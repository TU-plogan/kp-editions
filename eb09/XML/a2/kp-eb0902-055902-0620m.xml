                    man” (Johnson); “a collection of troops of all arms formed into brigades and
                    divisions, placed under the orders of one commander, with a general and special
                    staff and administrative departments; provided with all necessary war materiel,
                    and destined to act offensively and defensively against the enemy” (Block, <hi

                    comprehensive; the second excludes the forces of all but highly-civilised
                    nations. The essential characteristics of an <hi rend="italic">army,</hi> by
                    which it is distinguished from other assemblages of armed men, are its <hi
                    rend="italic">national</hi> character—that is, its representing more or less the
                    will and the power of the nation or its rulers—and its <hi rend="italic"
                    >organisation.</hi> The degree of the latter must depend on the age and the
                    state of civilisation; the armies of former days we should now call mobs. The
                    art of war has kept pace with the arts of peace, and there is as much difference
                    between the “armies” of the present and of the past as between an elaborate
                    modern machine and an early stone implement. But armies of some kind have
                    existed since the earliest periods of man’s history. At no time has industrial
                    accumulation, with its results, progress and civilisation, been possible unless
                    accompanied by the will and power to defend it. No nation has made -its mark in
                    history that has not at some period of its existence been pre-eminently
                    distinguished for martial spirit and proficiency in arms; or been allowed to
                    throw its full energies into the pursuits of peace till it had proved what it
                    was able and willing to do and endure in war. In studying the progress of
                    military art we dwell in succession on the proudest days of all the great
                    nations of the earth, and learn that when this art was neglected the fall of the
                    nation was seldom far distant.</p>
                <p>The art of war divides itself into two distinct branches —the first relating to
                    the military institutions of nations, the manner in which armies are raised,
                    their composition, characteristics, organisation, and government; the second to
                    their employment in war. The first, commonly known as the administration or
                    organisation of armies, is that of which this article treats. A modern army is a
                    vast and complicated machine, so constructed that the whole aggregate force of
                    its numerous parts may be exerted in any direction and on any point required. It
                    is our province to describe this machine in a state of rest, explaining the
                    construction, purpose, and combination of its several parts, but leaving its
                    action to be treated of elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps">War).</hi></p>
                <p>In the earliest stage of civilisation the army is identical with the tribe or
                    nation. Every man is a warrior; even women and children accompany the
                    expeditions, prepare and carry food, and bear such share as they are fitted for.
                    In more settled communities the able-bodied men only take the field, while the
                    women, the children, and the aged remain at home to watch the herds and till the
                    fields. Production is still so small that no division of duties among the men is
                    necessary. The armies consist of the whole male population, collected under
                    their chiefs and hearts of families, or under warriors who have specially
                    distinguished themselves. Such were some of the earliest armies mentioned in
                    history, and such are still the armies of the savage nations with whom our
                    colonial empire brings us in contact,—well fitted for petty warfare between
                    neighbouring tribes or nations, when the assailants confine themselves to raids
                    for plunder and captives, but not for distant expeditions or prolonged
                    operations. As population and industry increase, a division of labour becomes
                    both possible and necessary. A select portion of the inhabitants are specially
                    devoted to military service, either permanently 01 for a time, while the
                    remainder give undivided attention to pacific pursuits. Standing armies and
                    permanent organisation are thus introduced, and lead to improvements in
                    administration and progress in the art of war, till finally we attain to the
                    perfection of modern organisation.</p>
                <p>History points to Egypt as the first country in which a regular military
                    organisation was established, and the warrior class, as such, distinguished from
                    the rest of the population. By its earliest laws the revenues of the state were
                    divided into three equal parts, of which one went to the priests, one to the
                    king, and one to the warriors. Sesostris seems to have been the great military
                    organiser of Egypt. Trained by his father from childhood to war, he early
                    distinguished himself in military expeditions against the Arabians and against
                    Lybia, and mounted the throne with visions of universal conquest. To pave the
                    way for such schemes, he gave Egypt a military organisation, dividing it into
                    thirty-six provinces, and establishing a militia or warrior class, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Kalasires</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Harmatopoii,</hi> to each of
                    whom was allotted land sufficient for the maintenance of himself and his family.
                    These formed the nucleus of the vast army, amounting, according to Diodorus
                    Siculus, to 600,000 infantry, 24,000 cavalry, and 27,000 war chariots, with
                    which he undertook the conquest of the world. We read that the command of this
                    army was given to the companions of the king, who, like himself, had been
                    trained to arms under his father, and that a strict discipline was maintained
                    and a military code established which forbade corporal punishment, appealing to
                    the higher instincts of the soldier; but of the details of organisation and
                    administration by which so vast an army was moved and fed we can learn little.
                    With this army, aided by a powerful fleet, Sesostris first subdued Ethiopia, and
                    then extended his conquests eastward as far as the Ganges; thence turning
                    northwards and westwards, he swept over the Punjab, the table-land of Tartary,
                    and the north shores of the Caspian, and descended through Sarmatia and Dacia
                    into Thrace. Finally, he overran Asia Minor, and having conquered the Assyrian
                    empire and seated himself, on the throne of Ninus and Semiramis, returned in
                    triumph to Egypt after a nine years’ absence, and devoted the rest of his life
                    to the peace and prosperity of his kingdom. Such are the accounts handed down by
                    the ancient historians; and if any faith is to be attached to tnem, it seems
                    clear that he did actually raise and maintain large armies, and with them carry
                    out prolonged and distant expeditions, extending over several years, without
                    interrupting the industry and progress of his own country— facts which in
                    themselves prove a high degree of national and military organisation.</p>
                <p>The martial spirit of Egypt, however, seems to have expired with its first and
                    greatest conqueror, and as a nation it has distinguished itself in the arts of
                    peace rather than those of war: the country became the prey of conquerors and
                    the battle-field of other nations, and the palm of military supremacy passed
                    successively into the hands of the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Medes, and
                    the Persians. The first two nations present no special features in their
                    military systems; their armies, like those of Egypt, consisted mainly of
                    infantry, horsemen and chariots forming but a small though highly-prized
                    element. But the Persian empire introduces us to a more highly developed
                    military organisation, and a Bystem of standing armio closely resembling those
                    of modern times. Drawn from a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0621-0560"/> hardy and nomadic race, its armies at first
                    consisted mainly of cavalry, and owed much of their success to the consequent
                    ease and rapidity of their movements. Constantly extending their power by fresh
                    conquests, the warlike Persians established themselves as garrisons in the
                    subjected provinces, gladly exchanging their own barren mountain lands for these
                    rich and fertile countries, and for some time remained a distinctly conquering
                    and military race. Their empire attained its highest power under Cyrus and
                    Cambyses; the former, the founder of the great Persian empire, uniting on his
                    head the crowns of Babylon, Media, and Persia, while the latter still further
                    extended the empire by the conquest of Egypt. Cyrus seems to have been the
                    founder of that complete military organisation of which we gather details from
                    Xenophon and other writers. To each province of the empire was allotted a
                    certain number of soldiers as garrison or standing army. These troops, formed
                    originally of native Persians only, were called the king’s troops. They
                    comprised two classes: the one devoted exclusively to garrisoning the fortified
                    towns and castles, the other distributed throughout the country. To each
                    province was appointed a military commander, responsible for the number and
                    efficiency of the troops in his district; while the satrap, a civil governor,
                    was answerable for their subsistence and pay. Annual musters of these troops
                    were held either by the king in person or by generals deputed for the purpose,
                    and invested with full powers. This organisation seems to have fully answered
                    its original purpose, that of holding a vast empire acquired by conquest, and
                    promptly repelling inroads or putting down insurrections. But when a great
                    foreign war was contemplated, the standing army was augmented by a levy
                    throughout the empire, and each province and tributary nation furnished its
                    quota of men, horses, and provisions. The extent of the empire made such a levy
                    a matter of time. Thus the preparations for the invasion of Greece by Xerxes
                    took three w hole years; and the heterogeneous and unorganised mass of men of
                    all nations so brought together was a source of weakness rather than strength.
                    That the warlike Persians, whose reputation rose so high under Cyrus, who were
                    distinguished for their powers of endurance, and a daring courage which despised
                    stratagem and delighted in single combats, should within a century have failed
                    so disgracefully against the Greeks, has often been matter of wonder. Something,
                    doubtless, was due to the fact that their reputation was won over effeminate
                    races,* very different from their later antagonists; something also to the
                    degeneracy induced among themselves by years of success and luxury. But it must
                    also be borne in mind that the vast hosts over which the Greeks gained such easy
                    victories comprised but a very small proportion of the true Persians—of the race
                    which had given Cyrus his conquests. The cavalry alone seems to have retained
                    its national character, and with it something of its high reputation, even to
                    the days of Alexander. Nevertheless, the first contact between the Asiatic and
                    the Greek proved that the crown of military glory had passed to the western
                    nation.</p>
                <p>The earliest knowledge we have of the military institutions of the Greeks is
                    derived from the pages of Homer. They are glimpses only that we obtain, but they
                    suffice to distinguish many of their characteristics. Their compact formations
                    and subordination and silence in the ranks are contrasted with the looser
                    formation and noisy attacks of the Trojans. Their armies consisted almost
                    entirely of infantry. The leaders fought either on foot, like the rest, or from
                    chariots; and single combats between the chiefs on the two sides were common,
                    and often served to open the battle. We have sketched for us the traits of a
                    hardy, independent, enterprising race, sometimes cruel and quarrelsome, but
                    gallant, high-spirited, and intelligent, and well fitted to become distinguished
                    as soldiers. How these qualities were developed, till the Greek armies and Greek
                    tactics acquired a renown which has lasted to our day, we learn from the laws of
                    Lycurgus and Solon, and from the ample details handed down by Xenophon,
                    Thucydides, and other historians.</p>
                <p>By the laws of Athens every free man was liable to military service. It was not
                    only his duty but his distinction and privilege. The slave worked, the freeman
                    devoted his time to military exercises and to the gymnasium. At eighteen his
                    name was enrolled on the list of fighting men; for two years his duties were
                    confined to home service, and especially to the guarding of Athens; from his
                    twentieth to his fortieth year he was liable to service wherever the good of the
                    state might require. The collectors of taxes, the singers at some theatres, and
                    a few others, were alone exempted. The only privilege granted to the wealthy was
                    that of serving in the cavalry. The infantry, of which the army was mainly
                    composed, consisted of three classes. First were the heavy troops, “hoplitai,”
                    armed with a spear, a dagger, a corslet, and a large oval shield. These formed
                    the phalanx or main line of battle, and were composed entirely of free citizens,
                    natives of Attica. Secondly, the light troops, “psiloi,” armed with javelins,
                    but carrying little defensive armour, and no shields. These were destined for
                    skirmishing and covering the movements of the phalanx, and were mostly slaves,
                    who followed their masters, serving among the “hoplitai,” to war. Thirdly, there
                    were “gumnetai,” or irregular light troops, carrying no defensive armour, but
                    provided with javelins, bows and arrows, and slings, to harass the enemy; these
                    usually consisted of slaves or foreign troops. Besides these there was another
                    class, “peltastai,” so called from the light shield or target <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pelta)</hi> which they carried, and intermediate between thp “hoplitai” and
                    “psiloi.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The cavalry consisted entirely of the
                    wealthier Athenians, and was intelligent and enterprising. Each of the tribes of
                    Athens had its own military commander, chosen from itself, and elected for the
                    year only; and an Athenian army thus obeyed ten chiefs (“strategoi ”) of equal
                    rank. These commanded by turns for the day, while the ten together formed a
                    council of war to consult and decide in cases of emergency. Practically the
                    inconvenience of such a system was obviated by leaving nine of the ten behind,
                    or by the appointment of a “polemarch,” a sort of permanent chief of the staff,
                    who carried great weight in the councils.</p>
                <p>The Spartans owed much of their specially soldierly qualities to the institutes
                    of Lycurgus, which had for their aim to form a nation of warriors, and develop
                    to the utmost those physical and moral qualities which render men invincible.
                    Discipline, unquestioning obedience, uncomplaining endurance, and contempt of
                    danger, were the principles inculcated on the young Spartan from his earliest
                    years, while his body was strengthened by every exercise and trained to every
                    fatigue. As with the Athenians, military service was the first duty of every
                    citizen of Sparta. The age of enrolment was twenty instead of eighteen; but the
                    service lasted till sixty, and was more severe. In peace as in war, the Spartan
                    lived as if in presence of the enemy. War time was, indeed, his relaxation, for
                    he was then accompanied by slaves, carriages, and beasts of burden, and relieved
                    of every labour or fatigue, to keep him fresh for battle. Cavalry was held in

                    commanded by the kings of Sparta; when one only was formed, one king remained at
                    home. The king was accompanied by a bodyguard, comprising the winners of the
                    prizes at the athletic games, and had attached to him two polemarchs, or chief
                    staff officers, and three administrative officers, who relieved him of all care
                    of details, leaving him free to devote his mind to the great task of his
                    command.</p>
                <p>The phalanx, formed of the <hi rend="italic">Jωplitai,</hi> or heavy-armed
                    infantry, drawn up eight deep, was the basis of all Greek tactics.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For details of the various
                    formations, see article <hi rend="smallcaps">Intδntrt.</hi></p></note> The
                    Spartan and Athenian phalanx differed slightly in interior organisation and
                    subdivision, but the general principles were the same. For marching and
                    manoeuvring the ranks stood at open order, that is, 6 feet apart; for attack at
                    close order, or 3 feet apart; and for defence at locked order, or 1∣ feet apart.
                    The number of men in each phalanx, and the number of phalanxes into which the
                    battle-array was divided, varied according to circumstances; but from 2000 to
                    4000 seems to have been the usual strength of a phalanx. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >peltastai</hi> and light troops and the cavalry formed round or in rear of the
                    phalanx; the light troops remaining in front and harassing the enemy till the
                    actual moment of collision, and then falling back to the flanks or rear. In
                    counting the forces engaged in a battle, it was usual to reckon only the <hi
                    rend="italic">hoplitai,</hi> who answered to the knights and men-at-arms of the
                    Middle Ages; but the <hi rend="italic">peltastai</hi> and light troops generally
                    equalled, and often considerably exceeded, the former in numbers. The Athenian
                    phalanx was less compact than that of Sparta, but more formidable in its attack,
                    the offensive being best suited to the national character of the former, while
                    the passive courage and endurance of the latter shone especially in the
                    defensive. At Marathon and in subsequent battles the Athenians advanced to the
                    attack at a run, while the advance of the Spartans was always deliberate and
                    slow. The Thebans, under the direction of Epaminondas, modified the phalanx,
                    forming it on a narrower front, with greater depth, and the soldiers standing so
                    close in the ranks that they could not turn. This gave more weight at the point
                    of impact, and the Theban column of attack, fifty deep" crushed the Lacedemonian
                    phalanx, only eight deep, when opposed to it at Leuctra and Mantinaea. Xenophon
                    compares the effect to that of a heavy vessel striking a light one amidships
                    with her bow, and dashing her to pieces by the collision. The Macedonian phalanx
                    was a combination and adaptation of the various earlier Greek forms.</p>
                <p>The Greek armies were essentially militia. A few guards and garrisons were
                    maintained, but no standing armies like those of Persia; and the troops by whom
                    such perfection in tactics was attained, and such brilliant victories were won,
                    were only called under arms when occasion required, and returned to their civil
                    life when the danger was over. By constant wars, however, this militia had
                    acquired all the character of a regular army; and the Spartan forces especially
                    differed only in not receiving pay for their services. Beyond their own country
                    the warlike reputation and soldierly qualities of the Greeks made them highly
                    prized as mercenaries, and large numbers adopted that profession. Thus we hear
                    of Greek troops in the pay of the Egyptian kings in the time of Cambyses, and
                    later the garrisons of the Persian towns in Asia Minor were mainly furnished by
                    them; while Xenophon and the ten thousand Greeks who engaged under Cyrus the
                    Younger did more to spread the fame of the arms of Greece than even the great
                    victories of Marathon and Plataea, and, by exposing the weakness of the Persian
                    empire, paved the way for the future conquests of Alexander.</p>
                <p>Macedon, inhabited by rude but hardy shepherds and hunters, and far behind its
                    southern neighbours in civilisation, had made no mark in history till Philip
                    ascended its throne. But this monarch, who combined the highest military
                    qualities with a far-seeing shrewdness which was fettered by no strict
                    principles of honour, had no sooner established himself than he devoted all his
                    energies to raising the military power of his country and extending his
                    authority. The experience of his wars with the Athenians and other nations of
                    Greece taught him that he could only overcome them by a discipline and training
                    superior to their own, and he early saw that such was not to be given to a mere
                    militia force. He set himself, therefore, to form a standing army, to which he
                    gave an organisation, copied, but improved, from that of his adversaries. By
                    force of arms, by treachery, or by policy, he increased his power and influence
                    till it embraced all Greece; and he was about to make war on Persia at the head
                    of her united armies when his death put an end to his ambitious projects. But
                    his son Alexander had all his father’s military genius and ambition, and at the
                    same time inherited the instrument he required in the highly-trained army so
                    carefully prepared. Within a year he had chastised the Thracians in the north,
                    stamped out the Greek revolt by the storming and destruction of Thebes, and
                    received at Corinth from the representatives of the southern states the chief
                    command over their united forces; and in the following year crossed the
                    Hellespont at the head of an army of 35,000 men, and commenced that career of
                    conquest which was not to cease till he had carried his victorious arms over
                    India, and founded the largest empire the world had yet known. The army with
                    which these astonishing campaigns were won was composed of native-born
                    Macedonians, of their allies, and of mercenaries. The infantry was divided into
                    heavy and light armed, the <hi rend="italic">peltastai</hi> now forming a most
                    important part of the force, besides auxiliaries or irregular troops. None but
                    native Greeks were admitted into the phalanx or the cavalry. The cavalry, which
                    was more numerous than that of the Spartans or Athenians, was also divided into
                    heavy and light; the former carrying horse armour as well as body armour. The
                    actual force with which Alexander crossed the Granicus, the frontier line, was
                    30,000 infantry and 4500 cavalry, of whom about 12,000 were Macedonians, 5000
                    foreign mercenaries, and the remainder Greeks and allies. Special attention was
                    paid to recruiting, generals being left behind to attend to it, and numerous
                    reinforcements were sent to Alexander during his expeditions, so that at the
                    battle of Arbela his army amounted to at least GO,000 men. The tactical
                    organisation of his army was adopted from the Greeks. The Macedonian grand
                    phalanx, as finally formed by Alexander, numbered 16,384 heavy-armed infantry:
                    it was formed 16 deep, each file of 16 men forming a <hi rend="italic"
                    >lochos</hi> under a <hi rend="italic">lochagos,</hi> who led the file, and thus
                    became the front rank man. These files were variously grouped. Thus two files
                    formed a <hi rend="italic">dilochie,</hi> four a <hi rend="italic"
                    >tetrarchie,</hi> two tetrarchies a <hi rend="italic">taxiarchie,</hi> under a
                    <hi rend="italic">taxiarch</hi> or <hi rend="italic">centurion,</hi> Ac.; and 32
                    taxiarchies, or 256 files, formed a <hi rend="italic">simple phalanx</hi> of
                    4096 men. Four of these, with a due proportion of peltastai, light troops, and
                    cavalry, formed the <hi rend="italic">grand phalanx.</hi> The depth of 16 was
                    chosen as giving greater solidity than the Spartan phalanx, while admitting of
                    more subdivision. To form a solid column the phalanx was doubled, giving a depth
                    of 32; to extend its front, its depth could be reduced to one-half, still·
                    offering a firm line. The principal weapon was the <hi rend="italic">samssa</hi>
                    or pike, 24 feet long, of which 18 feet extended beyond the grasp. Thus the pike
                    heads of six ranks <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n623/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0623-0562"/> projected beyond the front, and formed that
                    bristling mass of spears which gave the phalanx its formidable appearance. The
                    proportion of peltastai, cavalry, and irregular troops attached to the grand
                    phalanx varied slightly, but as a rule the total about equalled that of the
                    phalanx. Of these, the peltastai would form one-half, the cavalry and irregular
                    troops about a quarter each. Thus the total strength of a grand phalanx and its
                    auxiliaries amounted to about 32,000 men, and Alexander’s army at Arbela was
                    formed of two such. The Macedonian phalanx was the crowning point of Greek
                    military organisation, and therefore has been described at some length; but a
                    still greater military power was already rising in the West, before whose
                    legions the phalanx itself collapsed, and to this it is now time to turn.</p>
                <p>The early or legendary period of Roman history is enveloped in a darkness which
                    hides the rise and first development of those institutions which ultimately gave
                    to Rome the empire of the world. Her earliest military organisation is
                    attributed to Romulus, who grouped the great families or clans (“gentes ”) in
                    three tribes; each required to furnish 1000 foot soldiers and 100 cavalry, and
                    in the force so raised is traced the. origin of the Roman legion. But itis to
                    Servius Tullius that the legend assigns the great classification, lasting to the
                    time of the Caesars, according to which the burdens and duties of military
                    service were determined. The whole population was numbered and divided,
                    according to wealth, into six classes; the class determining the amount of
                    war-tribute to be paid by the citizen, his position in the army, and the armour
                    he had to provide. The legionary infantry, <hi rend="italic">Triarii, Principes,
                    Hastati</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    “Hastati,” so called from the “hasta,” or spear, were comparatively lightly
                    armed, and usually formed the first rank of the line of battle; the “Principes,”
                    heavily armed, formed the second rank; and the “Triarii,” armed with shields,
                    body armour, and short heavy spear (“pilum”), formed a third rank or
                    reserve.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> were usually drawn from the
                    first four classes; the light troops, “<hi rend="italic">Velites,”</hi> from the
                    fifth; while the sixth and poorest class was exempted from all military service
                    and from the tribute. For voting purposes and for enrolment these classes were
                    subdivided into centuries; and a certain number of special centuries of
                    “equites” were formed from the patricians and most' wealthy citizens, who were
                    required to provide horses as well as armour, and formed the cavalry of the
                    legion. Every five years a fresh census was held, and the classification
                    according to property revised. Liability to service commenced at the age of
                    seventeen, and lasted until forty-six; and no Roman citizen could aspire to any
                    office until he had served ten years in the infantry or five in the cavalry. The
                    manner of raising the annual levy of troops is minutely described by Polybius.
                    Immediately after the election of the consuls, twenty-four military tribunes
                    were chosen from among the citizens of longest and most distinguished service.
                    The consuls having published the day on which all persons liable to service were
                    to assemble at the capital, the military tribunes were apportioned to the
                    several legions. The magistrates then proceeded to choose from the different
                    tribes, in order determined by lot, those most fit for military service, and
                    sent them, in groups corresponding to the number of legions, before the military
                    tribunes, who selected in turn for their several legions till the required
                    numbers were raised. The conscripts then took the military oath, <hi
                    rend="italic">sacramentum,</hi> and were dismissed until the appointed
                    muster-day, when the legion was formed and organised. The youngest and poorest
                    were made <hi rend="italic">Velites,</hi> the next in age <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hastati,</hi> the most powerful were selected for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principes,</hi> and the oldest or richest reserved for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Triarii.</hi> The legion was commonly composed of 600 Triarii, 1200 Principes,
                    1200 Hastati, and 1200 Velites, with 300 cavalry,—making a total strength of
                    4500; the number of Vehtes, however, often varied considerably. When the
                    classification was completed, the three classes of Triarii, Principes, and
                    Hastati were divided into ten <hi rend="italic">manipuli</hi> or companies
                    each,’ and the cavalry into ten <hi rend="italic">turmoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >or</hi> troops; while the Velites were distributed among the thirty manipuli. A
                    first and second centurion was then chosen and appointed to each manipulus; and
                    these again chose each two “ensigns” from their manipuli. The centurions ranked
                    among themselves according to the class to which they belonged; thus a centurion
                    of Triarii ranked above one of Principes or Hastati, and the first centurion of
                    each class commanded the whole of his class or one of the lines of battle of the
                    legion. Originally Roman citizens only, belonging to the five upper classes,
                    were admitted in the army, and the soldier equipped himself at his own cost, and
                    received no pay. Afterwards, the socii or allies of Rome were included in her
                    armies, and in the. time of Polybius a consular army consisted usually of two
                    legions, or 9000 Roman soldiers and about the same number of allies or socii.
                    But under the pressure of the great Punic wars the consular armies were often
                    doubled: at Cannae two double consular armies, or nearly 80,000 men, were
                    brought together; and at one period of the second Punic war as many as 23
                    legions were raised. The system of payment, too, dating from the prolonged siege
                    of Veii, removed the reasons, for exempting the poor from military service, and
                    they were included in the levies, though usually detailed to the navy as an
                    inferior service. Finally, when civil wars had shaken the old institutions, and
                    everything was sacrificed to faction and party spirit, even slaves and criminals
                    were enrolled, and the whole character of the army was changed. Other causes
                    also tended to the same result. The system of raising the consular armies
                    annually, and disbanding them at the conclusion of each campaign, required to be
                    modified when distant wars were undertaken: legions were kept permanently under
                    arms, and recruited annually by levies sent from Rome; ambitious generals found
                    excuses for not disbanding the armies to which they owed their power, and by
                    degrees a standing army was established; and these changes in the character of
                    the army were accompanied by corresponding changes in its organisation and
                    tactics. The distinction between the three ranks became gradually effaced, and
                    the three corresponding manipuli were merged in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cohort.</hi> The legion was no longer divided into three lines and thirty
                    manipuli, but into ten cohorts, and its force was raised from 4000 to 6000 men.
                    The manner of fighting, too, was gradually changed, and the Roman soldier
                    learned to trust less to his sword and heavy <hi rend="italic">pilum,</hi> only
                    useful at close quarters, and more to javelins and warlike instruments.</p>
                <p>The turning-point in Roman military art is commonly fixed about the time of
                    Marius, to whom the change in the organisation, as well as in the composition,
                    of the Roman armies is attributed. But the evil effects did not make themselves
                    felt immediately, and the legions, whose actions under Caesar shed the brightest
                    lustre on the Roman arms, were organised on the new system. So long as
                    discipline and the old military spirit remained, the Roman armies retained their
                    superiority, whatever their tactics. This spirit was too deeply implanted to die
                    out soon; and whenever men arose worthy to command them, the Roman soldiery
                    regained its reputation. But under a succession of weak and profligate emperors
                    all discipline was lost: the legions, degenerated into a feeble militia, sold
                    the empire which they were incapable of defending, and ultimately fell.an easy

                    discipline; care in the selection, training, and exercise of the soldiers; and
                    readiness in adopting improvements, whether from friends or foes. In the first
                    the Romans surpassed all other nations. The second especially attracted the
                    attention of contemporary students of their military institutions; Hirtius,
                    Vegetius, Josephus, all speak of the constant exercises by which, in peace as in
                    war, the Roman soldier was trained and inured to war. “If,” says Josephus, “we
                    consider what a study the Romans made of military art, we must confess that the
                    empire to which they have attained is not a gift of fortune, but a reward of
                    virtue. They did not wait for war to handle their arms; nor, slumbering in the
                    bosom of peace, move themselves only when awakened by necessity: as if their
                    weapons were born with them, as if they formed part of their members, they
                    allowed no truce to exercises; and these military games are real apprenticeship
                    to combat. Each soldier tests his strength and courage every day; thus battles
                    are neither new nor difficult to them; accustomed to keep their places, disorder
                    never arises, fear never troubles their minds, fatigue never exhausts their
                    bodies. They are certain to conquer, because they are certain to find enemies
                    unequal to them; and one may say, without fear of mistake, that their exercises
                    are battles without bloodshed, and their battles bloody exercises.” Josephus
                    said truly, they would never meet their equals. When they fell, it was not
                    because their adversaries were superior, but because they themselves were no
                    longer what they had been.</p>
                <p>Hitherto war had been a progressive art. Each great military power succumbed in
                    its turn to an organisation and a science superior to its own. But with the fall
                    of Rome we seem to begin afresh. The nations by whom the overthrow of this great
                    empire was effected were in the condition from which the Latins had emerged ten
                    centuries before; and more than ten centuries elapsed before the lost ground was
                    regained, and such highly-trained armies again appeared.</p>
                <p>The early institutions of the Frank and German races, the new masters of Europe,
                    were those of a free, proud, warlike people. The right to bear arms was the
                    privilege of the freeman, the mark of his status in the community. No man could
                    assume it till publicly pronounced worthy, and solemnly invested before the
                    assembly of the people. From that time he was never separated from his arms. The
                    same word <hi rend="italic">(wehr)</hi> denoted a weapon and a freeman; -even
                    his plot of land <hi rend="italic">(were)</hi> was named after that by which
                    alone he held it, and his social existence ceased when no longer able to carry
                    arms and mount his horse. Similarly, nation and army were convertible terms; the
                    Longobards continued to call themselves an army <hi rend="italic">(Heer)</hi>
                    long after their settlement in Italy. Their organisation was rude and simple.
                    The family was the basis of the social fabric; kindred families formed clans,
                    and these again confederations <hi rend="italic">(Markgenossenschaft),</hi> to
                    which admission was only obtained by common consent. Finally, the kindred tribes
                    or communities occupying a certain district <hi rend="italic">(gau)</hi> formed
                    a higher organisation <hi rend="italic">(gaugemeinde),</hi> which usually
                    included the whole of a particular race or stock, and had well-defined natural
                    boundaries. For political and military purposes the gau or province was
                    subdivided into “circles” <hi rend="italic">(Kreis)</hi> and “hundreds,” names
                    which have continued to this day; the latter calculated to include as many
                    households as would suffice to place a hundred warriors in the field. Kings and
                    commanders were, elected and were entrusted with absolute power in war time, but
                    in peace every freeman claimed perfect liberty; all great questions w.ere
                    determined by the people in public assembly, and all conquests were the property
                    of the community, to be shared equally among them. It is hard to imagine a
                    greater contrast than that between the perfect freedom and equality of the early
                    German institutions, and the tyranny and unequal rights of the feudal system
                    which succeeded it. But we can trace the gradual.transition. From early days the
                    most adventurous youths attached themselves to the hero of the nation or tribe,
                    to be instructed by him in peace and led to victory in war. Thus each great
                    warrior collected round him a band of personal followers—retainers, whom he
                    equipped with horses and armour, and rewarded with a share of the booty, and who
                    in return followed him in . all expeditions, and obeyed no law but his word.
                    When conquests were effected by such bands, the land was the property of the
                    chief, and was distributed by him as a reward to his followers. Gradually kings
                    and chieftains increased their retinues, extending protection to those who
                    obeyed them, and enriching them by grants of lands acquired by conquest or
                    seizure. These grants soon ceased to be free gifts, rewards for past service,
                    but were held to entail future service also; and the chiefs assumed the right to
                    revoke them. As the power of the nobles and the number of their retainers
                    increased, so did the number and power of the independent freemen decrease; a
                    prey to oppression and exactions of all sorts, they attached themselves in
                    self-defence to some neighbouring lord, surrendering their lands, and consenting
                    to hold them of him as vassals. Finally, the lords increased their pretensions,
                    assuming the titles of “suzerains” or “seigneurs,” claiming absolute authority
                    over the persons and property of their vassals, and requiring an oath of fealty
                    from them; and the feudal system, with all its grinding tyranny, was
                    established. Nations were broken up into small seignioralties, whose lords, at
                    constant war with each other, only united to resist any interference with their
                    privileges; and if occasionally a powerful ruler like Charlemagne succeeded for
                    a time in establishing a real government, it was only personal, and collapsed as
                    soon as the strong hand was removed. No great national undertakings, no great
                    progress in the arts of peace or war, were possible under such conditions; and
                    it was not till feudalism was nearly extinct that these arts emerged from the
                    darkness of the Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>The early Frank and German armies comprised the whole manhood of the nations,
                    rudely organised by “hundreds,” or by tribes and families. Some knowledge of
                    tactics had been gained from their adversaries the Romans, and from deserters
                    and escaped slaves in their ranks; but they usually adhered to thèir own
                    national formation, the wedge-shaped column of attack. The principal arm was
                    infantry, divided into “heavy” and “light;” the light infantry being originally
                    the <hi rend="italic">élite,</hi> and trained to act with the cavalry, but
                    afterwards degenerating into mere attendants of the latter. The transition from
                    the national to the feudal system is seen in the armies of Charles Martel. These
                    consisted in part of his personal followers, partly of mercenaries, and partly
                    of national levies. At Tours the latter still formed the great bulk of the
                    force, and fought, as of old, in heavy masses and with little tactical
                    organisation. Under Charlemagne armies became more feudal, the chiefs and their
                    retainers forming a larger proportion, the national levies a much smaller one;
                    and the frequent levies ordered in his reign did much to extinguish the class of
                    freemen, driving them to seek protection as vassals of the great nobles. The
                    true feudal armies were formed entirely of the knights, men-at-arms, and
                    vassals, who obeyed the summons of their suzerain, either at the call of the
                    king, or for his own private wars, and whose service lasted variously for twenty
                    or forty days or three months, at the end of which the army disbanded and
                    returned home.</p>
                <p>The change in the constitution of armies was accompanied by changes in their
                    armament. As the equality <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n625/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0625-0564"/> of the old freemen gave placé to the
                    classification of the people into lords, gentlemen, and -serfs, corresponding
                    distinctions in arms and equipment followed; the horseman became the
                    representative of the upper classes, the foot soldier of the serfs and peasants.
                    The feudal system could only be maintained by the superior fighting power of the
                    ruling class. All that money and art could do was therefore lavished on the
                    equipment of the lord and his immediate retainers, while the peasant remained
                    ill-armed and comparatively defenceless. The strength of armies was measured by
                    the number of men-at-arms. Efforts to arm and train the mass of the people
                    commonly originated with the kings, in their desire to form a more national
                    force than the semi-independent feudal levies, and received small encouragement
                    from the nobles. When they succeeded it was a sign of weakness in the feudal
                    chiefs, and of a more popular government. In no country were the lower orders so
                    warlike and used to arms as in England; and historians have shown how
                    essentially popular was the rule even of our most absolute monarchs.</p>
                <p>Two characteristics of feudalism were especially adverse to progress in military
                    art: the undue preponderance given to one arm, mlmerically weak; and the
                    impossibility of unity of action or combined organisation among so many
                    independent and rival authorities. Among the causes tending to bring about a
                    better military system must be reckoned the <hi rend="italic">Crusades,</hi>
                    those marvellous efforts of fanaticism that still excite a wonder and admiration
                    mixed with pity. It is true they left no mark at all proportionate to the
                    vastness of the efforts. The armies of the Crusaders, as they took the field,
                    were mere tumultuary masses, as destitute of order and discipline as their
                    leaders were ignorant of military science. But for the first time large bodies
                    were kept continuously under arms, and some sort of organisation necessarily
                    developed itself. The knights and leaders becoming conscious of their own
                    numerical weakness, bestowed more care on the arms and discipline of their men,
                    and learnt their value; and the first true infantry of the feudal times dates
                    from the Crusades. An event of very different character, but not less exercising
                    a most important influence, was the grant of the franchise to cities and towns,
                    resorted to by Louis VI. of France in 1135 to establish a counterpoise to the
                    power of the barons, and afterwards adopted in Germany and England. These
                    enfranchised cities raised their own levies <hi rend="italic">Cnihce des
                    communes),</hi> and thus furnished the king with a military force independent of
                    and antagonistic to the feudatories, and consisting mainly of an infantry
                    superior in quality to the feudal vassals. Another cause was the ever-increasing
                    employment of mercenaries, due partly to the growing wealth and luxury which
                    made personal service irksome, partly to the proved unfitness of feudal armies
                    for continuous operations. Lastly came the invention of gunpowder, which, though
                    it exercised no immediate effect on tactics, and had little to do with the
                    overthrow of feudalism, ultimately revolutionised the whole art of war.</p>
                <p>The fall of feudalism as a military system, though -gradual, as all such changes
                    are, may be said to have been accomplished in the middle of the 15th century.
                    Two events occurring about that time gave it its death-blow— the defeat of the
                    Burgundian chivalry by Swiss infantry in the three successive battles of
                    Granson, Morat, and Nancy; and the establishment of <hi rend="italic"
                    >“compagnies</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">ordonnance”</hi>
                    by Charles VII. of France. The first destroyed for ever the overwhelming
                    prestige attached to the mailed horsemen, and restored infantry to the place
                    which it had held in ancient armies, and has never lost since; from the second
                    dates the origin of <hi rend="italic">standing armies</hi> in Europe. Charles
                    VI. had already sought to substitute a permanent national force fqr-the foreign
                    mercenaries, who were as great a curse to their employers as to their enemies;
                    but the attempt was interrupted by his insanity, followed immediately by
                    internal discord and disastrous wars with England. It was not till sixty years
                    later that Charles VII., having firmly established his power by a series of
                    successes over the English, carried out his father’s idea; and (in 1445)
                    organised fifteen <hi rend="italic">“compagnies Tordonnances</hi> to be
                    maintained in peace as well as in war. Each company consisted of 100
                    men-at-arms, or “lancers,” with their attendants, viz., squire, groom or batman,
                    and three archers— the whole force amounting to 9000 men. Three years later, he
                    organised a corresponding force of infantry, 16,000 strong, named franc-archers.
                    The superiority of a standing army over an assemblage of feudal militia was
                    soon, proved, and other states imitated the example of France. A change took
                    place in the military system of Europe; the practice of calling out the feudal
                    contingent ceased, and permanently paid troops, regularly disciplined and
                    organised, were substituted for them. These troops were not always national. At
                    first they were largely composed of the old bands of wandering mercenaries; but
                    the proportion of foreigners decreased as the feudal spirit gave way to a more
                    national one.</p>
                <p>The development of the new system may be dated from the beginning of the 16th
                    century. Armies, no longer undisciplined feudal levies, were permanently
                    organised in. companies and in regiments. The use of fire-arms became general,
                    though it was long before the pike was entirely supplanted. The distinctive
                    duties and value of cavalry and infantry were recognised, and regular tactics
                    introduced for the different arms, the battalion (originally <hi rend="italic"
                    >battaglia</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> y</hi> battle array) becoming the
                    recognised tactical unit for infantry, as distinguished from the administrative
                    organisation by regiments and companies. “Articles of war” were issued to their
                    several armies by Ferdinand of Spain, Francis I. of France, and Charles V., and
                    a regular discipline thus established. From this time to the outbreak of the
                    great French Revolution but little change took place in the manner of raising
                    armies, though their tactical organisation varied according to the arms in use.
                    Armies were raised mainly by voluntary enlistment, compulsory levies being only
                    resorted to under pressure of war. Usually the king or his commander-in-chief
                    contracted with a nobleman, of repute as a warrior, or of large possessions, to
                    raise a regiment—the nobleman to receive a certain sum down and an annual
                    allowance for its maintenance, and to have the command of it. He in his turn
                    engaged “captains,” some of whom brought companies with them, others raised
                    companies under his authority, and others, again, merely commanded the men hσ
                    himself had raised. Royal officers, “commissaries,” were appointed to muster
                    these regiments periodically, and see that the colonels fulfilled their share of
                    the contract; and, on the other hand, to issue the pay and provide for the
                    subsistence of the forces. The regiments were sometimes raised for a fixed time,
                    and disbanded at the expiration of that time or at the close of the war, but as
                    standing armies became general, they were maintained. permanently, the command
                    being transferred as occasion required; and, as the terms of the contract were
                    always favourable to the colonel, the command of a regiment was a valuable piece
                    of court patronage. The earliest form of organisation, both in the cavalry and
                    infantry, was the company, originally representing the group of men who followed
                    a knight to battle and fought under his banner, and later the bands of
                    mercenaries who served under a “captain.” These companies were afterwards
                    grouped and organised in regiments, but for a long time each company continued
                    to carry its own banner, indicating its real origin. Both companies and
                    regiments varied in strength according <pb break="no"

                    the -wealth or personal influence of the leaders. In the days when men fought in
                    compact masses, and one man’s voice could thus control a large number, 500 and
                    even 600 men λvas not an uncommon strength for a company; and in some nations
                    the numbers never fell very low. In France, however, the policy initiated by
                    Richelieu, and afterwards adhered to by Mazarin and Louis XIV., of breaking the
                    power of the French nobility, and making them followers and dependants of the
                    king, reacted on the organisation of the army; for it was found desirable to
                    give employment to as many of the young noblemen as possible in the royal
                    armies, and therefore to multiply the companies and commands, and the French
                    companies sometimes fell as low as 30 men. As the undisciplined melée of feudal
                    battles gave way to regular and scientific tactics, the necessity of bodies of
                    constant and uniform strength was felt, and the battalion and squadron were
                    introduced as the <hi rend="italic">fighting</hi> formations of infantry and
                    cavalry respectively. Originally battalions were dense masses numbering several
                    thousand men, and composed of many regiments. As changes in arms led to the
                    adoption of more extended formations, it became necessary to subdivide into
                    smaller fractions, and battalions were gradually reduced in size till they
                    became mere fractions of a regiment. Finally, when the advantages of uniform and
                    permanent organisation were more fully understood, and large standing armies
                    enabled such improvements to be introduced, regiments also were made of uniform
                    strength, and the battalion became a fixed fraction, usually one-half or
                    one-third of a regiment, but still retained its distinctive character as a
                    tactical unit; while for administrative purposes, recruiting, clothing, payment,
                    &lt;fcc., the regiment was the unit. Similarly, the company remained the lesser
                    administrative unit,— that is, the captain was answerable for the pay⅞
                    equipment, and discipline of his company in camp and quarters; but on the
                    parade-ground or battle-field the battalion was divided into a number of equal
                    divisions not necessarily corresponding to the companies. In Frederick the
                    Great’s time a Prussian battalion consisted of five (afterwards four) companies,
                    but on parade was divided into eight “zugs” (divisions); and the Prussian
                    company column, now so famous, is merely a return to the old formations adopted
                    when the company acted independently.</p>
                <p>The tactical changes effected in European armies between the beginning of the
                    16th and end of the 18th centuries, consequent on alterations in arms, need only
                    be very briefly noticed here. In the earlier wars of the 16th century the
                    musketeers formed but a small proportion of the infantry, and the great bulk
                    consisted of pikemen, whose power lay in weight and mass: deep formations were
                    consequently the rule. The cavalry still fought principally with the lance. In
                    the latter part of the century, during the great war of independence of the
                    Netherlands, improvements in fire-arms led to the proportion of musketeers being
                    increased, and the front of battle proportionately extended to give effect to
                    their fire. Thus Maurice of Nassau usually formed his armies in battalions of
                    500 men, of 250 pikemen, and 250 musketeers each,—the pikemen ten deep in the
                    centre, the musketeers on the flanks. The cavalry also adopted fire-arms, and
                    were taught to tnιst more to fire than to the effect of the charge. During the
                    Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) the proportion of musketeers was still further
                    increased. The imperial armies under Tilly and Wallenstein still fought in heavy
                    masses, but Gustavus Adolphus reduced his formations to six ranks. The bayonet,
                    introduced about the middle of the 17th century, gradually superseded the pike,
                    and led to a further reduction of the ranks to four. During the prolonged wars
                    of Louis XIV.’s reign, and under the auspices of the great generals of that
                    age,—Turenne, Condé, Eugene, and Marlborough,— considerable improvements were
                    effected in the tactics and organisation of armies, and the permanent grouping
                    of battalions and regiments into brigades and divisions was first introduced.
                    Still further improvements were made during the Silesian and Seven Years’ Wars
                    (1740-63). Many changes ascribed to Frederick the Great are really due to
                    Leopold of Dessau, who, under the first Frederick, formed the army which the
                    second Frederick led to victory. He reduced the ranks of the infantry to three,
                    trained them to manoeuvre rapidly and with extraordinary precision, and was the
                    author of the drill-book which has remained the basis of all European systems of
                    drill. But the improvements in cavalry tactics were unquestionably due to
                    Frederick himself, who taught them the true secret of their strength, shock and
                    rapidity, and further· developed their power by the introduction of horse
                    artillery, able to move rapidly and accompany the cavalry anywhere.</p>
                <p>At the close of Frederick’s brilliant career every army in Europe had copied that
                    of Prussia more or less closely. Infantry was organised in regiments of two or
                    three battalions, each battalion 500 or 600 strong—this number being determined
                    by the length of line which it was considered one man could effectively control.
                    Cavalry was organised in regiments of four squadrons, each squadron from 100 to
                    150 strong. Artillery organisation was still in its infancy, a large part of the
                    guns being attached to regiments, and the heavy guns often horsed and driven by
                    contractors. But Gribeauval was laying the foundation in France of the battery
                    organisation afterwards adopted by all nations. The Prussian army, proud of its
                    brilliant series of successes, equally proud of its manoeuvring power and drill,
                    was looked up to by all Europe, and believed itself invincible, but in its pride
                    forgot how much was due to the hand which had guided it. The French army had
                    fallen very low in general estimation, and even the American war, and minor
                    successful expeditions towards the end of the century, did little to raise it.
                    The Austrian army was slow to adopt improvements, but had acquired a reputation
                    for tenacity. England, recently driven out of her American colonies, was hardly
                    acknowledged as a power on land.</p>
                <p>Such was the military condition of Europe when the J French Revolution broke like
                    a storm over the Continent, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> sweeping away old
                    landmarks and old systems, covering <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> the land for
                    years with a flood, which, when it receded, left the whole face of the country
                    changed. When, in 1792, the monarchs of Europe banded to crush the revolution,
                    the military force of France was at a very low ebb. The old Royalist army was
                    disorganised by revolutionary passions and frequent changes, and the constituent
                    assembly had rejected the proposed “compulsory service” as at variance with the
                    liberty of the citizen. But on the proclamation that “the country was in
                    danger,” volunteers flocked from all parts to join the armies, and a levy <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse</hi> was ordered to repel the
                    invaders. Officials vied in proving their zeal by the numbers of recruits they
                    forwarded to the frontiers, and patriotism and terrorism combined to fill the
                    ranks. Within three years nearly 1,200,000 men were thus poured into the army,
                    and sufficed to repel the invaders, and form the armies which, under Hoche,
                    Moreau, and finally under Bonaparte, brought France forth victorious in 1797.
                    But the long and bloody war had exhausted the supply, large as it <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> was, and some new system of recruiting became
                    necessary, for it was evident that voluntary enlistment would no longer suffice.
                    In 1798, therefore, Jourdan brought forward and passed the law establishing <hi
                    rend="italic">conscription,</hi> the basis of all French military legislation
                    since that date, and moro or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n627/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0627-0566"/> less of that of other countries also. Every
                    citizen was declared liable to service for five years, and the whole male
                    population, between the ages of twenty and twenty-five, was divided into classes
                    and enrolled by name, to be called out as occasion required. It was the terrible
                    power of the conscription that enabled Napoleon to carry on the gigantic wars
                    which characterised his reign, and after losing in the snows of Russia the
                    largest army ever pμt in the field, to reappear in a few months with another
                    almost as large. Other nations of necessity followed the example of France, and
                    the conscription became general. Prussia still further developed its power by
                    reducing the period of service in the ranks, and passing her soldiers as soon as
                    sufficiently trained into a reserve, thus gradually training the whole of her
                    population. The “short service and reserve” system, the greatest revolution ever
                    effected in this branch of military art, and characterised by a recent foreign
                    writer on political economy as “the greatest, and in its ulterior consequences
                    probably the most important, of the events of our century,” owed its origin to
                    the conditions imposed on Prussia by Napoleon at the treaty-of Tilsit.
                    Restricted to an army of 43,000 men, the Prussian statesmen evaded the spirit of
                    the clause by sending the trained soldiers to their homes, to be recalled when
                    needed, and replacing them with recruits. This system, by which every citizen
                    becomes also a trained soldier, and there is no limit to the size of the armies
                    save that of population, was at first only partially adopted by other countries.
                    The prejudice in favour of professional armies — soldiers whose business it was
                    to fight and do nothing else—was too strong, and doubts were felt whether these
                    semi-citizen armies would stand the rough trials of war. But after Sadowa, other
                    nations had no choice but to copy it or resign their military position. It is
                    true the lesson was not learnt at once by all, but 1870 and 1871 enforced what
                    1866 had already taught; and within the last few years every great Continental
                    power has reorganised its military institutions on the model of Prussia.</p>
                <p>If we glance back at the history of military institutions in Europe since the
                    fall of Rome, we find it divides its-self into four well-defined periods. In the
                    first or barbarous stage we hav6 .vast armies or hordes, formidable from their
                    numbers and the courage of the warlike freemen composing them, but almost
                    without tactics or organisation. In the second or feudal period we have armies
                    nearly as numerous, but whose strength lay entirely in a small body of
                    highly-equipped knights and men-at-arms,—the bulk of the army no longer freemen
                    fighting for their country, but slaves fighting at their lord’s command. Little
                    progress has been made in tactics and organisation, and the fighting power of
                    nations is exhausted in constant petty wars. In the third or “standing army”
                    period we have small armies of highly-trained professional soldiers forming a
                    class distinct from the rest of the population, tactics and organisation
                    becoming a science and making vast progress. Lastly, under the conscription we
                    have armies, once more national, embracing the whole male population, more
                    numerous than ever, but now trained and organised with all the science and skill
                    of professional soldiers. Some remarks on the general principles involved in
                    this branch of military art will serve as introduction to a more detailed
                    account of existing armies.</p>
                <p>The military institutions of a nation are governed by various considerations, the
                    principal of which are geographical position, policy, national character, and
                    wealth. A country like America, which is threatened by no powerful neighbours,
                    can devote its whole energies to peaceful pursuits, and reduce its army to a
                    mere police force. But a European state, surrounded by warlike and powerful
                    nations, may depend for its very existence on its army, and must consequently
                    keep pace with its neighbours, and develop its forces to the utmost that
                    industrial and economical considerations admit of. Political economista class
                    all military expenditure as non-productive. Perhaps it might more fairly be
                    called indirectly productive, as necessary to the maintenance and extension of
                    civilisation and the protection and development of trade. Further, the value of
                    property increases with increased security, and military expenditure within
                    certain limits thus tends to repay itself. Broadly, however, it may be treated
                    as a. tax for insurance, and as so much withdrawn from the productive power of
                    the nation. The object of all military institutions is to develop the highest
                    amount of fighting power,—that is, attain the greatest security with least
                    strain on the industry of the country,— the latter being measured not by the
                    cost of the army as shown by the budget, but by the amount of productive labour
                    withdrawn and disturbance produced. All questions, therefore, have to be
                    considered under two aspects, military and economical—that of efficiency and
                    that of cost.</p>
                <p>The first question that presents itself is the manner of raising armies. There
                    are two methods,—that of voluntary enlistment, and that of compulsory levies or
                    conscription: the former once the universal system, but now retained by England
                    alone; the latter adopted by all other European powers. By voluntary enlistment
                    the burden of military duty is distributed evenly throughout the community, the
                    soldier receiving fair wages for his service, while the citizen bears his share
                    in the form of taxes. Personal liberty is not interfered with, the industry of
                    the country generally is undisturbed, those members only are withdrawn who are
                    likely to contribute least to its wealth, and the army becomes a useful school
                    and refuge for the restless classes of the community. But the supply of recruits
                    is fluctuating and uncertain, they are drawn almost entirely from the lowest
                    class, every desired improvement is hampered by considerations of its effect on
                    recruiting, and the army tends to become a class rather than a national one.
                    Compulsory service gives unlimited command of men, introduces a higher class in
                    the ranks, and raises the tone of the army generally; while military efficiency
                    alone has to be considered in organisation. But it presses much more severely on
                    the country. Military service becomes a tax inflicted by lot, falling with
                    excessive weight on some, while others escape free. “Admit substitutes (or
                    exemption by payment), and the hardship falls exclusively on the poor; insist on
                    personal service, and the loss of time, which to the young man of fortune is
                    nothing, and which to the lowest class of labourer is unimportant, because the
                    pay while serving is as good as he would get elsewhere, becomes a very heavy tax
                    on the skilled industry of the artisan or the professional man, or’those who
                    have business habits to acquire.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Speech of Lord Derby, <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> 15th
                    December 1870.</p></note> Hence in all countries where personal service is
                    enforced, it is necessarily accompanied with provisions for softening its
                    hardships and reducing its inequality. The time of service is reduced to a
                    minimum, and a special short course is established for men of means and
                    education above the average. Exemptions are permitted on personal or family
                    grounds, and in Prussia these exemptions are carried so far that the ballot is
                    practically done away with; and in some countries money payments are required
                    from all who do not serve. The relative cost of the two systems depends upon the
                    size of the army. So long as the numbers required are small and can be obtained
                    at a fair <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n628/mode/1up"

                    cheaper of the two; but when the numbers are large, and excessive wages are
                    necessary to stimulate enlistment, compulsory service becomes economicaL Such an
                    army as England maintains is actually raised with less cost to the nation by the
                    former system; but armies such as those of the Continental powers are only
                    possible under the latter. So heavily, however, does the conscription press on
                    the life of a nation, that it may safely be asserted that no nation ever did or
                    will accept it, except of necessity.</p>
                <p>The next great question is that of the terms of service. No nation can afford to
                    keep constantly under arms the whole force which it may require to put forth in
                    war. In olden times fresh armies were raised on the outbreak of each war. The
                    great step in modern organisation was the maintenance of permanent <hi
                    rend="italic">cadres</hi> and the formation of trained reserves. Military forces
                    are now divided into “standing armies,” comprising those who are actually doing
                    duty as soldiers, and forming in peace time the cadres and the school of
                    instruction of the army; and “reserves,” under which name are included all who
                    pursue their industrial callings in peace, but are called to arms in war. Such
                    reserves, however, may be of very different value, from the Prussian
                    “reservist,” a trained soldier in the prime of life, to the. <hi rend="italic"
                    >garde mobile</hi> or volunteer who has only attended a few drills; and their
                    value is always closely connected with the system and terms of service. There
                    are practically three systems. The first, or <hi rend="italic">long service</hi>
                    system is now almost obsolete,—it partly lives in England alone. Under this the
                    soldier was engaged for life, or for a long term of years, remained with the
                    colours so long as fit for service, and was then discharged, usually with a
                    pension. It produced a highly-trained army, in which discipline, mutual
                    reliance, <hi rend="italic">esprit de corps,</hi> constancy under
                    discouragement, and all soldierly qualities, were carried to their highest
                    pitch. The soldier made the regiment, his home, and knew no law but the word of
                    his commander. But such an army was necessarily small, being maintained in peace
                    as well as in war, and could form no reserve, as all remained with the colours
                    till they were no longer fit for service. In war, therefore, it had to be
                    increased, and its casualties replaced by untrained recruits; and its quality
                    deteriorated when excellence was most required. Long service also tended to
                    produce a class army, isolated from the life of the nation, and always a
                    dangerous weapon in the hands of an unscrupulous ruler. Further, to condemn a
                    man drawn by lot to lifelong service was felt to be incompatible with the
                    maintenance of compulsory service; and when it was found by experience that
                    soldiers could in three years be sufficiently trained for all purposes of war,
                    and that by the application of short service armies could be trebled in numbers
                    in war without increasing the cost in peace, the old long service armies
                    disappeared from Europe.</p>
                <p>The converse of this is the second, or <hi rend="italic">militia</hi> system,
                    actually in force in Switzerland and Canada, and to a certain extent in America.
                    Under this no permanent army is maintained, but all, or a large proportion, of
                    the inhabitants are liable to service, and undergo a partial training. The cost
                    of such a force is very small, the industrial disturbance reduced to a minimum;
                    yet the forces that are put in the field are formidable, in numbers at least.
                    But its real economy is more than doubtful. History abounds with lessons that
                    such forces can never carry on sustained operations against trained armies. They
                    may show brilliant courage; but they want the mutual knowledge and reliance, the
                    constancy in defeat, and the instinctive discipline which can be acquired by
                    habit alone. The cost of putting them in the field is always disproportionately
                    great. Opposed to trained armies, they invite defeat; opposed to similar forces,
                    as in the great American war, decisive action on either side is impossible, and
                    the war drags on till its cost far exceeds that of years of standing armies and
                    peace preparations.</p>
                <p>The third and intermediate system is that of <hi rend="italic">short service and
                    reserves,</hi> now adopted by all nations. The European details Of its
                    application vary, but the general principles are the same in all,—to maintain
                    the cadres of a large army in peace, capable of expansion in war, and to keep
                    the recruit in the ranks only so long as is necessary to make him a trained
                    soldier, and then pass him into a reserve. It combines the numerical strength of
                    the militia system with the organisation, training, and discipline of a long
                    service army. Its practical application will be seen in describing the various
                    armies of Europe.</p>
                <p>The principles of <hi rend="italic">organisation</hi> are comparatively simple.
                    Organisation is of two kinds, tactical and administrative; the first having
                    reference to action on the battle-field, the second to general maintenance in
                    peace as well as in war. Originally the two were often distinct; thus companies
                    and regiments were originally administrative units, battalions tactical ones;
                    and the two had not necessarily any connection. But the most perfect
                    organisation is that which answers both purposes, and in this direction all
                    modern improvements have tended; and as the battle-field is the ultimate object
                    of all preparation, administrative considerations must give way to tactical ones
                    when they clash, and all organisation must conform to the tactical requirements
                    of the day. Great progress was made in this branch during the Revolutionary war.
                    The origin of regiments and battalions has already been described. The first
                    “mixed divisions,” ⅛.e., divisions comprising troops of all arms, were formed in
                    the Revolutionary armies of 1792,and in 1804 Napoleon organised “corps d’armée,”
                    each forming a complete army in itself, under the command of a marshal,—the
                    necessity for such organisation arising from the size of his armies, which had
                    grown beyond the immediate control of one man. This organisation was copied by
                    other armies, and attained its highest perfection when combined by the Prussians
                    with their territorial system—each corps d’armée being permanently located in
                    and recruited from a particular province. A modern army usually comprises
                    several such corps d’armée.</p>
                <p>A Prussian <hi rend="italic">army corps,</hi> which may be taken as the type of
                    modern organisation, consists of a staff, two infantry divisions, a cavalry
                    brigade, a regiment (seven batteries) of corps artillery, a regiment of
                    engineers, and a number of administrative services. An <hi rend="italic"
                    >infantry division</hi> consists of a staff, two infantry brigades, a rifle
                    battalion, four batteries of artillery, and a regiment of cavalry. An <hi

                    battalions); a <hi rend="italic">cavalry brigade</hi> of a staff, three
                    regiments (twelve squadrons), and a battery of horse artillery. The <hi
                    rend="italic">engineers</hi> comprise a pontoon train, a light field bridge
                    train, a column of entrenching tools, siege materials, and a field telegraph;
                    while nine reserve ammunition columns accompany the corps artillery. The
                    administrative departments include the <hi rend="italic">commissariat,</hi>
                    charged with the supply of the troops, and having at its disposal five provision
                    columns and a large amount of hired or requisitioned transport, and provided
                    with a field bakery;—the <hi rend="italic">medical department,</hi> consisting
                    of a staff; three ambulance detachments, each having a staff of medical

                    on the battle-field, a supply of medical stores, covers for wounded, and a
                    number of ambulance waggons, fitted for the conveyance of wounded; and the
                    medical staff attendants, tents, and all appliances for 12 field hospitals, each
                    calculated to receive 200 wounded;—the <hi rend="italic">pay department,</hi>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Note.—</hi> It is impossible to form anything but an
                    approximate comparison, owing to the different conditions of service and varying
                    organisation of the several armies. Under “depot troops” are included all forces
                    whose province it is to feed the active arms” Under “garrisons and reserves” are
                    included all forces organised for home defence, and not forming part of the
                    field armies; but in several cases a large proportion of these are available as
                    reinforcements to the active army if required Only those forces that have
                    received some training and have a permanent organisation are counted; thus the
                    English volunteers are included, but not the Geπnan landstuπn, or French
                    reserves of the territorial army. The British troops serving in India have been
                    included in the military forces of Great Britain, and the expenses borne on
                    their account by the Indian revenue in the military expenditure; but not the
                    native forces in India.</p>
                <p>HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE BRITISH ARMY.</p>
                <p>The history of the military institutions of England may be divided into three
                    principal periods, each marked by a system peculiar to itself: the Anglo-Saxon,
                    or militia period, preceding the Norman Conquest; the feudal period, extending
                    from that to the great Rebellion; and the period of standing armies, lasting
                    from the Restoration to the present day.</p>
                <p>Prior to the Norman Conquest the armed force of England was essentially a
                    national militia. Every freeman was bound to bear arms for the defence of the
                    country, or for the maintenance of peace. Military service was not a debt due to
                    the king or earl, the obligation of a dependent to his lord, but the service
                    owed by a free citizen to his country. To give some organisation and training to
                    this levy, the sheriffs had authority to call out the contingents of their
                    several shires for exercise. The thanes appeared on horseback, and the bulk of
                    the people, armed with swords, spears, and heavy shields, or with bows and
                    spears, formed the infantry; This force, termed the “Fyrd,” was available for
                    home service only, and could not be moved even from its county except in the
                    case of invasion or great emergency; and it was principally to repel the
                    invasions of Danes and others that its services were required. Yet even in those
                    days the necessity of some more permanent force was felt, and bodies of paid
                    troops were maintained by the king and some of the great earls at their own
                    cost. Thus Canute kept up a household force <hi rend="italic">(huscarle)</hi> of
                    6000 men, and paid troops also formed part of Harold’s army at the battle of
                    Hastings.</p>
                <p>Although William professed to reign by right of inheritance, not of conquest, and
                    to maintain the existing laws of the country, its military institutions
                    underwent a rapid and complete change under him. The great slaughter of the
                    Anglo-Saxon nobility at Hastings, and the frequent and unsuccessful revolts of
                    the survivors, and consequent forfeiture of their estates, enabled William to
                    make large grants to his followers; and with these he introduced the feudal
                    system of military tenure. Henceforth military service was a debt due by the
                    dependent or vassal to the lord of whom he held his land, not the free service
                    rendered by a citizen to his country. And William took advantage of his
                    exceptional position as a conqueror, and as the original granter of nearly half
                    the lands of England, to carry the feudal system to a perfection which it had
                    never attained on the Continent. Assuming that “the king is the universal lord
                    and original proprietor of all the lands of the kingdom,” he proceeded to divide
                    the country into more than 60,000 military allotments or fees, to be held under
                    tenure of “knight’s service.” By the conditions of knight’s service the tenant
                    of a fee was bound to attend his lord in w ar, with horse and arms, at his own
                    cost, for forty days in each year,—the tenant of half a fee doing like service
                    for twenty days. Where one man held many fees—and some of the great barons held
                    several hundreds — he became responsible to the king as tenant-in-chief for
                    military service in proportion to his grant, and required the same from his
                    tenants.</p>
                <p>This important change in the tenure of land and military system of the country
                    was not effected easily or at once. To the original Saxon proprietors, who still
                    held much of the land, the feudal· system was a strange and intolerable burden.
                    But the ever-growing preponderance of the Norman element, the dissensions among
                    the Saxons themselves, which William skilfully made use of, the constant wars
                    and revolts, and consequent necessity for improved military organisation,
                    gradually overcame their resistance, and shortly before the Conqueror’s death
                    the new system was finally accepted throughout the country. Thus the king could

                    confounded with the tenant of a knight-fee. Practically the latter were usually
                    the “men-at-arms,” only men of good family being admitted to the honour of
                    knighthood.</p></note> and men-at-arms for forty days free of cost; and these
                    feudal troops, unlike the Saxon levies, were bound to follow him anywhere. Such
                    at least was the theory; but in practice modifications were soon introduced.
                    Forty days might suffice to repel an invasion or crush a revolt, but not to
                    prosecute a foreign war; moreover, many of the tenants’ fees were subdivided,
                    and the holders only liable to twenty or ten days’ service. On the other hand,
                    many holders of fees could not render personal service, or preferred submitting
                    to a money penalty instead. Thus by mutual consent grew up a system'of fines or
                    “esçuage,” and with the money levied from those who failed to do service the
                    king was able to hire mercenaries, or pay such of the feudal troops as were
                    willing to prolong their service. From time to time proclamations and statutes
                    were issued reminding the holders of knights’ fees of their duties; but the
                    immediate object was generally to raise money rather than to enforce personal
                    service, which became more and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0630-0569"/> more rare. Thus gradually departed the spirit of
                    the feudal system, the principle that those who held the land should fight for
                    it; armies lost their national character, the power of the king was increased,
                    and the first steps laid towards the establishment of standing armies as
                    instruments in his hand. The feudal system had not, however, abrogated the old
                    Saxon levies; and while in the former we trace the source of our stipendiary
                    forces, from the latter arose two national institutions,—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >posse</hi><hi rend="italic">comitatus,</hi> liable to be called out by the
                    sheriff to maintain the king’s peace, and later the <hi rend="italic"
                    >militia</hi> force. The <hi rend="italic">posse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >comitatus,</hi> or power of the county, included all males capable of bearing
                    arms, peers and spiritual men alone excepted; and though its primary object was
                    to maintain peace and pursue felons under the command of the sheriff, it was
                    also bound to attend upon summons for the military defence of the country. This
                    levy was organised as an armed force by an Act of 27 Henry II. (1181 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and subsequently by the 13 Edward I. (1285 A.D.),
                    commonly known as the “Statute of Winchester,” which determined the numbers and
                    description of weapons to be kept by each man according to his property, and
                    also provided for their periodical inspection. This force was only liable to
                    home service, but even in early days seems to have been used, as now, as a
                    feeder to the army.</p>
                <p>The armies with which our kings carried on their foreign wars -consisted mainly
                    of paid troops. Many, in the days of the earlier kings especially, were foreign
                    mercenaries, and these were sometimes imported to England to the great
                    discontent of the country. But the Edwards found that there was better material
                    to be had in this country than abroad; and the army which Edward III. took to
                    France, and with which he won the battle of Crecy, was composed exclusively of
                    English, Welsh, and Irish. A muster-roll, still preserved, of the army with
                    which he besieged Calais is interesting as giving the numbers and rates of pay
                    of the different ranks. The prince received £1 a day, and the bishop of Durham,

                <p>These armies were raised partly from those bound to nerve by tenure, partly by
                    forced levies, which, though illegal and often strenuously resisted by
                    Parliament, were not unfrequent; but mainly by contracts entered into “with some
                    knight or gentleman expert in war, and of great revenue and livelihood in the
                    country, to serve the king in war with a number of men.” Copies of the
                    indentures executed when Henry V. raised his army for the invasion of France in
                    1415 are in existence. Under these the contracting party agreed to serve the
                    king abroad for one year, with a given number of men equipped according to
                    agreement, and at a stipulated rate of pay, the items of which are set forth,
                    and agree generally with those given above. A certain sum was usually paid in
                    advance, and in many cases the Crown jewels and plate were given in pledge for
                    the rest. The profession of arms seems to have been a profitable one, and there
                    was no difficulty in raising men where the commander had a good military
                    reputation; Edward III. is said to have declined the services of numbers of
                    foreign mercenaries, who wished to enrol under him in his wars against France.
                    The pay of the soldier was high as compared with that of the ordinary labourer,
                    and he had the prospect of a share of plunder in addition.</p>
                <p>The funds for the payment of these armies were provided pιrtly from the royal
                    revenues, partly from the fines paid in lieu of military service, and other
                    fines arbitrarily imposed, and partly by grants from Parliament. As the
                    soldier’s contract usually ended with the war, and the king had seldom funds to
                    renew it even if he so wished, the armics disbanded of themselves at the close
                    of each war. To secure the services of the soldier during his contract, Acts
                    were passed (18 Henry VI. c. 19; and 7 Henry VII. c. 1) inflicting penalties for
                    desertion; and in EdwarcfVL’s reign an Act “touching the true service of
                    captains and soldiers” was passed, somewhat of the nature of a Mutiny Act.</p>
                <p>The six centuries which elapsed between the Norman Conquest and the Rebellion may
                    be treated as one period in the history of the military institutions of England.
                    Though considerable changes had taken place, though the feudal armies in which
                    the great nobles rode at the head of their retainers, and whose main fighting
                    strength lay in the number of knights and men-at-arms, had given place to armies
                    raised by contract, commanded by officers having no personal connection with the
                    men, and in which the common infantry formed the real fighting strength, still
                    these changes had taken place gradually, and fundamentally the principles
                    remained the same. The army seldom came in collision with the nation. Latterly
                    indeed, in Queen Elizabeth’s time, the demands of the Irish wars had led to
                    frequent forced levies, and the occasional billeting of the troops in England
                    also gave rise to murmurs, but the brilliancy and energy of her reign covered a
                    great deal, and the peaceful policy of her successor removed all immediate cause
                    of complaint. But with the accession of Charles I. a new period commences, and
                    we find the army a constant and principal source of dispute between the king and
                    Parliament, until under William III. a standing army is finally established on
                    its present constitutional footing. Charles wished to support his
                    brother-in-law, the Elector Palatine, in his struggle for the crown of Germany,
                    and for that purpose raised an army of 10,000 men. He was already encumbered
                    with debts, and the Parliament refused all grants, on which he had recourse to
                    forced loans to supply the funds. The army was sent to Spain, but returned
                    without effecting anything, and was not disbanded, as usual, but billeted on the
                    inhabitants. The billeting was in itself illegal, and was the more deeply
                    resented as it appeared that the troops were purposely billeted on those who had
                    resisted the king’s loan. Finally, the disorders committed by these troops
                    caused the king to issue a commission to certain persons, officers and others,
                    to proceed against offenders “according to the justice of martial law,”—thus
                    establishing martial law in England in time of peace. These three breaches of
                    the law—forced loans, billeting, and martial law—all directly connected with the
                    maintenance of the army, formed the main substance of the grievances set forth
                    in the celebrated “Petition of Right.” In accepting this petition, Charles gave
                    up the right to maintain an army without consent of Parliament; and when in 1639
                    he wished to raise one to act against the rebellious Scotch, Parliament was
                    called together, and its sanction obtained, on the plea that the army was
                    necessary for the defence of England. This army again became the source of
                    dispute between the king and Parliament, and later some of the hottest contests
                    arose on the question of the command of the armed forces: finally both sides
                    appealed to arms, and the parliamentary army, after having overthrown the
                    monarchy, upset the Parliament also, and remained undisputed master. Under
                    Cromwell, the force which had raised him to power was naturally augmented and
                    encouraged. For the first timo a real standing army, amounting at one time to
                    80,000 men, was maintained. This army of the Commonwealth differed in character
                    from those which preceded or followed it, the men as a rule being taken from a
                    better class, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n631/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0631-0570"/> the officers from a lower one. The common levies
                    of the first parliamentary armies were no match for the gentlemen who gathered
                    round the royal standard, till Cromwell leavened them with a different stamp of
                    men, mainly drawn from the yeomen and middle class, — earnest resolute men,
                    whose stern fanaticism was able to turn the scale against the headstrong valour
                    of the Royalists. This class served largely in Cromwell’s army, and gave a tone
                    to the whole, while the pay was sufficiently high to make it a desirable
                    profession for others besides the poorest. But with the officers it was
                    otherwise. The noble and gentle families who commanded the king’s armies
                    remained faithful to his cause, and Cromwell had to draw his officers from a
                    class little above the men. Few will be found now to dispute Cromwell’s capacity
                    as a general and ruler, nor the high qualities of the army by which he
                    maintained his power at home, and spread England’s prestige abroad. But such an
                    army could not be maintained without great cost and hardship to the people at
                    large, and before Cromwell’s death it had produced deeper discontent than even
                    Charles’s exactions.</p>
                <p>On the Restoration this army was disbanded. The king feared and distrusted it,
                    for it was formed of his enemies, and officered by men who had approved his
                    father’s execution, and it had made itself hateful to the nation. The permanent
                    forces of the Crown were reduced to the “garrisons and guards” maintained by the
                    king from the revenue allotted to him for carrying on the government of the
                    country. The “garrisons” were commissioned to special fortresses,—the Tower of
                    London, Portsmouth, &amp;c. The “guards” comprised the sovereign’s body guards
                    (the “yeomen of the guard” and “gentlemen-at-arms,” who had existed since the
                    times of Henry VII. and VIII. ); Monk’s regiment of foot (now the Coldstream
                    Guards), alone retained of the disbanded army; and two regiments of life guards
                    and one of foot guards, raised principally from the cavaliers who had followed
                    the king’s fortunes. Even this small force, at first not exceeding 3000 men, was
                    looked on with jealousy by Parliament, and every attempt to increase it was
                    opposed. The acquisition of Tangiers and Bombay, as part of the dower of the
                    Infanta of Portugal, led to the formation of a troop of horse (now the 1st Royal
                    Dragoons) and a regiment of infantry (now the 2d or Queen’s regiment), for the
                    protection of the former; and a regiment of infantry (afterwards transferred to
                    the East India Company, and now the 103d, or Bombay Fusiliers), to hold the
                    latter. These troops, not being stationed in the kingdom, created no distrust;
                    but when in 1670, on occasion of the' Dutch war, 12,000 men were raised for the
                    protection of the coasts, Parliament immediately petitioned that they should be
                    disbanded as soon as peace was made. On several occasions during Charles’s reign
                    considerable armies were raised, but were mostly disbanded again when the
                    occasion ceased. Several regiments, however, were added to the permanent force,
                    including Dumbarton’s regiment (the 1st or Royal Scots)<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This regiment has the oldest history of any
                    in the world. Originally the “Scottish Guard” of the kings of France, it was
                    formed in the 9th century, and constantly recruited from Scotland. In 1625 it
                    was sent to England to attend the coronation of Charles I., and revisited it
                    later to fight against the parliamentary army. On the Restoration it came
                    permanently to England, and was named the 1st Royal Regiment.</p></note> and the
                    3d Buffs; and on Charles’s death in 1685 the total force of “guards and
                    garrisons” had risen to 16,500, of whom about one-half formed what we should now
                    call the standing army.</p>
                <p>James II. was more obstinate than his predecessor in his efforts to increase the
                    army, and Monmouth’s rebellion afforded him the pretext. A force of about 20,000
                    men was maintained in England, and a large camp formed at Hounslow. Eight
                    cavalry and twelve infantry regiments were raised, and given the numbers which,
                    with few exceptions, they still bear. James even proposed to Parliament to
                    disband the militia and further augment the standing army; and although the
                    proposal was instantly rejected by the Commons, he continued to add to the army,
                    and to billet, them on the country, in defiance of the remonstrances of
                    Parliament, till the Revolution deprived him of his throne and put an end to the
                    contest. The army which he had raised was to a great extent disbanded, the Irish
                    soldiers especially, whom he had introduced in large numbers on account of their
                    religion, being all sent home.</p>
                <p>The condition of the army immediately engaged the attention of Parliament. The
                    Bill of Rights had definitely established that “the raising or keeping of a
                    standing army within the kingdom, unless it be by the consent of Parliament, is
                    against the law,” and past experience made them very jealous of such a force.
                    But James was making efforts to recover his throne, and seeking aid from France;
                    Ireland and Scotland were disaffected, civil war was imminent, foreign war
                    certain; and William had only a few Dutch troops, and the remains of James’s
                    army, with which to meet the storm. Parliament therefore sanctioned a standing
                    army, trusting to the checks established on the power of the Crown by the Bill
                    of Rights and Act of Settlement, and by placing the pay of the army under the
                    control of the Commons. An event soon showed the altered position of the army. A
                    regiment which was favourably inclined to James, and had therefore been ordered
                    abroad, mutinied, and marched north, declaring for James. It was surrounded and
                    compelled to lay down its arms; but William found himself without legal power to
                    deal with the mutineers. He therefore applied to Parliament, and in 1689 was
                    passed the first <hi rend="italic">Mutiny Act,</hi> which, after repeating the
                    provisions regarding the army inserted in the Bill of Rights, and declaring the
                    illegality of martial law, gave power to the Crown to deal with the offences of
                    mutiny and desertion by courts-martial. From this epoch dates the history of the
                    standing army as a constitutional force.</p>
                <p>Under William the army was considerably augmented. The old regiments of James’s
                    army were reorganised, retaining, however, their original numbers, and three of
                    cavalry and eleven of infantry (numbered to the 28th) were added. In 1690
                    Parliament sanctioned a force of 62,000 men, further increased to 65,000 in
                    1691; but on peace being made in 1697 the Commons immediately passed resolutions
                    to the effect that the land forces be reduced to 7000 men in England and 12,000
                    in Ireland. The war that quickly succeeded obliged Great Britain again to raise
                    a large army, at one time exceeding 200,000 men; but of these the greater number
                    were foreign troops engaged for the Continental war. On the peace of Utrecht the
                    force was again reduced to 8000 men in Great Britain and 11,000 in the
                    plantations <hi rend="italic">(f.e.,</hi> colonies) and abroad. From that time
                    to the present the strength of the army has been determined by the annual votes
                    of Parliament, and though frequently the subject of warm debates in both houses,
                    it has ceased to be a matter of dispute between the Crown and Parliament. The
                    following table shows the fluctuations between that time and the present—the
                    peace years showing the average peace strength, the war years the maximum to

                <p>During William’s reign the small English army bore an honourable part in the wars
                    against Louis XIV., and especially distinguished itself by its intrepidity at
                    Steinkirk, at Neerwinden, and in the assault of Namur. Twenty English regiments
                    took part in the campaign of 1G94. In the great wars of Queen Anne’s reign the
                    British army under Marlborough acquired a European reputation. The cavalry,
                    which had called forth the admiration of Prince Eugene when passed in review
                    before him after its long march across Germany (1704), especially distinguished
                    itself in the battle of Blenheim; and Ramilies, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet were
                    added to the list of English victories. The army was permanently increased by
                    one regiment of cavalry and eleven of infantry; and though the regiments were
                    much reduced in strength during the following peace, the cadres remained
                    untouched. During the reign of the first and second Georges an artillery corps
                    was organised, and' the army further increased by five regiments of cavalry and
                    thirty-five of infantry. Fresh laurels were won at Dettingen (1743), in which
                    battle twenty English regiments took part; and though Fontenoy was a day of
                    disaster for the English arms, it did not lower their reputation, but rather
                    added to it. Six regiments of cavalry and six of infantry shared under Prince
                    Ferdinand the honours of the victory of Minden (1759), and the English infantry
                    was especially thanked by the prince for its conduct on that occasion. About
                    this time the first English regiments were sent to India, and the 39th shared in
                    Clive’s victory at Plassey. During the first half of George III.’s reign the
                    army was principally occupied in America; and though the conquest of Canada may
                    be counted with pride among its exploits, this page in its history is certainly
                    the darkest. English armies capitulated at Saratoga (1777) and at Yorktown
                    (1781), and the war ended in 1785 by the evacuation of the revolted states of
                    America and the acknowledgment of their independence. Before passing to the
                    great French Revolutionary wars, from which a fresh period in the history of the
                    army may be dated, it will be well to review the general condition of the army
                    in the century preceding.</p>
                <p>Regiments were raised almost as in the days of the Edwards. The Crown contracted
                    with a distinguished soldier, or gentleman of high position, who undertook to
                    raise the men, receiving a certain sum as bounty-money for each recruit. In some
                    cases, in lieu of money, the contractor received the nomination of all or some
                    of the officers, and recouped himself by selling the commissions. This
                    system—termed raising men for rank—was retained till’ very recently, and
                    originally helped to create the “purchase system” of promotion. For the
                    maintenance of the regiment the colonel received an annual sum sufficient to
                    cover the pay of the men, and the expenses of clothing and of recruiting. The
                    colonel was given a “beating order,” without which no enlistment was legal; and
                    was responsible for maintaining his regiment at full strength. “Muster masters”
                    were appointed to muster the regiments, and to see that the men for whom pay was
                    drawn were really effective. Sometimes, when casualties were numerous, the
                    allowance was insufficient to meet the cost of recruiting, and special grants
                    were made. In war time the ranks were also filled by released debtors, pardoned
                    criminals, and impressed paupers and vagrants. Where the men were raised by
                    voluntary enlistment, the period of service was a matter of contract between the
                    colonel and the soldier, and the engagement was usually for life; but
                    exceptional levies were enlisted for the duration of the war, or for periods of
                    three or five years. The army was officered entirely from the upper ranks, the
                    low rate of pay and the purchase system combining to exclude all. but men of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ndependent incomes. Appointments (except when in the
                    gift of the colonel) were made by the King at home, and by the
                    Commander-in-Chief abroad; even in Ireland the power of appointment rested with
                    the local commander of the forces until the Union. The soldier was clothed by
                    his colonel, the charge being defrayed from the “stock fund.” The army lived in
                    barracks, camps, or billets. Tho barrack accommodation in Great Britain at the
                    beginning of the century only sufficed for 5000 men; and though it had gradually
                    risen to 20,000 in 1792, a large part of the army was constantly in camps or
                    billets—the latter causing endless complaints and difficulties. The drill of the
                    army was mainly borrowed from that of Frederick, but the American war had
                    trained many regiments to skirmishing. The administration was generally corrupt
                    and defective, and the character of the army stood very low when England
                    embarked on her long war with France.</p>
                <p>Her first efforts in this war did not tend to raise it. After a campaign, fought
                    with great gallantry but not much skill, the English army under the Duke of York
                    was driven out of Holland, and that country annexed to France. But the
                    appointment of the Duke of York to the post of Commander-in-Chief of the army
                    was the commencement of a better era. He did much to improve its organisation,
                    discipline, and training, and was ably seconded by commanders of distinguished
                    ability. Under Abercromby in Egypt, under Stewart at Maida, and under "Wellesley
                    and Lake in India, the British armies again attached victory to their standards,
                    and made themselves feared and respected. The energy and unbending resolution of
                    Pitt seemed to communicate itself to the nation, and the threatened invasion of
                    England excited her martial spirit to the highest pitch. Finally, her military
                    glory was raised by the series of successful campaigns in the Peninsula, until
                    it culminated in the great victory of waterloo; and the army emerged from the
                    war with the most solidly founded reputation of any in Europe.<note

                <p>The events of this period belong to the history of England, and fall outside the
                    province of an article dealing only with the army. The great augmentations
                    required during the war. were effected partly by raising additional regiments,
                    but principally by increasing the number of battalions, some regiments being
                    given as many as four. On the conclusion of peace these battalions were redueed,
                    but the regiments were retained, and the army was permanently increased from
                    about 20,000, the usual peace establishment before the war, to an average of
                    80,000. The Duke of York, on first appointment to the command, had introduced a
                    uniform drill throughout the army, which was further modified according to
                    Dundas’s system in 1800; and, under the direction of Sir John Moore and others,
                    a high perfection of drill was attained. At the beginning of the war, the
                    infantry, like that of the Continental powers, was formed in three ranks; but a
                    two-rank formation had been introduced in America and in India, and gradually
                    became general, and in 1809 was finally approved.</p>
                <p>In the Peninsula the army was permanently organised B in divisions, usually
                    consisting of two brigades of three or <hi rend="superscript"> cl</hi> four
                    battalions each, and one or two batteries of artillery. The Duke of Wellington
                    had also brought the commissariat and the army transport to a high pitch of
                    perfection; but in the long peace which followed these establishments were
                    reduced or broken up. The period which elapsed between Waterloo and the Crimean
                    war is marked by a number of Indian and colonial wars, but by no organic changes
                    in the army, with perhaps the single exception of the Enlistment Act of 1847, by
                    which short service,— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> an original <pb break="no"

                    rc-engage to complete 21,—was substituted for the life enlistments hitherto in
                    force. The army went to sleep on the laurels and recollections of the Peninsula.
                    The Duke of Wellington, for many years Commander-in-Chief, was too anxious to
                    hide it away in the colonies, and to save it from further reductions or utter
                    extinction, to attempt any great administrative reforms. The force which was
                    sent to Turkey in 1854 was an agglomeration of battalions, individually perhaps
                    the finest the world had ever seen, but unused to work together, without trained
                    staff, administrative departments, or army organisation of any kind. They fought
                    with distinguished gallantry at the Alma and at Inkerman, but succumbed under
                    the hardships, the privations, and the sickness of the winter before
                    Sebastopol—a sacrifice to maladministration. The lesson was dearly bought, but
                    was not thrown away. From that time successive War Ministers and
                    Commanders-in-Chief have laboured perseveringly at the difficult task of army
                    organisation and administration. Foremost in the work was Lord Herbert, the
                    soldiers’ friend, who fell a sacrifice to his labours, but not before he had
                    done much for the army. The whole system of administration was revised. In 1854
                    it was inconceivably complicated and cumbersome. The “Secretary of State for War
                    and Colonies,” sitting at the Colonial Office, had a general but vague control,
                    practically limited to times of war. The “Secretary at War” was the
                    parliamentary representative of the army, and exercised a certain financial
                    control, not extending, however, to the ordnance corps. The Commander-in-Chief
                    was responsible to the sovereign alone in all matters connected with the
                    discipline, command, or patronage of the army, but to the Secretary at War in
                    financial matters. The Master-General and Board of Ordnance were responsible for
                    the supply of material on requisition, but were otherwise independent, and had
                    the artillery and engineers under them. The Commissariat Department had its
                    headquarters at the Treasury; and the militia until 1852 were under the Home
                    Secretary. A number of minor subdepartments, more or less independent, also
                    existed, causing endless confusion, correspondence, and frequent collision. In
                    1854 the business of the colonies was separated from that of war, and the then
                    Secretary of State, the Duke of Newcastle, assumed control overall the other
                    administrative officers. In the following year the Secretary of State was
                    appointed Secretary at War also, and the duties of the two offices amalgamated.
                    The same year the Commissariat Office was transferred to the War Department, and
                    the Board of Ordnance abolished, its functions being divided between the
                    Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary of State. The minor departments were
                    gradually absorbed, and the whole administration divided under <hi rend="italic"
                    >two</hi> great chiefs, sitting at the War Office and Horse Guards’
                    respectively. Finally, in 1870 these two were welded into one, and the War
                    Office as now existing was constituted.</p>
                <p>Corresponding improvements were effected in every branch. The system of clothing
                    the soldiers was altered, the contracts being taken from the colonels of
                    regiments, who received a money allowance instead, and the clothing supplied
                    from Government manufactories. The pay, food, and general condition of the
                    soldier were improved; reading and recreation rooms, libraries, gymnasiums, and
                    facilities for games of all kinds being provided. Special attention was directed
                    to sanitary matters; large barracks were built on improved principles; more
                    space allotted to the men; ventilation and drainage improved, and the rate of
                    mortality greatly reduced. A large permanent camp was formed at Aldershott,
                    where considerable forces were collected and manoeuvred together. Various
                    educational establishments were opened, a staff college established for the
                    instruction of officers wishing to qualify for the staff, and regimental schools
                    improved.</p>
                <p>The Indian mutiny of 1857, followed by the transference of the government of
                    India from the hands of the East India Company to those of the Queen’s
                    ministers, led to important changes. The East India Company’s white troops were
                    amalgamated with the Queen’s army, and reorganised—a difficult task, and one
                    which cannot yet be said to be completed.</p>
                <p>Among recent alterations may be mentioned the localisation of the army, commenced
                    in 1872, but which,cannot produce its full effects for many years to come; the
                    transference of certain powers over the militia from the lords-lieutenant to the
                    Crown, in 1871, and the placing the militia and volunteer forces directly under
                    the generals commanding districts; the abolition of purchase, in 1871; the
                    introduction of short service (6 years in the ranks) by the Army Enlistment Act
                    of 1870; the institution of annual autumnal manoeuvres, at which considerable
                    forces are collected and manoeuvred against one another over extensive tracts of
                    country; the formation of the Control Department, Ac.; but these will be dealt
                    with at length in the following pages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">British Army as it is.</hi></p>
                <p>The supreme command of all the military forces of the nation is vested in the
                    Crown, but can only be exercised through an intermediate and responsible agent.
                    The entire administration, therefore,’ of the regular army and reserve or
                    auxiliary forces is under the control and responsibility of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Secretary of State for lVar,</hi> who is assisted by two
                    under-secretaries, the <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Permanent</hi> Undersecretaries of State. The actual army
                    administration is divided among three great officers,—the Officer Commanding in
                    Chief, the Surveyor-General of Ordnance, and the Financial Secretary. These
                    officers are at the head respectively of the three great departments of the War
                    Office, viz., the Military Department, the Control Department, and the Financial
                    Department; their duties are defined by orders of Council of the 4th and 23d
                    June 1870. The <hi rend="italic">Officer Commanding in Chief</hi> is charged
                    with “the discipline and distribution of the army, and of the reserve forces of
                    the United Kingdom when embodied or called out for actual military service; the
                    military education and training of the officers, non-commissioned officers, and
                    men of the army, and of the reserve forces when assembled for training,
                    exercise, inspection, or voluntary military duty; enlisting men for and
                    discharging· men from the army and army reserves; the collection and record of
                    strategical information, including topography, in relation to the military
                    circumstances of this and other countries; the selection of fit and proper
                    persons to be recommended to Her Majesty for appointment to commissions in the
                    army, for promotion for staff and other military appointments, and for ιhilitary
                    honours and rewards.” The <hi rend="italic">Surveyor-General of the
                    Ordnance</hi> is charged with “providing, holding, and issuing to all branches
                    of the army and reserve forces, food, forage, fuel, light, clothing, arms,
                    accoutrements, munitions of war, and all other stores necessary for the
                    efficient performance of their duties by such forces, of proper quality and
                    pattern, and in proper quantities, according to the regulations governing the
                    provision, custody, and issue of such supplies; exercising a strict control over
                    the expenditure of such supplies, and seeing that they are properly accounted
                    for by the several officers and others who may be charged with their custody,
                    issue, and use; the custody of all buildings in which troops are quartered, and
                    allotting quarters; providing transport for troops, and directing land and

                    be duly and carefully examined.” The. <hi rend="italic">Financial Secretary</hi>
                    is charged with “preparing the annual estimate for the pay of the army and
                    reserve forces; collecting and incorporating into a general estimate for army
                    services the estimates of the other departments of the War Office, and
                    financially reviewing the expenditure proposed in such estimates; submitting for
                    the instructions of the Secretary of State for War any proposed redistribution
                    of the sums allotted to the different subdivisions of the votes for army
                    services; finally, allowing all cash expenditure, and recording the same under
                    its proper head of service in the annual account for Parliament; issuing all
                    warrants for the payment of moneys, making all imprests to accountants and
                    others, and seeing that accoùnts are duly rendered for the same; advising the
                    Secretary of State on all questions of pay, retired pay, and pensions for the
                    army and reserve forces.” Any or all of the above-mentioned great officers may
                    be in Parliament; and the Surveyor-General' of Ordnance and Financial Secretary
                    have usually seats in the Lower House.</p>
                <p>The Officer Commanding in Chief is nominated by a letter of service, and holds
                    his appointment during Her Majesty’s pleasure, differing in this respect from
                    the Surveyor-General and Financial Secretary, who are appointed by the Secretary
                    of State, and removable at his pleasure. The appointment is therefore not a
                    political one, and has been held by H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge since 1856. He
                    is assisted in his duties, and his orders are conveyed and executed through the
                    agency of the <hi rend="italic">General Staff</hi> of the army, comprising the
                    Headquarter Staff of the Military Department at the War Office, and the general
                    officers holding commands at home or abroad, with their subordinate staffs. The
                    Headquarter Staff is subdivided into the <hi rend="italic"

                    strategical, statistical, and topographical information, whether relating to the
                    British Empire or to foreign countries and armies; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recruiting Department,</hi> under an Inspector-General of Recruiting, charged
                    with the supervision of the recruiting throughout the kingdom; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Auxiliary Forces Department,</hi> under an Inspector-General of
                    Reserve and Auxiliary Forces, embracing all questions connected with the
                    militia, yeomanry, volunteers, and army reserves; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Military Education Department,</hi> under the Director-General of Military
                    Education, charged with the instruction and examination of officers, and matters
                    connected with military colleges and regimental or garrison schools and
                    libraries. The artillery and engineers have a distinct headquarter staff,
                    subordinate, however, to the Adjutant-General.</p>
                <p>The Surveyor-General of the Ordnance is annointed by the Secretary for War, and
                    removable at his pleasure; the appointment is therefore a political one, and
                    usually connected with a seat in Parliament. His subordinates and assistants in
                    the performance of his duties are the staff of the Ordnance Department at the
                    War Office, and the officers of the Control Department at the various military
                    stations at home and abroad. The Ordnance Department is divided into the <hi
                    rend="italic">Supply and Transport</hi> Division, under a Director of Supplies
                    and Transport, .whose duties embrace questions connected with transport, food,
                    forage, fuel and light, barracks, billets, and lodging; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Artillery and Stores</hi> Division, under a Director of Artillery and Stores,
                    whose duties embrace all questions connected with the manufacture, maintenance,
                    and supply of warlike stores of all kinds, and store and clotlιing accounts; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Contracts</hi> Division, under a Director of Contracts, who
                    makes all necessary contracts at home, and examines those entered into abroad;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Clothing</hi> Division, under the Director of
                    Clothing, who has charge of the manufacture and supply of clothing for the
                    army.</p>
                <p>The Financial Secretary is appointed by the Secretary for War, and removable at
                    his pleasure; the appointment, like that of the Surveyor-General, is therefore a
                    political one, and usually connected with a seat in Parliament. He is assisted
                    by an Accountant-General and large staff of clerks in his department of the War
                    Office, but has no staff or subordinates outside its walls.</p>
                <p>The number of men to be maintained and the amount of money to be expended are
                    determined by an annual vote of Parliament, based on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >estimates</hi> laid before the House by the Minister of War. The minister, with
                    the advice of the Officer Commanding in Chief, decides on the number of men that
                    Parliament shall be asked to provide for the ensuing year, and the estimates are
                    framed accordingly. To obtain the greatest possible accuracy, every subordinate
                    department at home and abroad is called upon for a detailed statement of
                    probable expenditure. These are examined and amended by the heads of the several
                    departments and divisions at the War Office, and passed on to the Finance
                    Department, where they are collected and incorporated into a general estimate,
                    which is submitted to the Secretary of State, with the remarks of the Financial
                    Secretary; and being revised and finally approved of, is submitted to the
                    Treasury and included in the annual budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
                    The Treasury may, however, reduce any item that appears excessive. When the
                    amount has been voted by Parliament, the Treasury authorises the
                    Paymaster-General to honour the orders of the War Office to the extent of the
                    vote. At home the necessary funds are obtained by warrants issued by the
                    Accountant-General, under authority of the Financial Secretary, and paid by the
                    Paymaster-GeneraΓby means of orders upon the Bank of England; abroad they are
                    obtained partly by remittances of specie, but principally by the negotiation of
                    bills of exchange drawn upon the Lords of the Treasury by the local Control
                    officers, acting’ in this respect on behalf of the Treasury. The army estimates,
                    as laid before Parliament, are divided under a certain number of votes, and
                    these again into sub-heads and items; and no money granted under one vote can be
                    applied to a service included under another vote without the sanction of the
                    Treasury. Within the limits of the vote, however, the War Office has the power
                    of redistributing the sums allotted.</p>
                <p>The following abstract of the army estimates for 1873-4 (which does not include,
                    however, the cost of that part of the army which is serving in India), will
                    indicate the classification under heads and votes, and the amounts allotted; and
                    although these vary slightly from year to year, the general distribution of
                    expenditure remains tolerably uniform :—</p>

                <p>The whole of the military forces of England are raised by voluntary enlistment.
                    Recruiting for the army is carried on partly by means of the large staff of
                    non-commissioned officers attached to the brigade dépôts, partly by means of
                    pensioners receiving a special rate of pay while so employed, and partly by
                    sergeants or parties sent out by regiments and corps for the purpose—the whole
                    being under the superintendence of the colonel commanding the brigade district.
                    Infantry regiments of the line recruit as far as possible within the districts
                    to which they are attached.; but the cavalry, artillery, engineers, guards, and
                    rifles recruit throughout the country generally. Enlistment in the army is
                    regulated by the annual Mutiny Act and the Army Enhstment Act; the former
                    legalises the maintenance of an army, and lays down the number of men and manner
                    of enlisting them; the latter fixes the period and conditions of service. By the
                    Enlistment Act of 1870 men are enlisted for a first period of twelve years,
                    which may be spent either entirely in the army, or partly in the army and partly
                    in the reserve, as may from time to time be fixed by the Secretary of State for
                    War. At present “short service” is fixed at six years in the army and six in the
                    reserve for infantry, and eight years in the army and four in the reserve for
                    the other ' branches. The Household cavalry, and a certain proportion in the
                    other branches, are enlisted for “long service,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    twelve years in the ranks.</p>
                <p>On the completion of twelve years’ aπny service, soldiers may be allowed to
                    re-engage for nine years, making a total of twenty-one, at the end of which they
                    are entitled to discharge with a pension. Those who are passed into the. army
                    reserve remain liable for the rest of their twelve years’ engagement to be
                    recalled into the ranks in case of w⅜r or national emergency, and to be called
                    out for eight days’ training in each year; but otherwise resume their positions
                    as citizens, and are free to follow their callings.</p>
                <p>A recruit for the army must be between 18 and 25 years of age, unmarried, free
                    from physical infirmities, and of such height and chest measurement as may be
                    laid · down from time to time. The standard has frequently varied, having been
                    used as a means of regulating the supply of recruits, but stood in 1873 at a
                    minimum of 5 feet 5 inches for the infantry, 5 feet 6 inches for light cavalry
                    and engineers, 5 feet 7 inches for gunners, and 5 feet 8 inches for heavy
                    cavalry; the minimum chest measurement being 33 inches. For rifle regiments and
                    for artillery drivers the standard is reduced to 5 feet 4J inches, but increased
                    chest measurement is required. Exceptions are also made in favour of artificers
                    and others. When a recruit presents himself for enlistment he is asked certain
                    questions as to age, and whether he has served before; if the answers are
                    satisfactory, and he is otherwise suitable, he is given a shilling as enlistment
                    money, and served with a notice warning him to attend before a magistrate for
                    attestation. Within not less than twenty-four, and not more than ninety-six
                    hours he is brought before the magistrate. If he then dissents from his
                    enlistment, he may be discharged on payment of 20s. “smart money;” if he still
                    wishes to enlist, he makes a declaration contained in the attestation paper as
                    to his age, place of birth, trade, &amp;c.; signs the attestation, and takes the
                    oath of allegiance; and is thenceforth legally a soldier. No recruit, however,
                    is finally accepted until he has been examined by a medical officer, and
                    approved by an officer of rank detailed for the purpose. Formerly, recruiting
                    was carried on largely at public-houses kept for the purpose; young men were
                    entrapped by lying placards or by the misrepresentations of recruiting agents,
                    and often enlisted whilst drunk, and then sent under escort to their regiments.
                    Recently great improvements have been made in the recruiting service: the
                    bounties formerly offered, and varying from £1 to £10, according to the demand
                    for recruits, have been abolished, exaggerated placards forbidden, the
                    recruiting taken away as much as possible from the public-houses, and the young
                    soldier sent by himself to join his regiment. Under the system of long service
                    the annual number of recruits required to keep up the army was from 8 to 10 per
                    cent, of its strength, but in future the proportion will be largely increased.
                    The average number actually raised annually was 16,000 in the ten years 1860-9,
                    and 21,000 in the three years 1870-2; the largest number raised in any one year
                    since the war being 28,000, in 1859.</p>

                <p>The Household cavalry, horse artillery, and some ranks of the foot guards,
                    receive a higher rate of pay, and the engineers usually earn working pay in
                    addition. Every soldier further receives a free ration of bread and meat, valued
                    at 6d. * Taking into consideration the value of the ration, lodgings, clothing,
                    fuel, and light, the pay and allowances of the infantry private represent an
                    average annual value of about £38, and that of the cavalry private about £41,
                    exclusive of any prospective advantages in the way of pension; while the
                    corporals and sergeants range from £45 to £70. Comparing this with the annual
                    receipts of the average labourer, which range between £35 and £45 in different
                    counties of England and Scotland, and are much lower in Treland, and bearing in
                    mind that the soldier as a rule is called on to do less work, it is evident that
                    his position on the whole is not a disadvantageous one. In addition to the
                    above, the soldier may earn Id. a day good-conduct pay after 2 years’ service,
                    2d. a day after 6 years’, 3d. after 12 years’, and 4d. after 18 years’ service.

                <p>A soldier may claim his discharge at the expiration of his first or second period
                    of service <hi rend="italic">; or</hi> he may be discharged before the
                    expiration of his service, either by sentence of court-martial or by order of

                    on reduction of the army, of as an invalid, if found unfit for further service.
                    A soldier discharged after 21 years’ service is entitled to a pension varying
                    from a minimum of 8d. a day for a private, to a maximum of 2s. 6d. a day for a
                    non-commissioned officer <hi rend="italic">; every</hi> goodconduct badge the
                    soldier was in possession of, or would have been entitled to, at the time of
                    discharge, adding a Id. a day to his pension. A soldier discharged on the
                    completion of his first period (12 years), or discharged at any time for
                    misconduct, receives no pension. If discharged as an invalid, on account of
                    unfitness for service, he receives a temporary or permanent pension, varying,
                    according to the nature of the disability and the manner in which it arose, from
                    a minimum of 6d. a day for a year, to the full pension given above. Pensions for
                    wounds are given on a special scale, according to the nature of the wound, the
                    maximum being 2s. 6d. for a private and 3s. 6d. for a non-commissioned officer.
                    Soldiers are also allowed to purchase their discharge as an indulgence,
                    according to a fixed scale depending on length of service and character <hi

                    being the maximum rates. After from 12 to 16 years’ service such discharge is*
                    granted free.</p>
                <p>There are ten ranks of combatant officers in the army,— viz., field-marshals,
                    generals,·lieutenant-generals, and major-generals (classed as <hi rend="italic"
                    >general officers)</hi>; colonels, lieutenantcolonels, and majors <hi
                    rend="italic">(field officers)]</hi> captains, lieutenants, and sub-lieutenants
                    (regimental or <hi rend="italic">company</hi> officers). The classification and
                    promotion of officers is complicated by the system of <hi rend="italic"
                    >brevet</hi> or <hi rend="italic">army</hi> rank, by which an officer may hold a
                    higher rank in the army than he holds in his regiment. Brevet rank is usually
                    given for distinguished service in the field, or for length of service: it
                    begins with the rank of major, and may be said to cease with that of
                    major-general, .as in that grade and in those above it all rank is army rank.
                    Relative rank and command within the regiment, regimental promotion and duties,
                    and pay, are determined by regimental rank; but rank, command, and duties
                    outside the regiment, and army promotion, are governed by army rank. Thus a
                    regimental captain may receive the brevet of major for distinguished service: he
                    is called captain and brevet major, retains his place among the captains of his
                    regiment, and continues to perform a captain’s duties in his regiment; but on
                    any duties where the officers of . several regiments are mixed he takes his
                    place as major, and would command captains of his own regiment, though senior as
                    such to himself.</p>
                <p>Previous to November 1871 first appointments and regimental promotion in the
                    cavalry and infantry were made under the purchase system. This system dates from
                    the earliest days of the army, and arose partly from the mode in which regiments
                    were originally raised Every regimental commission had a fixed regulation price,
                    varying from £450, the price of an ensigncy in an infantry regiment, to £7250,
                    that of a lieutenant-colonelcy of Life Guards; in addition to which an
                    over-regulation price, which sometimes even exceeded the regulation price, had
                    sprung up, and become established by custom, though contrary to law. An officer
                    on retiring received the regulation price of his commission from Government, and
                    the over-regulation from the officer who succeeded him; and the step went to the
                    senior qualified officer of the lower grade in the regiment. who was able and
                    willing to purchase it. An officer who could not afford to purchase rose with
                    the others till he became senior of his rank, and there remained till a death
                    vacancy or other “non-purchase step” gave him his promotion. Practically,
                    however, the injury inflicted was less than at first sight appears, as the
                    purchase system stimulated a rapid flow of promotion, by which the non-purchase
                    officer profited also, and if he lost a year or two in promotion, he saved
                    several thousand pounds. First appointments were given to gentlemen whose names
                    were on the Commander-in-Chief’s list, and to cadets from the Military College
                    at Sandhurst, on passing the required examinations and paying the price of the
                    commission; a certain number of commissions without purchase being given to
                    those who passed high examinations at Sandhurst, and to young men whose fathers’
                    services gave them special claims.</p>
                <p>Purchase was abolished by warrant of 20th July 1871, Parliament voting the money
                    to compensate the officers then holding saleable commissions, and a system of
                    promotion by “seniority tempered by selection” was substituted by the present
                    regulations.</p>
                <p>First commissions as sub-lieutenants are now given to successful candidates at an
                    open competitive examination, to non-commissioned officers specially
                    recommended, to university students who have passed certain examinations, and to
                    “Queen’s” and “Indian cadets,” and pages of honour. A certain number of first
                    commissions as lieutenants are also given to lieutenants of militia regiments.
                    The limits of age for candidates by competition are from 17 to 20; but this is
                    extended to 22 in the case of university students and militia lieutenants, and
                    30 in the case of non-commissioned officers. The great majority of first
                    appointments are given by open competition, examinations for the purpose being
                    held periodically under the Civil Service Commissioners. The successful
                    candidates receive commissions as sub-Eeutenants, and are sent to the Military
                    College at Sandhurst (or to their regiments, if in India) for a course of
                    instruction; and after passing the required examination in military subjects at
                    the conclusion of the course, and serving a certain time with their regiments,
                    are eligible for promotion to the rank of Eeutenant. A Eeutenant is eligible for
                    promotion to captain after two years’ service, but the actual time is usually
                    much longer—from eight to eleven years; to quaEfy, he must pass an examination
                    in regimental duties, drill, &amp;c., and also a special army examination in
                    military law, tactics, field sketching, and field fortification. Promotion to
                    the rank of captain is usually by regimental seniority; the senior qualified
                    subaltern in the regiment succeeding to a vacancy among the captains. A captain
                    may become <hi rend="italic">regimental</hi> major by succession to a vacancy in
                    his own regiment, or by being promoted to a majority in another regiment, or on
                    half-pay; and <hi rend="italic">brevet</hi> major by promotion for distinguished
                    service, or by seniority in the army. Before promotion to a regimental majority
                    a captain must pass a practical examination in subjects connected with the
                    command of a regiment or of a small mixed force in the field. The appointment as
                    major to a regiment is made for five years only, but is renewable. A major may
                    become <hi rend="italic">regimental</hi> Heutenant-colonel by appointment to the
                    command of a regiment, or to an unattached lieutenant-colonelcy; and by <hi
                    rend="italic">brevet</hi> for distinguished service, or by seniority in the
                    army. Certain staff appointments also carry with them the rank of
                    lieutenant-colonel on appointment, or on completion of five years’ service in
                    them. Regimental promotion ceases with the rank of Eeutenant-coloneL When a
                    vacancy arises in a regiment by death or by the promotion of an officer to
                    another regiment, the step goes in the regiment; if it arises otherwise, it is
                    fiUed up as seems best to the Secretary of State and the Commanderin<pb

                    receiving full consideration. A lieutenant-colonel becomes colonel by <hi

                    appointment as aide-de-camp to the Queen, after five years’ service in the
                    command of a regiment, or an equivalent staff appointment, or eight years under
                    certain conditions.</p>
                <p>The promotion of general officers is by seniority, regulated by a fixed
                    establishment, the numbers of which in 1870 were 71 generals, 115
                    lieutenant-generals, and 188 major-generals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    made independently of the establishment for distinguished service.
                    Field-marshals are appointed at the will of the sovereign, and without reference
                    to seniority.</p>
                <p>All promotions are made upon the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, with
                    the approval of the Secretary of State for War.</p>
                <p>The Artillery and Engineers have always been on a different footing from the rest
                    of the army. First appointments to these services are made through the Royal
                    Military Academy, entrance to which is by open competitive examination. After a
                    course of instruction in. professional subjects, occupying three years, cadets
                    are examined and finally classed, and receive commissions in the engineers and
                    artillery according to their standing on the list. Those selected for the
                    engineers are required to go through a further course of instruction at Chatham
                    for two years before their commissions are confirmed. Regimental promotion in
                    the two services is governed purely by seniority, and a separate establishment
                    of general officers is maintained for them; in brevet promotion they are on the
                    same footing as officers of the other branches.</p>

                <p>Officers of the horse artillery receive a higher rate of pay, slightly in excess
                    of that of the corresponding ranks in the cavalry. Officers of the engineers,
                    doing duty as such, receive extra pay, usually amounting to one-half of their
                    ordinary pay if serving at home, or equivalent to it if serving abroad or in the
                    London district. Lieutenant-, colonels of regiments, and other officers holding
                    commands of wings, batteries, or dépôts, receive “command pay” of from 3s. to
                    Is. 6d. daily. Captains holding higher rank by brevet receive 2s. a day
                    additional; and lieutenants, after seven years’ service, Is. a day. Officers
                    holding staff appointments receive the pay of such appointments in addition to
                    their regimental pay or half-pay.</p>
                <p>Officers holding certain appointments are “seconded ”— that is, their place in
                    the regiment is filled up, and they become supernumerary, their names being
                    shown in italics in the <hi rend="italic">Army List;</hi> but they still belong
                    to the regiment, and rise in it in due course.</p>
                <p>Officers who entered the purchase corps under the old system can retire by the
                    sale of their commissions, receiv ing from Government the value, over-regulation
                    as well as regulation, of the commission which they held at the date of the
                    abolition of purchase. Within certain limits officers are allowed to retire on
                    the full pay of their rank after thirty years’ service,—the full pay of a
                    lieutenant-colonel being reckoned at 20s. a day; and all officers have an
                    unqualified right to retire on half-pay after twenty-five years’ service. The
                    rates of half-pay amount usually to about three-fifths of the full pay of the
                    corresponding ranks. Pensions are granted to officers who have received wounds
                    in action equivalent to the loss of a limb, at the rate of £400 a year to a
                    lieutenant-general, £300 to a colonel or lieutenant-colonel, £200 to a major,
                    £100 to a captain, and £70 to a lieutenant. Such pensions continue as long as
                    the effects of the wound continue, and are held in addition to any pay or
                    retiring allowances the officer is in receipt of. Gratuities, varying from three
                    to twelve months’ pay of the rank, are granted to officers who have received
                    less serious wounds.</p>
                <p>Pensions are granted to the widows of officers killed in action, or dying of
                    diseases contracted in the field, at rates varying from £60 (lieutenant’s widow)
                    to £200 (widow of colonel or lieutenant-colonel) in the former case, and £50 to
                    £150 in the latter; and “compassionate allowances” are granted, at rates
                    varying, according to rank of deceased officer and other circumstances, from £6
                    to £40 annually for each child. Such compassionate allowances, however, are not
                    granted except in cases where it is shown that the means of the family are so
                    limited that they actually require such assistance; and widows’ pensions
                    generally cannot be claimed as a right, and are not granted where the widow is
                    left in affluence, or where the Secretary of State sees reason to withhold them
                    on account of misconduct or other causes. · A reduced rate of pension and
                    compassionate allowances, ranging from £40 to £120 for the widow, and £5 to £20
                    for each child, is granted where the officer died under circumstances which do
                    not entitle his family to the higher rates; but in such case the aggregate
                    amount must not exceed the half-pay of the rank held by him at the time of his
                    death. When an officer holding a saleable commission is killed in action, or
                    dies within six months of wounds received, his family receive the value of such
                    commission.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Staff.</hi></p>
                <p>The staff of the British army may be classed under three principal heads—</p>
                <p>1. General Officers, commanding divisions, districts, brigades, &amp;c.;</p>
                <p>2. General Staff, including Adjutant-General and Quarter master-General’s
                    Departments, brigade-majors, &lt;fcc.;</p>
                <p>3. Personal Staff, consisting of military secretaries and aides-de-camp.</p>
                <p>Appointments to commands are made from the lists of superior officers of
                    corresponding rank. Sometimes, however, commands are given to officers of lower
                    rank than that of the appointment, in which case they receive local and
                    temporary rank The command of brigades is usually given to colonels, with
                    temporary rank of brigadier-general.</p>
                <p>General officers are responsible for the discipline and efficiency of all the
                    military forces within their commands. They are required to make annual
                    inspections of every regiment or corps, and report minutely on them for the
                    information of the Commander-in-Chief. They are assisted in their duties, and
                    their orders conveyed to the troops, by the officers of the staff. Officers for
                    the <hi rend="italic">General Staff</hi> are selected exclusively from the
                    regular army, and, except in cases of proved abilities in the field, must have
                    passed through the Staff College. Admission to the Staff College is obtained by
                    competitive examination, the number entering being limited to twenty annually.
                    Candidates must have served not less than five years, and be reported to be
                    thoroughly good regimental officers, qualified from general character,
                    disposition, &amp;c., for employment on the staff, and physically fit for its
                    active duties. Before being allowed to compete, they are reported upon by a
                    board consisting of the commanding officer and two next seniors of their
                    regiment and corps, and also by a general officer, to whose staff they have been
                    attached for a month on trial. Officers of not less than seven years’ service
                    may present themselves at the final examination without having studied at the
                    college; but the same qualifications and certificates are required from them.
                    After completing the course and passing the final examination, officers are
                    attached during the following summer drill season either to the staff of a
                    general officer, or to the other arms of the service.</p>
                <p>Officers appointed to the <hi rend="italic">Personal Staff</hi> are not required
                    to pass through the Staff College, but have to undergo a qualifying
                    examination.</p>
                <p>Staff appointments are held for five years only, at the end of which time the
                    officer reverts to his regiment or to half-pay. Most of the lower appointments
                    are held by regimental officers who are temporarily withdrawn from their
                    regiments, but still borne on its establishment. No effective field officer of a
                    regiment, however, can hold a staff appointment, and no regiment of cavalry may
                    have more than one captain and one subaltern, and no battalion of infantry more
                    than two captains and two subalterns on the staff.</p>

                <p>The Headquarter Staff receive a special higher rate of pay. These rates are in
                    addition to the pay or half-pay of their regimental commissions. Staff officers
                    also receive an allowance for horses, varying from two for the lowest ranks to
                    eight for a general.</p>
                <p>The staff are the assistants of the general in all his duties, and the channels
                    through which his orders are conveyed to the troops. The duties of the officers
                    of the Adj ut ant-G eneral and Quartermaster-G eneral’s Departments, and of
                    military secretaries, correspond generally to those of the same departments at
                    headquarters; the Adjutant-General and his deputies or assistants being charged
                    with the issue of all orders, and matters referring to drill, discipline,
                    returns, duties, &amp;c.; the Quartermaster-General, or his subordinates, with
                    matters connected with the movement and quartering of troops, camps, military
                    positions, reconnaissances, embarkations, and disembarkations, &amp;c.; and the
                    military secretaries with questions relating to promotions and appointments,
                    miscellaneous confidential correspondence, and communications with the civil
                    authorities. A brigade-major performs the duties of the Adjutant and
                    Quartermaster-General’s Departments within his brigade. The duties of an
                    aide-de-camp are of a more personal nature. In the field he is employed to carry
                    orders, &amp;c.; in peace he attends his general at inspections and on all
                    public occasions, and renders such services as his general requires of him.
                    Officers of the General Staff, as a rule, are not under the rank of captains;
                    aides-de-camp are appointed without regard to rank, but no officer may hold a
                    staff appointment till he has served three years with his regiment or corps.

                    the qualified officers; appointments on Personal Staff are made on the
                    recommendation of the general officer. The total numbers of officers employed on
                    the staff of the army are 241 in the United Kingdom and colonies (British
                    establishment), and 278 in India (Indian establishment). About two-thirds of the
                    staff on the British establishment belong to regiments, and are borne on their
                    establishments, the remainder being officers on half-pay or unattached. In India
                    the rules regarding staff appointments vary a little, and most of the
                    appointments, with the exception of the higher <hi rend="subscript"> fl</hi>
                    commands, are filled from a special “staff corps but some are also held by

                <p><hi rend="italic">Cavalry.</hi></p>
                <p>The cavalry consists of 31 regiments: viz., 2 of Life Guards and 1 of Royal Horse
                    Guards, forming together the “Household Brigade;” 7 regiments of Dragoon Guards,
                    3 of Dragoons, 5 of Lancers, and 13 of Hussars.</p>
                <p>The Household Brigade form the body-guard of the sovereign, furnishing the
                    escorts on all state occasions. They are recruited regimentally, and take none
                    but picked men, of good character, and over 5 feet 10 inches in height. They
                    wear helmet, cuirass, and long jack-boots, and are armed with a breech-loading
                    carbine and long straight sword, 40 inches in the blade. From the great size of
                    the men, added to the weight of the cuirass, they ride very heavy—from 21 to 22
                    stone when equipped, for service. They are quartered in or near London, and are
                    only sent abroad in war.</p>
                <p>The other regiments are classed as “heavy,” “medium,” and “light.” The dragoons
                    are classed partly as heavy, and partly as medium; the lancers as medium; the
                    hussars as light. The heavies recruit from men of 5 feet 8 inches to 5 feet 11
                    inches in height, and ride, in “service marching order,” from 19 to 20 stone;
                    the mediums from men of 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 9 inches, and ride from 18⅜ to
                    19 stone; the lights from men of 5 feet 6 inches to 5 feet 8 inches, and ride
                    from 17⅜ to 18^ stone. The dragoon guards, dragoons, and hussars are armed with
                    breechloading carbines and sword. The lancers carry a bamboo lance (9 feet
                    long), sword, and pistol. The colour and facings of the uniform vary in
                    different regiments, the dragoons mostly wearing red, while the hussars and
                    lancers wear blue. The dragoons wear helmets, with the exception of the 2d
                    Dragoons (the “Scots Greys”), who wear bearskins; the lancers, the lancer
                    square-topped cap; and the hussars, a busby with plume and bag. The Household
                    Brigade are the only cuirassed regiments.</p>
                <p>A regiment of cavalry on war footing consists of 8 troops, forming 4 squadrons in
                    the field, and numbering 1 lieutenant-colonel, 1 major, 8 captains, 12
                    lieutenants and sub-lieutenants, 5 regimental staff officers, 11 staff
                    sergeants, 8 troop sergeants-major, 24 sergeants, 32 corporals, 8 trumpeters, 20
                    farriers, shoeing smiths, and saddlers, and 504 privates; in all, 27 officers
                    and 607 men, with 559 horses. They take with them in the field 2 forgewaggons, 1
                    small-arm ammunition-cart, and 7 baggage and store-waggons. The peace
                    establishment is 29 officers, 506 men, and 320 horses. Of the 28 regiments of
                    the line, 9 are usually in India, and 19 at home. The principal cavalry stations
                    in the United Kingdom are Alder-shott, the Curragh (with Newbridge), and Dublin;
                    at each of the two first there is a general commanding the cavalry, who also
                    inspects all the cavalry regiments in that portion of the kingdom. The depots of
                    regiments serving abroad, and the riding establishment, are at Canterbury.
                    Cavalry regiments are not connected with particular counties or districts, but
                    recnιit throughout the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The horses for the cavalry are mostly obtained by purchase from dealers, at the
                    headquarters of the several regiments; no breeding establishments or special
                    arrangements for securing a sufficient supply of a good class of horses, such as
                    have been generally introduced on the Continent, exist in England. The horses
                    are usually bought at four years old, £40 being the maximum government price;
                    the average height is 15 hands 2 inches. Officers provide their own chargers,
                    but are allowed to select from the troop horses under certain restrictions and
                    on payment of £50; sub-lieutenants are provided with horses and horse equipments
                    at the public expense.</p>
                <p>The oldest cavalry regiments are the Horse Guards, raised by the Earl of Oxford,
                    and first known as the Oxford Blues; and the two regiments of Life Guards,
                    raised in 1661-2. The privates in these regiments were for the most part of good
                    family, and were addressed as “Gentlemen of the Life Guards.” The youngest
                    regiments, the 19th, 20th and 21st Hussars, were formed from the European
                    regiments in the East India Company’s service at the time of the
                    amalgamation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artillery.</hi></p>
                <p>The artillery, notwithstanding the great augmentations it has received of late
                    years, consequent on the increased importance of its arm, still retains the
                    title of the “Royal Regiment of Artillery.” It consists of 205 batteries,
                    forming 28 brigades, of which 5 brigades, or 31 batteries, are horse artillery;
                    10 brigades, or 83 batteries, are field artillery; and 13 brigades, or 91
                    batteries, are garrison or siege artillery. In addition to these, there is a
                    depot brigade of 12 batteries, and the “coast brigade” of 10 batteries. The
                    battery is the true unit of our artillery, the brigade being rather a grouping
                    for administrative purposes; in the field and horse artillery, the batteries are
                    almost entirely independent.</p>
                <p>The establishment of a battery of <hi rend="italic">horse artillery</hi> on war
                    footing is—1 major, 1 captain, 3 lieutenants, 1 assistantsurgeon, 1 veterinary
                    surgeon, 2 staff sergeants, 6 sergeants, 12 corporals and bombardiers, 2
                    trumpeters, 10 artificers (including shoeing smiths), and 153 gunners and
                    drivers; altogether 7 officers and 185 men, with 206 horses and 6 guns, 9
                    ammunition-waggons, and 5 forge, store, &amp;c., waggons. The peace
                    establishment varies; the present home establishment is 5 officers, 151 men, and
                    113 horses. The guns now in use are 9-pounder rifled muzzle-loaders, of wrought
                    iron. In the horse artillery every man is either mounted, or carried on the
                    limber or ammunition-waggons, to enable them to keep pace with cavalry.</p>
                <p>A battery of <hi rend="italic">field artillery</hi> on war footing has the same
                    establishment of officers and non-commissioned officers, but more gunners and
                    drivers, and fewer horses. The numbers are—7 officers, 197 men, 184 horses, 6
                    guns, 12 ammunition and 4 miscellaneous waggons. The peace establishment at home
                    is 5 officers, 152 men, and 85 horses. The guns in use are 16-pounder rifled
                    muzzle-loaders, drawn by 8 horses.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">garrison l&gt;altery</hi> consists of 1 major, 1 captain, 2
                    lieutenants, 1 staff sergeant, 5 sergeants, 10 corporals and bombardiers, and
                    140 gunners. They are all dismounted, and are employed in garrisons in working
                    the heavy guns, at sieges, and on other similar duties.</p>
                <p>Besides the above, heavy batteries of position, mountain batteries, and
                    ammunition columns are formed in war time. A heavy battery has 4 guns only,
                    40-pounder breech-loading rifled guns on the Armstrong principle. Mountain
                    batteries are only organised when the nature of the warfare requires it, and
                    their detail varies accordingly.</p>
                <p>Artillery and infantry reserve ammunition columns are formed when an army takes
                    the field, one being attached <pb break="no"

                    officers and 138 men, with 4 artillery and 1G small-arm ammunitionwaggons, 2
                    spare gun-carriages, 5 miscellaneous waggons, and 142 horses; carrying 360
                    rounds of gun, and 307,200 of small-arm ammunition.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">coast brigade</hi> is formed entirely of old soldiers of
                    good character, drawn from the other brigades. It is broken up in small
                    detachments, often numbering one or two men only, distributed along the coast;
                    the men being employed to take charge of unoccupied forts and batteries, and of
                    the guns and artillery stores in those which are occupied. The number of
                    officers in the coast brigade is small, but there are 121 <hi rend="italic"
                    >master gunners,</hi> ranking as warrant officers, attached to it, who take
                    charge of the more important works and command the small detachments of coast
                    brigade men.</p>
                <p>The uniform of the whole of the artillery is blue with red facings; the horse
                    artillery wear a jacket, the others a tunic. The head-dress for all is a busby
                    with bag. The non-commissioned officers and gunners of the horse artillery, and
                    the mounted men of the field batteries, are armed with the cavalry sword, the
                    dismounted men with a sword-bayonet; the drivers carry no arms. Twelve carbines
                    are carried with each horse battery, and 24 with each field battery. The
                    garrison batteries are armed with breechloading carbines and sword-bayonets.</p>
                <p>The headquarters of the artillery are at Woolwich, the great arsenal for the
                    whole kingdom. Two or three brigades are usually stationed there, besides the
                    permanent dépôt and riding establishment. Three horse brigades (15 batteries),
                    six field brigades (43 batteries), and four garrison brigades (28 batteries) are
                    stationed in India; four garrison brigades (28 batteries) in our colonies and
                    foreign garrisons,—Gibraltar, Malta, Bermuda, Halifax, &lt;fcc.; and the
                    remainder distributed throughout the United Kingdom. The principal artillery
                    stations besides Woolwich are Alder-shott, Portsmouth, Dover, Dublin, and
                    Plymouth. There is a second depot at Sheerness; and a school of gunnery, with an
                    extensive establishment, has been formed at Shoe· buryness, for the double
                    purpose of instructing officers and men in the higher branches of gunnery, and
                    carrying on artillery experiments—the long reaches of sand near the mouth of the
                    Thames being peculiarly favourable for this purpose.</p>
                <p>The artillery are not connected with particular districts or counties, but
                    recruit generally throughout the kingdom. The horses for the artillery are
                    obtained by purchases made from dealers, or by officers specially appointed for
                    the purpose, £45 being the maximum price allowed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Engineers.</hi></p>
                <p>For purposes of administration, promotion, &lt;fcc., the Royal Engineers form a
                    single regiment or corps, consisting of 40 companies, 3 troops, and a large
                    establishment of officers, not attached to any companies, but employed in
                    superintending works and buildings, and in other’ professional and scientific
                    duties. Of the 40 companies, four are “survey” companies, and two are attached
                    for service with the postal telegraph; the remainder are employed in works and
                    buildings, or undergoing instruction at Chatham. The war establishment of a
                    company is 1 captain, 3 subalterns, 1 assistant-surgeon, 6 sergeants, 12
                    corporals, 2 buglers, and 100 privates (termed “sappers”) of various trades,
                    viz., carpenters, masons, bricklayers, smiths, painters, printers,
                    telegraphists, &lt;fcc.; in all, 5 officers and 120 men. The peace establishment
                    is 3 officers and 93 men.</p>
                <p>The three engineer troops are,—the field equipment troop, telegraph troop, and
                    pontoon troop, each of which forms the nucleus of several similar ones to be
                    raised in war. The war establishment of a <hi rend="italic">feld equipment
                    troop</hi> is 6 officers and 233 men (of whom 100 are drivers), with 186 horses
                    and 33 waggons and carts. It is divided into three sections, each of which
                    carries the camp equipment and all necessary tools and implements for a company
                    of engineers, and a “field park.” The troop is kept together for convenience in
                    peace time, but in the field would be broken up, and the sections attached to
                    the companies of engineers. The field equipment troop carries mining and
                    entrenching tools, sandbags, rope, gunpowder and fuses for mines and blasting, a
                    portable forge, sets of carpenters’, smiths’, farriers’, stonemasons’,
                    bricklayers’, collar-makers’, &amp;c., tools and materials; also instruments,
                    drawing materials, printing-press, and photographic apparatus.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">telegraph troop</hi> consists of 6 officers, 245
                    non-commissioned officers and men, with 24 carriages, 42 riding and 114 draught
                    horses. Twelve of the waggons are fitted as wire waggons, and carry each three
                    miles of insulated wire, on rollers, besides staples and telegraph poles for
                    carrying the wire along trees or houses, or over obstacles. Four waggons are
                    fitted as offices, with recording instruments (Morse). The troop is so organised
                    that it can be broken up into three sectioħs, each complete in itself. A certain
                    proportion of the men are trained to act as signallers, and all the materials
                    for visual signalling—flags for use by day, rockets and lime-lights for flashing
                    signals by night—are carried with the troop.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">pontoon troop</hi> consists of G officers and 296
                    non-commissioned officers and men, with 31 carriages, 20 riding and 210 draught
                    horses. It carries 22 pontoons, being sufficient to construct 120 yards of
                    bridge, capable of bearing cavalry, infantry, and field artillery; and a supply
                    of trestles for light field bridges.</p>
                <p>It is further in contemplation to organise a railway battalion, composed of men
                    trained to all duties connected with the construction, repair, and working of
                    railways.</p>
                <p>The daily pay of the several ranks has been already given; but in addition to
                    this ordinary rate, officers, when regimentally employed, receive extra pay,
                    usually equal to the ordinary pay, if abroad (or in the London district), or to
                    one-half of it if at home; and the non-commissioned officers and men receive
                    “working pay,” varying according to their skill and to the nature of their
                    employment, but commonly ranging between Is. and 2s. a-day. The uniform of the
                    Royal Engineers is scarlet, with blue facings, the head-dress a low busby and
                    plume. The men are armed with a Lancaster breech-loading rifled carbine and
                    sword-bayonet In the engineer train the non-commissioned officers and sappers
                    carry swords; the drivers carry no arms.</p>
                <p>The sappers are recruited entirely from men of good character, able to read and
                    write, and who have been brought up to, or served apprenticeship in, some
                    suitable trade. All men on enlistment are sent to Chatham to go through a long
                    course of training and instruction in the special duties connected with military
                    engineering, such as siege operations, field works, mines, bridging, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The headquarters and depot of the Royal Engineers are at Chatham, where their
                    great instructional institutions are established. The distiibution of the force
                    depends on the works in progress in différent parts of the empire. A
                    considerable number of officers are stationed in India, but no men. Thirteen
                    companies are now stationed abroad in our colonies and foreign
                    garrisons—Bermuda, Gibraltar, Malta, &lt;fcc.; and 27 companies, with the three
                    troops of engineer train, are at home. Two companies are employed, under the
                    direction of the Post-Office, in the construction and maintenance of the
                    telegraph lines throughout the country, thus acquiring in peace time the
                    practical experience necessary to enable them to undertake<pb break="no"

                    and in an enemy’s country; and four are permanently engaged on the great
                    ordnance survey of the kingdom. The others are distributed throughout the
                    principal garrisons; eight or ten usually remaining with the headquarters at
                    Chatham.</p>
                <p>The duties of engineer officers are very various. Besides the actual command and
                    superintendence of their men, and their instruction in all branches of field
                    engineering, they include the charge, construction, and repair of fortifications
                    and barracks, the survey of the kingdom, the management of a number of
                    scientific and experimental establishments, the development of all the
                    scientific appliances of war, such as armour plating, torpedoes, field
                    telegraphy and signalling, &amp;c., Engineer officers are also largely employed
                    under the civil government in connection with the educational departments,
                    railways, prisons, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Infantry.</hi></p>
                <p>The infantry consists of 3 regiments of Foot Guards (7 battalions), 109 of the
                    Line (137 battalions) and the Rifle Brigade (4 battalions,)—total, 148
                    battalions.</p>
                <p>The three regiments of guards are the Grenadier Guards, of 3 battalions; and the
                    Coldstream and Scots Fusilier Guards, of 2 battalions each. These form together
                    the brigade of foot guards. They are stationed principally in London, and rarely
                    leave the country except for active service in the field; they furnish the
                    guards on the royal palaces, and guards of honour on state occasion®, receive a
                    special rate of pay, and have certain privileges. Up to 1872 their lieutenants
                    had the rank of captains in the army, and their captains that of
                    lieutenant-colonels. This privilege, however, was abolished by a warrant of July
                    of that year as regards officers entering subsequent to that date.</p>
                <p>Of the line regiments, Nos. 1 to 25 have two battalions each, two rifle regiments
                    (the 60th and Rifle Brigade) have four each, and the remainder one only. By the
                    localisation of 1873, the single battalion regiments have been grouped in pairs
                    to form “district brigades.” The several battalions are altogether independent
                    of one another in matters of command, internal economy, &amp;c.; but recruiting
                    is carried on for the brigade, and men or officers may be transferred from one
                    battalion to another within it. A district brigade comprises two line
                    battalions, a brigade depot, and a certain proportion of reserve and auxiliary
                    forces.</p>
                <p>A battalion of infantry consists of eight companies. Its war establishment is 1
                    lieutenant-colonel, 2 majors, 8 captains, 16 lieutenants and sub-lieutenants, 1
                    adjutant, 1 paymaster, 1 quartermaster, 1 assistant-surgeon, 10 staff sergeants,
                    8 colour sergeants, 32 sergeants, 16 drummers, 40 corporals, 4 hospital
                    orderlies, 10 pioneers, and 946 privates,—in all, 31 officers and 1066
                    non-commissioned officers and men. On service it takes with it 62 horses (of
                    which 9 are officers’ chargers and 53 draught horses), and 14 waggons and carts
                    (3 ammunition carts, 1 entrenching tool waggon, 1 for quartermaster’s stores,
                    and 9 for camp equipment and baggage). The peace establishment varies. Most of
                    the battalions at home are kept at a reduced establishment of 520 rank and file,
                    the guards at 750, the battalions next for foreign service at from 700 to 820,
                    and the battalions in India at 820.</p>
                <p>The infantry is at present armed partly with the Snider (converted Enfield)
                    rifle, and partly with the Martini-Henry, but will ultimately be armed entirely
                    with the latter. This weapon, which was selected in 1870 after a careful and
                    protracted series of trials, is a breechloading rifle, 4 feet 1 inch long,
                    weighs 8 lb. 12 oz., and ranges up to 1000 yards. It is seven-grooved, bore <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 451 of an inch, carries a bullet weighing 1 oz., and
                    has been fired at the rate of 25 rounds a minute. The soldier carries 70 rounds
                    of ammunition, viz., 20 in each of two pouches on the waist belt, 10 in expense
                    bag, and 20 in a pocket in his valise. The bayonet (Elcho sword-bayonet) is a
                    short heavy sword, with saw-back, which can be attached to the rifle as a
                    bayonet, or used independently as a sword, or to cut up firewood, chop bushes,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Although the regiments are named Rifles, Fusiliers, Light Infantry, &lt;kc., the
                    organisation, armament, and training is the same throughout, the only
                    distinction being in matters of dress. The two rifle regiments wear dark green;
                    all the rest of the infantry wear red. The guards are distinguished by their
                    tall bearskins; the fusilier regiments (9) wear sealskin caps, resembling the
                    bearskins of the guards, but smaller. There are 9 Highland regiments, of whom 5
                    wear the kilt and bonnet; the others have minor distinctions in dress. The light
                    infantry regiments, 11 in number, are distinguished by a horse-hair plume to the
                    shako in place of a ball. The “facings” vary with the different regiments, but
                    all “royal” regiments have blue.</p>
                <p>All regiments now carry the valise equipment, substituted for the knapsack in
                    1870. It consists of a black leather bag slung from the shoulders by straps and
                    fitted to lie in the hollow of the back, connected with a waistbelt and
                    ammunition-pouches in such a manner as to distribute the weight evenly over the
                    body, and cause it to hang direct on the shoulders. The greatcoat, when not
                    worn, is strapped above it. The valise holds a spare shirt, pair of boots,
                    socks, cap, towel, and other small articles, and when full weighs about 15 lb;
                    the total weight carried by the soldier, including arms, ammunition, and the
                    clothes he has on, amounts to about 52 lb.</p>
                <p>Each battalion has four hospital orderlies, picked men specially trained to the
                    care of sick and wounded, and relieved from all other duties; and ten pioneers,
                    skilled artificers of various trades, who carry a complete set of carpenters’
                    and other tools, and are employed, sometimes under the quartermaster of the
                    regiment and sometimes under the engineers, in executing repairs and other
                    works.</p>
                <p>The guards and rifle regiments recruit through the country generally: the former
                    maintain a high standard, usually 2 or 3 inches above that of the line; the
                    latter take men of low standard, but require special chest measurement. The
                    other infantry regiments recruit as far as possible within the brigade districts
                    in which the depots are permanently stationed. Of the 141 line battalions, 50
                    are stationed in India, 20 in the colonies and foreign garrisons, and 71 at
                    home; thus allowing one battalion at home and one abroad from each brigade. The
                    chief foreign garrisons are Malta (7 battalions) and. Gibraltar (5 battalions).
                    The largest home stations for infantry are London (for the Guards), Portsmouth,
                    Dublin, Cork, Plymouth, Chatham, Dover, and the camps of Aldershott, Colchester,
                    Shorncliffe, and the Curragh,</p>
                <p>The oldest infantry regiments are the Coldstream Guards (General Monck’s
                    regiment), the 1st “Royal Scots” (originally the “Douglas” regiment), the
                    Grenadier and Scots Fusilier Guards, the 2d “Queen’s” (raised for the defence of
                    Tangier), and the 3d “Buffs” (raised from the London train-bands). These
                    regiments were formed between 1660 and 1662. The principal augmentations madeto
                    the army between this date and the Crimean war have been already detailed.
                    Second battalions were added to the regiments from 1 to 25 in 1857—59, and the
                    100th was raised in Canada in 1858. The nine regiments from 101 to 109 were
                    formed from the European regiments in the service of the East India Company, on
                    the transference of the powers of that company to the Crown.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Reserves and Auxiliary Forces.</hi></p>
                <p>The reserves are divided into classes. The “1st Class Army Reserve” consists—(a)
                    of men who, after a service of not less than three years in the ranks of the
                    army, have been passed into the reserve to complete the unexpired portion of
                    their engagement; and (&amp;) of soldiers who have been discharged by purchase
                    or on completion of limited engagement, and have enrolled themselves for 5
                    years. The men of the 1st class reserve receive 4d. a-day, paid quarterly in
                    advance, and an annual allowance of £ 1 for necessaries. In peace time they may
                    be called out for 12 days’ training annually, or to aid the civil power,
                    receiving daily pay at the rate of 2s. in the first case, and 2s. 6d. in the
                    second. In case of war or national danger, they may be recalled to service by
                    proclamation, and attached to any regiment or corps of their own branch of the
                    service, or formed into separate corps. They then resume their position in all
                    respects as soldiers of the regular army, and are liable for service at home or
                    abroad, and until completion of their term of engagement. The 2d class army
                    reserve consists of enrolled pensioners,—men who have completed their second
                    period of service in the regular army, and been discharged to pension. They
                    receive no bounty, but an annual allowance of £1 for necessaries, and daily pay
                    at the rate of 2s. or 2s. 6d. when called out for training or in aid of the
                    civil power. They are subject to the same regulations as the 1 st class, except
                    that they are only liable for service "within the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>By the Act of 1867, a <hi rend="italic">militia reserve</hi> was created in
                    addition to the above, consisting of men actually serving in the militia who
                    voluntarily enrol in this reserve for a term of six years, during which they
                    remain with their militia regiments in peace time, but in case of war may be
                    drafted into the regular army. They receive an annual bounty of £1 in addition
                    to their militia pay and bounty. Their number is limited to one-fourth of the
                    effective strength of the militia, and in 1873 amounted to 28,286 men.</p>
                <p>The first attempt to organise a reserve of men who had passed through the ranks
                    of the army was made in 1843, when the enrolment of pensioners for home service
                    in special cases was authorised by Parliament. The number was originally limited
                    to 10,000, but afterwards increased to 20,000. In 1859 when the military power
                    and threatening attitude of France caused the alarm in England which led to the
                    volunteer movement, an effort was made to organise a more efficient reserve from
                    men who had taken their discharges on completion of their first period of
                    service, but the inducements offered were insufficient, and the scheme proved a
                    failure. In 1867, after the proved success of the short service aud reserve
                    system in Prussia, a new Reserve Force Act was passed, which, with subsequent
                    modifications, laid the foundation of the present first-class reserve; but it
                    required increased inducements, and the Short Service Act of 1870, to give the
                    reserve any importance. The militia reserve was formed as a temporary expedient,
                    to be reduced as the army reserve increases. It has been objected to on the
                    grounds that it entails increased expense without any real addition to the armed
                    force of the country, as the men are merely passed from one force to another,
                    and that it takes away the best men from the militia at the moment this requires
                    to be most efficient But, in the absence of a sufficient reserve of
                    fully-trained soldiers, a reserve of partly trained men is essential.
                    Practically the militia always has been the feeder of the line in war time, and
                    it was thought better to enrol a number of men in peace time, when they could be
                    selected, and all necessary preparations made for drafting them in at once in
                    war, rather than adhere to the old system of offering high bounties at the last
                    moment, and getting a worse class of men.</p>

                    Kingdom.</hi></p>
                <p>The United Kingdom is divided into 10 military districts, or general officers’
                    commands,—viz., England, 6; Scotland, 1; Ireland, 3.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is exclusive of the four military
                    stations or camps of Alder-shott, Woolwich, Chatham, and the Curragb, to which
                    r.o districts are attached.</p></note> Within the district the general officer’s
                    authority extends over all the military forces— regular, reserve, or auxiliary.
                    These districts, again, are subdivided into 66 infantry brigade or sub-districts
                    under colonels; of these 50 are in England, 8 in Ireland, and 8 in Scotland.
                    Each brigade comprises 2 battalions of the line, a brigade dépôt, 2 militia
                    battalions, and such reserves and volunteers as are included in the
                    sub-district; the average male population of the sub-districts being 200,000.
                    The two line battalions are independent of the colonel of the sub-district. One
                    is always abroad, one at some home station, usually a garrison or camp of
                    instruction. But they draw their recruits and reserves from the sub-district,
                    and supply the officers and non-commissioned officers for the brigade dépôt, and
                    for the staff of the militia and volunteers. The brigade depot is the connecting
                    link between the line battalions and the district. It is permanently established
                    at some principal town in the sub-district, and is formed of two companies from
                    each line battalion, under the command of a major of the home battalions. To it
                    are attached 2 captains (adjutants of militia battalions) and a large staff of
                    noncommissioned officers, who join the militia battalions when embodied, but at
                    other times are employed at the depot in recruiting and drilling recruits. The
                    duties of the colonel of the district include recruiting for the line and
                    militia, the training of recruits and of all reserve and auxiliary forces, the
                    annual inspection of the militia and volunteers, the registry and payment of the
                    army reserve and enrolled, pensioners, and the care of arms and stores of
                    reserve and auxiliary forces.</p>
                <p>For cavalry purposes Great Britain is divided into 2, and for artillery into 12
                    sub-districts, under colonels, whose duties correspond in the main with those of
                    the infantry colonels as regards recruiting and supervising the training of the
                    auxiliary forces of their respective arms, but are more restricted, as they have
                    no dépôts and staff of regulars under their immediate command.</p>
                <p>The colonel of the brigade depot is especially charged with the measures for
                    mobilisation in case of war. On the order being given, the army reserve and
                    militia reserve men are collected at the dépôt, and sent to the home battalion
                    to complete it to war strength. The supernumerary men of the reserve, and all
                    men of the field battalion that are unfit for immediate service, are drafted to
                    the depot, which is increased to the strength of an eight-company battalion, by
                    calling in officers from the half-pay list, and by recruiting. A.t the same
                    time, one, or, if necessary, both militia battalions are embodied. If an
                    expeditionary force is to be despatched, the militia battalions relieve the
                    regular army in all the home garrisons; and probably, as was the case during the
                    Crimean war, in some of the foreign ones also.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Civil Departments of the Army.—Control Department.</hi></p>
                <p>The Control Department was formed in 1869 and 1870 by the amalgamation of the
                    five formerly distinct administrative departments, viz., Commissariat
                    department, Barrack <pb break="no"

                    department, and Military Train. At the head of the Control Department is the
                    Surveyor-General of Ordnance, assisted by a director of supplies and transport,
                    and a director of artillery and stores; the general duties of the department
                    have already been defined in treating of the administration of the army.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the Control Department consists of— (a),
                    administrative officers, named controllers; (δ), executive officers, divided
                    into two sub-departments, and named commissaries and paymasters; (c), the
                    non-commissioned officers and men of the Army Service Corps. The ranks of <hi
                    rend="italic">administrative officers</hi> are—controller, ranking with
                    major-general; deputy-controller, ranking with colonel; and
                    assistant-controller, ranking with lieutenant-colonel. Appointments as
                    assistant-controller are made from commissaries in the supply and transport
                    sub-department, or from combatant officers of the army. In the latter case the
                    officers selected must have five years’ full-pay service, be not under the rank
                    of captain, not over 35 years of age (40, if belonging to the artillery,) and
                    have passed through the Staff College or the advanced class at Woolwich. They
                    serve on probation for two years, at the end of which, if found competent and
                    willing to serve in the Control Department, they resign their military
                    commissions, and receive commissions as assistant-controllers. Artillery
                    officers are generally selected to fill the appointments in the artillery and
                    store branch, but the great majority of appointments are made from the
                    sub-departments, and but few from the combatant ranks of the army. Promotion to
                    the higher grades is by selection, after a service of not less than ten years
                    for the rank of deputy-controller, and thirteen years for that of controller, at
                    least three years having been in the next lower rank. After thirty years’
                    full-pay service, Control officers are entitled to retire; and retirement is
                    compulsory at the age of 60.</p>
                <p>Officers of the Control Department conduct their duties under the direct orders
                    of the officer commanding the district or station, whose advisers and agents
                    they are in all matters connected with the raising or issue of money, the supply
                    of provisions, stores, and transport. They hold a position analogous to that of
                    officers of the general staff, except that they are at the same time directly
                    responsible to the Secretary of State for War for the proper conduct of their
                    duties. Where the orders of the officer commanding appear inconsistent with the
                    War Office instructions, it is the duty of the Control officer to point out the
                    inconsistency, and apply for special authority from the commanding officer,
                    which being granted, must be implicitly obeyed, and relieve the Control officer
                    from the responsibility</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">executive sub-departments</hi> are the supply and transport
                    sub-departments, and the pay sub-department. The ranks in the former
                    are—commissaries, ranking with majors; deputy-commissaries, ranking with
                    captains; and assistant-commissaries, ranking with lieutenants. The ranks are
                    the same in the pay sub-department; but the officers are called paymasters
                    instead of commissaries. First appointments in the supply and transport
                    sub-department are conferred on civilians selected by open competitive
                    examination, or subaltern officers of the army, and on deserving
                    non-commissioned officers; the limit of age is 17 to 20 for civilian candidates,
                    and 22 for subalterns of the army or militia. Retirement may be claimed after
                    thirty years’ service, and is compulsory at the age of 55.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Army Service Corps</hi> consists of 12 transport companies
                    and 11 supply companies, officered from the supply and transport sub-department.
                    The establishment of a supply company is 2 officers, 27 non-commissioned
                    officers, and 97 rank and file; of a transport company, 3 officers, 13
                    non-commissioned officers and 117 rank and file, with 91 horses and 26
                    carriages. In war time these would be largely augmented, according to the
                    requirements of the army and the nature of the service. The supply companies
                    consist of butchers, bakers, issuers, clerks, mechanics and tradesmen of various
                    kinds; the transport companies of drivers, with a proportion of smiths,
                    wheelers, saddlers, farriers, &amp;c. The ranks of the Army Service Corps are
                    filled by volunteers from the army,—men of good character, specially
                    recommended, and of not less than two years’ service,—or by recruits specially
                    enlisted for it under authority from the Secretary for War. The rates of pay are
                    nearly the same as in the cavalry, but the artificers and tradesmen usually earn
                    working pay in addition. The uniform is blue. The supply companies are armed
                    with breech-loading carbines and sword bayonets, the transport companies with
                    cavalry swords.</p>
                <p>The executive duties that devolve on the Control may be classed broadly under
                    four heads—pay, provisions (“<hi rend="italic">munitions</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de bouche”),</hi> stores <hi rend="italic">(“munitions de guerre”),</hi> and
                    transport; and officers of the sub-departments are selected as far as possible
                    for service in the several branches according to their special training. The
                    provision branch is the most important, and occupies the largest number of
                    officers. In peace time the soldier is fed partly by the Control, partly by
                    means of purchases made by himself. He receives a free ration from Government of
                    1 ft of bread and ∣ft of meat, and in addition expends a sum varying from 3∣d.
                    to 6d. a day on groceries, vegetables, &amp;c. Under certain circumstances the
                    Government ration is slightly increased, and in the field it is raised to 1∣ ft
                    bread and 1 lb meat; and rations of groceries, spirits, and vegetables are also
                    provided by the Control, though paid for by the soldier. The forage ration for a
                    horse is 10 lb oats and 12 lb hay, with 2 ft extra oats to horses picketed out,
                    and 2 ft oats and 2 ft hay additional to draught horses doing very heavy work.
                    In peace time the army is supplied by contract, the contractor usually
                    delivering the bread and meat or forage at the Control store, where it is
                    inspected by a board of officers before issue. At some of the large camps and
                    stations, however, ovens and slaughter-houses have been established, at which
                    the bread is baked and the meat killed and prepared for the troops by the men of
                    the Army Service Corps. When troops are encamped on flying columns, or for
                    autumn manoeuvres, iron field-ovens or steam baking waggons are commonly used;
                    the former turning out about 480 ft of bread in a day of 12 hours, the latter
                    about 900 ft. Biscuit and salt meat are largely used abroad and at sea, but not
                    at home. (For the supply of an army in the field, see article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">War.)</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">transport</hi> duties of the army in peace time, when all
                    the civil resources of the country are available, and most articles are
                    delivered at the required point by the contractor, are very slight; but to be
                    efficiently organised for the field, an army requires a vast amount of
                    transport, of which the existing establishment would only suffice to form the
                    nucleus. The British army is differently situated from the great Continental
                    armies in this respect, that its operations extend over the most distant and
                    varied countries, involving the most different conditions; and as the transport
                    service must always be specially organised to suit the peculiar conditions of
                    the theatre of war, it is impossible in peace time to maintain an establishment
                    which shall be equally applicable in all cases. In some countries railways and
                    water transport are largely available, and the duties thrown on the train are
                    comparatively light; in other countries the local resources in carts and
                    waggons, if properly organised, are ample, and a sufficient <hi rend="italic"
                    >cadrei</hi> of officers and superintendents is alone required; in others,
                    again, the local resources are <hi rend="italic">nil,</hi> and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0644-0583"/> the army has to bring with it every man, horse,
                    and waggon of the vast train it requires.</p>
                <p>And the character of the transport varies as widely as the quantity required. In
                    some countries large waggons are most suitable, in others, light carts only can
                    be used; in others, again, recourse must be had to pack animals,— horses, mules,
                    bullocks, camels, and elephants,—or to coolies and native carriers. Evidently no
                    establishment can be framed that shall be equally suitable in all cases. The
                    existing transport, therefore, is based on the requirements of an army operating
                    in a civilised country, with good roads, where the transport can be mainly done
                    by waggons; while for special expeditions, such as those to Abyssinia and
                    Ashantee, special transport is organised. The waggon in common use is the
                    “general service waggon,” a strong four-wheeled (equirotal) waggon, drawn by
                    four horses, weighing 16 cwt., and carrying a load of 30 cwt.</p>
                <p>The transport companies at the disposal of the Control have to carry the
                    equipment and baggage of the staff and departments, to horse and drive the
                    ambulance and field hospital waggons, and, above all, to carry the supplies and
                    reserve stores of the army, the bringing the daily 'supplies to the troops being
                    the duty which taxes them most heavily.</p>
                <p>The charge and issue of warlike stores is a duty of ever-increasing importance
                    and difficulty in these days of scientific warfare. In most armies this duty
                    devolves on the officers of the artillery, whose education specially qualifies
                    them for it, and the question was warmly discussed when the Control Department
                    was formed. It was ultimately decided to unite all supply duties under the
                    Control, providing, however, by an admixture of artillery officers for the
                    necessary scientific knowledge within the department.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the establishment of officers of the Control Department
                    in 1873, with their full pay, and the daily rates of half and retired pay to
                    which they become entitled:—</p>

                <p>The Medical Department comprises 4 ranks of medical officers—viz.,
                    Surgeon-General, Deputy-Surgeon-General, Surgeon-Major, and Surgeon,—and the
                    officers and men of the Army Hospital Corps; the whole being under a
                    director-general at the War Office. The officers of the two higher grades are
                    employed chiefly as administrative officers superintending districts or large
                    hospitals; while the surgeons-major and surgeons are attached to regiments and
                    corps, or employed as executive officers in the hospitals. Every battalion
                    serving at home or in the colonies has one medical officer attached to it; and
                    every battalion in India has one surgeon-major and two surgeons. First
                    appointments in the Army Medical Department are given to candidates who possess
                    two diplomas or licences for medicine and surgery, and, after attending a
                    probationary course at a general military hospital, pass a satisfactory
                    examination in military medicine, surgery, hygiene, and pathology. On
                    appointment as surgeons they rank as lieutenants, and after 6 years’ full-pay
                    service, as captains. Promotion from surgeon to surgeon-major is by seniority,
                    but officers may be specially promoted for distinguished service. Surgeons-major
                    rank as majors on appointment, and after 20 years’ full-pay service (in the two
                    ranks), as lieutenant-colonels. Promotion from surgeon-major to
                    deputy-surgeon-general, and from that to surgeon-general, is by selection of the
                    Commander-in-Chief, with approval of the Secretary for M <hi rend="superscript">

                    file. They are employed entirely on hospital duties, and are under the direction
                    and control of the medical officer of the station, though subject for discipline
                    to the military authority. The officers and non-commissioned officers rank with
                    the corresponding grades in the army, but their authority is confined to their
                    own men and to patients and men attached to military hospitals on duty.
                    Appointments of officers are made from the non-commissioned officers of the
                    corps: the ranks of the corps are filled by volunteers from the army,— men of

                    not over 30 years of age; and by recruits, whose direct enlistment is specially
                    authorised. They are variously employed as clerks, compounders of medicines,
                    cooks, &amp;c., but principally as attendants on the sick in the general

                    under the immediate attendance of their own medical officers and orderlies. The
                    hospital staff consists of the medical officers attached to regiments at the

                    the medical officer of the regiment or corps. When an army is organised for

                    and wounded, with a sufficient staff of medical officers and attendants, and a
                    company of “stretcher bearers,” provided with stretchers; these are charged with
                    the immediate removal of the wounded from the battle-field, their first
                    dressings, and conveyance to the nearest field hospital· The field hospitals are
                    provided with large hospital tents, beds, and all the requirements of an
                    hospital, and a sufficient staff of medical officers and attendants, and either
                    accompany the army in its march, or establish themselves in suitable places in
                    rear. The ambulance waggon commonly used is four-wheeled, weighing 16 cwt.,
                    drawn by two horses, and constructed to carry eight wounded (two lying down and
                    six sitting), besides a water keg, stretchers, and other medical appliances.</p>

                <p>The general health of the army has greatly improved of late. The disasters of the
                    Crimean war first drew attention to the importance of proper sanitary
                    arrangements in the field; but what, perhaps, aroused public attention still
                    more strongly was the report of the Royal Commission of 1858, by which it
                    appeared that the mortality in the army generally was twice as great, and in the
                    foot guards three times as great, a3 in the corresponding classes of the civil
                    population. Since then, improved barracks, better meals, gymnasia,
                    recreation-rooms, and out-of-door amusements provided for the soldier, have
                    reduced the death-rate to one-half; while the Contagious Diseases Act, severely
                    attacked as it has been, has materially lowered the sick-rate at those stations
                    where it is in force. The admissions from causes under its control have, within
                    five years, been reduced to less than a third at some of the large stations;
                    while a comparison of 14 stations at which the Act is in force, with 14 to which
                    it has not been extended, shows 54 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 cases per
                    1000 men at the former, and 113’3 at the latter. The annual death-rate in the
                    army generally averages about 14 per 1000. In 1870 Gibraltar, Malta, and Canada

                <p>The Veterinary Department is charged with the supervision of the sanitary
                    condition of horses, and their treatment when sick; also the selection of such
                    as are proposed to be cast as unfit for the service, and the examination of
                    remounts. The grades are—staff veterinary surgeons, ranking as majors;
                    veterinary surgeons, 1st class ranking as captains, and 2d class ranking as
                    lieutenants; the whole under a principal veterinary surgeon, who ranks as a
                    colonel. Candidates for appointment are required to pass an examination before a
                    board of veterinary surgeons. Veterinary surgeons of the 2d class must have
                    served five years, and passed a further examination, to be promoted to the 1st
                    class; and a service of fifteen years is required for promotion to staff

                    Royal Military College at Sandhurst, which had existed since the beginning of
                    the century. The present building, near Sandhurst, was completed in 1862, and
                    accommodates forty students. The qualifications and manner of admission of
                    students have already been noticed (under “Staff”). The course lasts two years,
                    beginning in February, and with vacations at Christmas and Midsummer. The
                    subjects of instruction are military history and art, fortification, military
                    administration and law, surveying and sketching, reconnaissance, mathematics
                    (including a short course in mechanics and practical astronomy), sciences, and
                    languages; a large part of the course being devoted to out-of-door work and
                    practical instruction in the duties of staff officers in the field. The Staff
                    College is open to officers of all arms of the service, and twenty students are
                    admitted each year. At the end of the first year they are required to pass a
                    qualifying examination; and at the end of the second, the final examination is
                    held, at the close of which the names of the successful candidates are published
                    in general orders, divided into two classes,—“Honours” and “Pass.” Those
                    officers who fail at the qualifying or at the final examination rejoin their
                    regiments at once. The staff of the establishment consists of a commandant and
                    ten professors, of whom four are military, the others civilians.</p>

                    officially recognised by Parliament. This institution was formerly devoted to
                    preparing young gentlemen for commissions in the infantry and cavalry, the ages
                    of admission varying from thirteen to sixteen and eighteen at different periods.
                    Now it is devoted to the instruction of young officers of these arms after they
                    have passed the requisite examination for commissions, and before they are
                    appointed to regiments. The course lasts a year, and the instruction is confined
                    altogether to purely military subjects,—fortification, military sketching,
                    tactics, military law, correspondence, and accounts. At the conclusion of the
                    course the students are required to pass an examination in these subjects, and
                    their commissions are dated according to the result,—those in the first class
                    being antedated two years; those in the second, twelve months; and those in the
                    third dating from day of examination. The present building accommodates about
                    150 students, and it will probably be necessary to increase it considerably. The
                    staff of the establishment consists of a governor, with an assistant and five
                    staff officers (paymaster, surgeon, &lt;tc.), and twelve military professors and
                    instructors. A riding establishment and master are also kept up for the

                    commissions in the artillery and engineers. The course of instruction, which
                    lasts for three years, is mainly scientific and professional, mathematics
                    playing an important part in it. The students are finally classed by the results

                    having the option of appointment to the engineers, and seniority in the army
                    being determined by their position on the list. The present building
                    accommodates about 250 students. The staff consists of a governor, with a
                    secretary and adjutant, a “captain of cadets” and three “lieutenants of cadets”
                    for purposes of discipline, and twenty-one professors and instructors.</p>

                    field fortification, military sketching and reconnaissance, and law. The course
                    of instruction usually lasts four months, during which time the officer is
                    struck off all other duties. At the close of the course an examination is held,
                    and those who pass satisfactorily are certified as qualified for promotion.
                    Garrison instructors hold the rank and receive the staff pay and allowances of
                    brigademajors, and are selected from officers who have passed through the Staff

                    into adult, grown children, infant, and industrial schools. To every regiment
                    are appointed a schoolmaster and schoolmistress, and a certain number of

                    formed for the instruction of non-commissioned officers. Army schoolmasters
                    receive a rate of pay varying, according to service, from 4s. a-day on
                    appointment to a maximum of 7s. a-day, and rank as non-commissioned officers
                    next below the sergeant-major. Candidates are required to go through a course in
                    the training schools of the Royal Military Asylum, Chelsea, admission to which
                    is by competitive examination, open to non-commissioned officers and soldiers of
                    the army (of good character and especially recommended), to civilian pupil
                    teachers, and certificated schoolmasters. Before appointment the candidate must
                    enlist for general service for twelve years.</p>
                <p>Schoolmistresses are classed in three classes, receiving from £30 to £44 yearly.
                    Candidates must be certificated schoolmistresses, or have been employed as
                    teachers in an army school, and in the latter case must pass an examination
                    before appointment. All first appointments are made to the third class, and
                    promotions are made according to merit and services.</p>
                <p>At all important military stations and garrisons large and commodious
                    schoolhouses have been specially built; at smaller stations barrack-rooms are
                    told off and fitted up for the purpose. Schoolmasters and mistresses are
                    permanently attached to regiments, and accompany them from station to station,
                    and the schools are under the immediato and constant supervision of the
                    commanding officer. They are also periodically visited and examined by
                    inspectors, who report to the director-general, for which purpose a staff of one
                    inspector of army schools, two local inspectors (officers of the army, receiving

                    sub-inspectors, are maintained. The improvement that has taken place in the
                    education of the army generally may be gathered from the reports and returns of
                    the director-general, by which it appears that between the years 1858 and 1871
                    the proportion of “uneducated” fell from 40 per cent, to 12 per cent., and that
                    within the last few years the number possessing a superior education has risen
                    from 6 to 32 per cent. And although much of this is doubtless due to the spread
                    of education throughout the country, a comparison of the educational statistics
                    of the recruits with those of the army generally proves that still more is due
                    to the regimental schools.</p>

                    which must not exceed threepence a month for a private soldier. The garrison
                    library forms a central depot from which the recreation-rooms are supplied with
                    books. All the rooms are furnished, warmed, and lighted at the public expense,
                    and the recreation-rooms provided with billiard and bagatelle tables, chess,
                    backgammon, and other games. An annual allowance of <hi rend="italic">£2,</hi>
                    10s. is granted by Government for each troop or company; this, with the
                    subscriptions, forms a fund to defray the cost of purchase and repair of books
                    in garrison libraries, and of games, newspapers, &amp;c., for recreation-rooms.
                    Many recreation-rooms have a refreshment bar attached to them, where the men are
                    supplied with tea, coffee, and other light refreshments at a very low price. A
                    garrison librarian, usually a non-commissioned officer or a pensioner, takes
                    charge of the library, and a regimental librarian has charge of the
                    recreation-rooms. These are managed by a committee composed of non-commissioned
                    officers and privates; and the garrison libraries are managed by a committee
                    consisting of members chosen from the regimental committees, under the approval

                    give officers of the artillery the means of continuing their studies after they
                    have completed the regular course at Woolwich, and of qualifying by a special
                    training for appointments requiring exceptional scientific attainments. The
                    establishment consists of a director, an assistantdirector, and two instructors
                    of artillery, and a number of instructors and lecturers for mathematics,
                    languages, and sciences. Its duties include the instruction of an advanced class
                    of artillery officers, selected by competition, to qualify for scientific
                    appointments; and the formation of classes in topography, astronomy, and
                    languages, open to all officers of the artillery wishing to join them. A <hi

                    artillery, and carrying on all experiments connected with artillery and stores.
                    The present site was selected for the school in consequence of the facilities
                    afforded by the sands at the mouth of the Thames for artillery practice and
                    firing at long ranges. The establishment consists of a commandant and
                    brigade-major, with six instructors for the gunnery department; and two
                    superintendents of experiments. Officers and non-commissioned officers are
                    selected from brigades of artillery to go through a long course of instruction
                    in gunnery, use of military machines, &lt;fcc., and qualify as instructors to
                    brigades and batteries; and squads of officers and men are sent there for

                    qualifying to act as musketry instructors to their regiments, and to secure a
                    uniform system of instruction and practice throughout the army. With this view
                    also, squads of officers and men from all regiments in the service are
                    periodically sent there for a short course. The establishment consists of a
                    commandant, a deputy assistant adjutantgeneral, and five officer instructors.
                    The commandant is also inspector-general of musketry, and exercises a general
                    supervision over the instruction and practice throughout the army; for which
                    purpose periodical reports are made to him from all regiments, and the annual
                    musketry returns are carefully examined by him before being submitted, with his
                    remarks, to the Commander-in-Chief. To secure sufficient attention to this
                    important part of a soldier’s training, musketry instructors are appointed in
                    every regiment; and staff officers, formerly termed district inspectors of
                    musketry, are appointed to the principal districts. Every recruit is required to
                    go through a course of instruction and practice before being dismissed drill,
                    and every trained soldier is put through an annual course, lasting about a
                    fortnight, in which he fires 60 rounds at fixed distances from 150 to 800 yards.
                    Extra pay of Id. a day is given to those men who qualify as “marksmen,” and

                <p>Justice is administered by the commissioned officers of the army: by the
                    commanding officer for minor offences, and by regimental, district, or general
                    courts-martial for more serious crimes. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Military
                    Law.)</hi> The administration of justice as pertaining to <hi rend="italic"
                    >discipline</hi> falls under the Adjutant-General’s branch of the department of
                    the Commander-in-Chief. But to ensure these disciplinary powers being exercised
                    in strict conformity with the law, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Judge-Advocate-General,</hi> a legal adviser to the Crown and to the
                    Com-mander-in-Chief, is appointed by patent. This officer is usually a lawyer of
                    high standing, having a seat in the House of Commons, holding his office as a
                    member of the Government, and quitting office with his party. His department
                    includes a deputy judge-advocate-general, who is also a lawyer and civilian, and
                    three deputy judge-advocates, military officers; of the latter, two are attached
                    to the Judge-Advocate-General’s office in London, and one to the
                    Commander-in-Chief in Ireland. A separate Judge-Advocate’s department is
                    maintained in India, where deputy judge-advocates are appointed to every
                    important command. All general courts-martial held at home are sent to the
                    Judge-Advocate-General, to be by him submitted to the Queen for confirmation;
                    and all district courts-martial, after having been confirmed and promulgated,
                    are sent to his office for examination and custody. The Judge-Advocate-General
                    and his deputy, being judges in the last resort of the validity of the
                    proceedings of courts-martial, take no part in their conduct; but the deputy
                    judge-advocates frame and revise charges, and attend at general
                    courts-martial.</p>
                <p>The punishments that can be awarded to officers and soldiers for various offences
                    are detailed in the Mutiny Act, the Articles of War, and the Queen’s
                    Regulations. A commanding officer can “reprimand” a commissioned officer, but
                    can award him no other punishment. Arrest is not, as in most armies, recognised
                    as a punishment, but is merely a preliminary to further proceedings. An officer,
                    on the commission of an offence, is placed under arrest— that is, deprived of
                    his sword and confined to his room— until the matter has been investigated and
                    disposed of, or sent before a court-martial. A commissioned officer can be tried
                    by a general court-martial only, and can be sentenced to death, penal servitude,
                    imprisonment, cashiering, or dismissal, reduction on list of his rank, or
                    reprimand. A soldier, on commission of an offence, is placed in confinement—that
                    is, deprived of his arms and confined in the guard-room. At “orders” <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> commanding officer’s office hours) the next morning he
                    is brought before the commanding officer, and the case investigated in presence
                    of the officer commanding his troop or company, the adjutant, and the prisoner.
                    If the offence is a minor one the commanding officer disposes of it summarily;
                    his powers including admonition, confinement to barracks for periods not
                    exceeding 28 days, carrying with it punishment drill up to 14 days, imprisonment
                    not exceeding 168 hours, and stoppage of pay for absence. Drunkenness is
                    punished by fines ranging from 2s. 6d. to 10s. If the offence is more serious,
                    the man is remanded to the guardroom while the necessary steps are being taken
                    for bringing him to trial, and is finally tried by a regimental, district, or
                    general court-martial, according to the nature of the offence. The punishments
                    that can be inflicted by court-martial are death, penal servitude for any period
                    not less than five years, imprisonment for any period not exceeding two years,
                    dismissal from the service, stoppages of pay, and forfeitures of pay,
                    medals,service, &amp;c. Flogging has been abolished except on active, service,
                    as also branding, and all such disgraceful punishments. Practically, military
                    offences, with very few exceptions, are disposed of by regimental or district,
                    courts-martial, and by sentences of imprisonment not exceeding six months. A
                    non-commissioned officer can only be reduced and punished by sentence of
                    court-martial.</p>
                <p>Sentences of penal servitude awarded to soldiers are carried out in the convict
                    prisons with other convicts; but sentences of imprisonment are usually carried
                    out in the military prisons. Military prisons were established in 1844, in order
                    to avoid the necessity of mixing soldiers sentenced for military offences with
                    ordinary criminals in county gaols. They are of two classes, the larger ones
                    being under a governor, and the smaller ones under a chief warder. They are
                    under the control of the Secretary of State for War, and under the immediate
                    supervision of the officer commanding on the station (acting as his
                    representative) and of the military visitors,—field officers serving at the
                    station, by whom the prisons are periodically visited, and all serious offences
                    investigated and punished. They are also inspected from time to time by the
                    Government inspectors of convict prisons. There are eight military prisons in
                    the United Kingdom, and six in the colonies; and the number of prisoners has
                    recently averaged about 12 per 1000. Besides these prisons, “provost cells” are
                    provided in every large barrack, in which short sentences of imprisonment not
                    exceeding 28 or 42 days are carried out under the charge of a
                    provost-sergeant.</p>

                <p>In the earlier days of the standing army the barrack accommodation in England was
                    altogether insufficient for the force maintained, and such as there was, was
                    miserably bad. A considerable portion of the army was constantly billeted,
                    camped, or lodged in buildings hired for tho time, and every proposal to build
                    barracks was jealously opposed in Parliament Thus, in 1704 the total
                    accommodation in barracks was only sufficient for 5000 men, and in 1792 did not
                    exceed 20,000; but during the long war with France, partly in consequence of the
                    large force kept permanently under arms, and partly also in consequence of the
                    fears aroused by the revolutionary spirit which had penetrated into many of the
                    large towns, barracks were constructed in all parts of the kingdom, and after
                    the peace the accommodation far exceeded the wants of the army. Many barracks
                    were then dismantled and sold, and others were allowed to fall into disrepair;
                    but little was done towards improving the condition of the existing barracks
                    until the Crimean war brought the army into notice again, and attention was
                    drawn to the heavy rate of mortality among soldiers in peace time, mainly
                    attributable to the defective construction and overcrowding of barracks. New
                    barracks on improved designs were then built, and existing ones altered and
                    reappropriated, so as to allow each man at least 600 cubic feet of air, and, in
                    addition, provide recreation-rooms and other resorts for the soldier during the
                    day.</p>

                    Pecreation-Pooms, Canteens,</hi> &amp;c.—Where no garrison schoolroom exists, a
                    building, 50 feet square, divided into 2 large and 4 small class-rooms for the
                    school. Recreation-rooms—2 rooms, 40 feet × 20 feet, fitted with bar in one
                    room, and bookcases in the other. Canteen—bar, including counter and space in
                    front, 24 feet× 12 feet; sitting-room for men, another for noncommissioned
                    officers, and quarter for canteen sergeant. Skittle-alleys and ball-courts are
                    also usually provided. Where no garrison hospital exists, a complete hospital
                    establishment, including medical officer’s office, surgery, dispensary, and
                    store-rooms, quarters for sergeant and orderlies, cook-house, wash-houses,
                    &amp;c., and wards for 10 per cent, of the force, are included in the barrack.
                    In constructing barrack-rooms the beds are usually, arranged in two rows, with a
                    passage of 5 feet between the beds, and 1 foot between head of bed and wall;
                    giving a width of 20 feet The barrack beds are of iron, made to double in the
                    middle; during the day they are folded back, and the centre of the room thus
                    cleared. Straw mattresses, blankets, and sheets are provided by Government; also
                    forms and tables for day use. The arms are kept in racks by the side of the bed;
                    knapsacks, kit, and accoutrements on shelves and pegs over the bed; 5 feet
                    lineal space and 600 cubic feet are allowed per man. In hospitals 1200 cubic
                    feet are allowed. In cavalry and artillery stables 1500 cubic feet are allowed
                    per horse; the stalls are 5 feet or 5∣ feet by 9 feet, with 12 feet down the
                    centre of a double stable, or 7 feet on each side where the horses stand head to
                    head.</p>
                <p>Since the formation of the Control Department the construction, maintenance, and
                    repair of barracks have devolved on the Royal Engineers; but the charge of them
                    when once finished and handed over, the allotment of quarters, and the supply,
                    maintenance, and repair of all barrack stores and movable furniture, rest with
                    the Control Department. The existing barrack accommodation in the United
                    Kingdom, according to the new appropriation, is sufficient for about 122,000
                    men,—88,000 in Great Britain, and 34,000 in Ireland; and when the works now in
                    progress, or about to be undertaken, are completed, this will be raised to about
                    135,000. Of this, however, about 2 per cent, must be deducted for small detached
                    forts and coast batteries, which cannot be occupied without great inconvenience
                    to the troops so dispersed, and a margin of at least 10 per cent, must be left
                    for barracks and rooms only partially filled, so that the available
                    accommodation will not exceed 120,000.</p>

                <p>The arms issued to the several branches of the service are supplied partly by
                    contract, but mainly by the ordnance manufacturing establishments. The,
                    principal of these is the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich (see article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Arsenal),</hi> divided into the carriage factory, laboratory,
                    gun factory, and experimental branch. From these factories are produced the
                    whole of the guns and gun carriages for naval as well as land service now in
                    use, and the greater proportion of the ammunition and equipment belonging to
                    them. Rifles, sword bayonets, and swords are manufactured at the Royal
                    Small-Arms Factory at Enfield, and gunpowder at the Royal Gunpowder Factory at
                    Waltham Abbey; a considerable quantity of powder, however, is also supplied by
                    contract. The various articles worn and carried by the soldier in the field, or
                    issued to him and under his care, are usually classed under the three heads of
                    arms and accoutrements (or equipment), clothing, and necessaries. Of these, the
                    first are supplied and maintained by Government (though the soldier is held
                    answerable for damage by carelessness or neglect), and under no circumstances
                    become the property of the soldier. The articles included under the second head
                    (clothing) are issued periodically to the soldier, and expected to last a given
                    time; during this time he is required to maintain them at his own cost, but at
                    the expiration of the period, and when replaced by the next issue, they become
                    his property. Lastly, the articles termed necessaries are supplied free to the
                    soldier on first joining, but afterwards have to be replaced and maintained at
                    his own cost. The articles supplied as “clothing” vary slightly in different
                    branches of the service, but usually consist of a tunic, a pair of trousers or
                    overalls, and two pairs of boots annually, and a second pair of trousers
                    biennially. Head-dresses, greatcoats, and leggings are issued at intervals
                    varying from three to ten years, but these articles do not become the property
                    of the soldier when done with. All clothing is supplied from the army clothing
                    depot at Pimlico; a certain amount is manufactured there, but the greater part
                    is obtained by contract, and only examined and stored there. The bulk of the
                    clothing is sent to regiments ready made-up, in sizes according to a size-roll
                    furnished by the regiment; but a certain proportion is sent in material unmade,
                    and an allowance is made to the master tailor of the regiment for making up such
                    articles, and fitting the clothing generally. “Necessaries” include serge frocks
                    or stable jackets, forage caps, shirts, socks, towels, brushes, combs, and other
                    small articles, of which a stock is always kept on hand by tho quartermaster of
                    the regiment, and supplied by him to companies as required. These articles can
                    either be obtained (on payment) from the clothing depot at Pimlico, or purchased
                    independently; but in the latter case the articles must be compared and found
                    equal to the sealed patterns, and the price must not exceed the Government
                    tariff.</p>
                <p>England, from its insular position, has always been a great naval power rather
                    than a military one. On her own element she has for years maintained an empire
                    more undisputed than any power or potentate has ever claimed on land. The rule
                    of Napoleon in the height of his fame was not so haughty and despotic on the
                    Continent as was that of England at sea. Men still living remember the times
                    when the British flag was saluted by every sail that traversed the sea in any
                    quarter of the globe, and no ship, of any nation, dared to pass a British
                    man-of-war without striking its flag. It was to the victories of her navy, and
                    especially to Trafalgar, that England owed her immunity from invasion. It is
                    natural, therefore, that the fame and popularity of the navy should partly have
                    eclipsed the deeds of the army. And yet the British army has a history of which
                    any nation might be proud. If it cannot count such a list of victories as
                    Napoleon emblazoned on the banners of France, neither has it suffered such
                    disasters; and it may lay claim to the longest continuous history of any army in
                    Europe. The French army dates all its traditions from Napoleon’s time; <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0650-0589"/> not a trace remains of the regiments that served
                    under Turenne, and Condé, and Luxemburg in the glorious days of the old
                    monarchy, and even the banner under which they fought is proscribed. The
                    Prussian army was almost unknown until the time of Frederick the Great; and
                    Austrian regiments have been so often changed that it is difficult to trace
                    their antecedents. But many English regiments trace back an unbroken history of
                    more than two centuries, and fought, under the numbers and the names they still
                    retain, with William III. in the Netherlands, and with Marlborough at Blenheim,
                    Ramilies, and Malplaquet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It is greatly to be regretted that, for some unexplained reason, only the
                    battles fought after the middle of the 18th century are borne by regiments on
                    their colours.</p></note> And their traditions are not confined to Europe. India
                    conquered and permanently held; every colony in the world at one time wrested
                    from its owners; the British flag planted on the ramparts of Cabul and Peking;
                    and her arms carried into the fastnesses of Abyssinia and the forests of
                    Ashantee;—such are among the deeds that attest the valour and enterprise of the
                    English army. From time immemorial the inhabitants of the British Islands have
                    been distinguished for a determined bravery and a physical power exceeding that
                    of any other nation.</p>
                <p>Modern peaceful experiences have confirmed the opinion as to the physical
                    superiority of the Briton, and in this respect no rival has yet been found to
                    the highly-fed English navvy. The army is composed of Englishmen, Scotchmen, and
                    Irishmen, in the proportion of about 75 per cent of the first, 10 per cent, of
                    the second, and 15 per cent, of the last. The Englishman generally is above the
                    average of nations in height and physical power. Even when the standard for the
                    army has been at its lowest, it has been several inches above that of
                    Continental armies. His strength lies especially in the upper part of the
                    body—in the chest, shoulders, and arms—and he is ponderous rather than active.
                    His lower limbs are not always proportionately developed, and the Englishman as
                    a rule is not a good marcher, nor is he so hardy as the inhabitants of many
                    other -countries. In temperament he is calm and rather stolid, not easily roused
                    to enthusiasm, and not full of romantic visions of glory, though not so
                    insensible to such emotions as is often believed; slow, somewhat wanting in
                    resource, and apt to grumble and show his discontent under hardships. On the
                    other hand, he has a strong sense of justice, of right, and of duty, which can
                    generally be successfully appealed to. His spirits rise to danger; he can always
                    be depended on for battle; and his courage, if less fiery, is of a more stubborn
                    and enduring kind than that of any other race. The Scotchman is less ponderous
                    in frame, but more sinewy and active,—a better marcher, and more capable of
                    enduring hardships and fatigue; more impetuous in action, though capable of a
                    restrained energy very different from the reckless valour of the Frenchman or
                    Irishman. The Scotch regiments have always been distinguished by a strong
                    national feeling and clanship, producing an <hi rend="italic">esprit de
                    corps</hi> that cannot be surpassed by any <hi rend="italic">corps</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’élite.</hi> The Irishman is active, gay, careless, more ready in
                    resource than the others, and often more reckless in fighting; but, on the other
                    hand, less to be depended upon, and more difficult to hold in the bonds of
                    discipline.</p>
                <p>The English officer is drawn exclusively from the upper classes. His early
                    education, his habits, and his traditions all fit him to be a leader of men. His
                    <hi rend="italic">physique,</hi> his intelligence, and the spirit of enterprise,
                    are developed by those athletic exercises and field sports which distinguish the
                    aristocracy of England. The character which especially distinguishes him is a
                    love of enterprise. Much of his spare time is spent in travelling, or in sports
                    of a more or less dangerous character. Not a war takes place in the most distant
                    and unhealthy colonies, but crowds of volunteers are found for it. There is not
                    a country in the globe but has been explored and traversed by English officers
                    for their amusement, and wherever a war takes place they flock to it. Not so
                    devoted, perhaps, as the officers of some nations to the details of their
                    profession, they yet carry out all that is required of them with rigorous
                    exactitude and a high sense of duty. But it is in the field, and when thrown on
                    their own resources, that they show to most advantage. Trained by our Indian
                    empire and colonial possessions to the life of a conquering nation, command
                    comes natural to them; and the youngest subaltern, suddenly called to a position
                    of responsibility, raises armies and carries on wars, and dominates all around
                    him by his daring and energy. The histories of Clive, Sir Herbert Edwardes, and
                    others, repeat themselves on a smaller scale whenever the occasion offers.</p>
                <p>The social life of the English officer is unlike that of any other army. Off
                    duty, the gradations of rank almost disappear, and all meet on a footing of
                    equality as gentlemen. Our mess system, envied and copied by foreign nations, is
                    only possible where such freedom exists. The officers live together, dine at a
                    table always handsomely furnished, and often rich with trophies and records of
                    the old history of the regiment, at which the president, perhaps the junior
                    officer, is for the time superior; and wherever stationed, and under all
                    conditions, retain the forms of high-bred society. The discipline of the English
                    army, once proverbial for cruelty and harshness, is now the very reverse, and
                    there is perhaps no army in which officers and men stand together on a more
                    pleasant footing.</p>
                <p>Of the character of the English army in war it is almost unnecessary to speak; it
                    has written itself, in history in a series of battles, often won against heavy
                    odds, from Crecy, Poictiers, and Agincourt, to Waterloo. The highest eulogiums
                    passed on it have been wrung from its adversaries. “L’infanterie Anglaise est la
                    meilleur du monde; heureusement il n’y en a pas beaucoup,” was Bugeaud’s
                    comment. “Le soldat Anglais,” says General Foy, “possède la qualité la plus
                    precieuse dans la guerre, le calme dans la colère.” Readers of military history
                    will remember Napier’s vivid picture of the assault of Badajoz, when the troops,
                    unable to advance, and yet scorning to retire, remained in the ditches to be
                    shot down by the garrison. And our account may well close with Foy’s description
                    of the British infantry at waterloo :—“La mort était devant eux, la honte
                    derrière. En cette terrible occurrence les boulets de la Garde Imperiale et la
                    cavalerie de France victorieuse ne purent pas entamer l’immobile infanterie
                    britannique. On eut été tenté de croire qu’elle avait pris racine dans la terre,
                    si ses bataillons ne se fussent ébranlés majestueusement quelques minutes après

                    ><p>An anecdote of the Indian mutiny, peculiarly characteristic of officers and
                    soldiers, may serve as a pendant to the opinion given above. A detachment was
                    holding an advanced post against the attacks of a vastly superior force. The
                    enemy gradually enveloped the post, and threatened to cut the retreat of its
                    defenders; but the defence was maintained unjshaken. At last an Irishman, with
                    more military instincts, perhaps, than the rest, exclaimed, “Och, captain,
                    captain, we’re surrounded!” The officer’s reply came sharp and stem. “What the
                    devil’s that to you, sir; look to your front and the defence was
                    continued.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">Indian Army.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of the armies of India is the history of our Indian empire, and as

                <p>For military purposes India is divided into three great sections—Bengal, Madras,
                    and Bombay. Under the term Bengal must be included Bengal proper, Assam, the
                    North-West Provinces, Oudh, and the Punjab; under Madras, Burmah; and under
                    Bombay, the province of Sindh. The army of India has always consisted of three
                    native armies, corresponding to the three presidencies, each associated with a
                    certain number of British troops, Europeans in the service of the late East
                    India Company, and forces furnished by the Imperial Government. This separation
                    into three distinct armies was the natural result of the original foundation of
                    separate settlements and factories in India; and each retains to the present day
                    its own separate history and traditions.</p>
                <p>Half a century after the establishment of the associations of merchant
                    adventurers, whose first charter bears date 1600, the English traders in Bengal
                    were still restricted by the native princes to a military establishment, as
                    guard, of an ensign and 30 men; and this Liliputian force may be taken as the
                    germ of the splendid army which now occupies India from Peshawur to Calcutta. In
                    1681 Bengal received the first reinforcement from Madras, in the shape of a
                    “corporal of approved fidelity and courage, with 20 soldiers;” and two years
                    later a company was sent from Fort St George (Madras), raising the little Bengal
                    army to a strength of 250 Europeans. In 1695 native soldiere were first
                    enlisted. The English had by this time moved to Calcutta, and there entrenched
                    themselves; and in the years 1701-2, the garrison of that now flourishing
                    capital consisted of 120 soldiers and seamen gunners. In 1756 Fort William was
                    captured by Surajah Dowlah, and the terrible tragedy of the Black Hole of
                    Calcutta was enacted; but vengeance followed promptly. An expedition was at once
                    despatched from Madras, and on the 23d June 1757 the battle of Plassey
                    established the British supremacy in Bengal. The little force, not exceeding
                    3000 men, with which Clive gained this astonishing victory, was formed mainly of
                    Madras troops, and the 39th regiment, recently despatched from England,—the
                    first royal regiment sent to India, and which now bears the motto, “Primus in
                    Indis.” The Bengal army was represented by a few hundred men only; but from this
                    date the military power and conquests of the Company rapidly increased. A
                    company of artillery already had been organised in 1748; and in 1757, shortly
                    before the battle of Plassey, the 1st regiment of Bengal native infantry was
                    raised. In 1759 the native infantry had been augmented to 5 battalions; in the
                    following year 3 troops of dragoons were raised; and in 1763 the total forces
                    amounted to 1500 Europeans and 12 battalions of native infantry, giving a
                    strength of 11,500 men. In 1765 the army was further increased; the European
                    infantry was divided into 3 regiments, and the whole force was organised in 3
                    brigades, each consisting of 1 company of artillery, 1 regiment European
                    infantry, 1 troop of native cavalry, and 7 battalions of Sepoys. In 1766,
                    consequent on the reduction of some money allowances, a dangerous combination of
                    the officers of the Bengal army took place, by which they agreed to resign their
                    commissions simultaneously. This combination was promptly put down by the then
                    Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Lord Clive, to whom the Bengal army may be said
                    to owe its existence. He found Bengal a ruined commercial agency in 1756; he
                    left it, ten years after, a powerful empire.</p>
                <p>The constant wars and extensions of dominion which took place during the next
                    thirty years led to further augmentation of the army; the number of brigades and
                    of European regiments was increased to 6; and in 1794 the Bengal army numbered
                    about 3500 Europeans and 24,000 natives.</p>
                <p>The first armed force in the Madras Presidency was the little garrison of
                    Armegon, on the Coromandel coast, consisting of 12 guns and 28 soldiers. In 1644
                    Fort St George w as built and garrisoned by 100 soldiers, and in 1653 Madras
                    became a presidency. In 1745, when Fort St George was surrendered to the French,
                    its garrison consisted of 200 Europeans, while a similar number, with the
                    addition of 200 “Topasses” (descendants of the Portuguese), garrisoned Fort St
                    David. In 1748 the various independent companies of factory guards at
                    settlements on the Coromandel coast and other places were consolidated into the
                    Madras European regiment. In the following year, Clive, with only 200 soldiers
                    and 300 Sepoys, seized and held Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, and on three
                    several occasions defeated the troops of the Nabob and their French auxiliaries.
                    From this year the military power of Madras may be dated. In 1754 the first
                    royal regiment, the 39th, was sent there, followed in 1758 by three others. In
                    1772 the Madras army numbered 3000 European infantry and 16,000 natives, and in
                    1784 the number of native troops had risen to 34,000.</p>
                <p>The island of Bombay formed part of the marriage portion received by Charles II.
                    with the Infanta of Portugal, and in 1662 the Bombay regiment of Europeans was
                    raised to defend it. In 1668 the island was granted to the East India Company,
                    and the regiment at the same time transferred to them. In 1708 Bombay became a
                    presidency, but it did not play so important a part as the others in the early
                    extension of our power in India, and its forces were not so rapidly developed.
                    It is said, however, to have been the first presidency to discipline native
                    troops, and Bombay Sepoys were sent to Madras in 1747, and took part in the
                    battle of Plassey in 1757. In 1772 the Bombay army consisted of 2500 Europeans
                    and 3500 Sepoys, but in 1794, in consequence of the struggles with the Mahratta
                    power, the native troops had been increased to 24,000.</p>
                <p>In 1796 a general reorganisation of the Indian armies took place. Hitherto the
                    officers in each presidency had been borne on general “lists,” according to the
                    branches of the service to which they belonged. These lists were now broken up,
                    and cadres of regiments formed. The colonels and lieutenant-colonels remained on
                    separate lists, and an establishment of general officers was created, while the
                    divisional commands were distributed between the royal and Company’s officers.
                    Further augmentations took place, consequent on the great extension of territory
                    and the complete assertion of British supremacy. In 1798, at the outbreak of the
                    war with Tippoo Saib, the native infantry in India had been increased to 122
                    battalions; and the force which General Harris took from Madras for the attack
                    on Seringapatam consisted of 5000 Europeans, 14,000 native troops, 40 siege
                    guns, 64 field guns, and the Nizam’s contingent, numbering 6000 men. In 1808 the
                    total force in India amounted to 24,500 Europeans and 154,500 natives.</p>
                <p>The first half of the 19th century was a history of wars and annexations, and
                    further augmentations of the army took place. Horse artillery was formed, and
                    the artillery service increased to a most powerful footing. “Irregular cavalry”
                    were raised in Bengal and Bombay, commanded by picked officers, and recruited
                    from a better class of troopers, who received high pay, on the condition of
                    finding their own horses and equipment. “Local forces” were raised in various
                    parts from time to time, the most important being the Punj&lt;4b irregular force
                    (raised after the annexation of the Punjab in 1849), consisting of 3 field
                    batteries, 5 regiments of cavalry, and 5 of infantry, and the Nagpore and Oudh
                    irregular forces. Another kind of military force, which had been gradually
                    formed, was that called “contingents,”—native troops raised by the native <pb

                    these was that of Hyderabad, originally known a⅛ the Nizam’s army, and
                    consisting of two brigades of infantry and cavalry, with artillery. Changes were
                    also made in the organisation of the army. The staff was enlarged, sanitary
                    improvementseffected, manufacturing establishments instituted or increased, and
                    the administration of the army generally improved.</p>
                <p>The officering and recruiting of the three armies was in all essentials similar.
                    The officers were mainly supplied by the Company’s Military College at
                    Addiscombe (established in 1809), and by direct appointments under the patronage
                    of the directors. The Bengal army was recruited from Hindustan, the infantry
                    being mostly drawn from Oudh and the great Gangetic plains. The soldiers were
                    chiefly high-caste Hindus, a sixth being Mahometans. The cavalry was composed
                    mainly of Mahometans, recruited from Rohilcund and the Gangetic Doab. The only
                    other elements in the army were the four Ghoorka regiments, enlisted from
                    Nepaul, and the local Punjâb irregular force. The Madras army was chiefly
                    recruited from that presidency, or the native states connected with it, and
                    consisted of Mahometans, Brahmins, Mahrattas, Telingas or Gentoos, and Tamils.
                    The Bombay army was recruited from its own presidency, with some Hindustanis,
                    but chiefly formed of Mahrattas and Mahometans; the Bombay light cavalry mainly
                    from Hindustan proper.</p>
                <p>In the year preceding the great mutiny the Indian army had reached its highest
                    strength. The establishment in the several presidencies was as follows :—</p>

                <p>Including the local and irregular troops (about 100,000 strong), the total
                    strength amounted to 38,000 Europeans of all arms, with 276 field guns, and
                    348,000 native troops, with 248 field guns,—truly a magnificent establishment,
                    and, outwardly, worthy of the great empire which England had created for herself
                    in the East, but inwardly unsound, and on the very eve of crumbling to
                    pieces.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible, within the limits of a short article, to do more than
                    briefly summarise the causes which led to the great Sepoy mutiny of 1857. For
                    many years the discipline of the Bengal army had been relaxed. The system under
                    which the ablest regimental officers were withdrawn to staff and civil employ
                    was incompatible with efficiency, the centralisation of the army administration
                    was excessive, and the powers of commanding officers had greatly diminished. The
                    supposed wrongs of Oudh stirred up the soldiers so largely recruited from that
                    province, and the religious prejudices of those otherwise well disposed were
                    inflamed by the secret emissaries of the disaffected. The Sepoys were told that
                    the Government wished to force them to break their caste and abjure their
                    religion, that they were to be sent across the sea to die in foreign and
                    detested lands, or to be sacrificed on their own shores. Even the ridiculous
                    endeavour to assimilate native to British soldiers in outward appearance was
                    turned to account by these emissaries. The “greased cartridges” were but the
                    spark which set the whole aflame. The miserable delusions spread, the
                    loyally-disposed east in their lot with the disaffected, feeling that when once
                    a mutinous spirit had been shown all was lost to them as a military body, and
                    the Bengal native army was in a short space of time only a chaotic mass of
                    disbanded and mutinous soldiers. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The story of the
                    rebellion is the history of those days, and cannot be treated in this place.
                    Fortunately for our power in India, the mutiny did not spread to the Madras or
                    Bombay armies; and in the darkest days our ancient enemies the Sikhs not only
                    remained faithful, but came forward to render us powerful assistance.</p>
                <p>By the autumn of 1858 the mutiny was virtually crushed, and the task of
                    reorganisation commenced. On the 1st September 1858 the East India Company
                    ceased to rule our Indian empire, and Her Majesty’s Government took up the reins
                    of power. On the important question of the reorganisation of the Indian army the
                    opinions and advice of the most distinguished soldiers and civilians were
                    invited. Masses of reports and evidence were collected in India, and by a royal
                    commission in England. On the report of this commission the new system was
                    based. They recommended the abolition of a local European army, and the
                    amalgamation of the existing one with the royal army; that the native army
                    should be enlisted for general service, and be of mixed nationabties and castes,
                    .that the irregular system should mainly obtain in the native cavalry; and that
                    the native infantry should be mainly regular.</p>
                <p>The European force was permanently increased, while the native army was largely
                    reduced. The Indian artilleries were transferred to the Royal Artillery, the
                    Company’s European cavalry became the 19th, 20th, and 21st Hussars, and their
                    European infantry became regiments of the line, numbered 101 to 109. The
                    transference of the Company’s Europeans to the Crown was not unattended with
                    trouble. The men considered that faith had not been kept with them, and a
                    mutinous spirit was shown. Ultimately they were offered their discharge, which a
                    large number accepted.</p>
                <p>The European officers of the native armies, and those officers and men who did
                    not accept service in the new royal regiments, now formed with the native
                    soldiers the new Indian army. The reorganisation of this by the Indian
                    Government was a task of no ordinary difficulty, involving much besides
                    reconstruction. Many of the levies hastily raised during the mutiny had to be
                    disbanded, or formed into line regiments, and various miscellaneous corps had to
                    be got rid of. The Government was further hampered by the necessity for
                    providing for the large number of officers whose regiments no longer existed. In
                    1861 a “staff corps” was formed in each presidency, “to supply a body of
                    officers for service in India, by whom various offices and appointments,
                    hitherto held by officers borne on the strength of the several corps of the
                    Indian forces, shall in future be held.” Promotion in this corps was to be by
                    length of service,—twelve years to attain the rank of captain, twenty years that
                    of major, and twenty-six years that of lieutenant-colonel. The staff corps was
                    filled up by a large number of Indian and British officers holding various staff
                    employments (the new regimental employments being counted as staff duty), and
                    all kinds of civil posts and situations, and has been gradually opened wider,
                    till it includes the great majority of the Indian officers. The new organisation
                    of the cavalry and infantry of the Indian army was promulgated in 1863, but did
                    not take effect in Bombay and Madras till 1864 and 1865. Cavalry regiments are
                    on the “silladar” or irregular system; their establishment consists of 1
                    commandant, 1 second in command (also commanding a squadron), 2 squadron
                    officers, 1 adjutant, 2 doing duty officers (Europeans), and 13 native officers,
                    444 non-commissioned officers and troopers, or “sowars.” The infantry battalions
                    have each 1 commandant, 2 wing commandants, 1 adjutant, 1 quarter-</p>

                    natives of all ranks.</p>
                <p>The total strength of the army of India in 1873 was 6162 European officers,
                    60,174 European non-commissioned officers and men, and 123,671 natives. The
                    supreme military power is the Viceroy and Governor-General in council. The
                    military member of that council is <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> War Minister,
                    and the military department of the Government of India the War Department. The
                    Commander-in-Chief of the army is the executive military power, and the
                    responsible adviser of Government, as well as local Com-mander-in-Chief in
                    Bengal. The Madras and Bombay Presidencies have military departments and local
                    Com-manders-in-chief, but subordinate to the supreme Government of India; each
                    presidency, however, has certain local peculiarities in its own military system
                    and its own army departments. The army departments are the commissariat (charged
                    with the supply of provisions, forage, fuel, light, and transport), the ordnance
                    department (charged with the custody and supply of all warlike stores), the
                    clothing department, medical department, stud department, &amp;c. The
                    commissariat is officered from the combatant ranks of the army, the subordinates
                    being also drawn permanently from its ranks, and is a most excellent and
                    powerful department. The ordnance department is officered from officers of the
                    Royal Artillery, who, as “commissaries of ordnance,” have charge of the various
                    arsenals and magazines in the country. The whole of British India is divided
                    into divisions and districts, and the command is exercised by royal or Indian
                    officers according to a proportion fixed. The staff is selected from the
                    officers of the British corps in India, the staff corps, and the Indian army,
                    and the system is similar to that in England and the colonies, except that the
                    tenure of brigade majorships is limited to three years.</p>

                <p>The Punjâb field force of 4 batteries of artillery, 5 regiments cavalry, 4
                    regiments Sikh infantιy, and 6 regiments Punjâb infantry, is included in the
                    Bengal army. The “Hyderabad contingent,” of 4 field batteries, 4 cavalry and 6
                    infantry regiments; the “Mysore” troops, of 6 regiments of cavalry and 4 of
                    infantry; the “Nair brigade,” of 2 battalions of infantry and four guns; and
                    other minor local forces and contingents, are not included in the above.</p>
                <p>The Bengal army is composed chiefly of Mahometans, Brahmins and other Hindu
                    castes, Rajpoots, Jâts, Pun-jâbees, natives of Trans-Indus, and hill-men. Some
                    are regiments entirely of one race, as the Ghoorkas, while others are mixed
                    entirely or by companies; but the composition of every regiment has been
                    definitively laid down. There are no special restrictions on caste or race, but
                    care is taken to prevent an undue preponderance of any class. Enlistment is
                    purely voluntary. Recruiting is carried on by parties detached, or by
                    non-commissioned officers and men on furlough. Pay and pension are fairly good,
                    though depreciated by the general rise in prices; pension being obtainable by
                    men invalided after fifteen years’ service. The native officers are appointed
                    from the noncommissioned officers, and though a respectable body of men, are not
                    sufficiently educated. It is, however, contemplated to give natives of rank and
                    position direct commissions. The British officers of the Indian army, generally,
                    are obtained through the medium of the staff corps, which is filled by
                    volunteers from the British army, and now supplies the native armies of India
                    with regimental officers.</p>
                <p>The Madras native army is composed of a few Christians, Mahometans, and
                    Mahrattas, and a large number of Telingas or Gentoos, and Tamils. The infantry
                    battalions are organised as in the Bengal army. The cavalry are mostly composed
                    of Arcot Mussulmans, descendants of the soldiers of the Nawab of the Carnatic.
                    This cavalry is not “silladar,” as in Bengal or Bombay, and the native
                    establishment is weaker, consisting of 12 native officers, 75 non-commissioned
                    officers, and 300 privates. The army is recruited as in Bengal, but has a
                    peculiar institution of its own, viz., the “recruit and pension boys” (sons of
                    soldiers or pensioners) attached to each regiment, and transferred to the ranks
                    when of sufficient age and approved of,—a valuable institution, and one which
                    gives a powerful hold upon the fidelity of the men.</p>
                <p>The Bombay army resembles that of Bengal in recruiting, organisation, and
                    equipment. It is composed of a few Christians, some Brahmins and Rajpoots, and
                    other Hindu castes, but mainly of Mahrattas and Purwarees, with a few Punjâbees
                    and natives of Trans-Indus. &lt;</p>
                <p>It is difficult to draw comparisons between the soldiers of our Indian forces,
                    recruited from so many different parts of the empire. The most warlike,
                    undoubtedly, are the inhabitants of Scinde, the Punjâb, and Trans-Indus. Perhaps
                    next come the men of Rohilcund, Rajpootana, Oudh, and the Mahrattas. These races
                    possess a greater aptitude for military training, and are generally of a better
                    physique than the inhabitants of the Southern Peninsula. But it is too much to
                    affirm that the former are “born soldiers,” the latter only “soldiers by
                    education.” The ploughshare has already replaced the sword in many parts, and
                    more and more are once turbulent tribes becoming peaceful tillers of the soil.
                    Of the actual value of native troops it is still more difficult to form a true
                    estimate. The Sikhs, both as friends and foes, have proved themselves gallant
                    soldiers, not unworthy of being matched with Europeans. The ordinary Sepoy,
                    under the guidance of British officers, has furnished many examples of heroism
                    and devotion. It is said that a Bengal regiment successfully stood the brunt of
                    a charge from the French at the battle of Porto Novo in 1782; and the devotion
                    of Clive’s Sepoys at Arcot has passed into a proverb. At the siege of Dehli in
                    1857, native regiments sustained losses which few European troops could have
                    borne, and crowds of men in hospital, with wounds only part healed, volunteered
                    to join in the final assault. But without their English officers they are of
                    little value; the Asiatic, as a rules, cannot face the European, and it would be

                    They are usefid auxiliaries, and relieve the European soldier of much of the
                    fatigue inseparable from the task of garrisoning so large an empire and
                    protecting its frontiers. But the mutiny proved the danger of relying on them,
                    and taught the lesson, never, it is to be hoped, to be forgotten, that our
                    Indian empire must be held, not by native armies, but by British armies.</p>
                <p>Many important changes and improvements have taken place since the great
                    reorganisation of the Indian armies was commenced in 1858. The education of the
                    whole army has been improved; musketry, gymnastic, and garrison instruction has
                    been introduced; and strict tests are now required of candidates for the staff,
                    and for promotion in all grades. Annual camps of exercise have been instituted,
                    where large bodies of troops are massed, and opportunities for higher tactical
                    training afforded. The commissariat department has been enlarged, the military
                    account department remodelled, the <hi rend="italic">matériel</hi> of war and
                    its manufacture vastly improved. The new Bystem of reliefs of British troops has
                    greatly shortened the tour of Indian service, splendid barracks have been built,
                    hill sanitariums extended, so that about 10,000 British troops are now located
                    in the hills during the hot weather; by these means, and a liberal expenditure
                    on sanitary requirements, the deathrate among European troops has been reduced
                    to one-half. Other great questions still remain to be dealt with. The local
                    peculiarities of the presidencies seem likely to give way before the increasing
                    intercommunication throughout India. The staff corps was an expedient, and
                    answered its purpose for the time as such, but experience has shown defects in.
                    its constitution. The officering of the native regiments will always remain a
                    subject for careful and anxious consideration. The British rule in India may
                    never again be put to such a severe test as that of 1857, but a wise government
                    will not the less prepare for a day of danger which may yet come for our Indian
                    empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Canadian Militia.</hi></p>
                <p>To complete the account of the military forces of the British empire some notice
                    of the Canadian militia is necessary. Until recently Canada was one of the great
                    military out-stations of the English army, and was garrisoned by a considerable
                    force of British troops distributed throughout the Dominion. Recently these
                    troops were gradually withdrawn, and the colony left to its own resources; and
                    since 1871 the regular forces maintained in the Dominion have been reduced to
                    the 2000 men forming the garrison of Halifax, which alone is still occupied as
                    an imperial station. The defence of Canada is provided for by a large volunteer
                    and militia force. By an Act passed in March 1868, all male inhabitants between
                    the ages of 18 and 60 are liable to serve in the militia, exemptions being
                    granted to judges, ministers of religion, professors, and a few others. The men
                    thus liable are divided into four classes, denoting the order in which they
                    would be called out for service—the first including all single men between the
                    ages of 18 and 30; the second, single men between 30 and 45; the third, married
                    men, or widowers with children, between 18 and 45; the fourth, all between 45
                    and 60. The militia is divided into an active and a reserve force. The active
                    force includes the volunteers, and the regular and the marine militia. Its
                    strength is fixed at 45,000* divided among the various districts in proportion
                    to their population. The contingent must be furnished either by volunteers, or,
                    if sufficient volunteers do not present themselves, by means of the ballot.</p>
                <p>Service in volunteer corps lasts for three years, and in the regular militia for
                    two years; the periods of training last from eight to sixteen days annually.
                    Money is granted for this purpose by Government; and every year camps of
                    instruction are formed in each of the eleven military districts into which
                    Canada is divided, at which the militia of the district are assembled and
                    trained. Two schools of military instruction for infantry officers are
                    established in each of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and one in each of
                    the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. There are also two schools of
                    gunnery, which have permanent batteries of artillery, at Kingston and Quebec.
                    The infantry are armed with long Snider rifles, the cavalry with Spencer
                    carbines and swords. The field artillery includes nine batteries, all. well
                    horsed. The “reserve militia” number 656,066 men, but have not hitherto been
                    organised or drilled. The command of the whole force is vested in Her Majesty,
                    who may call it to arms, wholly or in part, whenever necessary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">German Army.</hi></p>
                <p>By the “constitution of the German empire,” bearing date the 16th April 187⅛ the
                    land forces of all the states of Germany form a united army under the command of
                    the emperor. The German army thus includes the contingents of Prussia, Bavaria,
                    Saxony, Wiirtemberg, Baden, and a number of minor states, all raised and
                    organised (with insignificant variations) on the Prussian model. The peace
                    strength of the army is fixed at 401,659 men, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> or
                    about 1 per cent, of the population; and the budget is established on the basis
                    of 257 thalers, or £38, 11s. per soldier present with the colours. The army is
                    organised in 18 army corps, of which 14 are furnished by Prussia and the states
                    whose contingents are amalgamated with hers, 2 by Bavaria, 1 by Sax⅛ny, and 1 by
                    Wiirtemberg. As the Prussian army thus constitutes three-fourths of the military
                    forces of the empire, and is the model on which not only the other contingents,
                    but to a certain extent the armies of most European powers, have been formed, a
                    detailed account of its organisation will serve as an introduction to the
                    necessarily brief notices of the other armies of Europe.</p>
                <p>The Prussian army, like the monarchy, is of comparatively recent origin. Its
                    European reputation dates from the wars of Frederick the Great, but it was his
                    father, Frederick William I., aided by Prince Maurice of Dessau, who really
                    created the army which Frederick II. led to victory, and which numbered 70,000
                    men, admirably trained and equipped, when the latter ascended the throne.</p>
                <p>The infantry had been especially perfected by Prince Maurice; and under
                    Frederick’s care the cavalry soon rivalled, if it did not excel it. The gallant
                    struggle against overwhelming odds, and the series of brilliant victories which
                    marked the Seven Years’ War, raised the reputation of the army to the highest
                    pitch; and the superb force of 200,000 men which he bequeathed to his successor
                    was justly accounted the best in Europe. It was hardly, however, a national
                    army, and its excellence was owing rather to Frederick’s genius, and to his
                    system of discipline and instruction, than to the goodness of the material. The
                    cavalry, it is true, and the hussars especially, were recruited almost entirely
                    from the Prussian states, and from the sons of the small farmers or better class
                    peasants; but the infantry was raised from all sources, and was largely composed
                    of foreigners, deserters, and vagabonds of all kinds. With Frederick’s death,
                    the genius which had animated it, and which alone gave value to such
                    heterogeneous materials, was gone. It still retained its imposing appearance and
                    precision of movement, and its overweening self-confidence. But at the first

                <p>felito pieces; and after a series of crushing defeats, Prussia found herself at
                    the feet of the conqueror, shorn of half her territory, obliged to receive
                    French troops in all her towns and fortresses, and only existing as it were by
                    sufferance. But in these very disasters were laid the seeds of her future
                    greatness. By the treaty of Tilsit the Prussian army was limited to 43,000 men.
                    ' This limitation suggested to Scharnhorst what was known as the “krumper,” or
                    “shortservice” system already described. The bitter humiliation and suffering
                    endured under the French yoke aroused a national spirit which was capable of any
                    sacrifices. Every Prussian was eager to be trained to fight against the
                    oppressor of his country; and when Prussia rose in 1813, the armies she poured
                    into the field were no longer mercenaries, but national armies, imperfectly
                    trained and organised it is true, but animated by a spirit which more than
                    compensated for these defects. At the close of the war her rulers, with
                    far-seeing sagacity, at once devoted themselves to organise on a permanent
                    footing the system which had sprung up under the necessities and enthusiasm of
                    the moment. The conscription, compulsory personal service, and a three years’
                    term in the ranks, with further periods in the reserve and landwehr, were then
                    introduced^ and though variations have subsequently been made in the
                    distribution of time, the principles were substantially the same as those now in
                    force. By the law of 1814 the periods of service were fixed at three years in
                    the army, two in the reserve, and fourteen in the landwehr, and the annual
                    contingent at 40,000 men. As the population increased, it was felt that the
                    service was unequally distributed, pressing unnecessarily heavily on some, while
                    others escaped altogether. Further, the experiences of 1859, when Prussia armed
                    in anticipation of a war with France, aroused great doubts as to the efficiency
                    of the landwehr, which then formed the bulk of Prussia’s forces, and of whom
                    many had been as long as ten years away from the colours. Accordingly, by the
                    law of 1860 the annual contingent was fixed at 63,000, the period in the reserve
                    was increased from two to four years, and that in the landwehr reduced from
                    fourteen to five. The total armed force thus remained nearly the same (12
                    contingents of 63,000, in place of 19 of 40,000), but the army and its reserves
                    were more than doubled (increased from 5 × 40,000 to 7 × 63,000) while the
                    landwehr was proportionately reduced.</p>
                <p>This change was not effected without great opposition, and led to a prolonged
                    struggle between the king, guided by his able and ambitious minister Bismarck,
                    and the parliament; for some time the king ruled and levied taxes in open
                    defiance of parliament and the constitution; and it required the brilliant
                    successes of 1866, and the position thereby won for Prussia, to reconcile the
                    nation to the new law.</p>
                <p>By the present “military law of the German empire,” every German is liable to
                    service <hi rend="italic">{wehrpflichtig'),</hi> and must render such service
                    personally. Neither substitutes nor purchase of exemption are allowed; and those
                    who are physically unfit for the ranks may .be required to render such other
                    services—as hospital attendants, tradesmen, &amp;c.—as they are capable of.
                    Every German capable of bearing arms belongs to the army for· seven years,
                    commencing at the age of 21, and afterwards to the landwehr for five years. Army
                    service is divided between the ranks and the reserve, three years being spent in
                    the former and four in the latter. The annual contingent of recruits is not now
                    permanently· fixed, but is determined by the number required to keep up the
                    peace establishment, and is estimated at from 120,000 to 130,000 annually. By
                    fixing the total peace establishment instead of the annual contingent, the
                    authorities have gained the power of largely augmenting the army without raising
                    the budget or attracting public attention, as by passing men into the reserve
                    before their time they can always increase the contingent required to complete
                    the regiments, and thus the total number of trained men available in war. Thus,
                    before the war of 1870, commanding officers of regiments were directed to send
                    home a certain number of the most intelligent men after two years’ service; and
                    since the war a large proportion of the infantry have been subjected to two
                    years’ training only. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>The military organisation of Germany is based on the territorial divisions of the
                    empire. With the exception of the Prussian guard corps, which is recruited
                    generally throughout the kingdom, each army corps has a corps district <hi
                    rend="italic">{Bezirk)</hi> within which it is raised, recruited, and stationed.
                    The first six army corps districts correspond to the six provinces of old
                    Prussia, the 7th and 8th to the Rhenish provinces. The 9th, 10th, and 11th were
                    formed from Hanover, Schleswig-Holstein, and the minor states annexed by Prussia
                    in 1866; the 12th by the kingdom of Saxony, the 13th and 14th by Würtemberg and
                    Baden, the 15th by Alsace and Lorraine, and the 16th and 17 th (called 1st and
                    2d Bavarian army corps) by the kingdom of Bavaria. The following details apply
                    strictly to the Prussian provinces only.</p>
                <p>The corps districts are subdivided into division and brigade districts, and these
                    again into landwehr battalion districts, corresponding to the civil <hi
                    rend="italic">Kreis,</hi> or circle. As a rule, for each infantry regiment there
                    are two corresponding landwehr battalion districts, from which the former draws
                    its recruits and reserves. The battalion districts, again, are subdivided into
                    company districts, of which there are from 3 to 6 to a battalion. Every town and
                    village has thus its appointed place in the general organisation, and this is
                    indicated on notice boards conspicuously placed at all the entrances.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of each year lists are prepared from the parish registers of all
                    young men who have attained their twentieth year, and to these lists are added
                    the names of those who, though still liable to service, have been allowed to
                    stand over from previous years. In the spring, about May, the battalion
                    recruiting commission commences its labours. This commission is composed of the
                    landwehr battalion commander, the landrath or chief civil functionary, ' two
                    officers, and a surgeon, as permanent members, and four local members taken from
                    the more respectable inhabitants of the different villages.</p>
                <p>The commission having notified the days of its visiting the headquarters of the
                    several company districts, the youths are mustered there accordingly, and
                    inspected. Those who are found physically unfit for any service are struck off
                    the lists altogether. Others who are too young and unformed for military service
                    are put back for -a year. Many also are permitted to stand over on personal or
                    family grounds, the commission being allowed great latitude in granting
                    temporary exemptions.</p>
                <p>Every young man can be called up three years in succession, and as a rule the
                    majority of the recruits are put back one year at least on medical grounds, but
                    at the end of the third he must either be definitely passed or exempted. Those
                    who are exempted in their third year are passed into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ersatz</hi> reserve, where they undergo no training, and are free of service in
                    peace time, but in war can be called out and sent to the dépôts to replace the
                    casualties in the active army. Men below the regulation stapdard, but otherwise
                    fit for the army, are passed into the <hi rend="italic">Ersatz</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The contingent of recruits for 1872-3 was fixed at
                    190 per battalion. As the peace strength of the battalion, exclusive of the
                    permanent cadres, is about 450, it is evident these cannot all receive their
                    full three years’ training.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n656/mode/1up"

                <p>reserve; as also only sons of widows, and others who are the sole supports of
                    families, or who have, or have lost, brothers in the army. Although exemptions
                    afe much more charily granted in the third than in the first and second years of
                    liability, they are still sufficiently numerous to soften materially the
                    hardships of compulsory service. Finally, after all “exemptions” and
                    “adjournments” have been made, there remain those passed as fit for service, and
                    from these the required number are chosen by ballot. But the ballot is almost
                    nominal. In 1862, for instance, when the number coming of age amounted to
                    227,000, only 69,000 were left on the lists for the ballot—63,000 being the
                    required contingent — and in many districts the ballot was not applied at alL In
                    1867, 262,000 came of age, 110,000 were passed for the service, and about
                    100,000 taken. The system of exemptions is so elastic that practically the
                    recruiting commission can select, by a process of elimination, those best fitted
                    for service, and abolish the element of chance. A margin of about 10 per cent.,
                    however, is usually allowed; those who draw the lucky numbers are passed into
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ersatz</hi> reserve, but remain liable for a year to fill
                    any accidental vacancies in the peace establishment.</p>
                <p>The men drawn for the army are then told off to the different branches of the
                    service; men with good chests and good feet to the infantry, men accustomed to
                    horses to the cavalry, gamekeepers and foresters to the rifles, men of high
                    standard to the guard, those of inferior physique to the train, carpenters and
                    mechanics to the engineers, and a certain proportion of shoemakers, tailors,
                    saddlers, &amp;c., to all regiments and corps. The guards recruit throughout the
                    kingdom generally; the cavalry, artillery, fusiliers, and rifles throughout
                    their own corps districts; while the infantry regiments draw their recruits as
                    far as possible from the corresponding landwehr battalion districts. The
                    proceedings of the battalion recruiting commissione are revised by brigade
                    commissions, who distribute the recruits to regiments and corps, and these again
                    by a corps commission. The final decision and allotment to regiments is usually
                    completed about September. From that time the men are called recruits, and
                    amenable to military law, but are given passes until the 15th October, the date
                    on which they join their regiments.</p>
                <p>These conscripts form the great bulk of the army; but there are other classes,
                    also, serving under varied conditions. Of these the most important are the
                    “one-year volunteers,” young men of means and education who, on condition of
                    passing certain examinations and bearing all expenses of clothing, equipment,
                    &amp;c., are allowed to pass into the reserve after one year’s service only.
                    This system is a great boon to the middle·and professional classes, who thus
                    materially reduce the interruption which the full term in the ranks would cause
                    in their education; and every effort is made to render the service as light as
                    is consistent with thorough instruction. Many of these pass the requisite
                    examinations for officers’ rank, and become officers of landwehr, or qualify as
                    non-commissioned officers, and serve as such if recalled on mobilisation. A
                    certain number of youths enter voluntarily for three years, gaining the
                    privilege of serving at an earlier age, and choosing their own regiments. The
                    non-commissioned officers are mostly “re-engaged men.” Re-engagements are
                    allowed for various periods, and each squadron or company has several “<hi
                    rend="italic">Capitu-lanten,”</hi> smart young men, who have engaged to prolong
                    their service in the ranks with the object of getting promotion. In the cavalry
                    it is common for men to engage to serve four years instead of three, in
                    consideration of which their time in the reserve is reduced by one year, and
                    that in the landwehr by two years. Finally, there are a certain number who serve
                    for a given number of years in return for advantages received in the way of
                    education or maintenance from Government; such are the pupils of the
                    non-commissioned officers’ school and of the school of forestry, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>After completing his term in the ranks the soldier is passed into the reserve,
                    retaining, however, his place in his regiment, borne on its books, and liable to
                    be recalled to it in case of war. The <hi rend="italic">reservist</hi> is
                    supposed to take part in at least two manoeuvres, not exceeding eight weeks,
                    during his term of reserve service. On completing his seven years’ army and
                    reserve service he leaves his regiment and passes into the landwehr, and is
                    taken on the lists of the corresponding landwehr battalion for the remaining
                    five year3 of liability. The landwehr battalion is the basis of the local
                    organisation, both for recruiting and mobilisation. As a rule, to each
                    three-battalion regiment of the line is attached a two-battalion landwehr
                    regiment. These two are connected as closely as possible; they bear the same
                    number, the line regiment draws its recruits from the battalion districts,
                    furnishes the staff for their cadres, and passes its men into their ranks.</p>
                <p>In peace time the landwehr battalions exist only in cadre, viz., a commanding
                    officer, adjutant, and three clerks and orderlies per battalion, and a
                    sergeant-major and two non-commissioned officers per company. These are charged
                    with kéeping the registers of the names and addresses of all reserve and
                    landwehr men in their districts, and on mobilisation the whole labour of
                    summoning, collecting, and forwarding the men to their destination falls on the
                    landwehr battalion commander and his staff. The fusilier reserve landwehr
                    battalions form a peculiar feature in local organisation. Each army corps haβ a
                    fusilier regiment, which does not draw its recruits from a particular
                    subdistrict, but, like the cavalry and special corps, from the corps district
                    generally. But to each fusilier regiment is attached a reserve landwehr
                    battalion and district, bearing the same number, but used to equalise and fill
                    up the regiments throughout the corps district generally, remedying deficiencies
                    in the regimental quotas of recruits or reserve men, and forming, in fact, a
                    great central depot of recruits and reserves. It has always for its district
                    some important town or centre of commerce, where the floating population is
                    largest and local attachment weakest, and whence also the communications to all
                    parts of the province are easiest, and is allowed a considerably larger
                    staff.</p>
                <p>The following is an approximate estimate of the resources in men at the disposal
                    of the German empire :—</p>

                    fusiliers, and line. The nine regiments of guards are composed of picked men,
                    and are in every way <hi rend="italic">troupes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Télite</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> four of them are maintained at a special
                    increased peace establishment. The grenadier regiments only differ from the line
                    in name and in some trifling badges, relics of former times. The fusiliers are
                    the representatives of the old light infantry, and are specially intended for
                    outpost duty, skirmishing, &amp;c. The men are chosen for activity and
                    intelligence, and their armament differs slightly, but in organisation they are
                    the same as the line. A fusilier regiment is attached to each army corps.</p>
                <p>An infantry regiment has three field battalions, of which the third is called the
                    fusilier battalion. A battalion consists of four companies, and has a peace
                    strength of <hi rend="italic">552</hi> of all ranks, and a war strength of 1022.
                    A regiment on war footing numbers 60 officers, 3000 men, 73 non-combatants, with
                    105 horses and 19 waggons. Besides the three field battalions, a fourth or dépôt
                    battalion, 1240 strong, is formed on mobilisation. This includes a company of
                    tradesmen 200 strong, who are required to supply all clothing, &lt;fcc., and
                    execute all repairs required by the battalions in the field. The depot battalion
                    is formed partly of the next contingent of recruits, who are called out at once
                    on mobilisation, and partly of the oldest classes of reserve men, or, if these
                    do not suffice, of the youngest class of landwehr; any men in the field
                    battalions who, from want of instruction or other causes, are not considered fit
                    for immediate service, are also transferred to the depot. The field battalions
                    always maintain direct communication with it, and as soon as their losses amount
                    to 10 per cent, of their strength, draw on it for the necessary
                    reinforcements.</p>
                <p>The Prussian infantry stands in three ranks on parade, the third rank being
                    composed of picked shots <hi rend="italic">{Schützen),</hi> who formerly did all
                    the skirmishing. But for drill and manoeuvring the common formation is that of
                    company columns, the company being divided into two <hi rend="italic"
                    >“Zugs”</hi> or subdivisions, standing at six paces’ distance, and the third
                    rank being withdrawn and formed into a separate <hi rend="italic">Zug
                    {Schützenzug),</hi> two deep, in rear of the others. The Prussian drill, which
                    for many years was the model for Europe, has lately become so again, and since
                    1866 the company column formation, by which more independence is given to the
                    captains, and greater freedom of movement to the battalion generally, has been
                    adopted by most armies.</p>
                <p>The Prussians were also the first to adopt the breechloader, which they used with
                    marked success against the Danes in 1864 and the Austrians in 1866. Up to 1870
                    they were armed with the needle-gun, the earliest, but probably also the worst,
                    form of breech loader; but their losses from the French chassepôt convinced them
                    of the necessity of an improved weapon, and the infantry is now being armed with
                    the Mauser rifle. The infantιy soldier of the line carries a long breech-loading
                    rifle, with bayonet always fixed, a short sword, and 80 rounds of amnïunition; a
                    reserve of 20 rounds per man is also carried in the battalion ammunition waggon.
                    Fusilier regiments, and fusilier battalions of other regiments, are armed with a
                    shorter rifle without bayonet, but carry a sword which can be fixed and used as
                    such when required. The uniform is a darkblue tunic, grey trousers with red
                    stripe, helmet of black leather, with brass ornaments and spike <hi
                    rend="italic">{Pickelhaube),</hi> and boots into which the trousers are
                    generally tucked for marching. The different army corps are distinguished by the
                    colour of the shoulder cords. The knapsack is of brown calfskin, rather large,
                    but shaped to fit the back. The belts of grenadier and line regiments are white,
                    those of fusilier regiments black.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rifles.—</hi> The rifles <hi rend="italic">{Jdgeτ</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Schützen)</hi> are not organised in regiments, but form
                    independent battalions, of which the guard corps has two and the other army
                    corps one each. Their organisation, and peace and war establishment, are almost
                    identical with that of a line battaiion, but on mobilisation each battalion
                    forms a fifth or depot company, which performs the same duties as the depot
                    battalion does for the line regiments. They are recruited by picked men chosen
                    throughout the army corps district. Unlike the rest of the infantry, they always
                    stand in two ranks; and they are further distinguished by carrying a short
                    rifle, and by their green tunics with black belts. The rifle battalions of the
                    guards are mainly recruited from the rangers of the royal forests.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cavalry.—</hi> The cavalry consists of 73 regiments, of which
                    10 are cuirassiers, 26 dragoons, 19 uhlans (or lancers), and 18 hussars. The
                    cuirassiers and lancers are classed as heavy cavalry, dragoons and hussars as
                    light cavalry. The cavalry of the guard numbers 8 regiments, of which 2 are
                    cuirassiers, 2 dragoons, 3 uhlans, and 1 hussars, and are all carefully-picked
                    men.</p>
                <p>The organisation and establishments of all" cavalry regiments are alike. In peace
                    time they consist of 5 squadrons of 4 officers and 135 men each; in war the
                    regiment takes the field with 4 squadrons of 150 men each, while the fifth
                    squadron remains behind to form the depot.· The total strength of the 4 field
                    squadrons is 677 men and 706 horses, and of the dépôt squadron 267 men and 112
                    horses. The depot includes an artificers’ detachment, of 54 men. A cavalry
                    regiment thus requires a very small augmentation in war, and the field squadrons
                    are completed at once from the fifth or dépôt squadron, they sending to it their
                    recruits and untrained or unserviceable horses. Owing to the terms of service
                    usual in the cavalry, the actual proportion of “reservists” is much smaller than
                    in the infantry, but they still far exceed the number required to complete the
                    regiments, and accordingly are used to form the staff escort, field gendarmerie,
                    field post and other special corps, and to furnish non-commissioned officers to
                    the military train.</p>
                <p>The Prussian cavalry first won its reputation under Frederick the Great, and his
                    brilliant cavalry leaders Ziethen and Seydlitz. In the battles of Hohen
                    Friedberg, Rossbach, and. Zorndorf the cavalry decided the fortunes of the day,
                    and gloriously verified their old motto—</p>
                <p>Wenn alles wankt und schwankt</p>
                <p>Dann wäge nicht und zähle nicht, dann d’rauf!<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In recent campaigns they have more especially distinguished themselves by their
                    intelligence and enterprise as scouts and outposts, covering the movements of
                    their own armiee with an impenetrable screen, while constantly feeling the enemy
                    and reporting his movements. But their desperate charges at Mars la Tour and
                    Rezonville, where they sacrificed themselves to check the enemy and give
                    breathingtime to their own overmatched and exhausted infantry, will always be
                    classed among the most heroic deeds in the annals of cavalry.</p>

                <p>The light cavalry (hussars and dragoons) are armed with breech-loading carbines
                    and swords. In the heavy cavalry, 16 men per squadron carry carbines, the
                    remainder pistols. The cuirassiers are armed with a long heavy sword (7¼‰sc∆),
                    and wear a black cuirass weighing 16 Eb, and supposed to be bullet-proof. The
                    uhlans carry a lance and the usual cavalry sword. The cuirassiers use saddlery
                    of the “German” pattern, very cumbrous; the rest of the cavalry use the
                    “Hungarian” saddle. On the whole, the Prussian cavalry ride slightly heavier
                    than the corresponding troops in England. Great attention is paid to the
                    selection of horses for the cavalry, and constant efforts are made, by the
                    importation of valuable stallions and brood mares, to encourage the breeding of
                    a suitable class of horses. The remounts are bought by commissions appointed for
                    the purpose, and either sent direct to the regiments, or, if too young for work,
                    to the remount dépôts, where they are carefully broken. In war time the
                    necessary augmentation is obtained partly by purchase in the market and partly
                    by contracts previously made in peace time. If these measures are not
                    sufficient, the Government has the power of compulsory purchase. For this
                    purpose all the horses in the kingdom are registered and periodically inspected,
                    and returns kept of those considered fit for military service. On the order for
                    mobilisation the owners may be summoned to attend with their horses; these are
                    inspected by a military board, who select as many as they require, and take
                    possession at once; and a mixed board afterwards determines the compensation to
                    be given to the owners.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artillery—</hi> The artillery of an army corps consists of two
                    regiments of field artillery and a regiment of garrison artillery. One of the
                    two field artillery regiments is organised in two divisions <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ahcheilunf) of</hi> four batteries (two heavy and two light) each; this
                    furnishes the divisional artillery, <hi rend="italic">oneAl&gt;theilung</hi> to
                    each infantry division. The other consists of three divisions, two of field and
                    one of horse artillery, of three batteries each; and furnishes the corps or
                    reserve artillery, and the horse artillery, which is attached to the cavalry
                    divisions. A field battery on peace footing has only 4 guns, with 114 men, 37
                    horses, and 2 waggons. In war time it has 6 guns, with 155 men, 125 horses, and
                    10 waggons. A horse battery has a war establishment of 6 guns, 154 men, 207
                    horses, and 10 waggons. On mobilisation a dépôt division is formed for each army
                    corps, consisting of 1 heavy, 1 light, and 1 horse battery, and a detachment of
                    artificers. Further, a <hi rend="italic">Colonnen AbtheUung,</hi> consisting of
                    9 ammunition columns (of which 5 carry artillery ammunition and 4 small-arm
                    ammunition) is formed, and attached to the field artillery. The regiment of
                    garrison artillery is composed of two divisions of four companies each, with a
                    peace strength of 108, and a war strength of 209 men per company.<note

                    division of garrison artillery instead nf e regiment.</p></note> On mobilisation
                    the field artillery is augmented by men of the reserve, and by men drawn from
                    the garrison artillery regiment; the garrison artillery is principally
                    reinforced from the artillery men in the landwehr. Sometimes the number of
                    companies of garrison artillery is doubled. The Prussian artillery are armed
                    with rifled breech-loading guns of cast steel, the heavy batteries with the
                    6-pounder gun, throwing a shell weighing about 15ft; the light batteries and
                    horse artillery with the 4-pounder gun, throwing a 9 ft shell. The extreme range
                    of these guns is about 5000 paces, but their effective range does not exceed
                    2500. A heavy battery carries 134 rounds per gun, a light battery 157 rounds;
                    and the corps ammunition columns carry a further supply of about 100 rounds per
                    gun.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pioneers.—</hi> Each army corps has a battalion of pioneers, of
                    four companies, of which the first is the pontoon company, the second and third
                    sapper companies, and the fourth the miner company. The men of each company are
                    thoroughly instructed in their own special duties, but know also the duties of
                    the other companies sufficiently to be able to assist if required.</p>
                <p>The peace establishment of a company is 146 men. In war time the second sapper
                    company remains behind, and forms three garrison companies, and a depot company
                    is also formed. The other three companies, augmented to a war strength of 218
                    men, take the field, and furnish the <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> for a
                    light field bridge train or pontoon train, and an entrenching tool column, which
                    also accompany the army corps. Further, four railway detachments and four field
                    telegraph detachments are formed for the whole army. The railway detachments are
                    formed from the railway battalion, which was organised immediately after the war
                    of 1870-71, and is composed entirely of men trained to the various duties
                    connected with railways, the officers and non-commissioħed officers being
                    qualified to act as railway managers, station-masters, Ac. On mobilisation they
                    receive their augmentation from reserve and landwehr men who are actually
                    holding these positions on the various lines; and in war time they are charged
                    with constructing, repairing, and working or destroying the lines in an enemy’s
                    country. The field telegraph detachments, in the same way, are trained in peace
                    time to everything connected with telegraphy; in war they carry a light line,
                    which they lay down as required, or work the existing lines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Military Train.</hi> —The train is a mere skeleton in peace
                    time. The battalion which is attached to each army corps is little but a cadre
                    maintained for instructional purposes, and only numbers 240 men of all ranks,
                    while the train soldiers attached to an army corps on war footing amount to
                    3500. The men are only subjected to six months’ training, and by the constant
                    renewal the number passed into the reserve is enormously increased; additional
                    men are drawn from the cavalry reservists. In war time the train battalion is
                    broken up altogether, and forms a number of separate detachments, viz., five
                    provision columns, three ambulance detachments, a horse depot, a field bakery
                    column, and an escort squadron, to take charge of the five <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fuhr Park</hi> columns which’are organised of hired or requisitioned transport.
                    Further, nearly 1000 train soldiers are sent to the various regiments (65 to an
                    infantry regiment, 37 to a cavalry regiment) to drive the regimental baggage
                    train, act as servants to staff and field officers; 800 to the artillery,
                    principally as drivers, &amp;c., for the ammunition columns; and 300 to the
                    pioneers, for the pontoon and tool train; and 400 to the various administrative
                    services. The whole Of the transport in the Prussian service is
                    departmental,—that is, is told off to certain special departments and duties,
                    and is not available for general service. Thus the regiments have their
                    regimental transport, the artillery their ammunition columns, the commissariat
                    their provision columns, the medical department their field hospital and
                    ambulance train, &lt;fcc.</p>

                    district forms a reserve rifle company, one or two reserve cavalry regiments,
                    and three reserve batteries, from the landwehr men on its lists. The garrison
                    companies of sappers and the garrison artillery have already been spoken of, and
                    are more closely connected with the active army than the rest of the garrison
                    troops. The officers for the landwehr and reserve regiments are supplied partly
                    from the field troops, partly from one-year volunteers who have qualified, and
                    non-commissioned officers of the army who have retired with the rank of landwehr
                    officers, and partly from the half-pay list. Tn addition to the forces above
                    named, a certain number of “garrison battalions” are sometimes formed from the
                    surplus landwehr men, and some of the <hi rend="italic">Ersatz</hi> reserve.
                    This was done in the war of 1870-71 to relieve the depot troops Of the garrison

                    the front. The organisation and armament of the landwehr are generally similar
                    to those of the field troops, but the infantry wear a broad flat-topped cap

                <p>The general organisation of the Prussian army remains the same in peace and war.
                    The king is the Com-mander-in-Chief, and exercises his authority through the War
                    Ministry. The War Ministry is divided into a number of departments, of which the
                    principal are the Central Department, which includes the minister’s office; the
                    General War Department, which deals with all questions of organisation,
                    mobilisation, quartering, training, &amp;c., and all strategical and purely
                    military questions; and the Military Finance Department, which deals with all
                    questions of pay clothing, equipment, and supply. Directly under the king and
                    the War Minister come the commanders of the army corps districts into which the
                    kingdom is divided. In peace time each corps command comprises two divisions, a
                    rifle battalion, a brigade of artillery, and a battalion of pioneers and of
                    train; each division consists of two infantry brigades and one cavalry brigade;
                    each infantry brigade consists of two line regiments (exceptionally three) and
                    one or two landwehr regiments; each cavalry brigade of two or three cavalry
                    regiments. On the order for mobilisation the regiments are completed to war
                    strength, the depots formed, and the landwehr or garrison troops organised. A
                    few slight alterations are made to equalise the army corps (the details of the'
                    war strength of which have been already given) to a uniform strength of 25
                    battalions, and a portion of the cavalry and one or two batteries of horse
                    artillery are withdrawn from each corps to form separate cavalry divisions. The
                    active army then takes the field, with the same organisation and under the same
                    officers, corps and divisional commanders, brigadiers, staff, &amp;c., that they
                    have been accustomed to in peace.</p>
                <p>The instructions for mobilisation are minute and complete. Every year a “paper
                    mobilisation” scheme is drawn up, showing the number of men and officers
                    required to place every corps and detachment on war footing, and whence these
                    would be obtained, and showing also on what duties the officers and men actually
                    present would be employed.· This scheme is completed at the army corps
                    headquarters, and after revision by the War Minister, is approved and
                    promulgated. Every individual thus knows beforehand what would be his duties in
                    case of war, and the pith of the system lies in two short sentences in the
                    “Secret Instructions”—“Every person in authority should know in peace what will
                    be required of him on the order to mobilisé, and must expect no further orders.
                    All orders which have to be issued are to be kept ready in peace.” The steps‘to
                    be taken on mobilisation are detailed day for day. On the first day the War
                    Ministry acquaints the commanders of army corps and principal military
                    authorities, and also telegraphs direct to the commanders of landwehr battalion
                    districts, to summon the reserves. On the second and third days the landwehr
                    commanders complete the written summons, which are kept always ready, notifying
                    to each man when and where he is to join; and these are sent out by aid of the
                    civil authorities. The reserves for the field troops are called in first, the
                    landwehr men one or two days later. On the fourth and fifth days the reserve men
                    assemble, and are forwarded to their regiments, whence a few officers and
                    non-commissioned officers have been sent to take charge of them. Meanwhile the
                    regiments have formed their depots, drawn the reserve clothing and equipment
                    from their stores, and get everything in readiness to receive their augmentation
                    men. Most regiments are complete and ready to take the field by the seventh day.
                    As soon as the reserve men have all been despatched, the landwehr men are
                    collected, and equipped from the stores at the headquarters of the battalion
                    district. The landwehr battalions are mostly completed about the eighth day. The
                    reserve cavalιy and some of the administrative departments take a little longer,
                    but in 1870 the mobilisation was so far completed that the movement of the army
                    corp3 to the front could be commenced on the ninth day. The commanders of army
                    corps, divisions, &amp;c., accompany their commands, and are replaced in their
                    local commands by temporary <hi rend="italic">{stellvertretende)</hi>
                    officials.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Appointment and Promotion of Officers.—</hi> The Prussian army
                    draws its officers mainly from the <hi rend="italic">Kleinadel</hi> or lesser
                    nobility, corresponding to the country gentry of England. Promotions from the
                    ranks are very rare, and generally carry with them retirement or transfer to the
                    landwehr. A certain number of young men of. middle class obtain commissions, but
                    principally in the scientific corps or in the landwehr. First appointments are
                    obtained either from the cadet schools or by entering the ranks as <hi
                    rend="italic">avantageurs.</hi> More than one-half the officers enter by the
                    latter system. A young man seeking a commission obtains a nomination from the
                    colonel of a regiment, which admits him to serve as a private, but with
                    recognition of his being a candidate for the rank of officer, and as such he is
                    called an <hi rend="italic">avantageur.</hi> He is usually required to sleep and
                    mess with the privates in their barrack-room for the first two months; after
                    that he has more liberty given to him, and is sometimes received at the
                    officers’ table. After six months’ service, and passing an examination in the
                    subjects of a liberal education, he becomes qualified for promotion to the rank
                    of <hi rend="italic">Porte épée</hi><hi rend="italic">Fähnrich</hi> (swordknot
                    ensign), a sort of intermediate position between the commissioned and
                    non-commissioned ranks. After six months’ further service in this rank he is
                    sent to a military school for a ten months’ course of instruction, at the close
                    of which he is required to pass an examination in purely military subjects; and
                    then becomes qualified for a commission, subject to being accepted by the
                    officers of the regiment as worthy of admission among their number. The career
                    of those youths who enter from the cadet schools does not differ materially from
                    the above. The great majority enter as “avantageurs,” and serve their time as
                    already described, only passing the first or ensign’s examination before they
                    enter, and being appointed to regiments by the king, instead of obtaining
                    nominations from the colonels. A certain number who pass through <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n660/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0660-0599"/> the higher classes of the cadet school enter the
                    army at once as <hi rend="italic">Porte</hi><hi rend="italic">épée</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fähnrich,</hi> and serve their probation in that rank only; while
                    a very few, the <hi rend="italic">selecta,</hi> who take the highest honours,
                    are given commissions direct. Promotion in the army depends solely on the will
                    of the king, but in the main is governed by seniority; but exceptions are made
                    in favour of officers of the general staff, who commonly receive a step of rank
                    oh completing a term of duty in any staff appointment, aide-de-camps of higher
                    generals, instructor’s at the cadet and war schools, and officers who have
                    specially distinguished themselves in the field. As a rule, promotion to the
                    rank of captain is by seniority in the regiment, but above that rank by
                    seniority throughout that branch, or by selection. Officers are also freely
                    transferred from one branch to another; thus, after the battle of Gravelotte,
                    the command of the rifle battalion of the guard was given to an engineer
                    officer. Especial attention is bestowed on the selection of officers for the
                    general staff. These are generally taken from those who have passed through the
                    War Academy at Berlin, the highest educational establishment in the Prussian
                    army. . Candidates for admission to this academy must have served at least three
                    years with their regiments, must pass a qualifying examination, and must be
                    favourably reported upon by their commanders. The course lasts three years, and
                    those officers who give proof of sufficient abilities are afterwards employed
                    for a time on various military works, under the immediate supervision of the
                    chief of the staff, who thus acquires a personal knowledge of the character and
                    abilities of all staff officers. Occasionally officers specially recommended are
                    taken direct from their regiments; but they are always tested by the chief of
                    the staff before receiving appointments. The anxious care bestowed on the
                    selection of officers for these important duties has borne its fruit: the
                    Prussian staff has made itself a worldwide reputation, and to it and to the
                    genius of its chief, Von Moltke, may be awarded a large share in the success of
                    the Prussian arms. The army is equally fortunate in its corps of officers
                    generally,—men who unite the power of command and the high qualities of an
                    aristocracy with the most thorough knowledge of their profession and devotion to
                    it. The .pay of the Prussian officers in the lower ranks is small, usually about
                    half that of the corresponding ranks in the English army, and lower than in most
                    of the Continental ones; but the higher ranks are well paid, probably better
                    than in any other army, if the relative value of money and cost of living are
                    considered.</p>
                <p>The strength of the Prussian system lies in its close localisation and permanent
                    organisation. The first secures the strongest possible <hi rend="italic">esprit
                    de corps</hi> and the greatest simplicity and speed in mobilising; the second
                    that familiarity of every individual with his position, duties, and
                    surroundings, which is essential to the smooth working of so complicated a
                    machine as a great national army. It is to these, coupled with the careful
                    training, the subordination of everything to the army, and the ever-watchful
                    foresight with which every contingency is studied and provided for beforehand,
                    that the remarkable successes of the Prussian armies are to be attributed,
                    rather than to the excellence of the material or to the special military
                    qualities of the nation. Physically the Prussian soldier is not much if at all
                    above the average. It is true that the guards and some of the regiments from the
                    northern provinces are exceptionally fine, but the army is very unequal, and men
                    of practical experience have declared-the German, as a rule, to be not equal in
                    power or in endurance to the Frenchman.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See the opinion of Mr Brassey, the eminent contractor,
                    quoted in his <hi rend="italic">Life.</hi></p></note> In quick aptitude for war
                    the Frenchman has always had the advantage. .Generally, where the two have met
                    on equal terms the Frenchman has been victorious; and even through the disasters
                    of the late war, impartial witnesses have asserted that, man for man, the
                    Frenchman was the better. But such natural qualities as the Prussian soldier
                    possesses have been developed to the utmost by a civil education superior to
                    that of any other nation, and by a military training, physical as well as
                    mental, which may well serve as a model to all armies. He is docile, temperate,
                    simple in his tastes and aspirations; and though not so demonstrative as his
                    French neighbour, and with no fanatical enthusiasm, has a deep love of his
                    country and loyalty to his king. If not easily excited to heroism, neither is he
                    easily discouraged. No Englishman can forget that memorable march, when the
                    Prussian army, unshaken by the disaster of Ligny, undeterred by the difficulties
                    of the road or the enemy thundering in their rear, pushed on with indomitable
                    energy through all obstructions to succour their hard-pressed allies at
                    Waterloo. The Prussian army, more than any other, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >élite</hi> of a nation; and so long as the nation consents to submit to the
                    burdens of her present military system, and her affairs are guided by chiefs as
                    able and far-seeing as her present rulers, she will hardly forfeit the position
                    she has won as the first military power of Europe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Saxon</hi><hi rend="italic">Army.</hi></p>
                <p>The kingdom of Saxony, with a population of 2 j millions, furnishes one strong
                    army corps (29 battalions of infantry and 6 regiments of cavalry) to the German
                    army. The Saxons were long renowned as a warlike race, and played a prominent
                    part in all the wars of Northern Europe; and her princes twice mounted the
                    throne of Poland. At the outbreak of the wars of the French Revolution she
                    maintained an army of over 30,000 men, and at first sided with Prussia. After
                    the disasters of Jena and Auerstadt she allied herself with France, and for some
                    years furnished a contingent to the armies of Napoleon, who in return recognised
                    her elector as king, and largely increased his territories. The newly-made king
                    remained faithful to Napoleon even in his reverses; but the army was too German
                    in feeling to fight willingly under the French flag. In 1809 they did not
                    distinguish themselves at Wagram, and their defection at Leipsic contributed not
                    a little to the results of that bloody day. After the peace the king retained
                    his title, though shorn of a great part of his dominions, and the army was
                    reconstituted on a smaller scale. In 1866 Saxony sided with Austria, and her
                    army shared in the disasters of that brief campaign and the crowning defeat
                    at.Koniggratz. At the close of the war she was compelled to ally herself with
                    Prussia, and, as part of the North German Confederation, to place her military
                    forces at the disposal of the Prussian monarch. In 1870 and 1871 her troops,
                    under the command of the crown prince (now king) of Saxony, formed the 12th
                    corps of the great German army, and bore their share in the battles of
                    Gravelotte and Sedan and in the siege of Paris. Her army is organised in every
                    respect as a Prussian army corps, and is under the command in chief of the
                    German emperor, who, in concert with the king of Saxony, names the officers for
                    the higher commands. She retains, however, her separate War Ministry, budget,
                    &lt;kc.; and appointments and promotion to all but the highest commands are made
                    by the king of Saxony. The Saxon troops fought well in the late war between
                    Germany and France. In appearance they are smarter than most of the German
                    troops, and have a certain resemblance to the English; but their uniform and
                    equipment are assimilated in all respects to the Prussian.</p>

                <p>The kingdom of Bavaria, with a population of a little under five millions,
                    furnishes two army corps to the German · army. Like Saxony, Bavaria, originally
                    an electorate, was enlarged and made into a kingdom by Napoleon. Under the
                    command of Marshal Wrede, a distinguished Bavarian, her troope fought side by
                    side with the French through the campaigns of 1805 to 1812, but in 1813 she
                    seceded and joined the Alliance, and attempted to intercept the French on their
                    retreat from Leipsic. Napoleon, however, inflicted a severe defeat on his old
                    general at Hanau, and opened his road to France. In 1866 the Bavarians took part
                    against Prussia, but owing to their dilatoriness in taking the field, the
                    Prussians were able to beat them in detail, nor did their generals or troops
                    shine in this war. In 1870, however, they joined their former enemy in the war
                    against France, and bore their full share in the glories and losses of the
                    campaign, the second Bavarian corps having suffered more heavily than any but
                    the third Prussian corps. Her army has now been assimilated to that of Prussia
                    in most respects, but still retains certain distinctive peculiarities of dress
                    and equipment, such as her old light blue uniform, and helmet with black
                    plume.</p>

                <p>Lastly, Würtemberg, with a population of a little under two millions, furnishes
                    one army corps, organised, clothed, and equipped in all respects like the
                    Prussian army. Like the Bavarians, the Würtembergers fought against the
                    Prussians in 1866, but in 1870 made common cause with them against the French,
                    and by the convention entered into the following year, placed their army
                    permanently under the command of the Prussian king as emperor. The emperor
                    nominates to the highest commands, but the king of Würtemberg retains the
                    nomination and appointment of officers in the lower grades.</p>

                <p>But even this does not represent the entire force at the disposal of the empire
                    in war. More than 100,000 trained soldiers still remain available; while the <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">French Army.</hi></p>
                <p>From the earliest times the inhabitants of Gaul were distinguished for bravery
                    and enterprise. First as enemies and afterwards as subjects and auxiliaries,
                    they played an important part in the great wars of Rome; and though they yielded
                    to the irruption of the Franks, the admixture of races seemed only to heighten
                    the warlike spirit of the nation. Under Charlemagne, and, later, in the
                    Crusades, and under Philip Augustus and St Louis, the chivalry of France
                    especially distinguished itself. The excessive power and independence of the
                    great vassals, however, long prevented the formation of any permanent national
                    force, and made France a prey to intestine wars and foreign invasions. Charles
                    VII. availed himself of the lull which followed the final expulsion of the
                    English in the middle of the 15th century to organise his <hi rend="italic"
                    >compagnies d'ordonnance,</hi> and thus laid the foundation of a national
                    standing army. But the armies that followed the kings in their wars s.till
                    consisted mainly of foreign mercenaries, hired for the occasion; and the
                    creations of Charles and his successors. fell to pieces during the religious
                    wars. Lou vois, War Minister of Louis XIV., was the true creator of the French
                    royal army. On his accession to power, the king’s guards, some squadrons of <hi
                    rend="italic">gendarmerie,</hi> and a few infantry regiments (afterwards
                    distinguished as the “old”), constituted the whole of the standing ariny. All
                    other forces had to be created at the outbreak of a war, being usually raised
                    under contracts allotted to generals and others. Lou vois first transferred the
                    army from the hands of contractors and speculators to those of the king. He
                    abolished the <hi rend="italic">arriere-ban,</hi> and substituted a money tax
                    for the liability to service, thereby obtaining funds for the maintenance of a
                    regular army. In 1672, after ten years of his administration, Louis XIV. was
                    able to take the field with a force of 91,000 infantry, 28,000 cavalry, and 97
                    guns, all permanently organised troops, the largest national army that had yet
                    been seen; and six years later the military forces of France had been raised to
                    nearly 280,000 men. The last half of the 17th century is a brilliant period in
                    the annals of the French armies. Organised by Lou vois, animated by the presence
                    of the great king, and led by Condé, Turenne, Luxembourg, Catinat, and Vendome,
                    they made head against coalitions which embraced nearly all the powers-of
                    Europe, and won a series of victories that extended the bounds of France, and
                    made her for a time the first military nation of Europe. But after the death of
                    Louis XIV. the French army gradually deteriorated. In the Seven Years’ War it
                    was disgracefully defeated. Under the reign of Louis XV. confusion and
                    maladministration prevailed everywhere, and the highest idea of military art was
                    to copy servilely every minute detail of the Prussian army. The higher officers,
                    usually nobles about the court, seldom went near their regiments; and Madame de
                    Genlis relates how, when young courtiers departed to join their regimente for a
                    few weeks’ duty, the ladies of the court decked them with scarfs and favours, as
                    if proceeding on a distant and perilous expedition.</p>
                <p>Under Louis XVI. the army improved somewhat; the American war and the successes
                    of Lafayette and Rocham-beau revived a more warlike spirit; instruction was more
                    carefully attended to, a good system of drill and tactics was elaborated at the
                    camp of St Omer, and attempts made to reform the administration. But the
                    Revolution broke over France in the midst of these attempts at reorganisation;
                    the old royalist army disappeared with the monarchy, and was merged in that
                    revolutionary army which under à new flag was destined to raise the military
                    fame of France to its greatest height.</p>
                <p>If Louvois was the creator of the royal army, Carnot was so of the revolutionary
                    army. At the outbreak of the Revolution the royal army consisted of 105 infantry
                    regiments of 2 battalions each, 14 rifle battalions, 7 regiments of artillery,
                    and 62 regiments of cavalry, numbering about 173,000 in all, but capable of
                    augmentation on war strength to 210,000. To this might be added a provincial or
                    militia force of about 60,000, but nominal rather than <pb break="no"

                    to reorganise and augment this army. Voluntary enlistment under the system, of
                    <hi rend="italic">racoleurs</hi> or “bringers,” by which the army had hitherto
                    been fed, was found insufficient. “Compulsory service” was proposed in 1789, but
                    rejected as “contrary to the liberty of the citizen.” An appeal was then made to
                    the patriotism of.the nation, and 200 battalions of volunteers were enrolled;
                    but though many presented themselves, and these volunteers contained much of the
                    best blood and highest intelligence of France, the numbers fell far short of the
                    expectations, and the proportion that reached the frontier was small. In the
                    winter of 1792-3 the French armies, notwithstanding the unexpected successes of
                    the preceding campaign, seemed on the point of dissolving altogether, and the
                    Convention was driven to order a compulsory levy of 300,000 men.</p>
                <p>To eradicate the royalist element from the army, the old regiments were broken up
                    and amalgamated by battalions with the volunteers; and the name even of·
                    “regiment” was abolished. Promotions were made, not by seniority of rank, but
                    length of service; thus an old sergeant succeeded to the command of a regiment
                    over the heads of all the captains. In August. 1793 the affairs of France were
                    at their lowest ebb. Its armies had been driven from the Rhine and out of
                    Belgium, and a dangerous.insurrection had broken out in La Vendée. The
                    compulsory levy, slowly and imperfectly carried out, had not yielded the full
                    number; and those that were obtained deserted by hundreds. The nominal strength
                    amounted in all to 480,000 men, but one army with a paper strength of 90,000 had
                    really only 33,000 in the ranks, and the others were little better. Under the
                    new system of promotion commands changed almost daily, and fell into the hands
                    of men who had never before been entrusted with more than a section; and
                    confusion reigned everywhere.</p>
                <p>Such was the position when Carnot, then a captain of engineers, was called to the
                    Ministry of War. A few days later a levy <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">masse</hi> of all the male population between the ages of 18 and
                    2o was ordered, and was carried out with more method and success than former
                    levies. The muster-rolls, of the armies filled rapidly, and by the end of the
                    year the effective force had risen to 770,000. The amalgamation of the old army
                    and the volunteers, which had been commenced, but imperfectly carried out, was
                    effected on a different and more thorough principle; the white uniform
                    distinctive of the old days of royalty was abolished, the infantry organised in
                    demi-brigades of three battalions (usually one of the old army to two of
                    volunteers), and the men and cadres intermixed within the demi-brigade. A.
                    permanent organisation in divisions, composed of all arms, was introduced, and
                    able officers selected for the commands. Jourdan, Hoche, Pichegru, Kleber,
                    Moreau, were at the head of the armies of the republic. Arsenals and
                    manufactories of warlike stores were created, schools of instruction were
                    established; the republican forces were transformed from hordes to armies, well
                    disciplined, organised, and equipped. The enemies of France were defeated at all
                    points; and in tracing the plan for the campaign of 1794 Carnot showed that his
                    genius shone in strategy as much as in administration. “Twenty-seven victories,
                    of which 8 in pitched battles, 120 combats; 80,000 enemies <hi rend="italic"
                    >hors de combat',</hi> 91,000 taken prisoners; 116 fortresses or important towns
                    taken, 36 of them after siege or blockade; 230 forts or redoubts carried; 3800
                    guns, 70,000 muskets, 1900 millions of powder, and 90 colours captured;”—such
                    was the account Carnot was able to give of eighteen months of office; and at the
                    close he returned to his duty as a simple major of engineers. And even this did
                    not do justice to all he had effected. Himself of an almost Roman type of
                    character,—severe, but a true patriot and republican,- -he had succeeded in
                    infusing much of his own spirit into the army; he had given it not merely
                    discipline and organisation, but honour and soldierly feeling. When Moreau
                    promulgated to his army the decree of the Convention, which forbade them to give
                    quarter to any Englishman or Hanoverian, he added, in general orders, “I have
                    too high an opinion of French honour to believe that such an instruction will be
                    obeyed;”—and he was right.</p>
                <p>In the year 1796 Napoleon appeared on the scene, and by a series of brilliant
                    victories enlarged the frontiers of France and secured a glorious peace. But the
                    exhaustion of years of continuous warfare had made itself felt: the armies were
                    reduced to mere skeletons, and no sufficient means existed of replenishing them,
                    till in 1798 the <hi rend="italic">conscription</hi> was introduced. From that
                    time there was never a dearth of men: the whole male population of France was
                    practically at her ruler’s disposal; and Napoleon had full scope for his genius
                    in organising these masses. His principal improvements were effected in the
                    interval between the peace of Amiens and the War with the third coalition, while
                    threatening the invasion of England. His armies were collected in large camps on
                    the coasts of the Channel, and there received that organisation which, with
                    minor variations, they retained during all his campaigns, and which has since
                    been copied by all European nations. The <hi rend="italic">divisions,</hi> as
                    organised by Carnot, consisted usually of two brigades (twelve battalions) of
                    infantry, two regiments of cavalry, and two or three batteries of artillery.
                    This was a great improvement on former organisation, and worked well in the
                    comparatively small armies which then took the field. But in large armies of
                    150,000 men and upwards the number of isolated commands was too great. Further,
                    it had been found by experience that the very completeness of the divisional
                    organisation—each division forming a miniature army complete in all
                    branches—tended to excessive independence of action on the part of the
                    divisional commanders. Napoleon therefore grouped two or three divisions into
                    <hi rend="italic">corps</hi><hi rend="italic">T armée,</hi> commanded by
                    marshals. He withdrew the whole of the cavalry and a portion of the artillery
                    from the divisions, and with the light cavalry and batteries so obtained formed
                    a reserve corps under the immediate orders of the corps commander; while he kept
                    the whole of the heavy cavalry, amassed in cavalry divisions, his guards, and a
                    certain proportion of artillery, in his own hands; as a reserve to the whole
                    army. Thus was organised that “grande armée” which immortalised itself at Ulm,
                    Austerlitz, Jena, Friedland, Wagram, and Borodino; and after planting the
                    tricolor on every capital of Europe, perished at last in the snows of
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>The frightful expenditure of life during Napoleon’s wars almost drained France of
                    her manhood, and his frequent calls on the country made the name of the
                    conscription detested. One of the first acts of the Restoration was to abolish
                    it, and return to voluntary enlistment; but it was soon evident that this means
                    of recruiting no longer sufficed, and within three years compulsory service had
                    to be again resorted to. In 1818 the annual contingent was fixed at 40,000, and
                    the period of service at six years; in 1824 the contingent was increased to
                    60,000, and in 1832 to 80,000. Of this, however, a part only, according to the
                    requirements of the service, were enrolled; the remainder were sent home on
                    leave or furlough. Up to 1855 certain exemptions were authorised, and
                    substitution or exchange of lots amongst young men who had drawn was permitted,
                    but the individual drawn was obliged either to serve personally or find a
                    substitute. In 1855 the law of “dotation” or exemption by payment was passed,
                    and put an end to personal substitution. The state now undertook to provide
                    substitutes for all who paid a fixed sum, and did so by high bounties to
                    volunteers or to soldiers for re-engaging<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n663/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0663-0602"/>. Although the price of exemption was fixed as
                    high as £92, on an average 23,000 were claimed annually, and in 1859 as many as
                    42,000 were granted. Thus gradually the conscription became rather subsidiary to
                    voluntary enlistment, and in 1866, out of a total establishment of 400,0.00,
                    only 120,000 were conscripts. Changes had also taken place in the constitution
                    of the army. On the Restoration its numbers were reduced to 150,000, the old
                    regiments broken up and recast, and a royal guard created in place of the old
                    imperial one. When the revolution of July 1830 had driven Charles X. from his
                    throne, the royal guard, which had made itself peculiarly obnoxious, was
                    dissolved; and under Louis Philippe’s reign the army was augmented to about
                    240,000-with the colours.· Under the Provisional Government of 1848 it was
                    further increased, and in 1854, when France allied herself.'with England against
                    Russia, the army was raised to 500,000 men. The imperial guard was re-created,
                    and every effort made to revive the old Napoleonic traditions in the army. In
                    1859 Napoleon III. took the field as the champion and ally of Italy, and the
                    victories of Montebello, Magenta, and Solferino raised the reputation of the
                    army to the highest pitch, and for a time made France the arbiter of Europe. But
                    the campaign of 1866 suddenly made the world aware that a rival military power
                    had arisen, which was prepared tα dispute that supremacy. From this time a trial
                    of strength between France and Prussia was looked forward to as inevitable, and
                    both sides prepared for the coming struggle. Niel, the then War Minister of
                    France, saw clearly that the organisation which had with difficulty maintained
                    150,000 men in Italy, was no match for that which had within a month thrown
                    250,000 into the very heart of Austria, while waging a successful war on the
                    Maine against Bavaria and her allies. In 1867, therefore, he brought forward a
                    measure for the reorganisation of the army, by which he calculated to raise the
                    military force to 800,000 men—half of them with the colours and half in
                    reserve—besides forming a separate army for home defence in case of need. It is
                    not necessary to dwell on the law of 1868, for it remained but two years in real
                    operation. To complete NieΓs scheme many years were re,quired: but Niel himself
                    died within a year, and the next year saw the French army annihilated, or
                    existing only as prisoners of war in Prussia.</p>
                <p>At the outbreak of the great Franco-German war the French field troops consisted
                    of 368 battalions, 252 squadrons, and 984 guns. The strength of the entire army
                    on peace footing was 393,000 men; on war footing, 567,000. The forces
                    immediately available for the war on the Rhine were estimated at 350,000, but
                    they actually fell short of 300,000. They formed 8 <hi rend="italic"
                    >corps</hi><hi rend="italic">T armée,</hi> each composed of from two to four
                    infantry divisions and one cavalry division,—making a total of 26 infantry
                    divisions of 13 battalions each, 11 cavalry divisions of from 4 to 7 regiments
                    each, and 756 guns. Within seven weeks the whole of this army, with trifling
                    exceptions, was either captive in Germany or hopelessly shut up in Metz. But the
                    spirit of the nation rose to the occasion, and though, as the result proved,
                    extemporised armies can do little against veteran ones, the efforts of the
                    people and the creative energy of her rulers will always command admiration. The
                    next year’s contingent of recruits was called out and hastily trained. Fourth
                    battalions were formed from the depot <hi rend="italic">cadres,</hi> and
                    organised into <hi rend="italic">regiments</hi><hi rend="italic">de marche.</hi>
                    The <hi rend="italic">gardes mobiles</hi> were mobilised, and by successive
                    decrees and -under various names nearly all the manhood of the country called to
                    arms.</p>
                <p>The regular troops raised as <hi rend="italic">régiments de marche,</hi>
                    &lt;fcc., amounted to 213,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, and 10,000 artillery.
                    The <hi rend="italic">garde mobile</hi> exceeded 300,000, and the mobilised
                    National Guard exceeded 1,100,000—of whom about 180,000 were actually in the
                    field and 250,000 in Paris; the remainder in camps or dépôts.- Altogether the
                    new formations amounted to nearly 1,700,000, and if to that be added the army
                    existing at’the beginning of the war, the total forces developed by France
                    during the struggle reach the enormous amount of 2∣ millions.</p>
                <p>The reorganisation of the army took precedence of all other questions when the
                    conclusion of peace with Germany and the suppression of the communist revolt
                    gave rest once more to the country. By the law of recruiting of 1872 compulsory
                    personal service was introduced, and substitution or purchase of exemption was
                    abolished. The period of liability was fixed at twenty years—five years of the
                    time to be passed in the regular army, four years in the reserve of the regular
                    army, five years in the territorial army, and six in the reserve of the
                    territorial army. The annual contingent is not a fixed one, or determined by the
                    actual requirements of the army, but includes all capable of bearing arms;
                    certain exemptions in favour of only sons of widows, sole supports of families,
                    teachers, and theological students excepted. But as the peace establishment,
                    governed by financial considerations, would not admit of retaining the whole of
                    five years’ contingents with the colours, it was provided that the contingent
                    should be divided by lot into two classes, the first to serve the full five
                    years, the second to be sent home after six months’ or a year’s training.
                    One-year volunteers are admitted on conditions similar to those existing in
                    Prussia. In the calculations on which the law was based it was estimated that
                    about 300,000 annually came of age, of whom about one-half would be rejected as
                    unfit, or exempted on personal or family grounds. Of the remaining 1’50,000,
                    one-half would serve for the full five years, the remainder for six months or a
                    year only; and the peace army would thus comprise four yearly contingents of
                    75,000 and one of. 150,000. Deducting the one-year volunteers, a percentage for
                    casualties, and the men of the fifth year who would usually be sent home on
                    furlough, the remaining four classes give about 350,000; and adding 120,000 to
                    this for the permanent part of the army, the total of 470,000, being the
                    proposed peace establishment, is obtained.</p>
                <p>The organisation of the army was made the subject of a separate law passed in
                    1873. The land forces are divided into the <hi rend="italic">active army</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">territorial army</hi> or landwehr. The active army
                    consists of 18 <hi rend="italic">corps</hi><hi rend="italic">d'armée,</hi>
                    besides a special corps for service in Algeria each corps is composed of two
                    divisions of infantry, a brigade of cavalry, a brigade of artillery, a battalion
                    of engineers, and a squadron of the military train, and retains its organisation
                    permanently in peace and war. The total strength of an army corps is about
                    40,000 of all ranks, or about 30,000 combatants, with 108 guns. The country is
                    divided into 18 “regions,” and each region has always a corps stationed within
                    it, and is provided with magazines and stores of all sorts required to equip the
                    corps for the field, and to furnish out the depot and territorial army as well.
                    The army corps are not permanently localised, but are moved from district to
                    district; and on mobilisation they draw their reserves and stores from the
                    districts in which they happen to be stationed. Recruiting is partly general and
                    partly regional; those recruits who are drawn for five years being distributed
                    throughout the army, while those who have to serve one year only are attached to
                    the corps stationed in their district. For recruiting and for purposes of
                    mobilisation the “regions” are subdivided, each subdivision comprising one or
                    more recruiting offices, in which the recruiting lists, as well as the registers
                    of all furlough or reserve men, and men· belonging to the territorial army, are
                    kept. As a rule, each such office corresponds to a battalion of the <pb

                    books. The general commanding an army corps has under his orders all militaιy
                    forces (territorial or reserve troops as well as active) and establishments
                    within the district. He is assisted by a staff divided into two sections, of
                    which the first or active part accompanies the active army on mobilisation,
                    while the second or territorial part is permanently attached to the district,
                    and is specially charged with recruiting, remounts, and all local affairs, and
                    remains stationary on mobilisation. No general can hold the command of an army
                    corps for more than four years. At the head of each subdivisional recruiting
                    office is placed an officer of rank corresponding closely to the landwehr
                    battalion district commander in Prussia. All soldiers of the active army,
                    reserves, or territorial forces who are living at their homes, under whatever
                    conditions, and are domiciled within his subdivision, are under his orders. The

                    only in peace time; but its cadres are always formed and its organisation
                    established. It is officered by retired or half-pay officers and one-year
                    volunteers, or old non-commissioned officers who, on completing their army
                    service, have qualified as officers of the territorial army. The reserve of the
                    territorial army is not called out except in case of absolute necessity, and
                    then by classes beginning with the youngest.</p>

                <p>In estimating the numbers available for the active army, however, deductions must
                    be made for the last class of recruits (150,000) and the temporary exempts
                    (141,000), who are untrained, and for a number of non-effectives, estimated at
                    from 150,000 to 200,000, which would reduce the total to about 1,000,000. And
                    further, in comparing these numbers with those of the German army, it must be
                    borne in mind that, whereas almost every man on the German lists has received
                    his three years’ training, nearly one-half of the French army is composed of men
                    who have served a year or less with the colours. The peace establishment of the
                    French army is fixed at 450,000; the war establishment of the field army,
                    exclusive of depots and garrison troops, at 780,000.</p>
                <p>The French field army now (1874) numbers 496 battalions of infantry, 380
                    squadrons of cavalry, and 380 batteries; being 126 battalions, 56 squadrons, and
                    158 batteries in excess of its strength at the outbreak of thé war of 1870. The
                    imperial guard has been broken up, and its soldiers distributed throughout the
                    army. Of the creations of the war, the mobilised national guard has been
                    disarmed and dissolved; the <hi rend="italic">gardes mobiles</hi> sent home, but
                    inscribed as reserve of the army; and the <hi rend="italic">regiments</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de marche</hi> have been partly disbanded, partly amalgamated with
                    the regiments from whose dépôts they had been formed. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >infantry</hi> consists of 144 line regiments, each of 3 active and 1 dépôt
                    battalion; 4 regiments of Zouaves and 3 of Turco3, each of 4 field battalions
                    and a weak depot; 36 rifle battalions <hi rend="italic">{chasseurs)</hi> of 6
                    field and 2 depot companies each; a foreign regiment; and 3 battalions of
                    Algerian light infantry (“Zephyrs ”). The peace establishment of a regiment of
                    the line is about 2000; the total strength of the infantry, 298,000.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cavalry</hi> consists of 12 regiments of cuirassiers, 26 of
                    dragoons, 12 of hussars, 20 of <hi rend="italic">chasseurs-h-cheval,</hi> 4 of

                    Spahis. Notwithstanding the reputation which the Prussian uhlans had acquired in
                    the war, one of the first acts of the French Government was to abolish the
                    lance, and transform the old Γancer regiments into dragoons. Each regiment
                    consists of 5 squadrons, 4 of them field’ and 1 depot, and numbers about 900 men
                    and 800 horses; the total strength of the cavalry is 58,000 men and 50,000
                    horses.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">artillery</hi> consists of 38 regiments, of which 19 have
                    each 10 field batteries, and 19 have 6 field and 4 horseartillery batteries. The
                    battery has six guns. The artillery further comprises 30 garrison batteries, a
                    regiment of ponto-niers, 15 companies of artificers, and 2 regiments of
                    artillery train. The total peace strength of the artillery is 45,000 men and
                    24,000 horses.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">engineers</hi> consist of a staff of 462 officers and 570
                    men, and 3 regiments, forming 48 companies of sappers, 6 of miners, and 3 of
                    engineer train. These are ultimately to be formed into 19 independent
                    batteries.</p>
                <p>The key to the French military character, its strength and its weakness, is well
                    given by one of their own writers, Blυadel :—“We love the roll of the drum, the
                    coquetry of uniform, the roar and tumult of battle; but <hi rend="italic"
                    >obedience</hi> is burdensome to us,—it is strange to our character and to our
                    time. The ruling spirit of criticism is injurious to discipline, and too often
                    the study of duties is overlooked in the study of rights. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >warlike</hi> spirit of the ancient Gauls has remained as an inheritance to
                    their descendants: but notwithstanding the fame which our arms have achieved in
                    all epochs of our history, the true <hi rend="italic">military</hi> spirit is
                    rare in France.” This warlike spirit, which the French possess perhaps beyond
                    any other nation, is 'a matter of race and temperament; the military spirit is
                    the result of a nation’s training, and in that the French have been singularly
                    unfortunate. From the time that the Franks, fourteen centuries ago, subdued the
                    original Gallic or Celtic population of France, the nation was divided into two
                    sharply-defined classes, the conquerors and conquered. The former alone were
                    warriors and free; the latter were mere serfs condemned to till the ground and
                    labour. The Frank chivalry was renowned through Europe; but the peasant was
                    perhaps the most abject of his class. This it is that explains the difference
                    between the helpless crowds of footmen that followed the French nobility to
                    battle, and seemed only brought there to be slaughtered, and the sturdy British
                    archers who formed so important an element of strength in the English armies.
                    Hence also the difficulty found in raising an efficient national infantry; as
                    their own king, Francis I., says in his manifesto to the German princes—“We have
                    in our land no foot soldiers, because our ancestors trained our peasantry to
                    agriculture rather than war.” Even in the days of Loùis XIV. and Louis XV. the
                    foreign troops amounted to one-third or one-fourth of the army, and formed
                    distinct corps, usually receiving higher pay. The brilliant feats of arms that
                    gave such <hi rend="italic">prestige</hi> to the French name were mostly
                    performed by her gay and gallant aristocracy. It was the “Maison du Roi” who
                    seized Valenciennes in broad day by a <hi rend="italic">coup de main,</hi> who
                    decided the battle at Steinkirk, who broke the column of Fontenoy. The common
                    soldiers were <hi rend="italic">canaille,</hi> separated by an infinite gulf
                    from their officers. All this was changed by the great Revolution. The former
                    slaves became masters, but they had had no training to qualify them for freedom,
                    and that “law-abiding” spirit that marks the German and Anglo-Saxon races was
                    wanting in them. The old warlike spirit was revived and stimulated by the
                    enthusiasm of newly-acquired liberty; and Napoleon knew how to turn to account
                    the admirable material he found to hand. But <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n665/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0665-0604"/> while he knew better than any one how to
                    stimulate this martial ardour, he did nothing to raise the tone of the army or
                    inculcate a sense of duty. Glory and rewards were the two levers of action he
                    trusted to; and the extravagant “dotations” bestowed on all occasions on his
                    followers did much to create that mercenary spirit that has ever since tainted
                    the army. To the French soldier war means glory, promotion, plunder: if these
                    are not immediately attainable, lie becomes impatient, and blames his leaders.
                    Physically the Frenchman is smaller than the German or Englishman, but is
                    usually better formed about the hips and lower limbs, more active, and more
                    enduring. Mr Brassey, the great contractor, ranks him next after the Englishman
                    and before the German for power of work. Of a gay, volatile, excitable
                    temperament, he has always distinguished himself by impetuosity in attack, but
                    has not shown equal constancy and perseverance in maintaining the contest. A
                    brilliant offensive brings out all his best qualities; he has a natural aptitude
                    for war, a quick eye to seize the situation, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >furia</hi><hi rend="italic">Francese</hi> has become proverbial; but on the
                    defensive he becomes impatient and discouraged, and he is soon demoralised by
                    defeat and disaster. It is then, when discipline and duty alone hold men
                    together, that the want of the true <hi rend="italic">military</hi> spirit makes
                    itself felt, and till this is created in France, even her most brilliant
                    successes must be uncertain and transitory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Austrian Army.</hi></p>
                <p>The imperial army of Austria may be said to date from the Thirty Years’ War. Long
                    before that, Maximilian I. had established a corps of “kyrisser” (original of
                    the modern cuirassiers), and taken into his pay a considerable force of
                    “landsknechts,” the early German infantry. But the latter were companies engaged
                    for the war only, and disbanded at its termination; and it was not till the
                    reign of Rudolph II. (about 1600) that, any permanent regiments were formed.
                    Even these can hardly be counted as belonging to the imperial army, for the men
                    composing them were only indirectly subject to the sovereign, and really obeyed
                    their own chiefs, who could transfer their services to other powers. It was
                    Wallenstein who first raised a distinctly imperial army of soldiers owing no
                    duty but to the sovereign; and it was the suspicion that he intended to use this
                    army, which was actually raised largely at his own expense, to further his own
                    ends, that led to his assassination. From that time the regiments belonged no
                    longer to their colonels, but to the emperor; and the oldest regiments in the
                    present Austrian army date from the Thirty Years’ War. At the close of the war
                    Austria had 19 infantry and 7 cavalry (6 cuirassier, 1 dragoon) regiments. Half
                    a century later her forces had increased to 40 regiments of infantry and the
                    same of cavalry; and in 1809, when she put forth her whole strength for the
                    great struggle with Napoleon, she had 61 infantry regiments (46 German and 15
                    Hungarian) and 45 of cavalry. Up to the beginning of this century, her armies
                    were recruited almost entirely by voluntary enlistment; but, like all the other
                    powers, she was compelled to follow the example of France, and have recourse to
                    the conscription during the great Revolutionary wars. During the half-century
                    which intervened between the final overthrow of Napoleon and her struggle with
                    Prussia for supremacy in Germany, various minor, alterations were introduced,
                    but in the main her military system remained as it was at the close of the great
                    war. The conscription continued in force, the period of service being fixed at
                    ten years, eight of them in the ranks and two in the reserve; unlimited
                    furloughs, however, were largely granted, and the actual service in the ranks
                    seldom exceeded six years, and was often reduced to two or three in the
                    infantry. The disastrous war with Prussia in 1866, and the new constitution
                    finally granted in 1867, led to an entire revision of her military institutions
                    in the following year, and her present organisation is based on the law of
                    1868.</p>
                <p>The armed forces of - Austria consist of the <hi rend="italic">standing
                    army,</hi> which in peace time, on a reduced footing, serves as a school for
                    training the nation to arms, and in war time, completed by its reserves, forms
                    the field army; the <hi rend="italic">landwehr,</hi> which in war time acts as a
                    support to the field army and provides for home defence; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ersatz reserve,</hi> from which casualties in the field army are replaced; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">landsturm,</hi> a national levy only called out to resist
                    invasion. The war establishment of the standing army is fixed at 800,000; the
                    peace establishment varies, being governed by financial considerations, but is
                    usually about 250,000.</p>
                <p>Every male citizen capable of bearing arms becomes liable to military service on
                    completing his twentieth year. Exemption by payment, or by providing a
                    substitute, is not allowed; and those who are exempted on physical grounds are
                    required to pay a sum of money, proportioned to their means, into the military
                    pension fund. Temporary exemptions are, however, granted, as in other armies, to
                    only sons of widows and others who are the sole supports of families. The period
                    of service, or liability to service, lasts for twelve years. The annual
                    contingent of young men passed as fit for service is divided by lot into three
                    classes. The first form the standing army, and serve for three years in the
                    ranks, seven in the reserve of the army, and two in the landwehr. The strength
                    of this first class is determined by the annual requirements of the army, and
                    was fixed at 95,000. The second class forms the “Ersatz” reserve, or reserve for
                    recruits of the standing army. They are not trained at all, but for ten years
                    remain liable to be called in in case of war to fill the depots and replace the
                    casualties of the field aπny. The total strength of the “Ersatz” reserve may not
                    exceed that of one year’s contingent for the active army; the annual “Ersatz”
                    reserve contingent is therefore fixed at <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th of
                    this. The third class, including all who are not drawn for the two preceding
                    ones, are passed at once into the landwehr, in which they serve their twelve
                    years. The organisation of the landwehr varies in the different provinces.
                    Austria, as far as its military institutions are concerned, is divided into four
                    distinct provinces, viz., Austria proper, Hungary, Tyrol and Vorarlberg, and the
                    military frontier. The landwehr of these provinces are distinct, and cannot be
                    moved out of their own provinces except by authority of the Reichsrath or
                    central parliament. Most of the landwehr are trained for eight weeks on first
                    joining, and fourteen days annually afterwards. The Hungarian militia, or
                    “honveds,” as they are called, are better trained than the others. Apparently
                    with the object of providing a more distinctly national force, the Hungarian
                    diet has made arrangements by which one company of each regiment is kept
                    permanently embodied for instruction purposes, so that every man shall have a
                    full year’s training. The landwehr also includes the men who have completed
                    their ten years in the army and reserve, and have to serve for two years in the
                    landwehr. These are intended to provide a steadying element of old soldiers; but
                    as many of them have only actually served two years in the ranks, and been away
                    from their colours for eight, their value is doubtful. The number of young men
                    coming of age and fit for service amounts to 140,000 to 150,000 annually. Of
                    these, 95,000 are passed into the army, and about 10,000 into the “Ersatz”
                    reserve; and the balance, averaging about 40,000, into the landwehr. The
                    landwehr thus comprises two years’ contingents of old soldiers (which, after
                    deduc-thms<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n666/mode/1up"

                    years’ contingents of about 40,000; or a total, after allowing for casualties,
                    of between 500,000 and 600,000. The actual organisation, however, only provides
                    for incorporating about one-third of this number. Service in the landsturm is
                    voluntary, except in Tyrol, where all the male population capable of bearing
                    arms are enrolled, and divided into two classes; the first including all between
                    18 and 39 who are not actually serving in the army or landwehr, the second those
                    between 30 and 45. All liability ceases at the age of 45.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Infantry.—</hi> An Austrian infantry regiment consists of 5
                    field battalions of 4 companies each, and 1 depot battalion of 5 companies. In
                    peace time the first three battalions are maintained on a peace establishment of
                    386 of all ranks, the fourth and fifth on a reduced or· <hi rend="italic"
                    >cadre</hi> establishment of 300, and the depot battalion in <hi rend="italic"
                    >cadre</hi> only (21 officers and non-commissioned officers). The first three
                    battalions are mobile, their stations being determined by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ordre</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">bataille;</hi> and they
                    are always under the immediate command of the colonel of the regiment. The
                    fourth and fifth and dépôt battalions remain permanently at the headquarter
                    station of the regimental recruiting district, and are under the command of a
                    colonel or lieutenant-colonel (regimental second in command), called the reserve
                    commander, who is .also head of the recruiting district, and charged with all
                    duties connected with the annual conscription, calling out of reserves, &amp;c.
                    The captain commanding the depot battalion acts as his assistant in these
                    duties. The staff of the depot battalion conduct all business relating to the
                    muster-rolls and registers of reserve and furlough men, and have custody of the
                    augmentation stores of clothing, arms, ammunition, &lt;fcc. Its own muster-roll
                    is composed mainly of men who, after an eight weeks’ training, have been sent on
                    furlough, but held ready to fill vacancies occurring in the field battalions.
                    The annual contingent of recruits is distributed among the five field
                    battalions, and trained at their headquarters. In war time the five field
                    battalions are raised to a war strength of 952 of all ranks, and the depot
                    battalion to 1155, by calling in the reserve and furlough men.</p>
                <p>If the field force is still found insufficient, a sixth field battalion may be
                    formed from the first four companies of the depot battalion; and the fifth dépôt
                    company, under the command of the deputy of the district commander, then takes
                    over all the depot duties, being augmented for the purpose. The regiment forms
                    two distinct bodies, the first three battalions, under the regimental commander,

                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">rifle battalion</hi> consists of four field companies, a
                    reserve company, and a depot company: the four field companies forming a field
                    battalion, which is stationed according to the <hi rend="italic">ordre de
                    bataille,</hi> while the reserve and depot companies remain at the recruiting
                    headquarters. In peace time the field battalion has a strength of 460 of all
                    ranks, the reserve company 72, and the depot company a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cadre</hi> only. In war the field battalion is augmented to 989, the reserve
                    company to 240, and the depot company to 232. The 40 reserve companies are
                    formed into 10 reserve battalions of 4 companies each; and, if necessary, 10
                    additional reserve battalions can be formed from the dépôt companies, leaving
                    only a sufficient staff to train the “Ersatz” reserve and perform the other
                    depot duties. Seven of the existing rifle battalions form together the “Imperial
                    Tyrol Rifle Regiment;” the remainder are single battalions, numbered from 1 to
                    33.</p>
                <p>The Austrian infantry stand two deep, but in somewhat looser order than is usual
                    in other armies; their usual formation is in line of company columns, with
                    intervals of three paces if in “mass,” or deploying intervals if extended, the
                    companies being formed in columns of sections. Their movements are rather loose
                    but quick; and their new drill gives great independence of action to captains
                    and subordinate commanders. They are armed with breech-loading rifles, partly on
                    the “Wänzl” pattern, and partly on the “Werndl.” The troops armed with the
                    former carry 60 rounds, those armed with the latter 72 rounds of ammunition; and
                    the regimental ammunition waggons carry in addition 30 rounds for the former and
                    36 for the latter. The old white tunic, long distinctive of the Austrian army,
                    has been abolished, and replaced by a serviceable blue-grey uniform. The
                    Hungarian régiments are distinguished by wearing pantaloons, fitting close to
                    the leg and going inside the boot, instead of the trousers worn by the rest of
                    the infantry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cavalry.—</hi> The cavalry consists of 14 regiments of
                    dragoons, 16. of hussars, and 11 of lancers. The cuirassiers were converted into
                    dragoons after the war of 1866 (only 2 dragoon regiments existed at the outbreak
                    of that war), and the distinction between the heavy and light cavalry was
                    abolished at the same time. The dragoon regiments are mostly raised in the
                    German provinces of Austria, the hussars in Hungary, and the lancers in the
                    Polish provinces.</p>
                <p>A cavalry regiment consists of 6 field squadrons, a dépôt, and a reserve
                    squadron. The 6 field squadrons are kept permanently on a war footing, and form
                    the field regiment which in peace time is stationed according to the <hi
                    rend="italic">ordre</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bataille,</hi> and in war joins the active army: its establishment is 30
                    officers, 996 non-commissioned officers and men, and 900 horses. The reserve
                    squadron does not exist in peace time, but is formed on mobilisation from the
                    depot, and has the same establishment as a field squadron (171 men and 150
                    horses); it is chiefly employed as “staff” cavalry,—to furnish orderlies, escort
                    convoys, watch lines of communication, &lt;fcc. The depot squadron is maintained
                    as a <hi rend="italic">cadre</hi> only (19 of all ranks) in peace time, but in
                    war time, besides forming the reserve squadron, is itself raised to a strength
                    of a field squadron. The dépôt <hi rend="italic">cadre</hi> is permanently
                    stationed in the recruiting district (a cavalry regiment recruits from one or
                    more adjoining infantry <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n667/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0667-0606"/> recruiting districts), and has charge of the
                    clothing, arms, and equipment of all kinds of the furlough and reserve men, and
                    the registers and muster-rolls, but· has nothing to do with the training of
                    either recruits or young horses, who are sent direct to the field squadrons. In
                    recruiting for the cavalry, young men of strong frame, accustomed to horses, and
                    of a minimum height of 5 feet 3⅛∙ inches, are selected. The remounts of horses
                    are bought by commissions, and are trained and broken at the headquarters of the
                    field squadrons; 12 per cent, of its establishment being the maximum number of
                    remounts allowed yearly to a regiment. The Austrian cavalry has always borne a
                    very high reputation, and its drill is considered by competent judges to be the
                    best in Europe. Much of the old pedantry of drill has recently been swept away,
                    and replaced by a more serviceable system. The soldiers now rise in their
                    stirrups, ride with both hands, and only draw swords when necessary. The
                    instruction of recruits and training of the horses falls almost entirely on the
                    subaltern officers of the field squadrons—commencing on the 1st October, when
                    the annual contingent of recruits is called in, and lasting till the end of
                    June, when the tactical instruction of the squadron is supposed to be complete;
                    from July to September is devoted to drilling in regiments and larger bodies.
                    The hussars and dragoons are armed with breech-loading carbines and swords; of
                    the lancers, 32 men per squadron carry carbines, the rest lances, pistol, and
                    sword.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artillery.—</hi> The artillery consists of 13 regiments of
                    field artillery and 12 battalions of garrison artillery. A regiment of field
                    artillery on peace establishment consists of 12 batteries, viz., four 4-pounder
                    field batteries, three 4-pounder horse batteries, and five 8-pounder field
                    batteries; and the <hi rend="italic">cadres</hi> for two more 8-pounder
                    batteries, a depot battery, and five ammunition columns. The batteries have only
                    4 guns horsed in peace. The <hi rend="italic">cadres</hi> of the depot and two
                    8-pounder batteries remain at the headquarter station of the recruiting
                    district; the other batteries are stationed and detached according to
                    circumstances. In war the batteries are raised to a strength of 170 or 200 men,
                    with 8 guns, 8 ammunition and 6 other waggons, and 109 to 147 horses. Two
                    additional 8-pounder field batteries and a depot battery are formed by each
                    regiment from its <hi rend="italic">cadres,</hi> and 5 (in some regiments 6)
                    ammunition columns. A field artillery regiment on war establishment thus numbers
                    14 batteries or 112 guns; and as a rule a regiment is attached to each army
                    corps of 3 infantry divisions Of the ammunition columns, 3 carry artillery and
                    infantry ammunition in about equal proportions (12 infantry ammunition waggons
                    and 14 artillery waggons), and are attached, one to each infantry division; the
                    others carry principally artillery ammunition, and small-arm ammunition for the
                    cavalry, &lt;fcc., and are attached to the army corps headquarters or the army
                    ammunition park. The Austrian field guns are rifled muzzle-loaders, of bronze.
                    The 4-pounders and their ammunition waggons have four horses in the field
                    batteries, and six in the horse batteries; the 8-pounders and their ammunition
                    waggons are six-horsed. A 4-pounder battery carries 156 rounds per gun an
                    8-pounder 128 rounds. The remounts of horses are obtained by purchase as in the
                    cavalry, but a larger and heavier class of horse is selected for the
                    artillery.</p>
                <p>A battalion of garrison artillery consists of 6 companies, of which in peace time
                    5 are maintained on a peace establishment of 113 of all ranks, and 1 on a <hi
                    rend="italic">cadre</hi> establishment. In war they are all augmented to a
                    strength of 234. The companies of garrison artillery are employed in the defence
                    or attack of fortresses. A small number of mountain batteries, armed with
                    3-pounder rifled bronze mountain guns, are attached to the garrison
                    battalions.</p>
                <p>The artillery further includes a certain number of “artillery reserve
                    establishments” (siege parks, reserve ammunition parks, &amp;c.), which are only
                    organised in war, and the “artülery material department,” which is charged with
                    the construction and supply of all warlike stores in peace, and in war has
                    further to furnish companies of field artificers to the siege parks and
                    artillery reserve establishments. The great factory and depot for all artillery
                    <hi rend="italic">materiel</hi> is the artillery arsenal at Vienna, an
                    establishment of. great antiquity and celebrity. The principal powder factory is
                    at Stein, near Laibach. Laboratories are established at Wiener-Neustadt, at
                    Vienna, in immediate connection with-the arsenal, and at most of the principal
                    artillery stations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Engineers.—</hi> The engineers include two regiments of
                    engineers and one of pioneers. A regiment of <hi rend="italic">engineers</hi>
                    consists of 5' field battalions of 4 companies, 8 reserve companies, and a depot
                    battalion. In peace time the reserve companies and depot battalions are
                    maintained in <hi rend="italic">cadre</hi> only. In war time all the companies
                    are raised to a strength of about 230 of all .ranks; the field battalions
                    accompany the active army, a company bèing usually attached to each infantry
                    division, and a battalion to the army reserve; the reserve companies are
                    employed on the lines of communication. The general duties of the engineers
                    consist in carrying out all works connected with the investment, attack, and
                    defence of fortresses, strengthening positions, opening communications, &lt;fcc.
                    The <hi rend="italic">pioneers</hi> form 1 regiment of 5 battalions; each
                    battalion composed of 4 field companies, 1 reserve company (in <hi rend="italic"
                    >cadre</hi> only in peace time), and a <hi rend="italic">materiel</hi> reserve.
                    In time of war each battalion forms a depot company as well. The pioneers are
                    chargéd with the pontoon equipment; the construction of all bridges; and the
                    construction, repair,, and working or destruction of railways and telegraphs.
                    They form 15 “field railway divisions” in war, 5 of which are kept mobilised in
                    time of peace, to afford instruction in this most important branch of modern
                    military engineering. The officers of the pioneer corps are trained at the cadet
                    school at Hainburg. Special care is taken in the selection of recruits for the
                    engineer and pioneer regiments. As a rule, they must be of a minimum height of 5
                    feet 6 inches, of considerable physical strength, and of some education; and
                    most of them must be mechanics. The standard of height is, however, relaxed in
                    the case of skilled workmen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Military Train.—</hi> The transport of the Austrian army is
                    provided for partly by the military train, partly by the regimental transport
                    attached to the several arms. The military train consists of 36 field squadrons,
                    36 reserve squadrons (in <hi rend="italic">cadre</hi> only in peace time), 6
                    dépôt squadrons, and 6 <hi rend="italic">matériel</hi> depots. In peace time the
                    train forms a mere nucleus, capable of expansion in war, and supplies the
                    transport required by the military authorities in some of the chief garrison
                    towns; its whole strength is only 2500 men, with 500 waggens and 1250 horses. In
                    war time it is raised to a total of nearly 31,000 men, with 12,000 waggons and
                    36,000 horses. The 36 field squadrons are raised to a strength which varies from
                    173 men and 197 horses, to 547 men and 718 horses, according to the special
                    duties they have to perform. The 36 reserve squadrons are raised to the same
                    strength, and a similar number of “Ersatz” divisions are formed to carry out the
                    duties which in peace time were performed by the field squadrons. On
                    .mobilisation the field squadrons, as a rule, transfer the horses actually in
                    their possession to the field artillery; and are themselves completed in horses
                    partly by purchase and partly by requisition, and in men.</p>

                <p>from the reserve, who have been trained in their ranks, and from the cavalry
                    reserve men who are not required to complete the cavalry regiments. When an army
                    takes the field, one squadron of military train is allotted to. each infantry or
                    cavalry division, one to each army and army corps headquarters, one to each
                    pioneer battalion for the transport of its bridge equipment, and one to the
                    artillery reserve <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> and ammunition park. A squadron
                    attached to an infantry or cavalry division is formed into five sections, of
                    which the first provides the necessary transport for the divisional and brigade
                    staffs and the field hospital; the second, third, and fourth for the provision
                    column; while the fifth or reserve section supplies all necessary reliefs and
                    minor miscellaneous requirements. Regimental transport is provided for by the
                    regimental train, each infantry regiment having permanently attached to it 8
                    baggage waggons, 6 commissariat store waggons, and 3 ammunition waggons; and
                    each cavalry regiment, 4 baggage and 13 supply waggons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">'General Organisation and Administration of the Army.—</hi>
                    Since 1867 the Austrian empire has consisted of two distinct states, a German or
                    Cis-Leithan empire, commonly known as Austria proper, and a Magyar, or
                    Trans-Leithan, kingdom, known as Hungary. Each of these countries has its own
                    parliament, ministers, and government. The connecting ties between them-are a
                    common hereditary sovereign, a governing body known as the Delegations, and a
                    common army and navy. The war strength of 800,000, at which the naval and
                    military forces of the empire are fixed, is distributed between Austria and
                    Hungary in proportion to their populations; Austria contributing 470,368, and
                    Hungary 329,632. The annual contingents are divided in similar proportions. The
                    cost of the maintenance of the army, which in 1871 was estimated at £10,500,000,
                    is charged in the budget for the “common affairs of the empire,” laid before the
                    Delegations. A portion of this is met by the proceeds of the customs, and other
                    sources of revenue set apart to meet the common expenditure; the rest is
                    defrayed by the two states in the proportion of ∙⅛ths from Austria, and -⅛ths
                    from Hungary. The emperor is commander-in-chief of the army; the military and
                    administrative business is centred in the War Department, which is presided over
                    by the War Minister and his deputy. The empire is divided into 16 military
                    territorial districts. Of. these, 7 are called “general commands,” and have
                    general officers of high rank specially appointed to them’; the remainder are
                    termed “military commands,” and are commanded by the senior divisional commander
                    stationed in the district. Each commander of a district is assisted by a general
                    officer of lower rank, who has special duties to perform, and takes the place of
                    the commander in the event of the latter being called away on mobilisation. The
                    military districts again are <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> Subdivided into 80
                    regimental recruiting districts, corresponding to the 80 infantry regiments,
                    each under the superintendence of the reserve commander or second colonel of the
                    regiment, whose duties correspond closely to the landwehr battalion commanders
                    in the Prussian organisation.</p>
                <p>The Austrians have no permanent corps organisation; their standing army is formed
                    into independent divisions, which have no fixed stations, but are distributed
                    about the empire according to circumstances, and occasionally relieve one
                    another. There are 32 such divisions, of 2 infantry brigades each, 18 of these
                    have cavalry brigades attached to them. In war time 3 infantry divisions, with a
                    regiment of artillery and proportion of cavalry, would usually l&gt;e united to
                    form an army corps; but the division remains the principal unit of organisation.
                    The following gives the strength and details of an Austrian infantry division in
                    the field :—</p>

                <p>The Austrian army, though long the most perfectly equipped in Europe, and always
                    distinguished for its appearance, its discipline, the strong <hi rend="italic"
                    >esprit de corps</hi> of its officers, and the scientific training of its staff,
                    has yet the most unfortunate history of all the great European armies. Defeated
                    repeatedly by Frederick in the Seven Years’ War, by Napoleon in the
                    Revolutionary wars, and later by the French in 1859 and the Prussians in 1866,
                    the Italians are the only nation over, whom it can claim to have been generally
                    -victorious. Yet its spirit has always remained unbroken; and however severe the
                    defeat, however disastrous the campaign, no reverse ever brought Austria to the
                    condition of Prussia after Jena, or of France after Sedan. There are several
                    causes to which this almost uniform ill-success may be attributed. Trusting to
                    diplomacy rather than force of arms, her strategy has always been cautious and
                    vacillating. The hands of her generals have repeatedly been held when in the act
                    of striking. But the same, caution which often prevented her reaping the
                    successes actually within her reach, or retrieving disasters which were not yet
                    irremediable, also left her always with a reserve and a show of power still
                    formidable. Austria has also suffered from the heterogeneous composition of her
                    army. Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Poles, Croats, Italians, served together
                    under officers who frequently could not communicate with their men. The Germans,
                    or Austrians proper, are loyal and faithful to the house of Hapsburg; but the
                    other nationalities were not only indifferent, but frequently hostile, and
                    instances of whole regiments surrendering to the enemy rather than fight for a
                    cause they detested, are common in the history of her wars. The only ties by
                    which this heterogeneous mass was bound together, was a strict and somewhat
                    harsh discipline, and the strong loyalty and <hi rend="italic">esprit de
                    corps</hi> of its body of officers. The Austrian officers have always been
                    distinguished by a <hi rend="italic">cameraderie</hi> peculiar to themselves.
                    Officers of various nations and of very different social standing meet on terms
                    of perfect equality and intimacy as the “emperor’s servants,” and no
                    distinctions are acknowledged within the. army save those of military rank. The
                    general physique and intelligence of the rank and file of the army is rather
                    below than above the average. Some of the Hungarian regiments are fine bodies of
                    men, but the standard in other parts of tho empire is very low, and education
                    has made but little progress in the outlying provinces. The men are generally
                    docile and somewhat phlegmatic, but have neither the <hi rend="italic">élan</hi>
                    of the French nor the stubbornness of the northern nations.</p>
                <p>Since 1866 a great change has taken place in the character of the Austrian
                    forces. The disastrous campaigns of 1859 and 1866 shook the confidence of the
                    nation in that fine imperial army that ever showed so gallantly on parade, and
                    yet seemed ever to suffer defeat in the field.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0669-0608"/>
                <p>The army was reorganised on something of the Prussian model, universal personal
                    service introducing a more intelligent and more highly educated element into the
                    ranks° The cession of her last possessions in Italy, and the independent
                    constitution granted to Hungary, removed the principal causes of disaffection.
                    Her regimental officers, who formerly, though gallant and loyal gentlemen, were
                    not distinguished for study of their profession, are now subjected to tests more
                    severe than in any other country; while the constant renewal of the rank and
                    file, and even of the non-commissioned officers, under the three years’ system,
                    throws on them almost the whole of the arduous and ever-recurring labour of
                    training the annual contingents of recruits. Her rigid drill has given place to
                    one of exceptional freedom. Even the outward appearance of the army is changed;
                    and the gay uniforms for which Austria was once celebrated have given place to
                    more sober and serviceable ones. Whatever may be the result of the next struggle
                    she finds herself engaged in, none who have watched her military development
                    will deny that she deserves success, so far as success can be earned by a frank
                    acceptance of the lessons taught in her disasters, by honest and persevering
                    efforts to remedy the defects, laid bare, and by the loyal devotion with which
                    the officers and the country have accepted the new and arduous duties thrown on
                    them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Russian Army.</hi></p>
                <p>Of all European powers, Russia maintains by far the largest army. In 1870 its
                    peace establishment amounted to three-quarters of a million, and its war
                    establishment to a million and a quarter; and when the changes which were
                    commenced in that year have taken full effect, her available war strength will
                    be increased to nearly two millions. But even this enormous force is not
                    excessive when measured by the vast extent of her possessions (7,500,000 square
                    miles), or her population (82 millions); it is calculated that a levy of 25 per
                    cent, of the young men coming annually of age will suffice for the requirements
                    of the army, and that military service will thus fall more lightly in Russia
                    than in any other great nation of the Continent.</p>
                <p>Before the recent changes the Russian army was a reflex of the social condition
                    of the country. As in civil life there was practically no middle class, so in
                    the army there was a wide gulf between the officer and the soldier. The officers
                    were mainly drawn from the nobility, every young man of rank being practically
                    compelled to serve; the soldiers were entirely drawn from the serfs. Although
                    every one was nominally liable to serve, numerous exemptions were made in favour
                    of merchants, skilled mechanics, and others whose services were accounted more
                    valuable to the nation in their civil capacities, and the purchase of
                    substitutes was allowed; so that actually the recruits were drawn almost
                    entirely from the lowest class of agricultural labourers. Service was nominally
                    for life, though after a certain number of years the soldier was allowed his
                    discharge on pension. The army was recruited by an annual levy of so many per
                    thousand of the male population (usually from 4 to 6); the number of men
                    required from each village or district being notified, and the headmen and
                    elders charged with furnishing them. The power thus placed in the hands of the
                    small local authorities was most despotically used, and a youth who had incurred
                    the displeasure, of his superiors was surely drafted off to the army. Although
                    the army carried with it the advantages of ultimate freedom and a pension, the
                    time in the ranks was so long, its hardships so great, and the pay so miserably
                    small, that the service was very unpopular, and severe measures were necessary
                    to prevent the recruits deserting on their way to the depots. Subsequent to the
                    Crimean war, however, various steps were taken to improve the condition of the
                    soldier; the term of service in the ranks, first fixed at twenty years, was
                    reduced to fifteen, and a system of unlimited furloughs introduced, under which
                    the soldiet was sent to his home after seven or eight years’ service, though
                    liable to recall if needed. The liberation of the serfs in 1861 paved the way
                    for still further reforms, and by an imperial ukase of the 4th (16th) November
                    1870, the principle of universal personal liability to service was established.
                    By the new army organisation law, every Russian is liable to service on
                    attaining his twenty-first year. The purchase of exemption or of substitutes is
                    prohibited; but it seems doubtful whether this clause will be fully enforced,
                    and hitherto the purchase of exemption at a fixed rate of 800 roubles (about
                    £120) has been permitted. The conscription takes place annually between the 1st
                    November and 15th December, when the number required to complete the active army
                    (estimated at about 25 per cent, of those liable to service) are chosen by lot.
                    . The period of service is fifteen years,—of which four are spent in the ranks;
                    two years on furlough, liable to recall at any moment; and nine years in the
                    reserves, which can only be called out in case of war or national danger. In the
                    cavalry and horse artillery, the time with the colours is extended to five
                    years, and that in the reserve is shortened. Those who are not’ drawn for the
                    active army are put through a short course of training, and then sent to their
                    homes; but for six years they remain liable to be called in to replace
                    casualties in the active army in case of war. After this they pass into the
                    national legions, which include all able-bodied men* between the ages of 20 and
                    38 not actually serving in the army or navy. As in Prussia, certain advantages
                    are given to young men of means and good education, who are allowed to shorten
                    their period of service in the ranks. Special regulations apply to the Ukraine
                    and provinces which furnish the Cossacks and other irregular troops.</p>
                <p>The military resources of Russia thus consist of the <hi rend="italic">active
                    army,</hi> or men serving with the colours; the <hi rend="italic">reserves,</hi>
                    who have completed their period in the ranks, but rejoin the army in case of
                    war; the <hi rend="italic">irregular troops,</hi> or Cossacks; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">national legions,</hi> or armed levies, only called out in
                    exceptional cases, such as invasion. The regular army is formed by the active
                    army, completed in time of war from the reserves, and is divided into <hi
                    rend="italic">field troops</hi> and <hi rend="italic">local troops,</hi> —the
                    former furnishing the armies for the field, the latter the garrisons, and the
                    dépôts at which the recruits are assembled and trained, and whence the field
                    troops are fed. The local troops, as their name implies, are permanently
                    localised; the field troops are not,'as in Prussia, connected with certain
                    districts, but draw their recruits indiscriminately from the whole empire, and
                    are moved from one part to another as occasion demands.</p>
                <p>The field troops of the regular army consist of 612 battalions of infantry, 236
                    squadrons of cavalry, 16 battalions of sappers and engineers, and 306 batteries
                    of guns and mitrailleuses. They are divided into guards and line, each having
                    its due proportion of all arms, and are organised in detail as follows :—</p>

                    servants, &lt;fcc. A regiment on war establishment numbers 81 officers, 270
                    non-commissioned officers, 2700 rank and file, 96 drummers and buglers, and 259

                <p>The Russian infantry is formed in two ranks. On parade the four line companies of
                    a battalion stand in order from right to left, while the rifle company stands at
                    fifty paces in rear of the centre; but for manoeuvring purposes the three rifle
                    companies of the regiment are often united to form a separate battalion. The
                    guards still maintain on parade much of the stiffness and precision for which
                    the Russian army was once famous; but generally the movements of the infantry
                    are loose and rapid. In the main their drill resembles that of the German army;
                    the commonest formation for march and manoeuvring is the company column of
                    sections. The men are armed with the “Berdan” breech-loading rifle, a bayonet
                    (which is always carried fixed), and a short two-edged sword. They carry 60
                    rounds of ammunition in two pouches, and 40 rounds are carried in the regimental
                    -ammunition carts, so that there is always present with the regiment 100 rounds
                    per man; and the divisional reserves carry 60 rounds per man besides. A certain
                    number of entrenching tools are issued to each company, and on service are
                    carried by the men in turns. The <hi rend="italic">clothing</hi> is of somewhat
                    coarse texture, but very serviceable; that of the guards is of slightly finer
                    material than is supplied to the rest of the army. All infantry alike wear tunic
                    and trousers of dark green cloth (or white linen trousers in summer time), long
                    boots into which the trousers are tucked in the field or for marching, cap or
                    “kepi” of black cloth with straight peak, metal badge, and horse-hair plume, and
                    cloak of reddish-grey cloth with a dark-coloured hood. The tunics of the guard
                    are turned back in front, and faced with red or yellow. Regiments are
                    distinguished by the colour of the “paroli” (a strip of cloth worn on the
                    collar) and of the shoulder straps. The belts of the first three regiments of
                    the guard and grenadier divisions (with the exception of the rifle companies)
                    are white; those of all others black. The knapsack is rather large, and made of
                    black calf-skin. A white smock frock, intended as a fatigue dress, is worn in
                    summer at drill.</p>
                <p>A Russian regiment is very completely equipped with transport. Every company has
                    two waggons attached to it, one carrying ammunition (40 rounds per man), the
                    other six days’ rations of biscuit, salt, and other provisions and stores. In
                    addition to these the regiment has an orderlyroom waggon, a paymaster’s waggon,
                    a store and implement waggon, four ambulance waggons, and two hospital and
                    medicine carts. All these are kept in store in peace time with the headquarters
                    of the regiment; but only one waggon per company is horsed. In war time most of
                    the waggons are four-horsed; but some still have shafts, and are drawn by three
                    horses abreast.</p>
                <p>The regimental staff comprises 1 colonel, 3 lieutenantcolonels, 1 supernumerary
                    field officer, a regimental adjutant, paymaster, quartermaster, and instructor
                    in arms, 3 battalion adjutants, a chaplain, and 4 surgeons. In the field each
                    company is attended by an apothecary, provided with the necessary appliances;
                    and the officers’ servants and other unarmed men are taught the elementary
                    principles of military surgery, and trained to the duties of
                    stretcher-bearers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cavalry.—</hi> The regular cavalry consists of 10 regiments of
                    the guard, 18 regiments of dragoons, 14 regiments of lancers, and 14 regiments
                    of hussars.</p>
                <p>The cavalry of the guard comprise 4 regiments of cuirassiers, 2 of lancers, 2 of
                    hussars, 1 of dragoons, and 1 of horse grenadiers. ‘ There are also 2 regiments
                    of Cossacks of the guard, who in peace time furnish 2 squadrons each for duty,
                    and in war take the field with 6 squadrons, and may fairly be included among the
                    regular troops.</p>
                <p>All regiments of cavalry are organised in the same manner, and consist of 4 field
                    squadrons and 1 reserve squadron, the latter belonging to the “local troops.”
                    They have two establishments, viz., “war,” of 128 men per squadron (mounted);
                    and “peace,” of 112 men per squadron. The war establishment of a cavalry
                    regiment-is 32 officers, 73 non-commissioned officers, 512 rank and file, 16
                    trumpeters, and 305 non-combatants, including dismounted men in reserve,
                    officers’ servants, artificers, àc.; or a total of 938 officers and men, with
                    693 horses and 11 carriages. The formation and manoeuvres of the Russian cavalry
                    do not differ materially from those of other armies of Europe, except in the
                    case of dragoons, who are armed with a rifle and bayonet, and specially trained
                    to act as infantry. In all other cavalry the front rank is armed with a lance in
                    addition to sword and revolver. The rear rank is armed with sword and carbine in
                    lancer and hussar regiments, and sword and revolver in cuirassier regiments. The
                    cuirassiers wear white tunics with shoulder scales, cuirass, and helmet; the
                    dragoons a dark green tunic, with scales and cloth cap; the lancers, a blue
                    tunic with metal epaulettes, and the czapka, or lancer cap; and the hussars, a
                    blue tunic and cloth cap. Only the hussars of the guard wear bearskin caps and
                    pelisses. The guards have parade trousers of black or dark blue with stripes;
                    but in the field, trousers or pantaloons of a greyish blue cloth are worn by all
                    cavalry alike. The saddlery is simple in construction, though somewhat heavy and
                    cumbrous. Four separate folds of felt, each ∣ inch thick, support a wooden frame
                    previously fitted to the horse’s bare back; on the wooden frame is strapped the
                    horse rug, and the saddle is complete. When one fold of felt is wet or hardened
                    by dried perspiration, it is replaced by another, and sore backs are almost
                    unknown. The men as a rule ride fairly well, though not so well as the Austrian
                    or English cavalry; and the peculiar seat, and height of the saddle above the
                    horse’s back, strike the eye as ungainly. The horses, though often small, are
                    hardy and enduring; they are provided partly from the Government breeding
                    establishments and partly by purchase, and come mostly from the south-eastern
                    provinces of the empire. They are not taken on the strength of the regiment
                    until rising six years old, and are cast on completing their twelfth year; this
                    securing that they shall always be in their prime, and fit for the severe work
                    of active service.</p>
                <p>The staff of a cavalry regiment consists of a lieutenantcolonel commanding, two
                    field-officers commanding divisions (of two squadrons each), and regimental
                    adjutant, paymaster, quartermaster, and instructor in arms. Each regiment has
                    also a chaplain, two surgeons, and a veterinary surgeon. Each squadron has its
                    provision waggon, and each regiment has an ambulance waggon, and three store and
                    office waggons. Dragoon regiments have two ammunition waggons carrying 30 rounds
                    per man; other regiments have only one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artillery.—</hi> The field artillery consists of 3 brigades of
                    field and 1 of horse artillery of the guard; 44 brigades of field and 7 of horse
                    artillery of the line; and 3 Turkestan brigades.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0671-0610"/>
                <p>A brigade of field artillery consists of six batteries, viz., three heavy, two
                    light, and one of mitrailleuses. The horse artillery brigade of the guard
                    comprises five light batteries (including one of the Don Cossacks of the guard);
                    the remaining horse brigades have only two batteries each. The Turkestan
                    brigades vary slightly in composition. The Russian artillery thus numbers—143
                    heavy field batteries; 100 light field batteries; 19 batteries of horse
                    artillery; 4 mountain batteries; and 50 batteries of mitrailleuses; or a total
                    of 2128 guns and 400 mitrailleuses.</p>
                <p>A battery has three establishments—“peace,” with only 4 guns and 2 waggons
                    horsed; “increased peace,” with 8 guns and 8 waggons; and “war,” with 8 guns and
                    16 (or 24) waggons. On war establishment a heavy field battery numbers 6
                    officers, 316 non-commissioned officers and men (including artificers, &amp;c.),
                    and 214 horses; with 8 guns, 24 ammunition waggons, and 9 provision and store
                    carriages. A light battery has 261 officers and men, 160 horses, 8 guns, 16
                    ammunition and 8 other waggons and carriages. The guns are of bronze or cast
                    steel, breechloading and rifled on the Prussian system. The mitrailleuse
                    batteries are armed with a 10-barrelled gun on the Gatling system, slightly
                    modified by the Russian general Gorloff. A heavy battery carries 120 rounds per
                    gun, a light battery 130, and a mitrailleuse battery a total of 6290 rounds. The
                    harness is rough and clumsy, with long rope traces. The dress of the men of the
                    field batteries is similar to that of the infantry, and that of the horse
                    artillery to that of the dragoons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Engineers.—</hi> The corps is divided into sappers and
                    pon-toniers. The sappers form 11 field battalions, 1 field company (Turkestan),
                    and four reserve battalions (local troops); also 2 engineer field parks, 2 siege
                    parks, and 6 field telegraph parks. The pontoniers form 6 half-battalions. A
                    field battalion of sappers consists of 4 companies, and has a war establishment
                    of 900 rank and file, and a peace establishment of 600. The half-battalions of
                    pontoniers consist of two companies, and have a war establishment of 13
                    officers, 469 non-commissioned officers and men, with 392 horses, 52 pontoon and
                    10 other waggons and carriages; and carry 26 iron pontoons and 12 trestles,
                    sufficient to form 700 feet of bridge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organisation of the Field Army.—</hi> The organisation of the
                    Russian army is entirely divisional; two or more divisions »may be brought
                    together to form an army corps, but no such organisation exists permanently. The
                    infantry is formed in 47 divisions, viz., 3 of guards, 3 of grenadiers, 1 of
                    Caucasus grenadiers, and 40 of the line. Each division consists of 4 regiments
                    or 12 battalions (with the exception of the divisions of the Caucasus, which
                    have 16 battalions), and has attached to it a brigade of field artillery, but no
                    cavalry or rifles. The rifles are organised in separate brigades of 4 battalions
                    each, and form 8 brigades (1 guard, 1 of the Caucasus, 1 of Turkestan, and 5 of
                    the line); and the cavalry in cavalry divisions of six regiments, to each of
                    which is attached a brigade of horse artillery. With the exception of the guards
                    (of whom two divisions are always stationed in St Petersburg) and some of the
                    troops of the Caucasus and Turkestan, these divisions have no permanent
                    stations, but relieve one another from time to time. Five infantry and two
                    cavalry divisions are usually stationed in the St Petersburg district; 15
                    infantry and 2 cavalry divisions in the Warsaw and 'Vilna districts (Poland and
                    Polish frontier); 8 infantry and 2 cavalry in Kiev and Odessa (south-eastern
                    provinces); 7 infantry and 1 cavalry in Moscow; and 6 infantry and 1 cavalry in
                    the Caucasus. Of the cavalry, the guard divisions and three line divisions are
                    usually maintained on war footing, the remainder on the peace establishment; the
                    artillery all on peace establishment. Of the infantry, a few battalions in
                    Turkestan are alone maintained on war footing; the divisions in the Caucasus are
                    mostly on the “increased peace” establishment; the guards and grenadier
                    divisions, and those occupying Warsaw and the great fortresses, on “peace”
                    footing; and those distributed about the interior on <hi rend="italic"
                    >cadre</hi> establishment.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Local Troops.—</hi> That portion of the Russian army which is
                    stationary in peace is distinguished by the name of “local troops;” and these
                    again are divided into “reserve and dépôt troops” and “troops for service in the
                    interior.” The reorganisation of these forces was commenced in 1873, but will
                    take some years to complete.</p>
                <p>According to the new organisation, the reserve and dépôt troops will consist of
                    120 local battalions of infantry, each forming on mobilisation a three-battalion
                    reserve regiment and a depot battalion; 56 reserve squadrons of cavalry; 24
                    local batteries of artillery, forming in war 24 reserve artillery brigades (96
                    batteries) and 24 dépôt batteries; and 5 reserve companies of sappers. In peace
                    time they are little more than <hi rend="italic">cadres,</hi> distributed
                    according to population, and are charged with the training of recruits and
                    reserve and furlough men. In war they form a reserve army of 30 infantry
                    divisions and 24 artillery brigades, or about 420,000 men and 768 guns,
                    available to reinforce the field army; and dépôts numbering about 85,000
                    men.</p>
                <p>The “troops for duty in the interior” consist—First, of 48 “frontier battalions,”
                    of which 24 are stationed in the Caucasus, 12 in Turkestan, and the remainder in
                    the military districts of Orenburg and Eastern and Western Siberia. They are
                    organised in all respects like the rest of the infantry, and have a war
                    establishment of 1074, and a peace establishment of 615 of all ranks. Secondly,
                    of “garrison infantry and artillery,” intended for the defence of fortresses,
                    and numbering 98 battalions and 59 (in war time 91) artillery companies.
                    Thirdly, of “government battalions” and “local detachments,” who do garrison
                    duty in the capitals and towns, and act as police, guards, &amp;c.; of these
                    there are 70 battalions and 400 separate detachments, distributed throughout the
                    empire, maintained on a reduced establishment in peace, but raised to a total
                    war strength of 120,000 men when the field army is mobilised. Lastly, of
                    “etappen detachments,” stationed on the military roads, and charged with
                    furnishing escorts to recruits and prisouers, and providing them with lodging
                    and subsistence; and local artillery detachments, charged with the care of
                    artillery material stored in large towns.</p>
                <p>The total strength of the “local troops,” when the new organisation has been
                    completed, will amount to about 784,000 men and 816 guns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Irregular Troops.—</hi> The irregular troops or Cossacks have
                    always borne a most important share in the wars of Russia. In 1812 more than
                    100,000 were raised, and the services they rendered in that and the following
                    campaigns made their name famous and a terror throughout Europe. In 1856 they
                    raised 184,000 men, of whom about three-fourths were cavalry; but the Crimean
                    war did not give the opportunity of utilising this class of troops.</p>
                <p>The Cossacks have always been a race of free men; neither serfage nor any
                    dependence upon the land has existed among them. It has been the policy of the
                    Russian Government to foster their martial spirit, and various privileges have
                    been granted to them with this object. They <pb break="no"

                    service, from the age of 19 to 40. Only a portion of this time is actually spent
                    in the ranks; but in war time, by order of the emperor, the whole male
                    population between the ages of 15 and 60 may be called to arms. The Cossacks are
                    organised in “polks” or regiments of light cavalry, about 900 strong, and formed
                    usually of six “sotnias” or squadrons; in battalions of infantry, about 1100
                    strong; and horse artillery batteries of 8 guns. In peace time a few squadrons
                    are stationed at St Petersburg and Warsaw, furnishing escorts to the emperor and
                    viceroy. The rest are distributed about the Cossack provinces and on the
                    frontiers, maintaining the lines of communication in the wild Asiatic provinces.
                    The force under arms in 1871 amounted to 66,000, forming 323 sotnias or
                    squadrons, 35 companies of infantry, and 12 batteries. In war time this can be

                    There is as yet no regular organisation for the militia, nor have the men been
                    drilled; notwithstanding this, on the three occasions on which they have been
                    called out (viz., 1807, 1812, and 1855), they have always been rapidly formed,
                    and have done good service to the country. In 1855 the number actually raised
                    was 366,000. The number liable to service in 1871 was over 500,000; and as the
                    new law comes fully into action that number will be enormously increased.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organisation and Administration.—</hi> The emperor is the
                    Commander-in-Chief of the army, and exercises his authority through the War
                    Minister. The War Ministry is divided into twelve sections or departments,
                    including the imperial headquarters or military cabinet of the emperor; the
                    council of war, which is the highest legislative and administrative authority in
                    the empire; the headquarter staff; and the artillery, engineer, intendance,
                    medical, &amp;c., departments. For purposes of military administration the
                    empire is divided into 14 military districts, corresponding to the civil
                    “general governments,” and 51 governments or military sub-districts. At the head
                    of each military district is a general, who is also viceroy or governor-general,
                    and has the supreme control of all affairs, civil as well as military. The local
                    forces belonging to each military district are commanded by a local divisional
                    commander, and the forces of each government by a local brigadier. In addition
                    to the command of the local troops, these officers are charged with the keeping
                    of the muster-rolls of men on furlough, &lt;fcc., and generally with the
                    arrangements for mobilisation. The field troops stationed in the district are
                    under the command of their own divisional generals, subordinate to the district
                    general. The guards and some of the regiments stationed in the fortresses and
                    great towns are lodged in fairly comfortable barracks; but the accommodation
                    generally is quite insufficient. The erection of barracks for the whole army is
                    projected, and the necessary buildings have been commenced in many places; but
                    it must be long before the plan can be fully carried out. Meanwhile a large part
                    of the troops are billeted in the towns, and in some country districts are
                    distributed among the villages, living with the peasants, and for months without
                    seeing their officers or any opportunities for drill. During the summer months,
                    May to October, the regiments and divisions are brought together in large
                    standing camps for training, commencing with battalion and regimental drill,
                    rifle practice, instruction in field fortification, &lt;fcc., and concluding
                    with brigade and divisional field-days and great manoeuvres. In 1873, 445
                    infantry battalions, 238 squadrons, 93 sotnias of Cossacks, and 828 guns were
                    thus assembled at the various camps of instruction, the largest of which were at
                    Warsaw, where nearly 50,000 men were collected; and at Krasnoe Selo, near St
                    Petersburg, where about 30,000 men, principally of the guard, were encamped.</p>
                <p>The Russian guards, selected as they are with care from the vast military
                    population of the empire, are perhaps the finest body of men in Europe; and with
                    their brilliant and various uniforms, relieved by the Oriental picturesqueness
                    of the Cossack squadrons, certainly present the most gorgeous and imposing
                    military display to be seen anywhere. They have many special privileges, and all
                    officers of the guards rank two grades higher than the corresponding ones of the
                    line. The ordinary line soldier is rather below the average of European armies
                    both in physique and intelligence; but he is generally a good marcher, capable
                    of enduring great hardship and fatigue, and is good-natured, cheerful, obedient
                    by instinct and habit, and imbued with a certain religious and superstitious
                    loyalty, which is always apowerful motor, and at times can be excited to
                    fanaticism. Of all their commanders, Suwaroff knew best how to appeal to this
                    semi-barbarous and superstitious instinct, and to this he owed much of his
                    extraordinary influence and brilliant successes. Generally, however, the
                    Russian’s strength lies rather in endurance than action; no army, the British
                    perhaps excepted, fights so stubbornly and will endure such heavy losses without
                    flinching. Hence the most bloody battles in modern history have been those
                    fought against Russian troops,—Zorndorf and Kunnersdorf in Frederick’s wars,
                    Eylau and Borodino in Napoleon’s time. Outwardly the discipline is good, though
                    the intercourse between men and officers retains somewhat of that mixture of
                    familiarity and servileness characteristic of a stage not far removed from
                    slavery; but it may be questioned whether it is of the kind that will withstand
                    the strain of war, or gives the officers that moral influence which alone tells
                    in moments of danger or discouragement. The non-existence of a class
                    corresponding to the lesser nobility of Germany or the gentry of England has
                    always made the officering of the Russian army a matter of peculiar difficulty.
                    The staff and scientific corps are largely officered by foreigners, mostly
                    Germans; in the infantry the want is supplied to a certain extent by promotion
                    from the ranks. The Russian army, like the nation, is in a transitional state.
                    The liberation of the serfs was a vast constitutional change which could not
                    make itself fully felt in less than a generation, and which affects the army as
                    well as the nation. The introduction of personal service, applied to all
                    classes, must materially alter its character. The Russian Government, fully
                    alive to the present defects of the army, and also to its importance as a means
                    of raising, educating, and disciplining the nation, is using every endeavour to
                    instruct and improve the soldier. Regimental schools have been established
                    throughout the army, at which the soldier is taught, either by or under the
                    immediate supervision of his officers, for many hours a day during the long
                    winter months. Higher class schools are also formed for the instruction of
                    non-commissioned officers, where they receive not only a military education,
                    embracing tactics, military history, field fortification, &amp;c., but also a
                    general education which qualifies them, on leaving the army, to become, as many
                    do, teachers in the national schools, or to fill civil appointments. The
                    physical training of the soldier is also attended to; gymnastics of all kinds
                    are constantly practised<pb break="no"

                    contrasts very markedly with the awkward, ungainly peasant.</p>
                <p>The military power of Russia has been vastly increased of late years by the
                    construction of the great strategic lines of railway which now traverse the
                    empire in all directions, and enable her to concentrate her vast resources with
                    ease and quickness. The immense extent of the empire has hitherto been an
                    insuperable obstacle to the full development of her power. In 1854-56 the
                    efforts made to hold the Crimea exhausted Russia more completely than a series
                    of defeats in the heart of the empire could have done. For every man who
                    actually reached the Crimea four were expended on the road from sickness and
                    fatigue, and the total losses suffered in this war were estimated at the
                    enormous amount of 450,000 men. Now reinforcements can be brought with ease by
                    rail from the most distant provinces, and for a concentration on her
                    south-western frontiers she has four distinct main lines of railway, connected
                    by branch ones with every important military station. It is not to be wondered
                    at that Prussia and Austria watch with uneasiness the development of the
                    military resources of their powerful neighbour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Italian Army.</hi></p>
                <p>The old Piedmontese law of conscription is the basis of the present military
                    organisation of Italy, as its constitution is of the constitution of the new
                    kingdom. The Piedmontese have long borne a high reputation among southern
                    nations for their military qualities. The dukes of Savoy have played a not
                    unimportant part in history, and showed special ability in preserving the
                    independence of their small kingdom between two such powerful neighbours as
                    France and Austria. During the wars of the French Revolution Piedmont was
                    temporarily absorbed into thé French republic; but the kingdom of Sardinia was
                    restored in 1815. Various causes combined to place Piedmont at the head of the
                    national and liberal movement which agitated Italy during the ensuing thirty
                    years, and bring her in direct antagonism to Austria. Charles Albert, her then
                    ruler, had paid great attention to the army, and when Italy rose against Austria
                    in 1848 he took the field with an excellent force of nearly 70,000 men. At the
                    outset fortune favoured the arms of Italy; but the genius and energy of
                    Radetsky, the veteran Austrian commander, soon turned the tide, and in the
                    summer of 1849 the Piedmontese army was decisively defeated at Novarra, and her
                    king compelled to sue for peace. Charles Albert abdicated in favour of his son
                    Victor Emanuel, a prince who had already distinguished himself by his personal
                    gallantry in the field. Under his care the army soon recovered its efficiency,
                    and the force which joined the allied armies in the Crimea attracted general
                    admiration from the excellence of its organisation, equipment, and discipline.
                    In 1859 Piedmont again took up arms against Austria for the liberation of Italy;
                    but this time she had the powerful assistance of France, and played but a
                    subordinate part herself. In this campaign the Sardinian army was composed of
                    one cavalry and five infantry divisions, and numbered about 60,000 combatants.
                    By the peace of Villa Franca, Italy, with the exception of Venetia, was freed
                    from the Austrians, and Lombardy was added to Piedmont. The revolutionary
                    campaign of Garibaldi in the following year united the whole peninsula under the
                    rule of Victor Emanuel, and in 1866, when Italy for the third time took up arms
                    against Austria—this time as the ally of Prussia—her forces had risen to nearly
                    450,000, of whom about 270,000 actually took the field. But in quality these
                    were far from being equal to the old Piedmontese army; and the northern army,
                    under the personal command of the king, was defeated at Custozza by a much
                    smaller force under the Archduke Albrecht of Austria. Since 1866 the army has
                    been somewhat reduced, but increased care given to its organisation and
                    training, and in manoeuvring power it now stands high among the armies of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The existing organisation of the Italian army is determined by the laws of 1873.
                    Every Italian is liable to personal service from the age of 18 to 40.
                    Substitution (except in the case of brothers) and exemption by payment are
                    abolished. Absolute exemption is only allowed to such as are physically unfit
                    for service. Partial exemptions are allowed to only sons of widows, supports of
                    families, &amp;c., who are passed at once into the local militia without serving
                    in the army. Temporary exemptions or “adjournments” may be granted for three
                    successive years on urgent personal or family reasons. Tho remainder of the
                    annual contingent is divided by lot into two classes. The first class serve
                    eight years in the army, four in the active militia, and the rest of their time
                    in the local militia. Of the eight years in the army, three in the infantry and
                    five in the cavalry are usually spent with the colours; the remainder on
                    furlough. Further, the Minister of War has the power to send home on furlough,
                    after a year’s service only, young men of exceptional character or intelligence,
                    school teachers, artists, &amp;c. The second class are liable to service in the
                    several forces for the same periods, but are considered as on unlimited
                    furlough, and only subjected to six months’ training. One-year volunteers are
                    received on the same conditions as in other armies. The numbers of the first
                    class contingent are determined annually by law, and are distributed among the
                    districts and cantons according to the number of men found fit for service. This
                    is estimated at from 90,000 to 95,000; and the contingent of the first class was
                    fixed in 1872 and 1873 at 65,000. The war strength of the army, exclusive of
                    local or “sedentary” militia, is estimated at 750,000, of whom 375,000 are in
                    the active army, or first line; 250,000 in the active militia, or second line;
                    and 125,000 in the depots. The peace establishment is fixed at 200,000.</p>
                <p>The Italian army consists of 80 regiments of the line, 10 of <hi rend="italic"
                    >l)Crsaglieri</hi> (riflemen), 20 regiments of cavalry, 10 of artillery, and 2
                    of engineers. A regiment of the Hne consists of 3 battalions of 4 companies
                    each, and numbers about 1500 men on peace and 3000 men on war footing, Eight of
                    the existing regiments are grenadiers. The <hi rend="italic">lersaglieri</hi>
                    are formed in regiments of four battalions each, and are picked troops, armed
                    with a shorter rifle, and especially trained to traverse long distances at a
                    run. They are frequently used in conjunction with cavalry, and it is proposed to
                    relieve them of their knapsacks, to increase their mobility still further. The
                    cavalry consists of 5 regiments of the line, 7 of lancers, 7 of light horse, and
                    1 of guides. Each regiment has six squadrons, with a war strength of 150 horses
                    per squadron. Of those squadrons, two are intended to be detached to the
                    infantry divisions in war time, while the remaining four form the corps cavalry.
                    The artillery comprises 10 regiments of field artillery, and 4 of garrison
                    artillery, besides a certain number of coast and artificer companies. A regiment
                    of field artillery consists of 10 batteries of 8 guns each, and 3 companies of
                    artillery train. A regiment of garrison artillery consists of 15 companies. The
                    engineers consist of a separate staff of officers, and 2 regiments, each divided
                    into 4 companies of pontoniers, 16 of sappers, and 3 of engineer train. In
                    addition to the above field organisation, every regiment of cavalry, infantry,
                    artillery, or engineers has a depot, which in peace time is maintained on <hi

                <p>Tn war time this force is organised in 20 divisions, forming 10 army corps,—each
                    corps comprised of 24 infantry battalions, 4 <hi rend="italic">bersaglieri</hi>
                    battalions, 2 cavalry regiments, and 10 field batteries, giving a fighting
                    strength of 28,000 infantry, 2000 cavalry, and 80 guns. The corps and divisional
                    organisation is not permanent in peace time; but the divisional staffs are kept
                    up in those of 16 territorial and 4 active divisions maintained in peace.</p>
                <p>The dépôts and active militia, or second line of troops, are maintained in <hi
                    rend="italic">cadre</hi> only in peace time; the depots on mobilisation are
                    raised to a strength of 125,000, or a third of the active army. For the militia
                    the <hi rend="italic">cadres</hi> of 960 companies of infantry, 60 companies of
                    <hi rend="italic">bersaglieri,</hi> 10 of engineers, and 60 of artillery, are
                    formed in peace time. On mobilisation these will give a force of about 250,000
                    men, of whom 200,000, with 40 batteries or 320 guns, could take the field if
                    necessary. The local or “sedentary” militia is not organised in peace time, and
                    is only called out in the last extremity, corresponding generally to the
                    landsturm of Germany.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of Italy is divided into 16“ territorial divisions,” and these again
                    are subdivided into “districts,” of which there are 62, each comprising one or
                    more of the 80 provinces of the kingdom. These districts are under the
                    supervision of a colonel or lieutenant-colonel, whose duties correspond
                    generally to those of the commander of the land wehr battalion districts in
                    Prussia. He has under him a staff, and the <hi rend="italic">cadres</hi> of from
                    1 to 6 companies, forming the depots of the active army in peace time, and in
                    war furnishing each the <hi rend="italic">cadres</hi> for one militia battalion.
                    He superintends the first instruction and forwarding of the annual contingent of
                    recruit3 for the army, and the periodical training of the men belonging to the
                    second class, who are on permanent furlough.</p>
                <p>The Italian army is composed of very various materials, and in its reorganisation
                    it has been the object of the Government to blend these together as much as
                    possible. Going exactly contrary to the Pnιssian principle of localisation, the
                    kingdom is divided into five “zones,” and special arrangements are made to
                    provide that each regiment shall receive recruits in due proportion from all
                    five of these. The Piedmontese are a hardy, athletic race, superior, perhaps, to
                    any in Europe in power of work and endurance of fatigue, privations, and
                    hardships. They are temperate, intelligent, and combine a certain natural
                    independence with a traditional respect for their princes and aristocracy, which
                    makes them docile and amenable to discipline. The aristocracy of North Italy,
                    like that of England, has always associated itself with the welfare and progress
                    of the country, and deservedly kept the respect of all classes, and furnishes an
                    excellent class of officers to the army. The southern Italian, on the other
                    hand, is generally indolent, and incapable of much exertion, physical or mental;
                    occasionally roused to enthusiasm, but wanting in steadiness of character;
                    usually either bigoted and a slave to his priest, or a free-thinker, with little
                    respect for any authority human or divine. Since enervated and luxurious Rome
                    fell before the more vigorous northerner, the southern Italian has shown but
                    little military spirit. Whether the amalgamation of the various races will raise
                    the whole army to the level of the Piedmontese, or lower the old Piedmontese
                    army to the level of the others, is a problem which can only be solved
                    practically; but one may fairly hope that the new national life which is dawning
                    on Italy will restore to its inhabitants something of the qualities which once
                    made Rome mistress of the world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Spanish Army.</hi></p>
                <p>Spain, once the proudest of nations, has been brought so low by years of misrule
                    and anarchy that she can scarcely now be classed among the powers of Europe; and
                    the army which under Charles V., the Duke of Alba, and the Constable of Bourbon
                    had proved itself so formidable, has been reduced to a state of disorganisation
                    that makes any detailed notice of it impossible. The martial spirit of old
                    Spain, roused by the protracted struggle with the Moors, and fanned by the
                    exploits of the Cid and the successes of Ferdinand of Castile, culminated in the
                    reigns of Ferdinand and Isabella, and of their successor, Charles V. At the end
                    of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century the Spanish army was renowned
                    throughout Europe; while the discoveries of Columbus and the conquests of Cortes
                    and Pizarro had extended her power and the fame of her arms to the New World.
                    Gonsalvo de Cordova, Ferdinand’s “great captain,” was the creator of the Spanish
                    infantry, which, modelled originally on that of the Swiss, soon eclipsed the
                    latter, and became in its turn the model for other nations. More heavily armed
                    than the Swiss, it trusted, like them, to massive formations and the
                    irresistible weight of its attack. During the 16th century the Spanish infantry
                    maintained its reputation, and it was not till the close of the century that its
                    renown began to fade before the new school of Maurice of Nassau, and that the
                    deep masses of the “Spanish brigade” gave way to the smaller and more mobile
                    formations of the Netherlaud <hi rend="italic">ordonnance.</hi> Under the
                    disastrous reigns of the last princes of the house of Austria the army rapidly
                    degenerated, and when Philip V. ascended the throne in 1700 it scarcely amounted
                    to 15,000 men. During the 18th century it was largely augmented, and at the
                    outbreak of the French revolution numbered about 120,000 of all arms. But though
                    formidable in numbers, it was no longer so in quality; and throughout the long
                    war with Napoleon it distinguished itself principally by its uniform ill
                    success, and the haste with which it abandoned even the strongest positions.
                    After the peace the army was reorganised, and efforts were made to improve its
                    general condition. But the series of civil wars, or of risings in which the army
                    was a principal actor, thwarted all such attempts. When Isabella was driven from
                    the throne in 1868 the army espoused different sides, the bulk of the infantry
                    joining Prim and the revolutionists, while the artillery and some of the <hi
                    rend="italic">corps d’</hi><hi rend="italic">'élite</hi> remained faithful to
                    the queen. In 1867 the total armed forces of the kingdom (including navy and
                    colonial troops) were fixed at 200,000. The land forces in Spain itself amounted
                    to 150,000, of whom 80,000 belonged to the regular army, and the remaining
                    70,000 were made up of <hi rend="italic">carabiηeros</hi> or gendarmerie, <hi
                    rend="italic">guardia civil,</hi> and provincial militia. The law of recruiting
                    passed in 1870 made all Spaniards liable to service on reaching the age of 20,
                    and fixed the terms of service at four years in the ranks and two in the
                    reserve. Substitution by exchange of numbers or by <hi rend="italic"
                    >remplaçants,</hi> and exoneration by payment, were sanctioned—the price of the
                    latter being fixed at .£60. In 1872 the draft of a new military law was laid
                    before the Cortes, by which substitution and exoneration were abolished, and the
                    annual contingent required to complete the army was to be taken by position
                    (according to age) on the lists, instead of by ballot. The term of service was
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n675/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0675-0614"/> fixed at seven years,—three to be passed in the
                    army, two in the first reserve, and two in the second reserve; the first reserve
                    being liable to be called out at any time to complete the active army, but the
                    second reserve only in case of war, and by a vote of the Cortes. The abdication
                    of King Amadeus, however, prevented the carrying out of the contemplated
                    reorganisation of the army.</p>
                <p>The contrast between the conduct of the Spanish soldiers and of the Spanish
                    people during the Peninsular war presents a curious problem. At the very time
                    that the armies of Spain were dispersed on every occasion, often almost without
                    firing a shot, the people were signalising themselves by the heroic defence of
                    their towns, and by carrying on a desperate guerilla warfare that nothing could
                    subdue. The Spaniard possesses many of the highest qualities of a soldier: he is
                    hardy, temperate, individually brave, high-spirited, and independent; and though
                    naturally indolent and idle, is easily roused, and capable of great heroism, as
                    well as of sustained exertion. Yet this people, when brought together, form
                    without exception the worst soldiers of Europe. They are impatient of discipline
                    and restraint, and as easily discouraged as they are excited; and that mutual
                    confidence in one another and in their leaders, which alone gives moral strength
                    to a mass of men, is altogether wanting. How much of this may be due to the want
                    of good leaders may be a question; but discipline must always be the basis of
                    all military efficiency, and of discipline in the true sense of the word neither
                    the soldiers nor the people of Spain have any idea.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Portuguese Army.</hi></p>
                <p>The~existing army dates from the Peninsular war, when a considerable force of
                    Portuguese, at one time exceeding 60,000 men, was organised under Marshal
                    Beresford. Trained and partly officered by English officers, it proved itself
                    not unworthy of its allies, and bore its full share in the series of campaigns
                    and battles by which the French were ultimately expelled from Spain. At the
                    peace the army numbered about 50,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry, formed on the
                    English model, and all in the highest state of efficiency. This force was
                    reduced in 1821, under the new constitutional government, to about one-half. By
                    the present law of military organisation, passed in 1864, the strength of the
                    army is fixed at 30,000 men on peace footing, and 68,000 on war footing. The
                    number under arms, however, has never approached this; and in 1869 the actual
                    strength and composition of the army was as follows :—</p>

                <p>The number of troops in the Portuguese colonies amounted to 8500 infantry and
                    artillery, besides a reserve of 9500 men.</p>
                <p>The army is raised partly by conscription and partly by voluntary enlistment,
                    more than one-half being obtained by the latter method. Exemption may be
                    purchased by the payment of a fixed sum, amounting to about £80. The time of
                    service is eight years, of which five are spent in the regular army and three in
                    the militia. The Portuguese have distinguished themselves rather by naval
                    enterprise than as soldiers. Physically they are inferior to the Spaniards; but
                    they are more amenable to discipline, and proved themselves far more valuable
                    and trustworthy auxiliaries in the long Peninsular struggle.</p>

                <p>The military power of the “United Provinces” datesits rise from the middle of the
                    15th century, when, after a long and sanguinary struggle, they succeeded in
                    emancipating themselves from the yoke of Spain; and in the following century it
                    received considerable development in consequence of the wars they had to
                    maintain against Louis XIV. In 1702 they had in their pay upwards of 100,000
                    men, exclusive of 30,000 in the service of the Dutch East India Company. At the
                    beginning of the wars of the French Revolution the army had fallen to 36,000
                    men. In 1795 Holland was conquered by the French under Pichegru, and in the
                    course of the changes which ensued the army was entirely reorganised, and under
                    French direction bore its share in the great wars of the empire. In 1814 Holland
                    was relieved of the yoke of France, and in the following year, her armies, under
                    the gallant Prince of Orange, fought side by side with the British at Waterloo.
                    At the peace of 1815 the Belgian provinces, subject before the war to Austria,
                    were annexed to Holland, and the whole formed into a constitutional kingdom; but
                    the union between the northern and southern provinces of the Netherlands was
                    dissolved by the Belgian revolution of 1830, and in 1839 Belgium was finally
                    acknowledged as an independent kingdom.</p>
                <p>The military forces of the Netherlands consist of a home or regular army, a
                    colonial army, and a militia. The regular army is in theory raised by
                    conscription, five years being the term of service, but substitutes are allowed,
                    and a great part of the force under arms are volunteers, the conscripts being
                    drilled for ten months only, and then sent home on furlough, subject to six
                    weeks’ annual training. The colonial army is raised entirely by voluntary
                    enlistment. The infantry of the regular army consists of 8 regiments of the
                    line, each of 4 active and 1 depot battalion, a regiment of guards, composed of
                    2 battalions of chasseurs and 2 of grenadiers, and a battalion of instruction. A
                    battalion consists of 5 companies, of a peace strength of about 100 men, and a
                    war strength of 200. The cavalry consists of 4 regiments of hussars, each
                    regiment having 6 squadrons, viz., 4 field, 1 reserve, and 1 dépôt. The strength
                    of a squadron in time of peace is about 100 men, in time of war about 200. The
                    artillery consists of 5 regiments, viz., 1 field, 3 garrison, and 1 of horse
                    artillery. The field artillery regiment has 14 active batteries of 6 guns each,
                    and 1 depot company; the horse artillery has 4 active batteries and 1 depot; the
                    garrison regiments have each 14 companies, of which 1 is for torpedoes and 1
                    instructional. The engineers consist of a scientific staff, and 1 battalion of
                    sappers and miners. The war strength of the Dutch army in 1872 was as follows

                    of fair physique, but are very badly drilled. The men of the regular army are

                <p>By a law passed in 1868 the strength of the Belgian army was fixed at 100,000 men
                    on war footing, and 40,000 in time of peace. It is formed by conscription, to
                    which every able-bodied male is liable on completing his 19th year.
                    Substitution, however, is permitted, and substitutes or volunteers actually form
                    a large part of the army. The annual contingent is 12,000 men. The period of
                    service is eight years, of which two-thirds are passed on furlough; the actual
                    time in the ranks has recently been increased from twenty-six to thirty months
                    for the infantry; in the other services, it is three years. The <hi

                    chasseurs, 1 of grenadiers, and 14 of the line. Each regiment has 3 field and 1

                    regiments of chasseurs and 4 of lancers, each of four field and one depot
                    squadron. The chasseurs form on mobilisation the divisional cavalry, the lancers
                    the reserve cavalry. The <hi rend="italic">artillery</hi> is formed in 4
                    regiments, and numbers 34 field and 6 reserve batteries of 6 guns each. The <hi

                    corps, each of two infantry divisions and a reserve of cavalry and artillery,
                    and numbering 26 battalions, 16 squadrons, and 96 guns.</p>
                <p>Besides the standing army there is a civic militia <hi rend="italic"

                    400,000 men with the reserve, is formed of all citizens between 21 and 40 able
                    to bear arms, but is only organised in the large towns and fortresses. In time
                    of peace it is under the Ministry of the Interior, but in time of war under the
                    Ministry of War.</p>
                <p>The organisation of the Belgian army was subjected to a practical test in 1870,
                    when it was suddenly mobilised and placed in observation on the frontier. The
                    results were not satisfactory. The actual numbers fell considerably short of the
                    estimated ones, and of the men present a large number were quite unfit for
                    service. The number of officers was altogether insufficient, and the army was in
                    many respects incompletely equipped. A bill for the reorganisation of the army,
                    based on compulsory personal service, was introduced in 1871, and adopted in
                    principle by an overwhelming majority of the commission appointed to examine it.
                    But public opinion pronounced so decidedly against the abolition of substitution
                    that Government gave way, and the bill was withdrawn. Ultimately, General
                    Thiebault accepted the Ministry of War, and introduced a modified measure, which
                    yielded the disputed point of substitution, and contented itself with additional
                    guarantees for the character and quality of the substitutes, and reform in
                    various branches of army administration. In a rich and enterprising commercial
                    country like Belgium personal service would naturally fall peculiarly heavily;
                    but, further than that, a not inconsiderable portion of the inhabitants are
                    opposed to the maintenance of any standing army. The Belgians are not a military
                    nation; the martial spirit which once made them a match for the trained soldiers
                    of the most powerful and warlike kingdom of Europe, seems to have given place to
                    mercantile instincts and industrial pursuits. The troops that fought at Waterloo
                    alongside the British did little to raise Belgium’s military reputation, some
                    having deserted the battle-field in the midst of the conflict. The modem Belgian
                    soldier is active, fairly intelligent, and a good marcher, but undersized, of
                    inferior physique, and in most respects a bad copy of the French soldier.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Danish Army.</hi></p>
                <p>The Danish army, though small in numbers, has always been of excellent material,
                    and the gallant stand made in 1864 against the overpowering forces of Austria
                    and Prussia deservedly won the admiration of Europe. Since then she has
                    reorganised her army on the principle of universal service; but has applied that
                    principle in a manner peculiar to herself, and intermediate between the militia
                    system of Switzerland and the three-years’ system of Germany. By the law of 1867
                    every Danish citizen is liable to serve in the army or navy. Those who have been
                    brought up as sailors, and have served at least eighteen months as such, are
                    inscribed on the reserve lists of the navy; the rest serve in the army. Service
                    commences at 22, except in the case of volunteers, who are allowed to join at
                    18. The period of service is fixed at eight years in the army, and eight years
                    in the reserve or “reinforcement” <hi rend="italic">(for-staerkning).</hi> The
                    actual service with the colours is very short, and is divided into two periods.
                    The first or recruit’s course of instruction, which all must go through, lasts
                    for six months in the infantry, five in the guard, field artillery, and
                    engineers, and nine and a half in the cavalry. The second course lasts for nine
                    months in the infantry, eleven in the cavalry, and one year in the artillery and
                    engineers, and is confined to those who are considered insufficiently trained,
                    to non-commissioned officers selected for promotion, and to a certain number,
                    selected by lot, who are retained to complete the <hi rend="italic">cadres</hi>
                    and carry on garrison duties. In the infantry the bulk of the recruits are sent
                    home after the first six months, about one-third to one-fourth remaining for the
                    second term. On the other hand, the great majority of the cavalry, and almost
                    the whole of the field artillery, are retained for the second period, and thus
                    receive respectively twenty and seventeen^ months’ training. For every three
                    months of service in excess of the six months’ course, one year is deducted from
                    the period of service in the reserve. Those who were sent home after six months
                    are called out again for a supplementary course of six weeks during their second
                    year, which is passed at the camp of instruction at Hald, near Viborg, where
                    from 8000 to 10,000 men are annually assembled for large manoeuvres.</p>
                <p>The Danish army is organised territorially, the kingdom being divided into five
                    brigade districts, each of which is again subdivided into two regimental
                    districts. A brigade consists of two infantry regiments, each of two line and
                    one reserve battalion, and a cavalry regiment. The infantry regiments draw their
                    contingent of recruits from the corresponding regimental districts, the two line
                    battalions taking it by turns annually to receive and train the whole of the
                    recruits for the regiment. The cavalry are recruited from the brigade districts,
                    and the guard, artillery, and engineers from the kingdom generally. After
                    remaining for four years on the lists of the line regiments, the conscripts are
                    transferred for the remaining four years to the reserve battalions, in which
                    they have to perform one course of training, the reserve battalions being
                    mobilised during four weeks annually for the purpose. The Danish army thus
                    consists of 1 regiment of infantry of the guard and 10 of the line, each of
                    three battalions—two active and one reserve; 5 regiments of cavalry, each of
                    three active and two reserve squadrons; 1 regiment of field artillery of twelve
                    batteries, and 1 regiment of garrison artillery of two battalions; 1 regiment of
                    engineers, of six active and three reserve companies, and 2 companies <pb

                    army, exclusive of reserves, is about 38,000 men; the number serving with the
                    colours varies according to the time of year.</p>
                <p>The Danish soldiers are, generally speaking, a fine body of men, of considerable
                    physical power, and inured to hardship and rough living. They combine a good
                    deal of northern stubbornness with the romance and martial feeling of the old
                    Scandinavian. Nursed in old traditions and chivalrous legends, the quiet,
                    hard-working Danish peasant has within him a vein of poetry and a sympathy for
                    heroic deeds strongly contrasting with his outward demeanour. He still retains
                    much of the character of the feudal ages —instinctive respect and attachment to
                    his leaders, and implicit confidence in them; and in the army this feeling has
                    been strengthened by the local character which the regiments have always had,
                    officers and soldiers serving together for generations. The officers are all
                    drawn from the upper class, and are as a rule highly-educated gentlemen; they
                    are trained from an early age at the Academy at Copenhagen, where the languages
                    and literature of all countries are taught, as well as purely scientific
                    subjects, and undergo strict examinations before they pass as cadets.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Swedish and Norwegian Army.</hi></p>
                <p>Although the crowns of Sweden and Norway are now permanently united, each country
                    retains its own government, constitution, and laws; and the military forces of
                    the two countries are separate and differently organised. The Swedish army is
                    composed of three distinct classes,— the “värfrade,” or enlisted troops, to
                    which belong the royal guards, one regiment of hussars, the artillery, and the
                    engineers; the “indelta,” or national army, paid and kept by the landowners,
                    each of whom furnishes a certain number of men, to whom, besides a small annual
                    pay, a cottage and a piece of land are allotted during the period of service;
                    and thirdly, the “beräring,” or conscription troops, drawn by annual levy from
                    the male population between the ages of 20 and 25 years. The “indelta” are
                    called out for a month’s training annually in time of peace. Besides the above,
                    there is a Gothland militia force of 30 companies of infantry and 3 batteries of
                    artillery, numbering about 8000 men; these, however, are not compelled to serve
                    beyond the confines of the isle of Gothland, and have a separate command. The
                    royal guards number 2240, the line (under which is included the “indelta”) about
                    25,000 infantry, 5000 cavalry, 5000 artillery with 234 guns, and 1000 engineers.
                    The “beräring” amount to about 95,000 of all arms. The Swedish troops are
                    physically the finest in Europe,—powerful, hardy, and brave, and retaining much
                    of the old Scandinavian heroic spirit; and, though strictly a militia only,
                    their peculiar aptitude for all warlike exercises would make them formidable
                    antagonists, even to the best trained armies. Few nations have so brilliant a
                    military history. Under Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years’ War, and later
                    under the heroic but insatiate Charles XII., they achieved a reputation almost
                    unrivalled in Europe; and their armies and tactics served for many years as
                    models to the great military powers.</p>
                <p>The military forces of Norway are differently organised, and though divided into
                    line and militia, are in fact purely a militia force. By the law of 18G7 all
                    young men past the age of 21 are liable to the conscription, with exception of
                    the inhabitants of the three northern provinces, who are free from all military
                    service. Actually the troops are raised partly by voluntary enlistment and
                    partly by. conscription. The term of service is for ten years, divided into
                    three in the line, four in the reserve, and three in the militia or “landvaern.”
                    The <hi rend="italic">cadres</hi> of the army are formed entirely of volunteers.
                    The young men raised by conscription are required to go through a recruit’s
                    course of forty-two days, and subsequently an annual training of twenty-four
                    days. On the 1st January 1872 the troops of the line numbered 13,000 men, the
                    reserves 19,000, and the landvaern 11,000. The landvaern are only liable to
                    service within the frontiers of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>Swiss <hi rend="smallcaps">Army.</hi></p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Switzerland were always a hardy and independent race, but
                    their high military reputation dates from the middle of the 15th century, when
                    the comparatively ill-armed and untrained mountaineers signally defeated Charles
                    the Bold of Burgundy and the flower of the chivalry of Europe in the battles of
                    Granson, Morat, and Nancy. The Suabian war, towards the end of that century, and
                    the Milanese war, at the beginning of the following one, added to the fame of
                    the Swiss infantry, and made it the model on which that arm was formed all over
                    Europe. The wealthier countries vied with each other in hiring them as
                    mercenaries, and the poor but warlike Swiss found the profession of arms a
                    lucrative one. Whatever discredit may attach to the soldier who sells his
                    services to any country or cause, and fights for money alone, the Swiss at least
                    have done much to redeem the position by their unswerving loyalty to their
                    employers. The devoted faithfulness of Louis XVI.’s Swiss guard is proverbial,
                    and has been commemorated with just pride by their countrymen. The French
                    Revolutionary armies overran Switzerland, as they did all the small neighbouring
                    states, and during Napoleon’s career she had to submit to his rule, and furnish
                    her contingent to his armies. On the fall of Napoleon she regained her
                    independence, and returned to her old trade of furnishing soldiers to the
                    sovereigns and powers of Europe. Charles X. of France had at one time as many as
                    17,000 Swiss in his pay; Naples and Rome had each four regiments. The recruiting
                    for these foreign services was openly acknowledged and encouraged by the
                    Government. The young Swiss engaged usually for a period of four or six years;
                    they were formed in separate regiments, officered by countrymen of their own,
                    and received a higher rate of pay than the national regiments; and at the close
                    of their engagement returned with their earnings to settle down on their
                    paternal holdings. A series of revolutions, however, expelled them from France
                    and Italy, and recently the advance of liberal ideas, and the creation of great
                    national armies based on the principle of personal service, has destroyed their
                    occupation. Switzerland is now remarkable in a military sense as being the only
                    country that maintains no standing army; and the fact that, with an annual
                    expenditure of only £200,000, she shows a force of 200,000 men, has made her
                    military institutions the study of economists and the model for many would-be
                    military reformers.</p>
                <p>The 13th article of the constitution of 1848 forbids the maintenance of a
                    standing army within the limits of the confederation; but every citizen is
                    required to bear arms for the defence of the country, and for this purpose a
                    certain military training is given at all schools. The actual forces of the
                    republic consist of a militia divided into three classes,—the “auszug” or <hi
                    rend="italic">élite,</hi> the reserve, and the landwehr. The strength of the <hi
                    rend="italic">elite</hi> is fixed at 3 per cent, of the population, and that of
                    the reserve at 1J per cent.; the landwehr includes all who have passed the <hi
                    rend="italic">élite</hi> and reserve up to the age of 44. The total service is
                    limited to twenty-five years. Within these conditions the cantons are allowed to
                    raise their contingents and distribute the service as they please; and it thus
                    happens that service in the <hi rend="italic">élite</hi> lasts for five years in
                    some cantons, and for fourteen years in others. Exemption from service is
                    granted to certain Government and public officials, to the <pb break="no"

                    become liable on attaining the age of 20. No substitutes are allowed, and any
                    one rejected for bodily infirmity, or exempted from any cause, is required to
                    pay a small tax.</p>

                    consideration; and the available force is estimated at about 105,000, of whom
                    70,000 belong to the “auszug,” and 35,000 to the reserve.</p>
                <p>The infantry are armed and equipped by their cantons, the recruit himself having
                    to bear a portion of the expense. Before being placed on the rolls of the
                    “auszug” he has to undergo a training of four weeks for the line, or five weeks
                    for the rifles; and subsequently an annual training of eight days while in the
                    <hi rend="italic">élite,</hi> and six days in the reserve. Practically, however,
                    the <hi rend="italic">élite</hi> are commonly called out every second year only,
                    and the training of the reserve is often omitted altogether The cavalry,
                    artillery, and engineers have a recruit’s course of six weeks, and an annual
                    training of (nominally) a. fortnight; but in practice the latter has been
                    reduced to eight days every second year. The cavalry resemble our yeomanry,
                    consisting of a wealthier class of men, who find their own horses; the engineers
                    are selected from men following suitable trades. The whole army is formed in six
                    divisions, and annually one or two of these are assembled for divisional
                    manoeuvres. A handsome federal barrack for infantry and cavalry and a permanent
                    instructional establishment exist at Thun. Officers are required to go through a
                    six weeks’ course at this federal school, and to attend one course of recruit
                    training on appointment. The nomination of officers, and promotions up to the
                    rank of captain, are made by the cantonal governments; promotion to the higher
                    grades and appointments to the staff by the federal authorities, though usually
                    on the recommendation of the cantons. Candidates for the staff are required to
                    go through a two months’ course at a staff school which is annually opened for
                    the purpose.</p>

                    cheapness. The expenditure shown in the federal budget is only a portion of the
                    real cost of the army; to it must be added the expenses borne by the cantons and
                    by the men themselves. The actual cost is estimated by the best authorities at
                    £533,000 per annum, or about £5 per head for an effective strength of 105,000
                    men. In England the annual cost of the militia is about £8 per head, of the
                    volunteers £3. The Swiss so-called army may take its place between our militia
                    and volunteers. The men are less trained than our militiamen, but are generally
                    better educated and of a more intelligent class. They show at least as much
                    independence as our volunteers, and many things of acknowledged necessity are
                    left undone, simply because the men will not do them. The officers are in all
                    respects inferior, and that class who have previously seen service in the army
                    is wanting. In equipment the army is far behind our auxiliary forces, and an
                    attempt made in 1872 to improve its organisation generally, and give the federal
                    authorities more power, was successfully resisted by the cantons. During the war
                    of 1870-71 five divisions of the Swiss army, amounting in a <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> l to about 37,000 men, were mobilised and assembled
                    on tho frontier; and superficial observers were enthusiastic in their praises of
                    the organisation and efficiency of this citizen army. But their own commander
                    reported that there was “incredible friction in the mechanism of the whole
                    force; ’’ that many of the battalions were in the lowest condition of discipline
                    and efficiency; and that “to march against an enemy with such troops as these
                    would indeed be a bold enterprise;” and urged that “it would be far preferable
                    to have an army weaker in point of numbers, but of better quality.” What becomes
                    of such forces when opposed to a real army has been abundantly illustrated by
                    the history of the French <hi rend="italic">gardes mobiles in</hi> the war of
                    1870. Switzerland exists by the sufferance of her powerful neighbours, and her
                    military institutions are suited to such conditions, but not to a power that
                    relies on itself for its independence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Turkish Army.</hi></p>
                <p>The Ottoman empire, whose power at one time seemed to threaten the very existence
                    of the Christian states, has long lost her terrors, and her military
                    institutions are now studied rather to see what elements of resistance to
                    foreign aggression she still possesses, than for the part she may play in
                    European politics. Her armies have lost their peculiar character and
                    constitution, and with it much of the spirit which once made them formidable. In
                    the early days of her rising power every 0smanli was a soldier; and the whole
                    nation was animated with that martial fanaticism that was the secret of her
                    strength. As her conquests extended, her warriors were rewarded with grants of
                    land, and a system of military tenure arose resembling the feudal system of
                    Western Europe. And though the 0smanli retained his simple habits and warlike
                    spirit, the unfitness of such a militia for prolonged operations soon led, as in
                    the Christian states, to the establishment of a more permanent force. Sultan
                    Amurath I. in 1360 first formed a bodyguard of Christian captives; and this
                    force, highly privileged and rewarded, soon swelled to large dimensions. Such
                    was the origin of the janissaries, the earliest standing army in Europe, and for
                    long the scourge and terror of the neighbouring Christian states. Like most
                    proselytes, they were more fanatical even than the genuine Osmanli; and this,
                    added to a permanent organisation, made them for a time almost invincible. But
                    success and indulgence produced their usual results; they became overbearing,
                    corrupt, and formidable only to their own country. From being the sultan’s
                    slaves they became his masters, and the history of Turkey shows a long list of
                    rulers appointed, deposed, or murdered by the janissaries. Two attempts to break
                    their power failed disastrously. But Sultan Mahmoud II. was not daunted by a
                    first failure, and when in 1826 he commenced his reorganisation of the army, and
                    the janissaries again rose against him, they found him prepared. The new troops
                    remained faithful, and in a terrible three days’ struggle, in which 20,000 of
                    their number were killed, the janissaries as a body were annihilated. Mahmoud
                    now hastened to reconstitute his army on European models; but while his measures
                    were still in embryo he found himself involved in a war with Russia, and though
                    the newly-raised troops behaved with gallantry, the war soon took an
                    unfavourable turn, and ended disastrously for Turkey with the humiliating peace
                    of Adrianople. The reforms instituted by Mahmoud were, however, carried on
                    vigorously by his successor, Abdul Medjid, and form the basis of the present
                    military institutions of Turkey.</p>
                <p>As now constituted, the Turkish forces consist of the “nizam,” or standing army;
                    “ichtjat,” or first reserve; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n679/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0679-0618"/> “redif,” or second reserve; “hijade,” or
                    landsturm; and a certain number of irregular levies.</p>
                <p>Although in principle every one is liable to service, the army is recruited
                    entirely from the Mussulman population, Christians and others being exempted on
                    payment of a tax called the “bédel.” The capital, the island of Crete, and
                    certain frontier districts, are by ancient privilege exempt both from service
                    and from the tax. The burden of the conscription therefore falls on a
                    comparatively small proportion, considerably less than one-half of the
                    population. The actual conscripts, however, are not numerous. A considerable
                    proportion of the army is raised by voluntary enlistment, the pay being
                    sufficiently high to attract poor Mussulmans; and as personal substitutes, or
                    exemption on payment of a fixed sum (in which case Government finds the
                    substitute), are both allowed, all possessed of any means can and usually do
                    escape service. The period of service is fixed at twenty years,—four in the
                    ranks, two in the “ichtjat,” six in the “redif,” and eight in the “hijade.” The
                    strength of the standing army remaining at 150,000 men, the annual levy is fixed
                    at one quarter of this, or 37,500; and it is estimated that this will give
                    70,000 (two years’ contingents, deducting casualties) in the “ichtjat,” about
                    200,000 in the “redif,” and 250,000 in the “hijade,” or a total of 670,000 men.
                    Practically, however, these numbers would never be attained, and a great part of
                    the necessary organisation exists only on paper.</p>
                <p>The standing army is divided into six army corps, corresponding to the six
                    military districts or “ordus” into which the empire is divided; each army corps
                    consists of 6 to 7 infantry regiments, 6 or 7 rifle battalions, 2 to 7 cavalry
                    regiments, and 1 artillery regiment. There is no divisional or brigade
                    organisation in peace time, the regimental commanders communicating direct with
                    the corps commanders; but in war time brigades of two regiments and divisions of
                    two brigades are formed. The <hi rend="italic">infantry</hi> of the standing
                    army consists of 41 line regiments of 3 battalions each, and 38 rifle
                    battalions, or a total of 161 battalions. A line or rifle battalion has 8
                    companies, and a normal or war strength of 33 officers and 800 men; the peace
                    strength is variable, being reduced by furloughs granted at the discretion of
                    the corps or regimental commander, and seldom exceeds 400. Their regimental
                    organisation, parade formations, and drill, are copied from the French. The
                    infantry uniform, which until recently was also on the European pattern, is now
                    more national, and consists of an open blue jacket, an ornamental waistcoat,
                    leather sash, wide Turkish trousers, yellow lace boots, and fez cap. The <hi
                    rend="italic">cavalry</hi> numbers 25 regiments, all light cavalry, each of 6
                    squadrons, and numbering on war establishment 42 officers, 914 men, and 856
                    horses. The four centre squadrons are armed with lances, the two flank ones with
                    breech-loading carbines; all carry sword and revolver besides. The uniform is an
                    open jacket and waistcoat like that of the infantry, but differently laced; the
                    saddle is that known in Austria as the “Hungarian” saddle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">artillery</hi> consists of 6 regiments of field artillery,
                    attached to the several army corps, a reserve artillery regiment, and 7
                    regiments of garrison artillery. A field artillery regiment consists of 15
                    batteries of 6 guns each; the reserve artillery regiment is similarly organised,
                    and acts as a depot to the others. The garrison regiments are distributed to the
                    different fortresses; they are formed of 4 battalions of 3 companies, and have a
                    war strength of 2040 men, but in peace scarcely number a third of that. The
                    fortification corps, or corps of engineers, belongs to the artillery, and
                    consists of 2 battalions of 4 companies each. The artillery has always been the
                    best organised and most highly trained branch of the Ottoman army. Mahmoud paid
                    special attention to it, and it was the fidelity of that branch that gave him
                    the victory in the struggle with the janissaries. Foreign officers, Germans
                    especially, have always been largely employed in it, and by their exertions have
                    brought it to a state of efficiency contrasting most favourably with the rest of
                    the army.</p>

                <p>After completing four years service m the ranks, the Turkish soldier is passed
                    into the “ichtjat,” or first reserve, for two years, during which he is liable
                    at any time to be recalled, and cannot leave his district without permission.
                    The men of this first reserve, estimated at 70,000, are intended to form
                    separate battalions, but are in all respects available for service like the
                    standing army. Actually a large number would be required to complete the
                    “nizam,” and the <hi rend="italic">cadres</hi> and officers for these reserve
                    battalions only partially exist. A few such battalions were, however, formed at
                    the time of the Yemen expedition in 1870. After two years in this first reserve,
                    the soldier is passed on to the “redif,” or second reserve. The “redif” can only
                    be called out in war time, and is not liable for service except within the
                    country. It is divided into two levies, each of three years’ contingents, and
                    forms separate regiments and batteries; and it is proposed to form these into
                    army corps corresponding to the existing corps of the standing army, and
                    consisting each of 6 infantry regiments, 6 rifle battalions, 3 cavalry
                    regiments, and 1 artillery regiment of 6 batteries. But this organisation exists
                    on paper only, and it is very doubtful if the necessary <hi rend="italic"
                    >cadres</hi> and officers would be forthcoming. Lastly, after six years in the
                    “redif,” the man is passed on to the “hijade,” or landsturm, for eight years;
                    but this force, though liable to be called out in war, is not organised even on
                    paper.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">irregular troops,</hi> winch are raised in war, and at one
                    time formed a principal element of strength, are of two kinds,—paid troops
                    (Bashi-Bazouks) and volunteers (Spahis, Bedouins, &amp;c.) The former are
                    usually raised by contract, the governor of a province receiving orders to raise
                    a certain number, and being supplied with the necessary funds, and thereupon
                    contracting with such chiefs or adventurers as undertake to furnish the men at
                    the lowest cost. Most of the money finds its way into the pockets of the
                    governor or contractor, and but little goes to the Bashi-Bazouks. In the last
                    war between Russia and Turkey (1853-55) 20,000 to 30,000 of these were raised,
                    for the most part ill-armed and worse disciplined infantry; but most of them
                    were disbanded before the close of the war. The volunteers, on the other hand,
                    though deficient in organisation, are zealous Mussulmans and brave soldiers.
                    They come mostly from the wild border tribes, in small bodies, under their own
                    chiefs and beys, and furnish a very valuable irregular cavalry.</p>
                <p>The Turkish soldier of the present day is generally docile, faithful, temperate,
                    and capable of undergoing great hardships or fatigue. The familiar terms on
                    which the subordinate officers mix with the men would be considered subversive
                    of discipline in any other army, but do not appear to be so in the Ottoman army,
                    and serious military offences are rare. "When well commanded, he has shown
                    himself capable of great personal devotion and even heroism, but of a passive
                    rather than an active character. Naturally calm and rather apathetic, he seems
                    to have retained that fatalism which is a special characteristic of his
                    religion, but to have lost the fiery zeal that distinguished his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n680/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0680-0619"/> ancestors, and made them, whether individually or
                    as a nation, such formidable assailants. It may be questioned whether, in a
                    purely military aspect, Mahmoud did not lose more than he gained by the
                    destruction of the janissaries and reorganisation of his army on modem models,
                    and whether any amount of drill and science will compensate for the old
                    fanatical spirit. But some such reforms were necessary; Turkey could not
                    continue to hold a place in Europe, yet live the life of an Eastern nation and
                    of an age long past. Her new armies have showed themselves formidable on many
                    occasions; her artillery promises to rival that of most Western nations; and if
                    the Osmanli character is in some respects ill-suited to the scientific and
                    far-seeing character of modern warfare, it still retains enough of its old
                    religious fanaticism to make her more than ordinarily dangerous in a defensive
                    and, as it would seem to her, a holy war.</p>
                <p>In a notice of the military forces of Turkey mention must be made of her vassal
                    states, Egypt and Tunis, each of which is bound to furnish an auxiliary
                    contingent in war. The military forces of Tunis and Tripoli are too
                    insignificant to require special notice: her contingent is from 2000 to 4000
                    infantry, 1000 cavalry, and 8 guns, and during the Crimean war she did actually
                    send about 4000 men to the seat of war in Asia Minor. Egypt is now pledged to
                    furnish an army corps of 30,000 men complete with cavalry and guns. In the
                    Crimean war she furnished first one and afterwards two divisions, amounting to
                    about 21,000 men; and during the insurrection in Crete she furnished a
                    contingent of 10,000 men. The Egyptian army is almost the creation of its
                    present ruler, Ismail Pacha, who on his accession found only two infantry
                    regiments and a few detachments of irregulars. It now consists of 15 infantry
                    regiments of 3 battalions each, 3 rifle battalions, 4 cavalry regiments, 2
                    regiments of field artillery, and 3 of garrison artillery, and 1 battalion of
                    sappers; and numbers on war strength about 52,000 infantry, 2500 cavalry, and
                    144 guns. The peace strength is little more than half this. These troops are all
                    organised and drilled on European principles, mainly after French models. Many
                    of the highest officials are actually old French officers. In addition to these,
                    Egypt maintains a force of about 8000 <hi rend="italic">sandschaks</hi> or
                    irregular troops, who receive a higher rate of pay, but are required to arm,
                    clothe, and feed themselves, and are permanently stationed on her frontière. In
                    case of war Egypt can raise about 10,000 irregular cavalry among the tribes that
                    are subject to her.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">American Army.</hi></p>
                <p>The army of the United States of America is the last that calls for notice.
                    Threatened by no powerful or warlike neighbours, the United States are saved
                    from that ruinous competition in armaments which presses on the industry of
                    European countries. The American army is little more than a police force, of
                    which a few regiments serve as a reserve to the civil power in the great towns,
                    while the rest are dispersed in small posts along the frontiers or among the
                    Indian districts. By an Act of 1870 its strength was limited to 30,000 men. It
                    consists of 10 regiments of cavalry, each of 12 companies or troops; 25
                    regiments of infantry, of 10 companies each; 5 regiments of artillery, and one
                    engineer battalion. The cavalry, broken up in small detachments, partake more of
                    the character of mounted police than of that of European cavalry. They are armed
                    with swords and breech-loading or repeating rifles, and trained to act on foot
                    as well as on horseback; and the whole cavalry drill is assimilated as closely
                    as possible to that of the infantry. The infantry are organised after the old
                    English fashion in single battalion regiments of 10 companies. The army is
                    raised entirely by voluntary enlistment; the term of service is three years, but
                    it is now proposed to extend it to five, and re-engagements are encouraged. Two
                    regiments of cavalry and three of infantry are composed of negro soldiers, but
                    commanded by white officers. The officers of the army are furnished by West
                    Point Academy, a military school equal to any in Europe. The course of
                    instruction lasts four years, and includes all subjects of general education
                    besides purely professional ones. West Point is sought by young men of the best
                    families in America, and the number educated there considerably exceeds the
                    requirements of the army. It is thus the means of spreading a certain military
                    education throughout the country, and it was to this West Point training that
                    the Southerners owed the large number of excellent officers that were found in
                    their ranks in the war.</p>
                <p>For military purposes the territory of the United States is divided into ten
                    departments, and those grouped into four military divisions: the South,
                    comprising the departments of the South and of Texas; the division of the
                    Missouri, comprising the departments of Dakota, the Platte, and Missouri; the
                    division of the Pacific, comprising the departments of Columbia, California, and
                    Arizona; and the division of the East, comprising the departments of the East
                    and the Lakes.</p>
                <p>By the constitution of September 1787 the President is Commander-in-Chief of the
                    army and militia of the Union, and Congress has power to raise and support
                    armies, to make rules for their government and regulation, and to provide for
                    calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress
                    insurrections, and repel invasions. The Articles of War, by which all troops
                    when mustered into service are governed, were enacted in 1806, and are a close
                    but somewhat improved copy of those in force in the English army, and much of
                    their army regulations is identical with the old general regulations and orders
                    of the royal army.</p>
                <p>The military history of the United States is as strange as the rise and rapid
                    growth of the nation. In 1790 the rank and file of the army, as fixed by Act of
                    Congress, amounted to 1216 men; and in 1814 an English expedition of only 3500
                    men was able to seize and burn Washington, the capital of a country which even
                    then numbered eight millions of inhabitants. In 1861, at the commencement of the
                    war of the secession, the whole regular force amounted to only 14,000 men. In
                    April of that year the President called out 75,000 volunteers for three months
                    to defend the capital, which was threatened; and in May a further call for
                    42,000 was made. In July two calls for 500,000 each were authorised by Congress,
                    and as even this vast force proved insufficient for the gigantic struggle which
                    America had now embarked in, it was found necessary to introduce the
                    conscription. In October 1863 a levy of 300,000 men was ordered, and in February
                    1864 a further call of 500,000 was made. Finally, in the beginning of 1865 two
                    further levies, amounting in all to 500,000 men, were ordered, but were only
                    partially carried out in consequence of the cessation of hostilities. The total
                    number of men called under arms by the Government of the United States, between
                    April 1861 and April 1865, amounted to 2,759,049, of whom 2,656,053 were
                    actually embodied in the armies. If to these be added the 1,100,000 men embodied
                    by the Southern States during the same time, the total armed forces reach the
                    enormous amount of nearly four millions, drawn from a population of only 32
                    millions,—figures before which the celebrated uprising of the French nation in
                    1793, or the recent efforts of France and Germany in the war of 1870-71, sink
                    into insignificance. And within three years the whole of those vast forces were
                    peaceably disbanded, and the army had shrunk to a normal strength of only 30,000
                    men. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g.</hi> p. <hi rend="smallcaps">c.)</hi><pb
