                <p><label type="entry">ARBUTHNOT, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated physician, wit, and man of letters of the age of Queen Anne, was born
                    at Arbuthnot, near Montrose. The date of his birth is somewhat uncertain; many
                    authorities give 1675, which is scarcely reconcilable with his first appearance
                    in London; it should probably be 1665 or 1667. His father was a clergyman of the
                    Scotch Episcopal Church, who was compelled by the Revolution to resign his
                    charge, and whose family were consequently dependent on their ow n exertions.
                    Young Arbuthnot studied at the University of Aberdeen, where he took the degree
                    of M.D. He proceeded soon after to London, and for a time supported himseif
                    there by teaching mathematics. His first published work was a translation, with
                    considerable additions, of a treatise by Huyghens, called <hi rend="italic">Of
                    the Laws of Chance, or a Method of Calculation of the Hazards of Game,</hi>
                    1692. About this time there was much speculation concerning the geological
                    formation of the earth, and Dr Woodward published an Essay towards a natural
                    history of the earth, in which some curious views were propounded with regard to
                    the deluge. This essay Arbuthnot attacked with great success in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Examination of Dr Woodward's Account of the Deluge,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    London 1695. By this work he was brought into prominent notice, and not only
                    gained means to extend his practice, but at the same time brought himself into
                    connection with the circle of wits and literary men who formed the chief glory
                    of the age. He followed up the work on Dr Woodward by another on the usefulness
                    of mathematical learning, and contributed to the Royal Society an interesting
                    memoir, called <hi rend="italic">An Argument for Divine Providence drawn from
                    the Equal Number of Births of both Sexes,</hi> which procured him, in 1704,
                    admission as a Fellow to the Royal Society. A year later appeared the first
                    edition of a larger work, <hi rend="italic">Tables of the Grecian, Roman, and
                    Jewish Measures,</hi> &amp;c. This is still a work of some value, though in many
                    parts superseded. It was held in considerable estimation on the Continent, and
                    was translated into Latin. About this time a happy accident introduced Arbuthnot
                    to Prince George of Denmark, who was seized with sudden illness when on a visit
                    to Epsom. Arbuthnot, who chanced to be there at the time, was called in, and
                    ever afterwards continued to be physician to the prince. In 1705, at the
                    especial request of the Queen, he was made her physician extraordinary, and four
                    years later lie became Royal Physician in ordinary. In the same year he was
                    elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was now in the very
                    centre of the literary society of the time, and in it his great talents, massive
                    learning, and brilliant wit enabled him to take a prominent place. He was on
                    terms of close intimacy with Pope, Swift, Gay, and Parnell, and quickly became
                    one of the foremost literary men of the Tory party. In 1712 appeared the
                    celebrated political allegory, called the <hi rend="italic">History of John
                    Bull.</hi> The object of this admirable piece of satire was to throw ridicule on
                    the duke of Marlborough, and to excite among the people a feeling of disgust at
                    the protracted war then being carried on against Louis of Franca The nations at
                    war are represented as tradesmen involved in a lawsuit: the origin of the
                    dispute is traced to their selfish and narrow views; their national
                    characteristics are skilfully hit off, and the various events of the war, with
                    the accompanying political intrigues, are symbolised by the stages in the
                    progress of the suit, the tricks of the lawyers, and the devices of the
                    principal attorney (Marlborough) to prolong the struggle. There have been many
                    imitations of this famous allegory, but few of them have been so happily
                    conceived, or so well sustained. Its immediate effect was very considerable, and
                    it is even now of interest for the lively picture it presents of the politics of
                    the period. At the time of its appearance it was generally attributed to Swift,
                    but passages in Swift’s own letters make it quite clear that Arbuthnot was the
                    sole author.</p>
                <p>The death of the Queen in 1714 was a severe blow to Arbuthnot. He lost his post
                    as court physician, and was much impaired in his means. He appears about this
                    time to have paid a short visit to Paris, and on his return took up his
                    residence in Dover Street. His correspondence shows that after the Queen’s death
                    he was at first disposed to be despondent and gloomy, but he soon recovered his
                    natural buoyancy of spirits, and entered with eagerness into the proposed work
                    of the Scriblerus Club. The principal members of this club were Pope, Gay,
                    Swift, Arbuthnot, Parnell, Harley, Atterbury, and Congreve. The work projected
                    by them, a comprehensive satire on the abuses of human learning, was never
                    completed. One brilliant fragment, the first book of the Memoirs of Martinus
                    Scriblerus, published in Pope’s Works, is undoubtedly the work of Arbuthnot,
                    though it is not improbable that some portions are due to Pope and Swift. It is
                    an admirable combination of wit and learning, and is certainly one of the finest
                    pieces of sarcastic humour in the English language. Arbuthnot still continued
                    practice as a physician, and attained great eminence in his profession. In 1723
                    he was made one of the censors of the Royal College of Physicians, and in 1727
                    had the honour of delivering the Harveian oration. In 1731 he published an <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay concerning the Nature of Aliments,</hi> which has been
                    frequently republished, and has been translated into German. In 1733 he wrote an
                    <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Effects of Air on Human Bodies.</hi> He died in
                    February 1735. The scattered writings of Arbuthnot, on which his reputation as a
                    wit rests, are so interwoven with the works of Swift and Pope, that it is
                    difficult to discover what is absolutely his. A collected edition, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mis ellaneous Works of the late DrArbuthnot,</hi> Glasgow,
                    1750-51, contains many pieces that were expressly disclaimed by the t uthor’s
                    son.</p>
