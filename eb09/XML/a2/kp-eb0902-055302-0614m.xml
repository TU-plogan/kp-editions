                <p><label type="entry">ARMS <hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi></label> ARMOUR. The
                    history of arms and armour forms one of the most suggestive chapters in the
                    history of civilisation. The use of stone weapons appears to have been
                    universally characteristic of the earlier, as it is still distinctive of the
                    ruder races of mankind. The forms of the weapons fabricated in this intractable
                    material were of necessity few and simple. The commonest and most widely
                    distributed type is that of the imperforate axe, varying from the
                    roughly-dressed wedge of flint, to the finely-shaped and highly-polished
                    lenticular “celt.” They were fabricated of flint, diorite, greenstone,
                    serpentine, indurated clay-slate, in short, of almost every material capable of
                    being worked into the desired form, and of retaining the requisite sharpness of
                    edge. Spear-heads and arrow-pointe were chipped in flint with such surprising
                    dexterity and skill, that they were nearly as effective as those subsequently
                    fabricated in metals, and not much inferior in form and finish. The highest
                    efforts of the ancient stone-workere culminated in the short leaf-shaped
                    knife-dagger of flint, suggestive of the form which afterwards became the
                    characteristic weapon of the Bronze Age, the leaf-shaped sword. These
                    knife-daggers of flint exhibit considerable variety of form, though always of
                    the same type. They vary also in size, but seldom exceed about 12 inches in
                    length. They are never ground or polished, but delicately chipped to a straight
                    edge, while the flakes are so regularly removed from the convex portions of the
                    blade as to give a rippled or wavy surface, and the corners of the handle are
                    delicately crimped, thus producing an appearance of great beauty and finish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Bronze Age.—</hi> In the earliest interments in which the
                    weapons deposited with the dead are of other materials than stone, a peculiar
                    form of bronze dagger occurs It consists of a well-finished, thin, knife-like
                    blade, usually about 6 inches in length, broad at the hilt and tapering to the
                    point, and always riveted to the handle by massive rivets of bronze. It has been
                    found associated with stone celts, both of the roughly-chipped and the
                    highly-polished kind, showing that these had not been entirely disused when
                    bronze became available. A later type of bronze dagger is a broad, heavy, curved
                    weapon, usually from 9 to 15 inches in length, with massive rivets for
                    attachment to an equally massive handle. The leaf-shaped sword, however, is the
                    characteristic weapon of the Bronze Period. It is found all over Europe, from
                    Lapland to the Mediterranean. No warlike weapon of any period is more graceful
                    in form or more beautifully finished. The finish seems to have been given in the
                    mould without the aid of hammer or file, the edge being formed by suddenly
                    reducing the thickness of the metal, so as to produce a narrow border of extreme
                    thinness along both sides of the blade from hilt to point. The handle-plate and
                    blade were cast in one piece, and the handle itself was formed by side plates of
                    bone, horn, or wood, riveted through the handle-plate. There was no guard, and
                    the weapon, though short, was well balanced, but more fitted, however, for
                    stabbing and thrusting than for cutting with the edge. The Scandinavian variety
                    is not so decidedly leaf-shaped, and is longer and heavier than the common
                    British form; and instead of a handle-plate, it was furnished with a tang on
                    which a round, flat-topped handle was fastened, like that of the modern Highland
                    dirk, sometimes surmounted by a crescent-like ornament of bronze. A narrow,
                    rapier-shaped variety, tapering from hilt to point, was made without a
                    handleplate, and attached to the hilt by rivets like the bronze daggers already
                    mentioned. This form is more common in the British Isles than in Scandinavia,
                    and is most abundant in Ireland. The spear-heads of the Bronze eriod present a
                    considerable variety of form, though the leaf-shaped predominates, and barbed
                    examples are extremely rare. Some British forms of this weapon are of great
                    size, occasionally reaching a length of 27 inches. The larger varieties are
                    often beautifully designed, having segmental openings on both sides of the
                    central ridge of the blade, and elaborately ornamented with chevrony patterns of
                    chased or inlaid work both on the socket and blade. Arrow-points are much rarer
                    in bronze than in flint. In all probability the flint arrow-point (which was
                    equally effective and much more easily replaced when lost) continued to be used
                    throughout the Bronze Period. Shields of bronze, circular, with hammered-up
                    bosses, concentric ridges, and rows of studs, were held in the hand by a central
                    handle underneath the boss. The transition period between the Bronze and Iron
                    Ages in Central Europe is well defined by the occurrence of iron swords, which
                    are simple copies of the leafshaped weapon, with flat handle-plate previously
                    fabricated in bronze. These have been found associated with articles assigned to
                    the 3d or 4th century B.c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Greek Heroic Age.—</hi> The Greek sword of the heroic age
                    is described by Homer as double-edged, long, sharp, and trenchant, the blade of
                    bronze, and the hilt and scabbard adorned with gold or silver studs. In the
                    Homeric combats, however, the spear, lance, or javelin always plays the
                    principal part, and the sword is only used when the combatants meet at close
                    quarters, the spear having failed to decide the contest. Both sword and spear
                    appear to have been of the forms which are characteristic of these weapons in
                    the Bronze Age of Central and Northern Europe. The bow of Pandarus is described
                    as made of ibex-horn and strung with sinews. The arrow-head is the only part of
                    the warrior’s equipment which Homer expressly describes as of iron, and the mode
                    of its insertion in a split in the head of the shaft, where it was made fast by
                    a ligature<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n615/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0615-0554"/> of sinew, is precisely that which is still
                    adopted by modern savages with their arrow-points of flint. The defensive armour
                    of the heroic ages was also entirely of bronze. In consisted of helmet, cuirass,
                    greaves, and shield. The helm was sometimes a simple casque, or closefitting
                    headpiece, but more frequently adorned with crest and plumes. The cuirass of
                    bronze was often elaborately engraved and adorned with gold. The greaves covered
                    the leg to the instep, and were either of bronze or some similar compound metal
                    of great toughness and flexibility. The shield, round or oval in form, is
                    described as of bronze, backed or covered with hide, and decorated with bosses
                    and concentric rings of metal. We have a gauge of the size of Hector’s shield in
                    the lines—</p>
                <p>“Hector of the gleaming helm</p>
                <p>Turned to depart; and as he moved along</p>
                <p>The black hull ’ s-hide his neck and ancles smote,</p>
                <p>The outer circle of his bossy shield.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ik</hi> vi. 116-118.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Greek Historic Age.—</hi> In the early historic ages the
                    characteristic weapons of the Greek armies were determined by the military
                    tactics of the period. The mode of fighting in heavy phalanx necessitated the
                    use of long, heavy spears. The Hoplites when massed in phalanx stood sixteen
                    deép, the men of each rank close together, shield touching shield, the pikes of
                    each line, 21 to 24 feet long, projecting from 2 to 13 feet in front of the
                    foremost rank at equal distances. The shield of the early monuments, though
                    still large, is not nearly so large as that of Hector, usually reaching from the
                    shoulder to the knee, and still retaining its round or oval form and bold
                    convexity. On the early vases the shields are represented as adorned with a
                    great variety of devices. We now find the helm having a lengthened neck-guard,
                    side-guards for the face, frontlet, and prolonged crest, sweeping gracefully
                    over the rounded top of the head-piece and falling down the back. At the time of
                    the Peloponnesian war the linen corselet, so much in favour among the Egyptians,
                    Assyrians, and Asiatics generally, was introduced instead of the heavy cuirass
                    of the Hoplites, and a smaller shield substituted for the larger and heavier one
                    previously in use, while the length of the sword was considerably increased. The
                    light-armed troops were furnished with a light javelin provided with a strap
                    orthong attached to the middle to assist in hurling it. The mounted troops were
                    similarly equipped as to their defensive armour, and furnished with a longer
                    sword, a javelin, and a short dagger.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Egyptian.</hi> —The strength of the Egyptian armies in the
                    earliest times consisted of archers, who fought either on foot or from chariots.
                    The Egyptian bow was somewhat shorter than the height of a man. The string was
                    of hide, catgut, or cord. The arrows varied from 24 to 34 inches in length, and
                    were usually of reed, winged with three feathers and pointed with heads of
                    bronze. These were sometimes cast with sockets and sometimes with tangs.
                    Arrow-heads of flint are occasionally found in the tombs along with those of
                    bronze, and Sir Gardner Wilkinson remarks on this, that “flint arrow-heads were
                    not confined to an ancient era, nor were they peculiar to Egypt alone; the
                    Persians and other Eastern peoples frequently used them even in war.” The
                    Egyptian archers were provided with a falchion, dagger, mace, or battle-axe, for
                    close combat; their defensive armour consisted of a quilted headpiece and coat,
                    but they carried no shield, which would have been an impediment to the free use
                    of the bow The infantry were classified according to the weapons with which they
                    fought, a3 spearmen, swordsmen, clubmen, and slingers. The spears were 5 or 6
                    fee long, with large triangular or leaf-shaped heads of bronze, socketed and
                    fastened to the shaft by a single rivet through the socket. The spearmen fought
                    in close phalanx, and were furnished with shields of a peculiar form,
                    rectangular below and semicircular above, like a round-headed door, about half
                    the height of a man. Their shields were covered with bull’s hide, having the
                    hair outwards, strengthened by rims and studs of metal, and furnished with a
                    round sighthole in the middle of the semicircular upper part. They had quilted
                    helmets, and cuirasses of bronze scales or quilted with bands of metal, but no
                    greaves. The early Egyptian sword was of bronze, straight, double-edged,
                    tapering from hilt to point, and varying from 30 to 36 inches in length. Axes,
                    with short handle and an oblong or crescentic blade, with segmental openings,
                    fastened to the handle and unsocketed, maces and clubs of various forms, and
                    short, leaf-shaped daggers of bronze, were also used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Assyrian.—</hi> The Assyrian sword, as represented on the
                    monuments, resembled the Egyptian, but was worn on the left side, slung in a
                    nearly horizontal position by the waistbelt. The bow was also a favourite weapon
                    with the Assyrians, and lances, spears, and javehns, with oblong, leaf-shaped
                    and unbarbed heads, constantly appear upon the sculptures. The shield was round
                    and convex; the helm frequently conical, truncated or curved forward, and with
                    pieces to protect the neck at the back and sides. Their cuirasses were
                    close-fitting tunics made of many layers of flax, plaited or interwoven, and
                    hardened and cemented with glue,—a species of linen corselet frequently referred
                    to as in use also among the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Etruscan.—</hi> The arms and armour of the Etruscans were in
                    the main similar to those of the Greeks. Their cuirasses, however, were provided
                    with overlapping shoulderguards, a peculiarity not observed in Greek armour. The
                    shields were round and exceedingly convex, the helmets of very various forms,
                    with a general tendency to a deep, bellshaped contour, adorned with an
                    excessively elevated and elongated crest, and sometimes with alated projections
                    of considerable height rising from opposite sides near the apex of the helm.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">liοman.—</hi> The early Roman sword, like that of the Greeks,
                    Egyptians, and Etruscans, was of bronze. We have no direct statement as to its
                    form, but in all probability it was of the leaf-shaped form so universally
                    characteristic of this weapon in bronze. We gather from the monuments that, in
                    the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the Roman sword was short, worn
                    on the right side, suspended from a shoulder-belt, and reaching from the hollow
                    of the back to the middle of. the thigh, thus representing a length of from 22
                    inches to 2 feet. The blade was straight, double-edged, and obtusely pointed. On
                    the Trajan column (114 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> it is considerably
                    longer, and under the Flavian emperors the long, single-edged <hi rend="italic"
                    >spatha</hi> appears frequently along with the short sword. The characteristic
                    weapon peculiar to the Romans, however, was the <hi rend="italic">pilum.</hi>
                    The form of this weapon and the mode of using it have been minutely described by
                    Polybius, but his description has been much misunderstood ⅛ consequence of the
                    rarity of representations or remains of the <hi rend="italic">pilum.</hi> It is
                    shown on a monument at St Remi, in Provence, assigned to the age of the first
                    emperors, and in a bas-relief at Mayence, on the grave-stone of Quintus Petilius
                    Secundus, a soldier of the 15th legion.. A specimen of the actual weapon is in
                    the museum at Weisbaden. It is a pike with a stout iron head, carried on an iron
                    rod, about 20 inches in length, which terminates in a socket for the insertion
                    of the wooden shaft. As represented on the monuments, the iron part of the
                    weapon is about one-third of its entire length, and its junction with the wooden
                    part of the shaft is fortified by a knob or swelling which is peculiar to this
                    weapon. When used as a javelin at short distances it had a most embarrassing
                    effect. Piercing the <pb break="no"

                    with the weight of the shaft, which then dragged along the ground, so that the
                    shield was rendered useless for defence. When used at close quarters it not only
                    answered all the purposes of the modern bayonet, but when firmly wielded in both
                    hands it was . equally efficient to ward off sword-strokes, which fell harmless
                    upon the long and strong iron neck of the weapon. Polybius states that the
                    legionary receiving the sword-strokes, with cool steadiness, upon his <hi
                    rend="italic">pilum,</hi> soon turned the swords of the enemy into mere hacked
                    and blunted strigils or skin-scrapers. Vegetius also describes the <hi
                    rend="italic">püum</hi> in a modified form as used in the armies of the Lower
                    Empire, and in a still more modified form it reappears as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >angon</hi> of the Franks, to be noticed further on. The defensive armour of the
                    Romans in earlier times resembled that of the Greeks as previously described,
                    and was chiefly of bronze, consisting usually of helmet with crest and
                    cheek-pieces, cuirass of breast and back plates, modelled «ο the form of the
                    bust, and having a border of leather bands or straps, falling vertically so as
                    to protect the lower part of the body. On the columns of Trajan and Antonine the
                    cuirass proper is given to the chiefs only, the legionaries having their
                    cuirasses of leather or linen, on which are sewn circular plates of metal, with
                    shoulder-pieces and oblong plates descending vertically from the lower border of
                    the cuirass. There are two varieties of shield on the Trajan column,—an oblong,
                    rectangular, and highly convex form, peculiar to the legionaries, and an oval,
                    flattened form borne by the knights and <hi rend="italic">velites.</hi> In later
                    times the oval shield was assumed by the legionaries. The Roman helmets in the
                    time of the early emperors were simple skull-caps with a hollowed neck-guard, a
                    small bar acting as a visor, and hinged cheek-pieces which fastened under the
                    chin. In the declining days of the empire the helmet became deeper, the shield
                    larger and more varied in form, the length of the sword was greatly increased,
                    and uniformity of weapons and equipment was no longer observed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Frankish.—</hi> The characteristic weapon of the Franks of the
                    Merovingian epoch (450-760 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> was the <hi
                    rend="italic">francisca</hi> or battle-axe, which they used as a missile.
                    Procopius describes it as having a broad blade and a short haft, and it is said
                    that the blow of an axe when hurled would pierce a shield or kill a man, and
                    that the Franks rarely missed their aim. Agathias, the continuator of Procopius
                    (535 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> says they wear no body armour, few of them
                    even having helmets, but they carry round shields, swords of the length of a
                    man’s thigh, axes having double edges, and darts which are used either for
                    throwing or for thrusting. These darts had barbed iron heads, and were used as
                    the <hi rend="italic">pilum</hi> was used by the Romans. When the <hi
                    rend="italic">angon</hi> was fixed in the enemy’s shield the custom of the Frank
                    was to bound forward, place his foot on the end of the dart as it trailed along
                    the ground, thus compelling the enemy to lower his shield, when he killed him
                    with his axe or sword. The Frankish sword was a short, straight, broad-bladed,
                    double-edged weapon, somewhat obtusely pointed, and usually about 30 to 32
                    inches in length. The sword and <hi rend="italic">francisca</hi> of Childeric,
                    one of the first of the Merovingian kings (457-481), were discovered in his tomb
                    at Tournay in 1653, and are now in the museum of the Louvre. The sword has a
                    short, straight cross-piece at the lower end of the hilt, and the pommel is of
                    the same form, but smaller. The Carlovingian epoch, though almost devoid of
                    distinctive characteristics as regards the arms in use, is remarkable for the
                    gradual change from infantry to cavalry, and represents the transition to the
                    period of chivalry. The development of the two military orders of the knights or
                    men-at-arms and the common infantry soldiers, serfs or peasants, may be said to
                    have begun in the armies of Charlemagne, and the superior class of fighting men
                    in his time had added to the ordinary equipment of the earlier Franks the helm
                    and coat of mail.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scandinavian.—</hi> The swords of the early Iron Age in
                    Scandinavia are frequently found in the mosses of Schleswig, associated with
                    objects bearing a strongly-marked analogy to those recovered from the graves of
                    our own Pagan Anglo-Saxon ancestors, of the period dating approximately from the
                    5th to the 7th centuries of the Christian era. They are long, straight,
                    double-edged, and often richly damascened. On the tangs of several of those
                    found at Nydam are the names of the armourers, some of which are of the Roman
                    form. The grip of the hilt was circular, usually narrow in the middle, and the
                    cross-pieces above and below were similar in shape. The sheaths were of wooden
                    laths, adorned with tastefully-executed mountings in bronze. On one of the
                    chapes an inscription in the earlier Runic alphabet occurred. Associated with
                    these swords were flat, circular wooden shields, of 22∣ to 44 inches diameter,
                    having a single handle under the central boss, and bosses and mountings
                    sometimes of iron, but more frequently of bronze. Helmets were rare, but
                    chain-armour of interlinked iron rings, of alternate rows of riveted and welded
                    rings, was in use. The sword of the early Viking time in Scandinavia was long
                    and heavy, usually double-edged, with strong rectangular crosspiece, narrow
                    grip, and massive square or triangular pommel. In the later Viking time
                    single-edged swords were more common, and the pommel was frequently tri-lobed,
                    and the cross-piece elongated so as to form a decided guard. The shields were
                    usually circular or oval, often painted and adorned with devices, and conical
                    helmets and coats of mail were common.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon.</hi> —The early Anglo-Saxon sword was usually
                    about 3 feet long, straight, double-edged, broad in the blade, and rounded at
                    the point, with hilt and grip and cross-piece like those of the early
                    Scandinavian swords previously described. As the sword was not carried by any
                    man under the rank of thane, it is not often met with in Anglo-Saxon interments.
                    With them, as with the Franks, it was a horseman’s weapon, and the common
                    accoutrement of the infantry was a spear, an axe, a shield, and a <hi
                    rend="italic">scramasax,</hi> or heavy single-edged knife. The Saxon spear was a
                    narrow, long-bladed weapon, varying greatly in form and dimensions, but
                    generally characterised by the socket being slit or unclosed throughout its
                    length. The axe was narrow-bladed and single-edged, and sometimes peaked at the
                    back. The shield, which was circular or oval in form, was of wood, covered with
                    leather, and furnished with a high conical boss, often terminating in a pipe or
                    a button. Anglo-Saxon warriors of the 10th century are represented in the
                    manuscripts as wearing hauberks of mail and rounded casques. The Aelfric
                    manuscript, of the end of the 11th century, shows the tri-lobed sword-hilt and
                    round shield.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Norman.—</hi> The arms and armour of the Normans at the period
                    of the conquest of Normandy were, of course, Scandinavian. The Norman arms of
                    the period of the conquest of England are portrayed on the Bayeux tapestry. The
                    sword is still of the Scandinavian type, long, straight, double-edged, and
                    somewhat tapering, and round or obtusely pointed with cross piece and pommel.
                    The horsemen are armed with long lances as well as swords. On the tapestry the
                    Normans are represented as well provided with archers and cavalry, of which the
                    Saxons are apparently destitute. Maces and clubs appear also among the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n617/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0617-0556"/> weapons; and axes, with shafts from 4 to 5 feet
                    in length, appear in the hands of both Normans and Saxons. The Norman shield is
                    large and kite-shaped, provided with arm-strap and handle, and adorned with
                    emblazonments of badges or devices. Few examples of the older circular shield
                    appear on the tapestry, and these few are Saxon. The body armour consisted of a
                    long hauberk, ringed or trellised, with divided skirt, and having the hood and
                    body in one piece. The helmet was deep, conically topped, and furnished with a
                    nasal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">English after the Norman Conquest.—</hi> The armour in use in
                    England since the period of the Norman Conquest may be briefly divided into four
                    groups, each associated with its own historical period. True mail armour of
                    interlinked rings was generally adopted in the time of the Crusades, and its use
                    extended to about the beginning of the 14th century. Towards the close of the
                    12th century the long plaited or mailed skirt, divided at the bottom, as we see
                    in the Bayeux tapestry, had been superseded by a short-sleeved tunic, generally
                    of chain-mail, reaching only to the knees, but sometimes covered with
                    variously-shaped plates of metal. This short hauberk was confined by a belt
                    about the waist, and furnished with a hood or coif, over which a close-fitting
                    helm was worn. In the 13 th century there was less uniformity of military
                    equipment. The hauberk was again lengthened to the middle of the leg, and had a
                    coif to cover the head, over which the massive helm, with or without a nasal,
                    was worn, sometimes with a movable visor. The sleeves of the hauberk were
                    prolonged, and mittens added to protect the hands; the lower limbs were covered
                    with mail, the coverings above the knee being called <hi rend="italic"
                    >chaussons,</hi> and those below the knee <hi rend="italic">chausses.</hi> The
                    sword was long, straight, and pointed, generally with a short recurved guard and
                    rounded pommel. The shield was small, triangular, or heater-shaped; the helm
                    massive, high, and flat-topped. After the middle of the 13th century secondary
                    defences of plate for the protection of the joints began to be introduced; the
                    hauberk was shortened, the mittens of mail were divided into fingers, the helm
                    was often rounded at the top, and greaves and shoulderplates were introduced.
                    The period of mixed mail and plate armour extends from about 1300 to about 1410.
                    The introduction of secondary defences of plate for the weaker and more exposed
                    parts of the mail-suit gradually changed the character of the armour, until it
                    produced the complete panoply of plate-armour. In the first half of the 14th
                    century the sleeves of the hauberk were shortened, <hi rend="italic"
                    >demi-brasarts</hi> were introduced for the protection of the back of the upper
                    arm, and <hi rend="italic">vambraces</hi> worn on the front of the lower arm,
                    <hi rend="italic">rαundles</hi> were added in front of the shoulderjoints and at
                    the elbows, and the greaves or <hi rend="italic">jambarts</hi> were continued
                    over the feet in laminated plates. The <hi rend="italic">bassinet</hi> was now
                    worn beneath the huge sugar-loafed helm, and had a <hi rend="italic"
                    >camail,</hi> or curtain of mail, descending down the back for the protection of
                    the neck, which subsequently assumed the form of a close-fitting tippet. By the
                    middle of the century splinted armour had become common, and the cuirass with
                    gussets of mail appears. As the second half of the century advanced, the arms
                    and legs were cased entirely in plate, laminated <hi rend="italic"
                    >sollerets,</hi> acutely pointed at the toes, covered the feet, while the body
                    was protected by a long-sleeved hauberk of mail, reaching to about the middle of
                    the thigh, with laminated <hi rend="italic">épaulieres</hi> or shoulder-guards,
                    and <hi rend="italic">coudieres</hi> or elbow-guards. The long sword, with
                    cross-guard, and the short dagger or <hi rend="italic">misericorde</hi> were now
                    in fashion, and heraldic crests were generally adopted before the close of the
                    century. The first ten years of the 15 th century were a period of transition,
                    and from about 1410 the armour became a complete panoply of plate. The period of
                    complete armour of plate which commenced about 1410 extended to the beginning .
                    of the 17th century. At the commencement of this period, or towards the middle
                    of the first quarter of the 15th century, the body armour consisted of breast
                    and backplates of one piece, the <hi rend="italic">roundles</hi> at the
                    shoulders were replaced by plates resembling small shields fixed in front of the
                    shoulder-joints, and a fan-like arrangement of plates protected the elbows.
                    Below the waist the body was protected by the <hi rend="italic">taces,</hi> a
                    series of narrow, overlapping plates attached to a lining of leather. The
                    crested helm, sometimes with the addition of a collar, was still in use in
                    battle and tournament. The bassinet was more globular in form, and connected by
                    a gorget with the suit of plate. By the middle of the century the same system of
                    re-inforcing, or adding secondary protections to cover the weaker points, which
                    gradually changed the mail into a complete panoply of plate, had effected
                    considerable changes on the character of the plate-suits, until the
                    corresponding defences of the right and left sides of the figure became totally
                    unlike each other. The <hi rend="italic">tabard,</hi> a short surcoat with short
                    sleeves, emblazoned with the arms of the wearer, now commonly appears over the
                    armour. By the end of this century the defensive system of platearmour had
                    reached its highest development. At the commencement of the 16 th century, a
                    species of armour of less rigid and cumbrous description, often formed of small
                    plates of metal quilted within garments of linen or other tissues, had come into
                    fashion, skirts of mail also came again into use, while the armour generally
                    became more massive and more richly decorated. Pointed or rounded <hi
                    rend="italic">sollerets gave</hi> place to <hi rend="italic">sabatons</hi> cut
                    off square at the toes, and plumes were generally attached to the helms. The <hi
                    rend="italic">salade</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">morion,</hi> light open
                    head-pieces, gave place to the closed helmet, with visor and beevor; the
                    recurved finger-guard, with the long straight sword, and all varieties of the
                    sabre, came into use; and two-handed swords and sword-breakers (curious
                    implements, with notches and springs for catching the blade of an antagonist’s
                    sword) were also used. As the century advances the decadence of armour begins to
                    be evidenced by its assimilation to the forms of dress and prevailing fashions
                    of the time. Mere surface ornamentation is more and more regarded; fluted,
                    laminated, and puffed suits are fashionable, and the gradual disuse of armour is
                    foreshadowed in the increasing use of fire-arms, against which it afforded no
                    sufficient protection. After the close of the 16th century it continued to be
                    worn as much for display as for real service. Cuirasses began to be superseded
                    by buff coats and jerkins, but demi-suits of plate were worn by cuirassiers far
                    on in the 17th century. The variations of tilting arms and armour, and of horse
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n618/mode/1up"

                    short notice. For these and other details the works of Grose, Meyrick, Skelton,
                    Stothard. and Hewitt may be consulted by those who wish to study them fully,
                    while the copiously-illustrated works of Demmin and Lacombe, recently translated
                    by Mr Black of the South Kensington Museum and Charles Boutell, are excellent
                    popular manuals of the general subject.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artillery.—</hi> The adoption of gunpowder as an agent in
                    warfare gradually revolutionised the whole system of military tactics, and was
                    not only the ultimate cause of the total disuse of defensive armour, but
                    rendered obsolete the whole of the projectile machines and weapons of the Middle
                    Ages. Bows and shields were the first to give way before it, as they were the
                    oldest forms of weapons of offence and defence. Shields are not represented on
                    English effigies after the last quarter of the 14th century, though the round
                    Highland target survived with the broadsword till 1745. The long-bow, which
                    became such an important weapon in the 13th and 14th centuries, was usually of
                    yew, about five feet in length, and a practised archer would send an arrow of a
                    yard long through his mark at a distance of 240 yards. The cross-bow, which is
                    first mentioned by the Princess Anna Comnena, appears in an Anglo-Saxon
                    manuscript of the 11th century. Its use against Christians was prohibited by the
                    Lateran Council in 1139, although it was allowed against the infidels. The
                    long-bow continued in use in England till the end of Queen Elizabeth’s reign,
                    and the cross-bow was only disused in the French army in the 17th century, so
                    slow was the process of transition from one system to another, even after the
                    superiority of gunpowder had been long well known. Gunpowder had been in use for
                    centuries, however, before it was applied to projectiles. The Chinese used it in
                    their fireworks at a very early date, and it is believed to have been introduced
                    into Europe by the intercourse of the Arabs with the natives of the far East.

                    >ad</hi><hi rend="italic">comburendos hostes</hi> of Marcus Graecus (846 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a,d.),</hi> where it is described as including six parts of
                    saltpetre, two of sulphur, and two of charcoal. A similar receipt occurs in the
                    <hi rend="italic">He</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirabilibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mundi</hi> of Albertus Magnus, bishop of Ratis-bon, 1280 A.D. Until about the
                    beginning of the 14th century, however, it had not been applied in warfare to
                    the purpose of throwing projectiles, and was probably regarded merely as an
                    explosive mixture, like the “Greek fire” and similar preparations, employed to
                    spread terror and conflagration. Large cannon were used on the Continent in
                    siege operations, however, as early as the beginning of the 14th century. Cannon
                    are first mentioned in England in 1338; Froissart alludes to them in 1340, and
                    it is certain that they were used by the English at the siege of Cambray in
                    1339. At the same time experiments were being made at Tournay with long, pointed
                    projectiles, and the duke of Brunswick had substituted leaden bullets for those
                    of stone which were then in common use in his artillery. Carronades were used on
                    board the French ships at the battle of Rhodes in 1372, and bronze cannon were
                    cast at Augsburg in 1378. Towards the end of the 14th century there were <hi
                    rend="italic">bombardes</hi> in existence, capable of throwing balls of stone of
                    200 lbs. in weight. All early cannon were breech-loaders, and at first they were
                    built of bars of wrought-iron hooped together. The well-known Scottish <hi
                    rend="italic">bombarde,</hi> Mons Meg, which was used at the sieges of Dumbarton
                    and Norham in 1489 and 1497 is made°in this way. So early as the beginning of
                    the 15 th century the prototypes of the modem <hi rend="italic"
                    >mitrailleuse</hi> were invented. In Germany they were subsequently styled
                    “death-organs,” and Weigel mentions one which had as many as thirty-three pipes.
                    In the 15 th century cannon of a lighter kind than those used in siege
                    operations began to be employed in the field, carriages with trails were
                    introduced, trunnions were added to the guns, and iron balls became common. With
                    the improvement in the manufacture of the gunpowder it was found that the
                    increased velocity of the projectile made up for the diminution of its weight;
                    and throughout the 16th century, the course of improvement was chiefly directed
                    to the lightening of the enormous weights of the guns and projectiles, so as to
                    secure facility of transport. So much progress had been made in this direction
                    by the middle of the century, that, in 1556, the Emperor Ferdinand was able to
                    march against the Turks with 54 heavy and 127 light pieces of artillery. At this
                    period the French artillery were restricted by Henry II. to the following
                    sizes:—Cannon throwing a projectile of about 34 lb; culverins of three sizes,
                    throwing projectiles of 15 lb, 7£ fl&gt;, and 2 lb respectively; and the falcon
                    and the falconet, the former of which threw a projectile of about 1 B⅛, and the
                    latter of less than half a pound. In the second half of the 16 th century
                    mortars began to be used in Germany, and howitzers, or pieces for discharging
                    hollow projectiles in a horizontal direction, came into use in England about the
                    same period. At first the mortars were discharged by double firing, the
                    artilleryman lighting the fuse of the shell with one hand and the priming of the
                    mortar with the other. It was not until 1634 that the mortar was introduced into
                    the French army; and towards the close of the 17th century the method of
                    igniting the fuse of the shell by the discharge of the piece itself became
                    general, and greatly simplified the use of the arm. Though Benjamin Robins (who
                    died in 1742) is sometimes spoken of as the inventor of the greatest improvement
                    of modem times,—the application of the system of rifling to artillery,—he was
                    merely the first who treated the subject scientifically. There are rifled cannon
                    of the 16 th century in the museum of the Hague. One in the arsenal at Berlin,
                    dated 1661, is rifled with 16 grooves, and one at Nuremberg, of 1694, has 8
                    grooves. But it was not till after the time of Benjamin Robins that, by the
                    application of an armature of softer metal to the iron projectiles of the rifled
                    guns, the difficulty was surmounted of enabling them at the moment of explosion
                    to fit themselves tightly into the grooves of the rifling. The improvements of
                    Paixhans in 1822, and of Armstrong in England and Krupp in Prussia, have brought
                    the manufacture of these monster pieces of ordnance to the highest pitch of
                    perfection. Krupp’s cannon are made of cast-steel, and one of these, a
                    breech-loader, exhibited in 1867, weighed close on fifty tons, and its shot,
                    also of cast-steel, were somewhat over half a ton in weight. The most recent,
                    and perhaps the most important improvement in the working of heavy ordnance is
                    that of Captain Moncreiff, by which the recoil of the gun itself is utilised, so
                    as to withdraw it under the parapet, and by means of a counterpoise to elevate
                    it again, after it has been reloaded and laid by means of a reflecting sight.
                    These operations are thus conducted without exposing a man, and the gun itself
                    is only exposed at the moment of delivering its fire.</p>

                    right side of the barrel, with a pan for the priming, a trigger, and a pair of
                    movable nippers, called <hi rend="italic">serpentine,</hi> for holding the
                    match, was invented in Spain in the time of Francis I. (1515-1547). The <hi

                    powerful than the <hi rend="italic">harquebus,</hi> came into use shortly
                    afterwards, and was well known in England before the close of the 16th century.
                    On account of its weight it was provided with a long rest, forked in the upper
                    part and furnished with a spike to stick in the ground. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >musket</hi> and <hi rend="italic">harquebus</hi> when first employed by the
                    French armies were contemptuously spoken of by contemporary writers, by whom
                    they were considered inferior to arblasts and cross-bows. The wheel-lock, which
                    was invented at Nuremberg in 1515, was but sparingly applied to the harquebus
                    and musket on account of the costliness of its mechanism and the uncertainty of
                    its action. The same objection applied to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >snaphaunces,</hi> the precursors of the first flint locks, and even to the
                    flint locks themselves, which were invented in France about 1640, and it was not
                    till the beginning of the 18th century that the flint-lock musket finally
                    superseded the old matchlock. In 1807 a Scottish clergyman, Alexander Forsyth,
                    took out a patent for a percussion gun, though it was not till 1820 that it
                    began to come into general use. The system of firing the charge by a fulminate
                    was followed by the invention of the needle-gun, the first model of which was
                    constructed in 1827 by Jean Nicolas Dreyse, a native of Erfurt. Improvements in
                    the mode of a*dapting the bullet to the rifled grooves successively led to the
                    perfected system of the Minie rifle, by which the explosion of the charge
                    expands the cup-shaped end of the conical bullet, and drives it into all the
                    grooves, a process which was previously effected by hammering with the ramrod.
                    The needle-gun was first made breech-loading in 1836, and since that time the
                    improvements effected have been mainly directed to the combination of length of
                    range with accuracy of aim and rapidity of fire. According to an official
                    report, the results of the trial at Spandau of the needle-gun used by the
                    different nations of Europe was as follows:—the Prussian, 12 shots per minute;
                    the Chasse-pôt, 11; the Snider (England) 10; the Peabody (Switzerland), 13; the
                    Werndl (Austria), 12; the Remington (Denmark), 14. Neither breech-loaders nor
                    revolvers, however, are inventions of modem date. Both were known in Germany as
                    early as the close of the 15th century. There are in the Musée d’Artillerie at
                    Paris wheel-lock <hi rend="italic">harquebuses</hi> of the 16th century which
                    are breech-loaders; and there is, in the Tower armoury, a revolver with the old
                    match-lock, the date of which is about 1550. A German harquebus of the 16th
                    century, in the museum of Sigmaringen, is a revolver of seven barrels. Nor is
                    rifling a new thing in fire-arms, for there was a rifled variety of the old
                    harquebus of the 15th century, in which the balls were driven home by a mallet,
                    and a patent was taken out in England for rifling in 1635. All these systems
                    were thus known at an early period in the history of fire-arms, but it is only
                    the perfecting of their mechanism and rifling, the improvements in the gunpowder
                    and the cartridge, and above all the adoption of the system of firing by a
                    fulminate, that have 'enabled them to be used with the precision, length of
                    range, and rapidity of fire, that now form such striking features in the warfare
                    of modem times. It remains only to notice the bayonet, the invention of which,
                    about 1650, has been claimed for Puséygur, a native of Bayonne. The bayonet in
                    its simple plug form, inserted into the mouth of the barrel, was adopted in
                    France and England about 1675. In 1689 it was attached by two rings to the
                    barrel by General Mackay, and the socketed bayonet was introduced by Vauban into
                    the French army in 1703. In these days of precision of aim with long-range
                    projectiles the bayonet; once the most decisive of modern weapons, has become of
                    secondary importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Collections.—</hi> The formation of historical collections of
                    arms and armour dates no further back than the commencement of the 16th century.
                    The earliest is that made by Louis XII. at Amboise in 1502. The magnificent
                    collection at Dresden was begun about 1553. The Ambras collection, now at
                    Vienna, of which a series of illustrative photographs has been published by the
                    Baron von Sacken, was commenced in 1570. There is also a splendid collection in
                    the Imperial Arsenal at Vienna, which has been described, with illustrations, by
                    Captain Leitner. The Musée d’Artillerie at Paris, catalogued by Μ. 1’ Haridon,
                    is one of the richest and best organised collections in Europe. In the Armeria
                    at Turin there is a fine collection, of which a catalogue has been published by
                    Count Seyssel. The collection at Sigmaringen is catalogued and illustrated by Dr
                    Lehner, and that of Munich by M. de Hefner-Alteneck. Of the remarkable
                    collections at Tzarskoe Selo, St Petersburg, and at Madrid, there are no
                    detailed descriptions. The collection in the Tower of London, which was
                    classified by Dr Meyrick, and catalogued by Mr John Hewitt, contains about 60Ô0
                    examples, from the commencement of the Middle Ages downwards, The most
                    remarkable private collection ever formed in this or any other country was that
                    of Llewelyn Meyrick -at Goodrich Court. It is to be regretted that the
                    opportunity of acquiring this collection in its integrity was missed by the
                    Government. It may be noticed as an indication of popular interest in the
                    subject, that a Museum of Arms, including specimens from the earliest period,
                    has been recently established in Birmingham, containing, in addition to a.series
                    of fire-arms granted by the Government, a fine and extensive collection made in
                    Italy by the Cavaliere Caliandra, of which the guardians of the Birmingham Proof
                    House have become the purchasers. If we except the National Museum of the
                    Antiquaries at Edinburgh, which contains a fine series of stone and bronze
                    weapons, and a few typical examples of the arms of later times, there is no
                    public collection of arms and armour in Scotland. (J. AN.)</p>
