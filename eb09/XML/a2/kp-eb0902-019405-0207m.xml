                    rules claiming apostolic origin and authority have descended to us, and of these
                    the two most important are the canons of the Apostolic Synod of Antioch and the
                    collection now described, which bears the title <hi rend="italic"

                    και πάνσεπτων ’Αποστόλων). The Apostolic Canons consist of a series of
                    eighty-five rules, of which the first fifty are held to be the most important<pb

                    directory for the guidance of the clergy in their daily life and usual round of
                    duties. It is somewhat remarkable that the life of the ordinary layman is for
                    the most part left unnoticed; four Canons only deal with the laity, the rest of
                    them speak of the clerical life and that alone. The authority of these Canons
                    varies in the Eastern and in the Western Church. The Eastern Church, following
                    the guidance of John of Damascus, has received as authoritative the whole
                    eighty-five, and makes them of equal authority with the Epistles of St Paul, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> acknowledges that they possess plenary authority. The
                    Western' Church has always hesitated to receive more than the first fifty, and
                    has received them more on the recommendations of such distinguished popes as
                    John II., Stephen III., and Urban Π., than because of their own intrinsic value;
                    and it was only when they were incorporated in the decretals that they obtained
                    a real authority.</p>
                <p>According to some authors, they are first quoted in the Acts of the Synod of
                    Constantinople, in 394 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and in those of the
                    Synods of Ephesus and Chalcedon, in 431 and 451 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    Some have said that they are mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Decretum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">libris recipiendis,</hi> issued by Pope
                    Gelasius (492-496 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> while others have pointed out
                    that the name occurs in those MSS. only which have the decree of Hormisdas
                    (514-523). Perhaps the soundest decision is, that the collection is not
                    mentioned in history until about the end of the 5th century; it is undoubted
                    that it was in existence before the beginning of the 6th,for the Latin
                    translation of the first fifty Canons dates from the year 500 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>A great deal of criticism has been expended upon this collection of
                    ecclesiastical rules. It was once commonly received that the Apostolic Canons
                    were the authoritative decisione upon church life and discipline enacted by the
                    first council of Jerusalem, whose proceedings are recorded in the Acts of the
                    Apostles. Since the 16th century juster views have prevailed. The Canons
                    themselves contain statements which are almost identical with many passages in
                    Holy Scripture, and with many of the decisions of the earlier synods and
                    councils, more especially those ’of Antioch, Nicaea, and Laodicea; it is also
                    evident that much that they include is but the description of the tradition and
                    practice of the church then existing. The following questions then arise :—(1.)
                    Are the passages which resemble what we find in Scripture taken therefrom, or
                    from contemporary independent oral tradition <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>?
                    and, (2.) Have the rules, which are almost literally identical with the
                    decisions of the earlier councils, suggested and formed the basis of
                    these.decisions, or are they themselves suggested by the decisions of the
                    councils? When we bear in mind the fact that the historical existence of the
                    Holy Scriptures and of the councils is well assured, and that we have no
                    trustworthy evidence of the existence of this collection until the end of the
                    5th century, the conclusion forces itself upon us that the Apostolic Canons must
                    be based upon the Acts of the earlier councils, not these upon the Canons.
                    Critics have differed about the precise date of the compilation. The Magdeburg
                    Centuriators think that it was some time in the 3d century; while Dalleus is of
                    opinion that it was not until the middle of the 5th century; others place it
                    between these dates. Perhaps the best conclusion we can come to is that the
                    so-called Apostolic Canons are a compilation of practical rules for the guidance
                    of the clergy made from holy Scripture, the decisions of the earlier councils,
                    and existing ecclesiastical usage, by an unknown ecclesiastic belonging to the
                    Syrian Church, who lived in the 4th or 5th century.</p>
