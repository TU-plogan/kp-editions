                    rend="italic">Haikh,</hi> in the native language), formerly an extensive country
                    of Western Asia, which is now divided between Turkey, Russia, and Persia. Its
                    political relations, and consequently its geographical limits, were subject to
                    frequent variation, but in its widest extent it may be described as reaching
                    from the Caucasus in the N. to the Mountains of Kurdistan in the S., and from
                    the Caspian Sea in the E. to Asia Minor in the W., frequently, indeed, somewhat
                    overlapping with the last-mentioned geographical division. From a very early
                    period a distinction was drawn between Greater Armenia <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Armenia Major, Medz Hayotz),</hi> to the east of the Euphrates, and Lesser
                    Armenia <hi rend="italic">(Armenia Minor, Phokhr Hayotz),</hi> lying to the
                    west. The former is more properly Armenia. It consists for the most part of an
                    elevated <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n608/mode/1up"

                    the sea, culminating in the peaks of Mount Ararat, and sinking towards the
                    plains of Iran on the east and those of Asia Minor in the west, while it is
                    frequently broken by glens and valleys. It is watered by the Euphrates, the
                    Tigris, the Aras, and the Kur, all of which have their sources within its
                    borders; and, like other mountainous countries, it possesses a large number of
                    lakes. The most important of these are Van or Aghtamar, Sevan or Khabodan, and
                    Urmiah or Keghem. The country is naturally fertile, producing grain, cotton,
                    tobacco, and grapes, but for many centuries it has been sadly neglected. It
                    abounds in romantic scenery and luxuriant pasture. The beauty of the district of
                    Ararat especially has been celebrated by patriotic historians like Moses of
                    Khorene and Lazarus of Pharb. In the time of its greatest prosperity, Armenia
                    Major was divided into fifteen provinces, and contained a large number of
                    flourishing and important towns. The capital for many centuries, under the
                    Haikian dynasty, was Armavir, to the north of the Araxes, but it was changed for
                    Artaxata (Ardashad) towards the close of the first century of our era. Erovant
                    II. (58-78 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> built Erovantashad and Pakaran, and
                    adorned them with the spoils of the earlier cities. From the 2d to the 4th
                    century the royal residence was at Valarsabad, which no longer exists, and,
                    under the Pagratid dynasty, the chief town waβ first Shiragavan and afterwards
                    Ani, the remains of which still testify to its magnificence. (Texier, <hi
                    rend="italic">Description de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Arménie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> Brosset, <hi rend="italic">Ruines</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Erzeroum, Van or Shamira-maguerd, Nakhjuan, Amid, and Pakovan. Divided and
                    incorporated by the three great empires already mentioned, Armenia has no longer
                    a separate existence, and details regarding the present condition of the country
                    that formerly bore the name come more appropriately elsewhere. The Russian
                    portion extends south to the Aras, and is mainly included in the government of
                    Erivan; the Persian share is absorbed in Azerbijan; and Turkish Armenia is
                    principally contained in the province of Erzeroum. The chief towns in the first
                    are Erivan, Etchmiadzin, Ordubad, and Alexand-ropol; in the second, Urumiyah;
                    and in the third, Erzeroum and Van.</p>
                <p>According to their own legendary history, in which ancient traditions are
                    curiously incorporated with Biblical lore, the Armenians are descendants of
                    Ξaik, a spn of Togarmah, the grandson of Japhet, who fled from the tyranny of
                    Belus of Assyria and settled in the country which now, in their language, bears
                    his name. The conquest of the land by Semiramis, and the revolt of Barvir
                    against Sardanapalus, are the chief events in the early ages. Tigranes or Dikran
                    is regarded as the contemporary and ally of Cyrus, and the history of his reign
                    is recorded in detail. His son, Vahakin, who succeeded him, was celebrated for
                    his strength, and was deified after his death. The dynasty came to an end in the
                    person of Vahi, who was defeated by Alexander the Great, 328 B.c.</p>
                <p>The Armenians threw off the Macedonian yoke in 317 β.c., and chose Ardvates as
                    their king; but on his death, about thirty-three years afterwards, they
                    submitted to the Seleucids of Syria. About 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    Artaxias, who had been appointed governor by Antiochus the Great, took advantage
                    of that monarch’s defeat by the Romans and proclaimed Armenia Major independent.
                    It was this prince who afforded an asylum in his court to the exiled Hannibal.
                    The example of revolt was followed in Lesser Armenia by Zadriades, whose
                    descendants maintained their position till the time of Tigranes IL, when their
                    territory was annexed to Greater Armenia.</p>
                <p>About the middle of the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the great
                    Parthian king, Mithridates I., who had already extended his empire over Syria,
                    established his brother, Valarsaces (Wagharshag), in Armenia, and thus rendered
                    him the founder of one of the most important branches of the Arsacid family. The
                    new king greatly promoted the prosperity of the country by founding cities,
                    establishing laws, and rewarding persons of talent. The most celebrated of his
                    successors was his great-grandson, Tigranes II., who made himself master of
                    Syria, the Lesser Armenia, and many Parthian provinces, and would, ’probably,
                    have been the founder of an extensive empire had not the solicitations of his
                    fathef-in-law, Mithridates of Pontus, brought him into collision with the
                    Romans. In reward for the submission which he ultimately made to Pompey, he was
                    allowed to keep possession of Armenia, with the exception of the provinces of
                    Sophene and Gordyene, which were erected into a separate kingdom for his son,
                    Tigranes. He ] continued a faithful ally of the Romans till his death, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> about 55 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when he was
                    succeeded by his son, Arta- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> vasdes, who, having
                    adopted a more independent policy, was taken prisoner by Antony and carried to
                    Alexandria, where he was afterwards beheaded by Cleopatra in 30 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>A period follows of nominal Roman supremacy and actual anarchy; 170 independent’
                    families all asserting themselves to the best of their ability, and a few of
                    them succeeding in establishing their petty principalities. At length a usurper,
                    Erovant, an Arsacid by the female line, made himself in some sort master of all
                    the kingdom about 58 A.D., and maintained his position till he was expelled by
                    Ardashes (Exedarus), a more direct representative of the race, who was
                    repeatedly dethroned and restored by Parthian and Roman interference, but
                    managed to do something for the amelioration of his country.</p>
                <p>When the Arsacids were driven from the Persian throne 1 by the Sassanid
                    Artaxerxes (Ardeshir), Chosroes the Great <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of
                    Armenia naturally took up arms in their defence; and ‘ he maintained the contest
                    till his assassination by Anag, an Arsacid prince of Persia, when Armenia became
                    subject to the Persian dynasty, 232 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In the
                    massacre of the royal family which ensued, none escaped but Tiridates (Tirdat),
                    a son of Chosroes, who fled to Rome, and afterwards, with the help of the
                    Romans, established himself on the throne, 259 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    The first act of his reign was the persecution of the Christians, who had begun
                    to take root in the country during the previous century. St Gregory, surnamed
                    the Illuminator, was cast into prison; but the king being, as he supposed,
                    miraculously cured of a dangerous distemper by the saint, the Christian religion
                    was embraced by himself and most of his people. The introduction of Christianity
                    tended to arouse the animosity of the Persians; and from this period Armenia
                    became the theatre of almost uninterrupted struggles between that nation and the
                    Romans, until Theodosius the Great agreed to cede to Persia the eastern part of
                    the country, which was thence called Persarmenia, while the western part was
                    annexed to the Roman empire. Theodosius nominated Arsaces IV., then nominal king
                    of Armenia, governor of the western division; and the Persian king, to
                    conciliate the people, appointed Chosroes III., a descendant of another branch
                    of the Arsacids, governor of the eastern part. The rule of the Arsacids in
                    Persarmenia ended with Ardashes IV., who was dethroned by Bahram V. of Persia in
                    428; and from that date Armenia ceased to be a kingdom, and was ruled till 632
                    by Persian <hi rend="italic">marzbans</hi> or governors. The Persians had all
                    along endeavoured to subvert Christianity, and for that purpose had recourse to
                    the most cruel persecutions. Frequent insurrections were the consequence, one of
                    the most remarkable being that which was led by Vartan (see Neumann’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of</hi><hi rend="italic">Vor</hi><hi rend="italic">fan,
                    by</hi><hi rend="italic">Elisoeus,</hi> 1830). From 632 till 839 Armenia was the
                    scene of almost incessant struggles between the Greeks <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n609/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0609-0548"/> and Mahometans, while its own native prince3
                    added to the confusion by their rivalries and strife. Ashod, a member of the
                    Pagratid family, which claimed to be of ancient Jewish origin, became master of
                    Central and Northern Armenia about 743, and, being recognised by the caliphs as
                    an independent prince, founded a dynasty which continued till 1079, when Cakig
                    II was assassinated, and his kingdom incorporated with the Greek empire. Another
                    family, which claimed the parricide sons of Sennacherib as its founders, held
                    possession of the province of Vasburagan and some of the neighbouring territory,
                    and maintained its independence till 1080, when it likewise succumbed to
                    Byzantium. During the same period the district northwest of lake Van was held by
                    the Mussulman race of the Merwanids,—called by the Armenians the princes of
                    Abra-huni,—who gave a nominal submission now to the Byzantine government and now
                    to the sultans.</p>
                <p>Rhupen (Ruben), a relative of the last king of the Pagratid dynasty, retired to
                    the north of Cilicia, and founded in the shelter of the Taurus a small
                    principality, which gradually extended its boundaries to the Mediterranean, and
                    became known as the kingdom of Lesser Armenia. The Rhupenians entered into
                    alliance with the Crusaders, and formed, along with the kings of Cyprus, the
                    last bulwark of Christianity in the East. They welcomed as allies the Mongolian
                    hordes that overran Asia in the 13th century, and shared in the hostility and
                    vengeance of the Mamelukes. The last king of the family, Leon, or Ghevond VI.,
                    was taken prisoner in spite of a Vigorous defence at Gaban in 1375, and, after
                    six years of captivity in Egypt, wandered through Europe till his death, at
                    Paris, in 1393. (See Langlois, <hi rend="italic">Essai sur les rois de la dyn.
                    Roupénienne,</hi> St Petersb., 1860; <hi rend="italic">Documents pour servir à

                    chartes T Arménie,</hi> 1863.)</p>
                <p>About the middle of the 14th century the Kurds had possession of the south of
                    Armenia, the Persians of the north, and the Ottomans of the west. The whole was
                    subjected to the sway of Tim our, of whose cruelties a graphic account has been
                    left by the Armenian, Thomas of Medzoph (see Nève’s <hi rend="italic">Etude
                    sur</hi><hi rend="italic">Thomas de MedzopK).</hi> It was mainly governed by
                    Persian officials during the next century, the only national authority being the
                    patriarch. Tn 1604 Shah Abbas, in his contest with Ahmed I., laid the whole
                    country waste, and forcibly transplanted about 40,000 of the inhabitants into
                    Persia, where they settled principally in Ispahan and New Julfa, as they fondly
                    called the city which they founded. Since then the Armenians have had no
                    political position as a nation, though they continue to form an important and
                    valuable portion of the population in Russia, Turkey, and Persia, and their
                    colonies have spread into almost all quarters of the globe. It was calculated,
                    about 1850, that there were approximately four millions of Armenians in the
                    world, of whom 2,500,000 were inhabitants of the Ottoman empire, 1,200,000 of
                    the Russian empire, 25,000 in the empire of Austria, 150,000 in Persia and
                    Azerbijan, 25,000 in continental India and the Archipelago of Asia, and the
                    remaining 100,000 scattered in various countries (Dulau-rier). According to a
                    recent statistician of Turkey (Lejean), there are 400.000 Armenians in the
                    European part of the empire, of whom more than 200,000 are in Constantinople
                    itself. Originally ∙a brave and warlike people, they have become distinguished
                    for their peaceful character and their submissiveness to the government of every
                    country in which they live. (See the articles of Dulaurier and Prince Dadian in
