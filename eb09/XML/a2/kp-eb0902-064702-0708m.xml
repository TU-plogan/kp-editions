                    or body-rings, in <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi> and the other groups to
                    which the class-name Insect is now restricted, and in Worms, under which he
                    comprehended insect larvae, several true Annelids, and intestinal worms
                    (Scolecida), he failed to appreciate this as a feature common to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Malacostraca</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Scleroderma,</hi> which he
                    named on account of the character of their integument. Linnaeus, on the other
                    hand, saw that annulation was the most prominent common feature, and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Insecta,</hi> therefore, -were a good natural group so long as
                    embryology could throw no light on the affinities of the Cirripeds and parasitic
                    Crustaceans—these two groups forming, together with the intestinal worms,
                    molluscs, zoophytes, and lithophytes, the class <hi rend="italic">Vermes.</hi>
                    Cuvier (1829) includes in the third branch of his scheme, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Animalia articulata,</hi> Annelids, Crustaceans, Arachnids, and Insects (the
                    Myriapods being an order of this class). Latreille (1796) proposed a scheme in
                    which the orders of the Insects (as now restricted) formed equivalent groups
                    with the Crustaceans, Arachnids, and Myriapods, which now first appear as a
                    distinct group, though still united with a section of the Crustaceans. Latreille
                    further, in 1801, recognised the Cirripeds as intermediate between his <hi
                    rend="italic">Insecta</hi> and the Molluscs. Lamarck gave the value of classes
                    to the Insects, the Arachnids (including therein the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thysanura</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myriapoda),</hi> the Crustaceans, and the
                    Cirripeds. But he has no province answering to the Cuvierian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Articulata,</hi> since these orders are, with Annelids, Conchifers ( =
                    Lamellibranchs), and Molluscs ( = <hi rend="italic">Odonto-phora),</hi> members
                    of the “sensitive animals,” the Lernaeans and other parasitic Crustaceans being
                    an order of the <hi rend="italic">Vermes,</hi> and therefore apathetic animals.
                    De Blainville, still relying chiefly on external form, recognises four types in
                    the sub-kingdom of the bilateral animals :— <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Artiom&lt;xrpha</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Artiozoaria),</hi> of which the
                    first is <hi rend="italic">Osteozoaria</hi> (Vertebrates). The second, <hi
                    rend="italic">Entomozoaria</hi> (Articulates), includes: Class 1. <hi

                    rend="italic">Cestoidea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ascaris.</hi> The third type, <hi
                    rend="italic">Malentozoaria,</hi> is intermediate between the Articulates and
                    Molluscs, and embraces two classes: <hi rend="italic">Nemato-poda,</hi>
                    Cirripeds; and <hi rend="italic">Polyplaxiphora,</hi> the Chitons. The
                    classification of which this forms a part is a compromise between the method of
                    Cuvier, based on the recognition of distinct plans, and that of Ehrenberg, who
                    sketched each group as departing from the common plan of the animal kingdom only
                    by excess of development in one or other direction. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Articulata,</hi> viz., <hi rend="italic">Insecta, Arachnoidea,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Crustacea</hi> (the Cirripeds and Epizoa being included), <hi
                    rend="italic">Anmι∙ lata,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Somatotoma</hi> (the two
                    latter making up all that are now known as Annelids), he distinguished from
                    Molluscs by the isolation of their ganglia and their succession, those of the
                    Molluscs being dispersed. Owen’s <hi rend="italic">Homogangliata,</hi> as
                    equivalent to <hi rend="italic">Articulata,</hi> is the expression of the same
                    difference; his <hi rend="italic">Insecta</hi> embrace two sub-orders, <hi
                    rend="italic">Myriapoda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hexapoda,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annellata</hi> are placed between the Epizoa and Cirripeds.
                    Milne-Edwards (1855) divides the <hi rend="italic">Entomozoaria</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Annellata</hi> into two groups,—(1.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arthropoda,</hi> including Insects, Myriapods, Arachnids, and Crustaceans; and
                    (2.) <hi rend="italic">Vermes,</hi> including Annelids, Helminths,
                    Turbellarians, Cestodes, and Rotifers. Siebold and Stannius (1845) made the
                    Arthropods a primary division co-ordinate with <hi rend="italic">Vermes,</hi>
                    and united the Myriapods with the Crustaceans. Leuckart’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arthropoda</hi> comprise two classes,— <hi rend="italic">Crustacea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Insecta</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the latter combining the
                    orders, <hi rend="italic">Myriapoda, Arachnida,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hexapoda.</hi> Fitzinger’s <hi rend="italic">Arthrozoa,</hi> or eminently motor
                    animals, Crustaceans, Arachnoids, and Insects, contrast with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dermatozoa</hi> or Molluscs, which are eminently sensitive. Von
                    Baer’s <hi rend="italic">Articulata</hi> correspond to the Cuvierian group under
                    the same designation, and like it represent a type of organisation, the
                    longitudinal or bilaterally symmetrical, the organs being arranged with
                    reference to the axial alimentary canal. The embryological system of Van Beneden
                    (1855) rests upon the position of the vitellus relatively to the surface of the
                    embryo, the Articulates being designated by him <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epicotyle-dones</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Epivitellians,</hi> the vitellus
                    being received into the embryo on the dorsal or upper surface, while the
                    vertebrates receive the yelk on the ventral or lower surface, and are therefore
                    <hi rend="italic">Hypocotyledones or Hypovitellians.</hi> As will be pointed out
                    afterwards, this nomenclature is unfortunate, since the surfaces thus contrasted
                    are identical, both being the haemal aspects of the body. It may further be
                    remarked that the term <hi rend="italic">Articulata</hi> is manifestly one which
                    should be abandoned, since it is made to represent very different things, being
                    used by Cuvier, Ehrenberg, and Owen to include the Annelids,—by Van Beneden,
                    Vogt, and some more recent writers, to their exclusion. N either is <hi
                    rend="italic">Arthrozoa,</hi> the Greek equivalent of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Articulata,</hi> more commendable, Burmeister and Fitzinger using it with the
                    same difference. But <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda</hi> has varied only in the
                    rank assigned to it, not in the area it represents; thus Milne-Edwards makes it
                    a sub-division of the <hi rend="italic">Annellata;</hi> Van Beneden, Siebold and
                    Stannius, and Leuckart, a primary division of the animal kingdom. But as a
                    general designation for thoso animals which are made up of nearly equivalent
                    somatomes or somites is needed, Macleay’s term <hi rend="italic">Annulosa</hi>
                    is, perhaps, the best, since it has never been used for two incommensurate
                    groups. Leach, and later (1825) Latreille, proposed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Condylopoda</hi> as the name of the group for which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arthropoda</hi> was afterwards devised. Custom has overborne the rule of
                    priority, and the later is now the more common name. The classifications
                    hitherto mentioned rest solely on an anatomical basis, those of Von Baer and Van
                    Beneden dealing<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n709/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0709-0648"/> only with the observed facts of development.
                    Haeckel, applying all that was known of embryology to the construction of the
                    pedigree of the groups, made (1866) the <hi rend="italic">Articulata</hi> one of
                    the five great trunks of the genealogical tree. The Articulate phylum embraced
                    the Infusoria and intestinal worms, as well as the Annelids, along with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arthropoda</hi> as restricted above. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arthropoda</hi> further formed two groups :— <hi rend="italic">Carides,</hi>
                    the branchiate Arthropods or Crustaceans; and <hi rend="italic">Tracheata,</hi>
                    the Arachnids; Myriapods, and Insects, which breathe by tracheae. The term
                    Articulate disappears from Haeckel’s latest classification, in which a
                    redistribution of the phyla is set forth. From assumed ancestors destitute of
                    body-cavity <hi rend="italic">{Acoelomi)</hi> descend those <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vermes</hi> with body-cavity, of whose plan <hi rend="italic">Echinodermata,
                    Arthropoda,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi> show special modifications. In 1870 Gegenbaur gave a general
                    table, in which the <hi rend="italic">Vermes</hi> included <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tτιnicata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Annv,lata.</hi> The former led towards the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mollusca;</hi> the latter was the starting point of <hi
                    rend="italic">Arthropoda,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Echinodermata;</hi> of the Arthropods there are four
                    classes,—Crustaceans, Arachnids, Myriapods, and Insects. Amidst all the varying
                    opinions as to the value of the group, the importance of the limbstructure has
                    been recognised since Latreille dwelt upon the articulations by which the parts
                    of these appendages are connected.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda</hi> agree in the characteristic already
                    mentioned, the articulations of their limbs, whence the class-name is derived.
                    The body presents various degrees of complexity. In the caterpillar, the <hi
                    rend="italic">metamera, somites, somatomes,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >annuli,</hi> owe their mobility to differences in thickness of the integument.
                    In the Myriapods the numerous similar somites are flexed on each other by the
                    overlap of the chitin-thickened portions of cuticle which protect the upper and
                    lower surface of each division. The somites are more or less effaced in the
                    abdomen of insects and spiders; head and thorax in crabs and spiders have their
                    composite origin concealed. But the external signs of division of the body no
                    longer correspond, as in Annelids, to the distribution of the internal organs,
                    which, with a partial exception in the case of the nervous system, are now
                    unities contributing to the well-being of the whole. Homonomy, the absence of
                    segmentation, or the equivalence of the divisions of the body, among the
                    Annelids, has been contrasted with the heteronomy, or segmentation of the
                    arthropod body. The difference, however, is only one of degree, since both the
                    cephalic and caudal extremities, at least of the higher Annelids, are true
                    segments, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> fused somites which, in addition to
                    fusion, have undergone some amount of specialisation. In the four classes of
                    Arthropods the head is a constant segment. It consists of prae-oral and
                    post-oral somites, the ganglia of which are represented by the supra-and
                    sub-oesophageal masses. The number of somites, as represented by appendages, is
                    not the same in the four classes, and as the variation affects the prae-oral
                    appendages supplied from the supra-oesophageal ganglion the difference is of
                    great importance. In the Crustaceans the somites of this segment are, according
                    to Huxley,— App.—Eyes, Antennae, Antennules, Mandibles, Maxillae, Maxillae. <hi
                    rend="italic">Som.—</hi> 1. 2. 3. <hi rend="italic">4. 5. 6.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Podophthalmata</hi> present the eyes as modifications of
                    processes identical with those which become ambulatory limbs. In the rest the
                    eyes are sessile. In Myriapods, Arachnids, and Insects, the eyes are sessile,
                    and the prae-oral appendages are reduced to one pair of antennae, whose
                    innervation is from the supra-oesophageal ganglion. Apart from the value to be
                    assigned to descent in the search for homologies among these classes, it is a
                    question of fact whether the eyes are prae-oral or lateral to the oral aperture.
                    The cephalic lobes carry the organs of sight probably in the earliest types of
                    development at the angle of bifurcation, the position of the single eye of
                    Ostracods. In more complex forms the eyes appear more or less towards the outer
                    margin of the lobes; and in insects where the cephalic arch is high, these
                    organs may appear to correspond not to the most anterior, but to a posterior
                    part of the cephalic sterna, just as sensory organs appear, the gustatory at the
                    base of the outer, the auditory at the base of the inner antennae in the higher
                    Crustaceans. By shortening of the development process the change of position may
                    be obscured, and the eyes, primitively belonging to the extremity of the
                    embryonal body, may from the first appear connected with more posterior somites.
                    The identification of homologous parts of the prae-oral region in the four
                    classes rests on the opinion held as to the origin of the classes. If the
                    Crustaceans are regarded as the stock of the Arthropods, the homologies must be
                    recognisable. If, on the other hand, all four are divergencies from a common
                    stock, then the absolute identity of the parts must hold a second place in
                    comparison with a general conformity to the common plan. The identification of
                    the eyes with a particular pair of appendages necessitates the assumption that
                    these sense organs, when sessile, are so by non-development of their supports.
                    The converse supposition is more admissible, that the eyes are supported on
                    stalks as the result of an adaptive modification. Further, among the Crustaceans
                    we find hints of the primitive composite character of the Arthropod. The
                    auditory sacs of <hi rend="italic">Mysis</hi> are at the caudal extremity of the
                    body, the respiratory organs of Isopods are in the same position, and the
                    genital orifices vary in different genera, and even in the sexes of the same
                    species. Analogous (perhaps no more) is the distribution among Molluscs of the
                    eye-spots which fringe the mantle of <hi rend="italic">Pecten,</hi> are
                    pedunculate in the snail, and, with the otolithic sacs, are in close proximity
                    to the nerve centres of cuttlefishes. If this view is accepted, the close
                    comparison of the limbs of Arthropods loses much of its importance, and it
                    becomes more interesting to endeavour to trace the primitive form from which the
                    divergences have occurred. Among Crustaceans the Nauplius is the earliest
                    recognisable form,—“an unsegmented ovate body, a median frontal eye, and three
                    pairs of natatory feet, of which the anterior are simple, and the other two
                    biramose” (F. Müller). The third pair of appendages is replaced by the
                    mandibles, the oval body is divided by a transverse fold, and the Nauplius head
                    and tail thus marked off have the mid-body of the adult developed by
                    intercalation between them. Appendages are developed before segmentation is
                    indicated in the free living Nauplius; but in some this stage is overpassed in
                    the egg, the evidence of its existence being the presence of a thin exuviated
                    membrane which is not egg membrane, nor can it be termed amnion, without
                    overstraining that term which is properly used in the higher vertebrate
                    embryology. In Insects the vermiform stage is rapidly passed through, the
                    priority of segmentation to the development of appendages being indicated in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Trichoptera,</hi> according to Zaddach, and in Aphis,
                    according to Huxley. If we go to the Rotifers, there are in that group types
                    which are comparable with the Nauplius of Crustaceans, and with the vermiform
                    larvae of Insects, as 0. Schmidt and Lubbock <hi rend="italic">{Origin and
                    Metamorphoses of Insects')</hi> have shown. <hi rend="italic">Pedalion</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mira</hi> (Hudson) has a very close resemblance to the Nauplius,
                    <hi rend="italic">Lindia</hi> to the vermiform grub of Dipterous insects. The
                    resemblance is not impaired by the comparison suggested by Ray Lankester between
                    the Molluscs and Rotifers. Huxley calls the Molluscs “little more than
                    oligomerous modifications of the polychaetous Annelids” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Nature,</hi> December 10,1874); and in this article it is attempted to show
                    what are the simplest forms presenting common features with the Arthropods. The
                    hexapod Insect has been compared by Haeckel, F. Müller, and others to the Zoëae
                    of Malacostracous Crustaceans, a group-in one <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n710/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0710-0649"/> member only of which, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peneus,</hi> has a Nauplius stage been detected. The Zoëa and the Insect
                    possess alike three pairs of limbs for locomotion, and three for ingestion of
                    food. The abdomen in both is without appendages, and the mandibles are without
                    palps. Admitting the resemblances, there is a prior question to be settled in
                    the case of Insects, Myriapods, and Arachnids. Are the temporary embryonal
                    investments of these animals, the cellular and the structureless membranes, to
                    be compared with the blastodermic moultings of Crustaceans, with that membrane
                    whose presence in the Amphipods is accepted by some observers, as the last trace
                    of the Nauplius stage! In the Acarids Claparède found the inner layer to invest
                    the embryo after the outer gave way, and Metschnikoff recognises the deutovum in
                    <hi rend="italic">Platygaster</hi> also. The identification with the Nauplius is
                    strongly denied by the last-named observer; but there is still room for further
                    investigation, since embryologists of high reputation differ so entirely on the
                    matter of fact, irrespective of phylogenetic theories. Should the identification
                    be accepted, the Arthropods would, as a group, egree in having a Nauplius stage,
                    different in detail in each class; the second, or Zoëa stage, would differ still
                    more in each, and the homologies of the parts would thus become obscured in
                    details, the identity of the general plan being clearly recognisable. All the
                    Arthropods agree in having the terminal portion of the intestinal canal derived
                    from the outer, the middle portion from the inner embryonic layer. Lastly, the
                    Arthropods, in common with the Molluscs and Annelids, have their body-cavity, or
                    perivisceral space, formed by the splitting of the mesoblast, or derivative
                    layer formed between the outer and inner layer (epiblast and hypoblast, and
                    ectoderm and endoderm). In Insects, in the higher Arachnids, and Crustaceans,
                    yelk segmentation is partial; in Myriapods, and the lower Arachnids, and
                    Crustaceans, it is total; but as in Insects, for example, the unsegmented yelk
                    undergoes at a later period a division into polygonal masses, the difference,
                    though of value in classification, is not of primary importance. The relation of
                    the branchiate Arthropods, the Crustaceans, to the other three tracheate
                    classes, has been discussed chiefly from a phylogenetic point of view. The
                    priority of aquatic to terrestrial forms is assumed, and the derivation of the
                    latter from the former is traced in various ways. The somites or metamera of the
                    Arthropod retain, more than the nervous system which is derived from the
                    epiblast, and still more than the alimentary canal and its appendages, the
                    annulose characteristic that each represents a unit; each may, and many do, give
                    rise to appendages originally similar, but afterwards modified for special
                    functions. Hence the same limbs are tactile in Crustaceans, prehensile in
                    Arachnids, ambulatory in some Crustaceans, accessories of mastication in others,
                    locomotive in some, respiratory in others. In Insects the abdomen of the adult
                    is destitute of appendages, but many larvae are provided with tracheal gills,
                    that is, external processes in which air-canals ramify, and in which a large
                    quantity of blood is received within the cavity of the thin-walled dilatable
                    process. These processes are destitute of external apertures, the tracheal
                    system is in them closed. Such structures are found but rarely to co-exist with
                    the open condition of this tracheal system. But <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteornarcys,</hi> one of the Orthopterous order, is remarkable for this
                    conjunction, the branchial processes cf the adult overhanging the stigmata of
                    the tracheae. Considerable variety exists in the position of the gills. The
                    larvae of <hi rend="italic">Perla</hi> have three thoracic pairs of gills, and
                    are terminal of the abdomen. In other cases they are confined to the abdomen.
                    Now, it is to be noted that these gill projections are not at first tracheal; in
                    <hi rend="italic">Chloea</hi> the tracheae appear after another moult, and they
                    are then vibratile. Further, they are developed from the upper surface of the
                    body. Now, in the Annelids the limbs are typically double pairs projected from
                    the sides of the body; the parapodia consist of two branches, notopodium and
                    neuropodium, and the gills when present are modifications of the notopodium. In
                    the Crustaceans this bipartite condition is indicated by the exopodial and
                    endopodial divisions of the limbs. In the adult insect this duplicity has
                    disappeared, unless we recognise in the position of the gill tracheae the
                    equivalent of the branchiferous notopodium. Gegenbaur and Lubbock regard the
                    wings as tracheal gills transferred from locomotive organs in water to
                    locomotive functions in air. Gegenbaur thinks that the dropping off of the gills
                    determines the opening of the tracheal system by the stigmata or pores. Further,
                    he assigns to the closed tracheal system a funotion similar to that of the
                    swim-bladder of fishes, structures primarily useful in flotation, subordinately
                    respiratory in function.</p>
                <p>Natural as may seem the assemblage included under <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arthropoda,</hi> there is no group in which adaptive modifications have
                    introduced so much diversity of anatomical and physiological relations.
                    Metamorphoses, the changes of form which changes of external conditions have
                    promoted, are met with of very various amount. The progress of the embryo from
                    the first appearance of the blastoderm up to sexual maturity of the adult may be
                    direct, without metamorphosis, or may be retarded by changes of form and habit,
                    rendering the young animal capable of sustaining lifo under very various
                    conditions. In any one of these stages, even in the adιdt, multiplication may be
                    provided for by a process of budding, the bud from which the new form emerges
                    being in essence undistinguishable from the ovum for whose further development
                    impregnation is necessary. These metamorphoses are probably of late origin in
                    the history of the group, their perpetuation being due to change in their
                    surroundings. Their relations may be “falsified by the struggle for existence,”
                    the details of the developmental history of the family (phylogenesis) may be
                    crowded into a short space in the development of the individual (Ontogenesis).
                    The description of these variations belongs to the particular treatment of the
                    Crustaceans, Myriapods, Arachnids, and Insects. (j. γ.)</p>
