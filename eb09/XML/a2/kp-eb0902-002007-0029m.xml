                    Bishop of Winchester, one of the most illustrious of the prelates of England,
                    was born in 1555 in Thames Street, Allhallows, Barking, London. His father
                    Thomas was of the ancient family of the Suffolk Andrewes; in his later years he
                    became master of Trinity House. Lancelot waβ sent while a mere child to the
                    Coopers’ Free School, Ratcliff, in the parish of Stepney. From this the youth
                    passed to Merchant Taylors’ School, then under the celebrated·Richard Mulcaster.
                    In 1571 he was entered at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He was here one of the
                    first four scholars upon the foundation of Dr Thomas Watts, successor of the
                    venerable Nowell. Contemporaneously he was appointed to a scholarship in Jesus
                    College, Oxford, at the request of the founder (Dr Price), by Queen Elizabeth.
                    In 1574-5, he took his degree of B.A.; in 1576 he was chosen to a fellowship at
                    his college; in 1578 he proceeded Μ. A.; in 1580 he was ordained, and in the
                    same year his name appears as junior tieasurer; in 1581 he was senior treasurer,
                    and on July 11, was incorporated Μ. A. at Oxford. On passing Μ. A., he was
                    appointed catechist in his college, and read lecture» upon the Decalogue,
                    afterwards published, causing a <hi rend="italic">furor</hi> of interest far and
                    near, as his first quaint biographer Isaacson tells. The notes of these lectures
                    printed in 1642 authenticate themselves; later editions have been suspiciously
                    enlarged, and otherwise altered for the worse.. The notes are historically
                    valuable and important, inasmuch as with Bishops Jewell and Bilson, he teaches
                    in them, that Christ is offered in a sacrament, that is, his offering is
                    represented and a memory of his passion celebrated. Nothing can be more definite
                    or emphatic than Andrewes’ repudiation of a real external sacrifice in the bread
                    and wine. From the university Andrewes went into the North, on the invitation of
                    Henry Hastings, earl of Huntingdon, lord president of the North. In 1585 he is
                    again found at Cambridge taking his degree of B.D. In 1588 he succeeded Crowley
                    in the vicarage of St Giles, Cripplegate. Here he delivered his most penetrative
                    and striking <pb break="no"

                    1592, the latter in 1611. In a great sermon on April 10, in Easter week 1588, he
                    most effectively, and with burning eloquence, vindicated the Protestantism of
                    the Church of England •against the Romanists. It sounds oddly to have “Mr
                    Calvin” adduced herein and elsewhere as a new writer, with lavish praise and
                    affection. Passing other ecclesiastical advancements, Andrewes was preferred by
                    Grindal, at the suit of Walsingham, to the prebendal stall of St Paneras in St
                    Paul’s, London, in 1589. The prebendary had “the courage of his opinions,” for
                    Sir John Harington records that Sir Francis Walsingham, his patron, having
                    laboured to get him to maintain certain points of ultraPuritanism, he refused,
                    having, as the garrulous Knight, in his <hi rend="italic">State of the Church of
                    England</hi> (pp. 143, 144), pun-ningly remarks, “too much of the αvδpos in him
                    to be scared with a councillor’s frown, or blown aside with his breath,” and
                    accordingly answered him plainly, that “they were not only against his learning,
                    but his conscience.” On September 6, 1589, he succeeded Fulke as master of his
                    own college of Pembroke, being at the time one of the chaplains of Archbishop
                    Whitgift. His mastership of Pembroke was a success in every way. In 1589-90, as
                    one of the twelve chaplains of the queen, he preached before her majesty a
                    singτdarly outspoken sermon (March 4, 1590). In this year, on October 13, he
                    preached his introductory lecture at St Paul’s, upon undertaking to comment upon
                    the first four chapters of Genesis. These form part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orphan Lectures,</hi> of the folio of 1657, than which there is no richer
                    contribution to the theological literature of England, notwithstanding the
                    imperfection of the notes in some cases. He -was an incessant worker as well as
                    preacher. He delighted to move among the people, and yet found time to meet w
                    ith a society of antiquaries, whereof Raleigh, Sidney, Burleigh, Arundel, the
                    Herberts, Saville, Stow, and Camden, were members. What by his often preaching,
                    testifies Isaacson, at St Giles’s, and his no less often reading in St Paul’s,
                    he became so infirm that his friends •despaired of his life. His charities were
                    lavish, and yet discriminative. The dearth of 1594 exhibits him as another
                    Joseph in his care for the afflicted and poor of “the Israel of God.” In 1595
                    appeared <hi rend="italic">The Lambeth Articles,</hi> a landmark in our national
                    church history. Andrewes adopted the doctrine of St Augustine as modified by
                    Aquinas. Philosophically, as well as theologically, his interpretations of these
                    deep things remain a permanent advance in theological-metaphysical thought. In
                    1598 he declined offers of the two bishoprics of Ely and Salisbury, his “nolo
                    episcopari” resting on an intended alienation of the lands attached to these
                    sees. On November 23, 1600, was preached at Whitehall his memorable sermon on
                    Justification, around which surged a controversy that is even now unspent. The
                    preacher maintained the evangelical view as opposed to the sacerdotal. On July
                    4, 1601, he was appointed dean of Westminster, and his sedulousness over the
                    renowned school is magnified by Bishop Hacket in his <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Archbishop Williams.</hi> On July 25, 1603, Andrewes assisted at the coronation
                    of James I. In 1604 he took part in the Hampton Court Conference, and, better
                    service, was one of the committee to whom we owe our authorised version of Holy
                    Scripture. The dean frequently preached before the king, and his majesty’s own
                    learning, given him by George Buchanan, made him a sympathetic hearer. Many of
                    these state sermons are memorable from their results and place in our
                    ecclesiastical history.. In 1605 he was appointed, after a third declinature,
                    bishop of Chichester. In 1609 he published his <hi rend="italic">Tortura</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Torti,</hi> in answer to Bellarmine’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Matthaeus</hi><hi rend="italic">Tortus.</hi> This work is one of many born of
                    the gunpowder plot and related controversies. It is packed full of learning, and
                    yet the argument moves freely. Nowhere does Andrewes’ scholarship cumber him. It
                    is as a coat of mail, strong but mobile. In this same year he was transferred
                    from Chichester to Ely. His studiousness here was as intent as before. He again
                    assailed Bellarmine in his <hi rend="italic">Responsio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad
                    Apologiam,</hi> a treatise never answered. From 1611 to 1618, Andrewes is to be
                    traced as preacher and controversialist in season and out of season. In 1617 he
                    attended the king to Scotland. In 1618 he was translated to the see of
                    Winchester. In this year he proceeded to the Synod of Dort. Upon his return he
                    became in word and deed a model bishop, while in every prominent ecclesiastical
                    event of the period he is seen in the front, but ever walking in all beauty of
                    modesty and benignity. His benefactions were unprecedented. His learning made
                    him the equal and the friend of Grotius, and of the foremost contemporary
                    scholars. His preaching was unique for its combined rhetorical splendour and
                    scholarly richness, and yet we feel that the printed page poorly represents the
                    preaching. His piety was that of an ancient saint, semiascetic and unearthly in
                    its self-denial, but rooted in a deep and glowing love for his Lord. No shadow
                    rests on his beautiful and holy life. He died 25th September 1626, and the
                    leaders in church and state mourned for him as for a father. Two generations
                    later, Richard Crashaw caught up the universal sentiment, when in his lines <hi
                    rend="italic">Vpon Bishop Andrewes' Picture before his Sermons,</hi> he exclaims
                    :—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> “This reverend shadow cast that setting sun, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Whose glorious course through our horizon run, </l>

                    <l part="N"> All one great eye, all drown’d in one great teare.” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>It is to be regretted that the works of Bishop Andrewes have been only
                    fragmentarily and uncritically collected and edited; but the edition of the
                    Anglo-Catholic Series suffices to place him in the front rank of the theologians
                    of England. (Works, as originally published, and as collected <hi rend="italic"
