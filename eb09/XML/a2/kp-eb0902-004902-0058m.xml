                    qualities or properties of matter with which the science is concerned. Thus, the
                    physicist classifies bodies according to their mechanical, electrical, thermic,
                    or other physical properties; the chemist, regards their composition; while the
                    zoologist and the botanist group them according to their likenesses and
                    unlikenesses of structure, function, and distribution.</p>
                <p>As soon as the labours of anatomists had extended over a sufficiently great
                    variety of animals, it was found that they could be grouped into separate
                    assemblages, the members of each of which, while varying more or less in minor
                    respects, had certain structural features in common, and these common
                    morphological characters became the definition of the group thus formed. The
                    smallest group thus constituted is a <hi rend="smallcaps">Morphological
                    Species.</hi> A certain number of species having characters in common, by which
                    they resemble one another and differ from all other species, constitutes a <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Genus;</hi> a group of genera, similarly associated,
                    constitutes a <hi rend="smallcaps">Family;</hi> a group of families, an <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Order;</hi> a group of orders, a <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Class;</hi> a group of classes, a <hi rend="smallcaps">Subkingdom</hi>; while
                    the latter, agreeing with one another only in the characters in which all
                    animals agree, and in which they differ from all plants, make up the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom.</hi></p>
                <p>The formation of a morphological classification is therefore a logical process,
                    the purpose of which is to throw the facts of structure into the smallest
                    possible number of general propositions, which propositions constitute the
                    definitions of the respective groups. A perfect classification will fulfil this
                    end, and, in order to form it, two conditions are necessary: Firstly, we must
                    have a full knowledge of the adult structure of every animal, recent and
                    extinct; secondly, we must know all the modifications of structure through which
                    it has passed, in order to attain the adult condition, or in other words, the
                    mode of development of the animal. For it is the sum of all the structural
                    conditions of an animal which constitutes the totality of its structure; and if
                    two animals, similar in their adult state, were unlike in their development, it
                    is clear that the latter circumstance would have to be taken into account in
                    determining their position in a classification.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus, living at a time when neither comparative anatomy nor embryology can be
                    said to have existed, based his classification of animals upon such broad
                    resemblances of adult structure and habit as his remarkable sagacity and wide
                    knowledge enabled him to detect. Cuvier and his school devoted themselves to the
                    working out of adult structure, and the <hi rend="italic">Leçons</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Anatomie Comparée</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Règne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi> are wonderful embodiments
                    of the results of such investigations. But the Cuvierian system ignores
                    development; and it was reserved for Von Baer to show the importance of
                    developmental studies, and to inaugurate the marvellous series of researches
                    which, in the course of the last fifty years, have made us acquainted with the
                    manner of development of every important group of animals. The splendid
                    researches of Cuvier gave birth to scientific palaeontology, and demonstrated
                    that, in some cases, at any rate, extinct forms of life present characters
                    intermediate between those of groups which are at present widely different. The
                    investigations of Agassiz upon fo%sil fishes tended in the same direction, and
                    further showed that, in some cases, the older forms preserve, as permanent
                    features, structural characters· which are embryonic and transitory in their
                    liviħg congeners. Moreover, Darwin, Owen, and Wallace proved that, in any great
                    area of geographical distribution, the later tertiary extinct forms are clearly
                    related to those which now exist in the area. As Taxonomic investigations
                    increased in accuracy and in extent, the careful examination of large suites of
                    specimens revealed an unexpected amount of variability in species; and Darwin’s
                    investigation of the phenomena presented by animals under domestication proved
                    that forms, morphologically as distinct as admitted natural genera, could be
                    produced by selective breeding from a common stock.</p>
                <p>Upon the foundation thus furnished, the doctrine of Evolution, first
                    scientifically formulated by Lamarck, has been solidly built up by Darwin, and
                    is now, with various modifications and qualifications, widely accepted. But the
                    acceptance of tins doctrine introduced a new element into Taxonomy. If all
                    existing animals are the last terms of a long series of developmental stages,
                    represented by the animals of earlier ages of the earth’s history, the starting
                    point of which has been a primordial form of the extremest simplicity consistent
                    with animal life, then every animal has an “ancestral” as well as what may be
                    termed a “personal” embryology; and the same considerations which oblige the
                    Taxonomist to take account of the latter phenomena, compel his attention to the
                    former stages of development. Two animals belong to the same group, when they
                    are similar in structure, personal development, and ancestral development, and
                    not otherwise. Hence it follows that a perfect and final zoological
                    classification cannot be made until we know all that is important concerning—1,
                    the adult structure; 2, the personal development; and 3, the ancestral
                    development of animals. It is hardly necessary to observe that our present
                    knowledge, as regards even the first and second heads, is very imperfect; while,
                    as respects the third, it is utterly fragmentary.</p>
                <p>The only genus of animals of which we possess a satisfactory, though still not
                    quite complete, ancestral history, is the genus <hi rend="italic">Equus,</hi>
                    the development of which in the course of the Tertiary epoch from an
                    Anchitherioid ancestor, through the form of <hi rend="italic">Hipparion,</hi>
                    appears to admit of no doubt. And all the facts of geology and palaeontology not
                    only tend to show that the knowledge of ancestral development is likely long to
                    remain fragmentary, but lead us to doubt, whether even such fragments as may be
                    vouchsafed to us by the extension of geological inquiry will ever be
                    sufficiently old, in relation to the whole duration of life on the earth, to
                    give us positive evidence of the nature of the earliest forms of animals.</p>
                <p>While holding the doctrine of evolution to its fullest extent, and having no
                    doubt that Taxonomy ought to be the expression of ancestral development, or <hi
                    rend="italic">phylogeny,</hi> as well as of embryogeny and adult structure, and
                    while conceiving that the attempts at founding a scientific phylogeny, which
                    have been made by Haeckel and others, are of much interest and importance as
                    guides to and sugges-tors of investigation, the present writer looks upon all
                    such attempts as provisional hypotheses; and he conceives that, at any rate for
                    the present, it is a mistake to introduce considerations of this purely
                    hypothetical kind into classification, which should be based on verifiable
                    data.</p>
                <p>In the case of an existing animal, it is possible to determine its adult
                    structure and its development, and therefore to assign its place relatively to
                    other animals, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n59/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0059-0050"/> structure and development of which are also
                    known; and, in the case of an extinct animal, it is possible to ascertain
                    certain facts of its structure, and sometimes certain facts of its development,
                    which will justify a more or less positive assignment of its place relatively to
                    existing animals. So far, Taxonomy is objective, capable of proof and disproof,
                    and it should leave speculation aside, until speculation has converted itself
                    into demonstratioιt.</p>
                <p>In the present rapidly shifting condition of our knowledge of the facts of animal
                    structure and development, however, it is no easy matter to group these facts
                    into general propositions which shall express neither more nor less than is
                    contained in the facts; and no one can be more conscious of the manifold
                    imperfections of the following attempt at such a classification than the author
                    of it.</p>
                <p>In certain of the lower animals, the substance of the body is not differentiated
                    into histogenetic elements; that is, into cells<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The term “cell” is used here in its broadest
                    sense, as equivalent to a nucleated mass of protoplasm.</p></note> which, by
                    their metamorphoses, give rise to tissues. In all other animals, on the other
                    hand, the protoplasmic mass, which constitutes the primitive body, is converted
                    into a multitude of cells, which become metamorphosed into the tissues of the
                    body.</p>
                <p>For the first of these divisions the old name of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Protozoa</hi> may be retained <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> the second, the
                    title of <hi rend="smallcaps">Metazoa,</hi> recently proposed by Haeckel, may be
                    conveniently employed.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Protozoa.</hi></p>
                <p>Haeckel has shown that, among the <hi rend="italic">Protozoa,</hi> there are some
                    which are simpler than the rest, inasmuch âs they are devoid of both nuclei and
                    contractile vesicles. To these he applies the name of—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Mmera.—</hi> Among the members of this group, which are at
                    present known, three series are distinguishable, in all of which multiplication
                    is effected by division, preceded, or not preceded, by the assumption of an
                    encysted condition. In one state, each of these <hi rend="italic">Monera</hi> is
                    a <hi rend="italic">myxopod</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The term “Rhizopod” is already employed in a limited and
                    special sense.</p></note> that is, is provided with longer or shorter
                    pseudopodia as locomotive organs, and, in <hi rend="italic">Protamoeba</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Protogenes,</hi> the result of the process of division is also
                    two or more myxopods. But, in <hi rend="italic">Protomonas,</hi> the myxopod,
                    after becoming encysted, gives rise by division to bodies provided with long
                    flagelli· form cilia, by which they are propelled, and which may be termed <hi
                    rend="italic">mastigopods;</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Myxastrum,</hi> the
                    encysted body divides into a multitude of oval particles, each enclosed in itβ
                    own coat. These are set free, and each gives rise to a new myxopod of the same
                    character as the parent.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Protomyxa,</hi> the myxopods coalesce into a reticulated
                    plasmodium; and <hi rend="italic">Vampyrella</hi> is parasitic, devouring
                    stalked diatoms, and encysting itself upon the ends of their stalks, the
                    encysted form dividing into new <hi rend="italic">Vam-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pyrélloe.</hi> Most of these interesting <hi rend="italic">Monera</hi> have
                    been made known by Haeckel, so that, in all probability, many others remain to
                    be discovered. It is probable that the <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera,</hi>
                    notwithstanding the complexity of the skeletons, belong to this group, but too
                    little is known of the structure of their soft parts to enable any certain
                    conclusion to be drawn respecting them, and the analogy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gromia</hi> leads to the suspicion that they may belong to the next
                    division.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Fndσplastica.—</hi> In these <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi>
                    a portion of the interior protoplasmic body is separated from the rest as a
                    distinct, more or less rounded, body, which may be termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >endoplast,</hi> as a term suggestive of its similarity to the nucleus of a
                    histogenetic cell, without implying its identity there with. Of such endoplasts
                    there may be one or many, but the protoplasm in which they he does not give rise
                    to cells, which become metamorphosed into elements of the tissues. Very often
                    they possess one or more vacuoles, which rhythmically dilate and contract, in
                    accordance with the changes in the protoplasm in which they he, and which are
                    termed <hi rend="italic">contractile vesicles.</hi></p>
                <p>In this division of the <hi rend="italic">Protozoa,</hi> three groups—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arhoebidoe,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Flagellata</hi> (or
                    flage∏ate <hi rend="italic">Infusoria),</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gregarinidoe</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> closely repeat the forms and mode of
                    ι eproduction of the <hi rend="italic">Protamoebidoe, Protomonadidoe,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Myxastridoe</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">Monera.</hi>
                    Among the rest, the <hi rend="italic">Acinetidoe</hi> are distinguished by their
                    pseudopodia being converted into suckers, through which they draw the juices of
                    their prey. Tn ah these, and in the preceding forms, there is a more or less
                    marked distinction of the protoplasm constituting the body into a firmer and
                    denser outer layer, the <hi rend="italic">ectosarc,</hi> and a more fluid inner
                    substance, the <hi rend="italic">endosarc;</hi> and, in some of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gregarinidoe,</hi> the ectosarc becomes differentiated into
                    muscular fibres. In the <hi rend="italic">Flagellata</hi> there is a permanent
                    oral aperture; and in one member of this group, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Noctiluca,</hi> additional complications of structure, in the form of a
                    ridge-like tooth and a tentacle, occur. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Radiolaria,</hi> the body is still more clearly differentiated into an inner
                    substance, surrounded by a capsule, and containing nuclei and even cells, and a
                    vacuolated ectosarc, whence the radiating pseudopodia proceed. Coloured
                    corpuscles, usually yellow, appear in the ectosarc, and have been shown by
                    Haeckel to contain starch and to multiply independently. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ciliata</hi> (ciliated <hi rend="italic">Infusoria),</hi> with
                    which the <hi rend="italic">Catallacta</hi> of Haeckel may be included, the
                    differentiation of the protoplasm of the body, without any development of
                    histogenetic cells, goes still further. A permanent mouth and anus may appear,
                    connected by a permanently softer and more fluid region of the protoplasm (as is
                    plainly to be seen, for example, in <hi rend="italic">Nyctotherus)</hi>
                    foreshadowing an intestinal cavity. The ectosarc may be differentiated into a
                    specially modified cortical layer, and well-marked muscular fibres may be
                    developed. Morever, the endoplast, or “nucleus,” becomes an organ of
                    reproduction, the germs of the young being given off by division from it. Very
                    generally, a small body—the so-called “nucleolus,” but which has, admittedly,
                    nothing to do with the structure so named in a true cell, and may be termed the
                    “endoplastula”—is to be found close to the nucleus, and there is some ground for
                    supposing it to be a testis. The <hi rend="italic">Infusoria</hi> frequently
                    multiply by fission, which may, or may not, be preceded by encystment; and in
                    many of them, as in the <hi rend="italic">Gregarinidoe, Acinetidoe,</hi> and
                    some <hi rend="italic">Flagellata,</hi> conjugation has been observed. It is yet
                    disputed how far the conjugation is a necessary antecedent of the process of
                    endogenous germ formation.</p>
                <p>Ehrenberg concluded, from those remarkable researches which first gave a clear
                    insight into the structure of the ciliated <hi rend="italic">Infusoria,</hi>
                    that they were animals of complex structure, possessing, on a minute scale, all
                    the organs characteristic of the higher forms of animal life. In opposition to
                    this view, Dujardin started the conception that they are little more than masses
                    of sarcode ( = protoplasm); and Von Siebold, modifying this view in accordance
                    with the cell theory, regards them as the equivalents of single cells of the
                    tissues of the higher animals. The result of the long controversy which has been
                    carried on on this subject seems to be,. on the one hand, that Ehrenberg was
                    quite right in vindicating for the <hi rend="italic">Infusoria</hi> a far
                    greater complexity of structure than they had been supposed to possess. It is
                    certain that an Infusorium may possess a distinct integumentary layer, muscles,
                    a permanent oesophagus, a pertnanent anal area, and, in some cases, a persistent
                    tract <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n60/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0060-0051"/> of the body substance, more permeable to
                    alimentary matters than the rest, which might be fairly termed a permanent
                    alimentary tract. Moreover, there is much reason for regarding the endoplast and
                    endoplastula as generative organs, while there is, sometimes, a rather complex
                    persistent system of water vessels. But, on the other hand, this complexity of
                    organisation is different from that observed in the higher animals, inasmuch as
                    the various structures enumerated do not result from the metamorphosis of
                    histogenetic cells, but arise by immediate differentiation of the finely
                    granular protoplasm of which the body is composed. And, so far, Von Siebold
                    appears to have been fully justified in regarding a ciliated Infusorium as the
                    homologue of a single cell. This is a view which will present no difficulty to
                    those who are familiar with the morphology of the lower plants. The complicated
                    mycelium of <hi rend="italic">Mucor Mucedo,</hi> for example, is, while young,
                    nothing but a single cell; and, in <hi rend="italic">Caτderpa,</hi> a single
                    undivided cell grows, without division, into an organism which simulates one of
                    the higher Algae in the diversity of its parts.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Metazoa.</hi></p>
                <p>The germ becomes differentiated into histogenetic cells, and these cells become
                    arranged into two sets, the one constituting the outer wall of the body, or <hi
                    rend="italic">ectoderm,</hi> while the other, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >endoderm,</hi> lies internal to the foregoing, and constitutes the lining of
                    the alimentary cavity, when, as is usually the case, a distinct alimentary
                    cavity exists. In the embryo, the representatives of these two layers are the
                    <hi rend="italic">epiblast</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hypoblast.</hi></p>
                <p>All the <hi rend="italic">Metazoa,</hi> in fact, commence their existence in the
                    form of an ovum, which is essentially a nucleated cell, supplemented by more or
                    less nutritive material, or <hi rend="italic">food yelk.</hi> The ovum, after
                    impregnation, divides into cleavage masses, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >blastomeres,</hi> giving rise to a <hi rend="italic">Morula,</hi> in the midst
                    of which arises a cavity, the <hi rend="italic">blastocoele</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{cleavage cavity, “</hi><hi rend="italic">Furchungshöhle”</hi> of
                    the Germans), which maybe larger or smaller, filled only with fluid, or occupied
                    by food yelk. When it is largest, the blastomeres, disposed in a* single layer,
                    form a spheroidal vesicle, enclosing a correspondingly shaped blastocoele. When
                    it is reduced to a minimum, the <hi rend="italic">Morula</hi> is an almost solid
                    aggregation of blastomeres, which may be nearly equal in size, or some may be
                    much larger than others, in consequence of having undergone less rapid division.
                    The next stage in the development of the embryo of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metazoon</hi> consiste (in all cases except a few parasitic auenterous forms)
                    in the conversion of the <hi rend="italic">Morula</hi> into a body having a
                    digestive cavity, or a <hi rend="italic">Gastrula.</hi> The animals in which the
                    embryo takes on the form of a <hi rend="italic">Gastrula,</hi> may be termed, as
                    Haeckel has proposed, <hi rend="italic">Gastroeoe.</hi></p>
                <p>The conversion of the <hi rend="italic">Morula</hi> into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gastrula</hi> may take place in several ways.</p>
                <p>In the simplest, the <hi rend="italic">Morula</hi> being composed of equal or
                    nearly equal blastomeres, more or less completely converted into cells, these
                    differentiate themselves into an outer layer, the epiblast, investing the
                    remaining cells, which constitute the hypoblast. The central cells of the
                    hypoblast next diverge and give rise to a space filled with fluid, the
                    alimentary cavity, which opens at one end, and thus gives rise to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gastrula.</hi> This is the process generally observed in <hi
                    rend="italic">Porifera, Coelenterata, Turbellaria, Trematoda,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Nematoidea.</hi></p>
                <p>In a second class of cases, the <hi rend="italic">Morula</hi> becomes converted
                    into blastomeres of unequal sizes, a small and a large set. The smaller rapidly
                    become converted into cells, and invest the larger and any remains of the food
                    yelk, as a blastoderm, which at first represents only the epiblast of the former
                    case. The hypoblast arises either from the epiblast thus formed, or from the
                    included larger blastomeres. This is the process observed in certain <hi
                    rend="italic">Turbellaria,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora,</hi> in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Oligochoeta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hirudinea,</hi> in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda,</hi> and in most <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>In a third group of instances, the <hi rend="italic">Morula,</hi> whether
                    consisting of equal or unequal blastomeres, becomes spheroidal, and encloses a
                    correspondingly shaped blastocoele. One part of the wall of this vesicular <hi
                    rend="italic">Morula</hi> then becomes invaginated, and gives rise to the
                    alimentary cavity, with the hypoblast which limits it. This process has been
                    observed in the <hi rend="italic">Chcetognatha, Echinodermata, Gephyrea,</hi>
                    polychaetous <hi rend="italic">Annelida, Enteropneusta, Brachiσpoda;</hi> in
                    most <hi rend="italic">Mollusca</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphioxus;</hi> and, slightly modified, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petromyzon</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi> These various modes
                    in which the two primary layers of the germ may be developed shade off into one
                    another, and do not affect the essence of the process, which is the segregation
                    of one set of cells to form the external covering of the body, and of another
                    set to constitute the lining of the alimentary canal.</p>
                <p>In whatever manner the <hi rend="italic">Gastrula</hi> is formed, and whatever be
                    its shape when its alimentary cavity is complete, one of tw’o things happens to
                    it. It becomes provided with many ingestive apertures, distinct from that first
                    formed; or with only one, which may or may not be distinct from the first
                    aperture. The former division comprises only the Sponges <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Porifera</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Spongida}</hi> in which, as the remarkable
                    researches of Haeckel have shown, the walls of the deeply cup-shaped <hi
                    rend="italic">Gastrula</hi> become perforated by the numer-rous inhalent
                    ostioles, while the primitive opening serves as the exhalent aperture. These may
                    be termed the <hi rend="italic">Metazoa polystomata.</hi></p>
                <p>The latter division includes all the remaining forms, which may be grouped
                    together as <hi rend="italic">Metazoa monostomata.</hi> Among these, two primary
                    groups are distinguishable, of which. the second exhibits an advance in
                    organisation upon the first. In the first, the aperture of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gastrula</hi> becomes the permanent mouth <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Archceostomata').</hi> In the second, the permanent mouth is a secondary
                    perforation of the body wall <hi rend="italic">{Deuterostomata').</hi></p>
                <p>1. It is now well established that the aperture of tho <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gastrula</hi> becomes the oral aperture of the adult in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coelenterata,</hi> which group includes animals differing much in grade of
                    organisation, from the simple <hi rend="italic">Hydra</hi> to the complex <hi
                    rend="italic">Ctenophore,</hi> but all manifestly exhibiting variations of one
                    fundamental type. Parallel with these may be ranged an assemblage composed of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Turbellaria, Rotifera,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trematoda,</hi> which are associated together by the closest resemblances of
                    structure, and which present an even greater range in grade of organisation than
                    the_ <hi rend="italic">Coelenterata.</hi> The lower <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhabdocoela</hi> come very close to the <hi rend="italic">Infusoria</hi> (as
                    close as the multicellular to the unicellular Algae), and are but little
                    superior to <hi rend="italic">Hydra</hi> in the degree of their organic
                    differentiation; while, in the <hi rend="italic">Trematoda,</hi> the land <hi
                    rend="italic">Planarioe,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Nemertid&lt;x,</hi> we
                    have animals which attain a considerable complexity, and in the case of many <hi
                    rend="italic">Trematoda</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Lineus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Pilidium)</hi> undergo remarkable metamorphoses. As a cognate
                    group, the <hi rend="italic">Nematoidea</hi> may be enumerated, extremely simple
                    in their lowest forms, considerably differentiated in the higher, and connected
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Turbellaria</hi> by such forms as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polygordius.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Oligochoeta</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hirudinea</hi> also belong to this division of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scolecimorpha,</hi> but they differ from the foregoing in the development of a
                    segmented mesoblast.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Coelenterata, Nematoidea, Turbellaria, Trematoda,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Rotifera,</hi> the mode of origin of the cells which lie
                    between the epiblast and the hypoblast, constitute the meso-blast, and give rise
                    to the connective tissue and muscles of the body wall and of that of the
                    intestine, is not precisely known. They may take their origin in the epiblast,
                    or in the hypoblast, or in both. But in the <hi rend="italic">Oligochoeta</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Hirudinea,</hi> after the epiblast and hypoblast are
                    difieren-tiated<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n61/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0061-0052"/>, the cells of the latter give rise by division to
                    two bands of cells, which lie, one on each side of the long axis of the ventral
                    face of the worm, and constitute the mesoblast. This becomes marked out by
                    transverse constriction into segments, and, in each segment, gives rise to all
                    the tissues which lie between the epiblast (epidermis) and hypoblast (epithelium
                    of the alimentary canal). The mouth corresponds with the primitive involution of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Morula;</hi> the anal aperture is a new formation. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nematoidea</hi> and in the lower Rhabdoccele <hi rend="italic"
                    >Turbellaria,</hi> the intestinal canal is a simple tube or sac. But in some <hi
                    rend="italic">Turbellaria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trematoda,</hi> the
                    alimentary canal gives off diverticula, which ramify through the mesoblast and
                    even unite together. The like takes place in a great many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coelenterata,</hi> and the “gastro vascular apparatus/' as it has been well
                    termed, which is thus formed, is highly characteristic of them. The animals just
                    referred to, therefore, have an “entero-coele” more or less distinct from the
                    proper digestive cavity, but connected with it, and ramifying through the
                    mesoblast.</p>
                <p>2. In the remaining members of the animal kingdom, the -embryo develops a
                    secondary mouth as a perforation of the body wall, the primary aperture
                    sometimes becoming the anus, and sometimes disappearing. Of these <hi
                    rend="italic">Metazoa deuterostomata,</hi> there are some which follow the mode
                    of development of the <hi rend="italic">Oligochoeta</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hirudinea</hi> very closely, so far as the formation and segmentation of the
                    mesoblast is concerned, though the question, whether this segmented mesoblast
                    arises from the epiblast or the hypoblast, has not been exhaustively worked out.
                    These are the <hi rend="italic">Annelida</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >polychoeta</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and there is the closest resemblance in
                    development between them and the lower <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda (Crustacea,
                    Arachnida,</hi> lower <hi rend="italic">Insecta},</hi> while, in the higher
                    Arthropods, the process is complicated by the development of an amnion, and by
                    some other special peculiarities which need not be considered in detail. In all
                    these <hi rend="italic">Metazoa,</hi> whatever cavities are developed in the
                    mesoblast, whether a wide perivisceral cavity, or vascular canals, or both
                    combined, they arise from the splitting or excavation of tho mesoblast itself,
                    and are not prolongations of the alimentary cavity. Hence they may be termed <hi
                    rend="italic">Schizocoela.</hi></p>
                <p>But, in certain other deuterostomatous <hi rend="italic">Metazoa,</hi> the
                    mesoblast becomes excavated, and a “perivisceral cavity” and vessels are formed
                    in quite another fashion.</p>
                <p>Thus in the <hi rend="italic">Chσetognatha,</hi> represented by the strange and
                    apparently anomalous <hi rend="italic">Sagitta,</hi> Kowalewsky’s researches
                    show, that the vitellus undergoes complete segmentation, and is converted into a
                    vesicular <hi rend="italic">Morula,</hi> on one side of which involution takes
                    place, and gives rise to the primitive alimentary canal, of which the opening of
                    involution becomes the permanent anus, the mouth being formed by perforation at
                    the opposite end of the body. Before the mouth is formed, however, the primitive
                    alimentary cavity throws out, on each side, a caecal pouch, which extends as far
                    forwards as its central continuation does, and grows backwards behind the anus.
                    The two sacs, thus prolonged posteriorly, meet, but remain divided from one
                    another by their applied walls in the median line. These lateral sacs now become
                    shut off from the median portion of the primitive alimentary cavity (which opens
                    at its anterior end, and becomes the permanent alimentary canal), and are
                    converted into shut sacs, the cavity of each of which forms one-half of the
                    perivisceral cavity. The inner wall of each sac, applied to the hypoblast, gives
                    rise to the muscular wall of the intestine; and the outer wall, applied to the
                    epiblast, becomes the muscular wall of the body, and from it the generative
                    organs are evolved. The great ganglia and nerves are developed from the cells of
                    the epiblast. Thus <hi rend="italic">Sagitta</hi> is temporarily coelenterate,
                    but the two gastrovas-cular sacs, each enclosing an enterocoele, become shut off
                    from the alimentary canal and metamorphosed into the walls of the perivisceral
                    cavity. But it is not altogether clear whether the cells of the enterocoele give
                    rise only to the lining of the perivisceral cavity, and whether the muscles and
                    connective tissue are otherwise derived or not. Kowalewsky’s evidence, however,
                    is in favour of the origin of the muscles directly from the cells of the
                    mesoblastic diverticula.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Echinodermata,</hi> the brilliant investigations of
                    Johannes Müller, confirmed in their general features by all subsequent
                    observers, proved, firstly, that the ciliated embryonic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gastrula</hi> (the primitive alimentary canal of which is formed by involution
                    of a vesicular blastoderm), to which the egg of all ordinary Echinoderms gives
                    rise, acquires a mouth, by the formation of an aperture in the body wall,
                    distinct from the primitive aperture of the <hi rend="italic">Gastrula,</hi> so
                    that, in this respect, it differs from the embryo of all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coelenterata;</hi> secondly, that the embryo thus provided with mouth, stomach,
                    intestine, and anus acquires a complete bilateral symmetry; thirdly, that the
                    cilia, with which it is primitively covered, are ultimately restricted to one or
                    more series, some of which encircle the axis of the body, or a line drawn from
                    the oral to the anal apertures; and fourthly, that, within this bilaterally
                    symmetrical larva or <hi rend="italic">Echinopaedium,</hi> as it may be called,
                    the more or less completely radiate Echinoderm is developed by a process of
                    internal modification.</p>
                <p>Müller believed that the first step in this process wa3 the ingrowth of a
                    diverticulum of the integument, as a hollow process, which became converted into
                    the ambulacral vascular system of the Echinoderm. He did not attempt to explain
                    the origin of the so-called blood-vascular system, or pseudhaemal vessels, nor
                    of the perivisceral cavity. Miiller’s conclusions remained unchallenged until
                    1864, when Prof. Alexander Agassiz took up the question afresh, and, in a
                    remarkable paper on the development of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asteracanthion,</hi> detailed the observations which led him to believe that
                    the ambulacral vessels do not arise by involution of the external integument,
                    but that they commence as two primitively symmetrical diverticula of the stomach
                    (the “würstformige Körper” of Müller), one of which becomes connected with the
                    exterior by an opening, (the dorsal pore observed by Müller, and considered by
                    him to be the origin of the ambulacral vessels), and gives rise to the
                    ambulacral vessels, the ambulacral region of the body of the Echinoderm being
                    modelled upon it; while upon the other gastric sac, the antambulacral wall of
                    the starfish body is similarly modelled. Both gastric sacs early become
                    completely separated from the stomach of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echinopaedium,</hi> and open into one another, so as to form a single
                    horseshoe-shaped sac, connected with the exterior by a tube which is converted
                    into the madreporic canal. Agassiz does not explain the mode of formation of the
                    perivisceral cavity of the starfish, and has nothing to say respecting the
                    origin of the pseudhaemal vessels.</p>
                <p>Recently, Metschnikoff has confirmed the observations; of Agassiz, so far as the
                    development of the ambulacral system from one of the diverticula of the
                    alimentary canal of the starfish larva is concerned, and he has added the
                    important discovery that the perivisceral cavity of the Echinoderm is the
                    product of what remains of these diverticula. Moreover, his observations on
                    other <hi rend="italic">Echinodermata.</hi> show that essentially the same
                    process of development of the peritoneal cavity occurs in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophiuridae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Echinidoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holothuridσe.</hi></p>
                <p>The precise mode of origin of the pseudhaemal system, or so-called blood-vessels,
                    of the Echinoderms is not yet made out. But it is known that the cavity of these
                    vessels contains corpuscles similar to those which are found in the perivisceral
                    cavity and in the ambulacral vessels, and that all three communicate.</p>

                <p>Both Agassiz and Metschnikoff justly insist upon the correspondence in
                    development of the lateral gastric diverticula of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echinopadium</hi> with the gastrovascular canal system of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ctenophora;</hi> and, on the ground of this resemblance, the former refers the
                    Echinoderms to the <hi rend="italic">Radiata,</hi> retaining under that
                    Cuvιerian denomination the <hi rend="italic">Acalephce (Coelenterata)</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Echinodermata.</hi> But this arrangement ignores the real
                    value of his own discovery, which shows that the Echinoderms have made a great
                    and remarkable step, in passing from their primarily coelenterate stage of
                    organisation to their adult condition. And it further ignores the unquestionable
                    fact, admirably brought out by the same excellent observer’s recent
                    investigations into the development of <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus,</hi>
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Echino-pcedium</hi> is almost identical in structure
                    with the young of animals, such as the <hi rend="italic">Gephyrea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Enteropneusta,</hi> which are in no sense radiate, but are,
                    eminently, bilaterally symmetrical. In fact, the larva of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balanoglossus</hi> (the sole representative of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enteropneusta),</hi> was originally described by Müller, under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tomaria,</hi> as an Echinoderm larva; and was subsequently more
                    fully examined by Prof. Alex. Agassiz, who also regarded it as an unquestionable
                    Echinoderm larva; and it is only recently that it has been proved, partly by
                    Metschnikoff and partly by Agassiz himself, to be the larval form of <hi
                    rend="italic">Balanoglossus.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus,</hi> as in
                    the Echinoderms, it appears that saccular outgrowths of the intestine give rise
                    to the perivisceral cavity and its walls; and, if such be the case, the
                    mesoblast will be chiefly, if not wholly, represented by diverticula of the
                    alimentary canal. Thus in the <hi rend="italic">Chaetog-natha</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Echinodermata,</hi> and possibly in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enteropneusta,</hi> the perivisceral cavity is a portion of the alimentary
                    cavity shut off from the rest; and, in contradistinction to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Schizocoela,</hi> in which the perivisceral cavity is produced by
                    a splitting of the mesoblast, they may be said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >En-</hi><hi rend="italic">terocoela.</hi></p>
                <p>If we endeavour to determine the place of the three remaining great groups of
                    animals, the <hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> obstacles
                    arise,—firstly, from a want of sufficiently exact knowledge respecting the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mollusca;</hi> and secondly, from the difficulty of interpreting
                    certain well-ascertained facts in the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>That the <hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> including under that name the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyzoa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brachiopoda,</hi> as well as
                    the higher Mollusks, are closely allied to the <hi rend="italic">Annelida,</hi>
                    is readily demonstrated. The known forms of Brachiopυd, Lamellibranch, Pteropod,
                    and Gasteropod larvae all have their parallels among Annelidan larvae. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyzoa</hi> are closely allied with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gephyrea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rotifera;</hi> and a Mollusk may be said to
                    be a few-segmented annelid with a mantle. But whether the perivisceral cavity is
                    developed in the annelidan or in the echinoderm fashion is not yet clear. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa,</hi> the evidence is at present insufficient to
                    justify any conclusion. In the <hi rend="italic">Brachiopoda,</hi> there is some
                    ground for thinking that the perivisceral cavity is formed in the same way as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Sagitta</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Echinodermata</hi>;
                    while, in the <hi rend="italic">Lamelli-</hi><hi rend="italic"/><hi
                    rend="italic">branchiata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odontophora,</hi> there is
                    every reason to believe that the perivisceral cavity is formed by splitting of
                    the mesoblast, or that they are schizocoelous.</p>
                <p>In the lowest <hi rend="italic">Tunicata,</hi> represented by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Appendicularia,</hi> the recent investigations of Fol have shown, that, in the
                    adult, the body proper is formed almost exclusively by an ectoderm and endoderm,
                    which proceed directly from the epiblast and hypoblast of the embryo. It is çnly
                    in the caudal appendage that a distinct nιesoblast is represented by the
                    notochord and the muscles. The blood channels correspond with the blastocoele,
                    and the house” in which these singular animals shelter themselves is a cuticular
                    secretion, representing the cellulose coat of the higher ascidians. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Appendicularia</hi> have no <hi rend="italic">atrium,</hi> or at
                    most only rudiments of it, hence the branchial clefts open directly on the
                    haemal aspect of the body, which corresponds with the ventral face of a
                    vertebrate animal. In all other <hi rend="italic">Tunicata,</hi> an atrial
                    cavity is formed by involution of the ectoderm, which thus gives rise to a
                    cavity on each side of . the branchial sac, into which the branchial clefts of
                    the adult open; and a thick cellulose <hi rend="italic">cuticula,</hi> into
                    which cells from the ectoderm usually wander, invests the exterior of the body.
                    The “atrial tunic,” or invagi-nated layer of the ectoderm, is reflected, as a
                    visceral layer, over more or less of the outer surface of the alimentary canal,
                    and, as a parietal layer, over more or less of the inner surface of the body
                    wall; and the space between the two (the blastocoele) becomes converted into the
                    blood passages. Thus, such an ascidian resembles a vertebrated animal, not only
                    in the manner in which its nervous centre is developed, but in the fact that it
                    possesses an atrial cavity, which singularly resembles the pleuroperitoneal
                    chamber of a vertebrate. For this cavity is bounded externally by the atrial
                    tunic and the integument, which correspond with the somatopleural layer of the
                    mesoblast and the epiblast of a vertebrate embryo; and it is bounded,
                    internally, by the atrial tunic and the epithelium of the alimentary canal,
                    which, to the same extent, correspond with the splanch-nopleure and the
                    hypoblast. The primitively double atrial aperture has its parallel in the
                    peritoneal openings which persist in many <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus the ascidian has no “perivisceral cavity” formed by splitting of the
                    mesoblast, nor has it any “perivisceral cavity” formed by diverticula from the
                    alimentary canal. It is neither enterocoelous nor schizocoelous, but what, at
                    first sight, resembles a perivisceral cavity is formed within the body by
                    involution, and the ascidian may therefore be said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >epicoelous.</hi> If the alate prolongations of the body which lie at the sides
                    of the branchial apertures, in <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus,</hi> were to
                    enlarge and unite round the anus so as to leave but a relatively small opening
                    between their edges, the cavity so formed would answer to the atrial chamber of
                    an ascidian.</p>
                <p>In the higher <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> the pleuroperitoneal<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It must be recollected that
                    the pericardium is also originally a part of this cavity, and that in some

                    off from it.</p></note> cavity appears to be formed by the splitting of the
                    mesoblast into two layers, a splanchnopleure and a somatopleure, and, therefore,
                    seems at first to correspond with the perivisceral cavity of the Annelids and
                    Arthropods. But what is now known of the structure and development of the lowest
                    and most embryonic of known <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus,</hi> throws very great doubt upon this interpretation of the facts.
                    One of the most singular of the many peculiarities of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus</hi> is the fact that the branchial clefts open, not on the exterior
                    of the body, as in all other <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> but into a
                    chamber with a single external aperture, which, on the one hand, curiously
                    resembles the atrium of an ascidian; while, on the other, it is undoubtedly
                    homologous with the pleuroperitoneal cavity of the higher <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata.</hi> Now Kowalewsky’s investigations have shown, that, at first,
                    the branchial apertures of the embryo <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> open upon
                    the exterior of the body, but that, after a time, a process of the wall of the
                    body, on the dorsal side of the branchial apertures, grows down over them, and,
                    uniting with its fellow in the median ventral line of the body at all points,
                    except at the abdominal pore, gives rise to the outer wall of the
                    pleuroperitoneal cavity. Thus the lining of that cavity, like the atrial tunic
                    of the ascidian, is a derivative of the epiblast; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus</hi> is epicoelous. As it can hardly be doubted that the somatopleure
                    of <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> is the homologue of the somatopleure in the
                    higher <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> it becomes <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0063-0054"/> highly probable that the apparent splitting of
                    the mesoblast in the latter, after all, represents the mode of development of
                    the pleuroperitoneal cavity which obtains in the former, and, thus, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> are not schizoccelous, but epiccelous. Whether
                    this suggestion will turn out to be well based or not, must be decided by the
                    embryological investigations specially directed to this point: but that there
                    should be any essential difference between <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> and
                    other <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> in the manner in which the
                    pleuroperitoneal cavity is formed, is highly improbable.</p>
                <p>The distance between <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> and other vertebrate
                    animals, which has hitherto been generally supposed to exist, has been greatly
                    diminished by recent investigations. So far from being devoid of a brain and of
                    a skull, the regions of the cerebro-spinal axis and of the neural canal, which
                    answer to those organs in the higher <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> are, in
                    proportion, extremely long in <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> as they are in
                    all vertebrate embryos. But, in <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> the head
                    retains throughout life a segmentation comparable to that of the rest of the
                    body, while, in the higher <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> almost all traces
                    of these distinct segments are very early lost. Moreover, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus,</hi> the renal apparatus, so far from being absent, is represented
                    by a comparatively large structure, and nothing is wanted to equip it with all
                    the organs found in a young Marsipobranch, but auditory sacs, which, however, it
                    must be remembered, make their appearance late in the Lamprey. With all this,

                    of this division, however, the alimentary canal may be rudimentary, as in sundry
                    male <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Gordiacei</hi>
                    among the <hi rend="italic">Nematoidea,</hi> and yet these are so closely allied
                    to other forms possessing fully developed digestive canals, that it is
                    reasonable to regard their rudimentary alimentary apparatus as absorbed. In two
                    groups, however, the <hi rend="italic">Cestoidea</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acanthocephala,</hi> there is no trace of an alimentary canal either in the
                    embryo or in the adult.</p>
                <p>From the point of view of phylogeny, this fact may be interpreted in two ways.
                    Either the alimentary canal which once existed has aborted, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cestoidea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acanthocephala</hi> are
                    modified <hi rend="italic">Scolecimorpha,</hi> or these parasites have not
                    descended from <hi rend="italic">Gastroeoe,</hi> but have passed into their
                    present condition directly from a ΛforWα-like form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metazoon.</hi> In the latter case they will form a division of <hi
                    rend="italic">Agastroeoe,</hi> apart from the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metazoa.</hi></p>
                <p>The subjoined synopsis indicates the general relations of the different groups of
                    the Animal kingdom, in accordance with the views which have been put forward in
                    the preceding pages.</p>
                <p>Those who are familiar with the existing condition of our knowledge of animal
                    morphology, will be aware that any such scheme must needs, at present, be
                    tentative and subject to extensive revision, in correspondence with the advance
                    of knowledge. Nor will they regard it as any objection to the scheme of
                    classification proposed, that the divisions sketched out may be incapable of
                    sharp definition —the constant tendency of modern investigations being to break
                    through all boundaries of groups, and to fill up the gaps between them by the
                    discovery of transitional forms. In the place of assemblages of distinctly
                    definable groups, which it has hitherto been the object of the Taxonomist to
                    define and co-ordinate in precise logical categories, we are gradually learning
                    to substitute series, in which all the modifications by which a fundamental form
                    passes from lower to higher degrees of organic complication, are summed up. (τ.
