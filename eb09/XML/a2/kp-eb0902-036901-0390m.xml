                    introduced in the East as a title of dignity, which did not necessarily imply
                    any superiority of jurisdiction over a bishop. Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria,
                    appears to have been the first who made use of the term in applying it as a mark
                    of personal honour to Alexander, his predecessor in the see of Alexandria, and
                    Gregory Nazianzen applied the term in like manner to Athanasius. In the
                    following century the title of archbishop seems to have been applied to the
                    bishops of the more important sees, as the names of several archbishops are
                    recorded in the list of church dignitaries, who were assembled in the Council of
                    Chalcedon in 451 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In the Latin Church the title
                    was hardly known before the 7th century after Christ. Isidore of Seville
                    (Hispalensis) is the first writer who speaks of archbishops, distinguishing them
                    as a class from patriarchs, metropolitans, and bishops. Archbishops in the
                    present day are for the most part either patriarchs or metropolitans; but an
                    archbishop is not necessarily a patriarch or a metropolitan, and there are
                    metropolitans who have only the title of bishops. The ecclesiastical government
                    of the Church of England is divided between two archbishops,—the archbishop of
                    Canterbury, who is primate of all England and metropolitan of the province of
                    Canterbury, and the archbishop of York, who is primate of England, and
                    metropolitan of the province of York. The jurisdiction of the archbishop of
                    Canterbury as primate of all England extends in certain matters into the
                    province of York. He exercised the jurisdiction of <hi rend="italic">legatus
                    natus</hi> of the Pope throughout all England before the Reformation, and since
                    that event he has been empowered, by 25 H. VIII. c. 21, to exercise certain
                    powers of dispensation in cases formerly sued for in the court of Rome. Under
                    this statute the archbishop continues to grant special licences to marry, which
                    are valid in both provinces; he appoints notaries public, who may practise in
                    both provinces; and he grants dispensations to clerks to hold more than one
                    benefice, subject to certain restrictions which have been imposed by recent
                    statutes. The archbishop also continues to grant degrees in the faculties of
                    theology and law, which are known as Lambeth Degrees. His pewer to grant degrees
                    in medicine, qualifying the recipients to practise, has been practically
                    restrained by 21 and 22 Vict. c. 90. The province of Canterbury consists of
                    twenty-one dioceses—St Asaph, Bangor, Bath and Wells, Canterbury, Chichester, St
                    David’s, Ely, Exeter, Gloucester and Bristol, Hereford, Lichfield, Lincoln,
                    Llandaff, London, Norwich, Oxford, Peterborough, Rochester, Salisbury,
                    Winchester, and Worcester. The bishops of the above-mentioned dioceses
                    constitute the Upper House of Convocation of the prelates and clergy of the
                    province of Canterbury. The archbishop is president <hi rend="italic">ex
                    officio</hi> of this Convocation, which is summoned by him pursuant to a royal
                    writ whenever the Parliament is called together (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Convocation),</hi> and it is prorogued and dissolved whenever the Parliament is
                    prorogued or dissolved.</p>
                <p>Tne archbishop of Canterbury exercises the twofold jurisdiction of a metropolitan
                    and of a diocesan bishop. As metropolitan he is the guardian of the
                    spiritualities of every vacant see within the province, and he presents to all
                    benefices which fall vacant during the vacancy of the see, and through his
                    special commissary exercises the ordinary jurisdiction of a bishop within the
                    vacant diocese. He exercises also an appellate jurisdiction over each bishop,
                    which in cases of licensed curates he exercises personally under 1 and 2 Vict.
                    c. 106; but his ordinary appellate jurisdiction is exercised by the judge of the
                    provincial court of appeal, which from the circumstance of its having been held
                    in former days in the church of St Mary of the Arches (Bow Church), which was a
                    peculiar of the archbishop, has come to be called the Arches Court of
                    Canterbury. The judge of this court, who is appointed by the archbishop, is
                    properly styled the Official Principal of the Arches Court, but he is commonly
                    called the Dean of the Arches, from a peculiar jurisdiction, now abolished,
                    which he formerly exercised in the name of the archbishop over fifteen churches
                    in the diocese of London. The archbishop had formerly exclusive jurisdiction in
                    all causes of wills and intestacies, where parties died having personal property
                    in more than one diocese of the province of Canterbury, and he had concurrent
                    jurisdiction in other cases. This jurisdiction, which he exercised through the
                    judge of the Prerogative Court, has been transferred to the Crown by 20 and 21
                    Vict. c. 77. The Arches Court was also the court of appeal from the consistory
                    courts of the bishops of the province in all testamentary and matrimonial
                    causes. The matrimonial jurisdiction has been transferred to the Crown by 20 and
                    21 Vict. c. 78. The Court of Audience, in which the archbishop presided
                    personally, attended by his vicargeneral, and sometimes by episcopal assessors,
                    has fallen into desuetude. The vicar-general, however, exercises jurisdiction in
                    matters of ordinary marriage licences and of institutions to benefices. The
                    Master of the Faculties regulates the appointment of notaries public, and all
                    dispensations which fall under 25 H. VIII. c. 21.</p>
                <p>The first archbishop of Canterbury was Augustine the monk, whose preaching
                    converted King Ethelbert. Augustine was consecrated a bishop for England in 597
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and received the <hi rend="italic">pallium,</hi>
                    which is the distinguishing mark of the metropolitan’s office, from Gregory the
                    Great in the following year. He was subsequently constituted <hi rend="italic"
                    >legatus natus</hi> of the apostolic see, and his successors enjoyed various <hi
                    rend="italic">jura regalia</hi> by grant from the Crown. They had also
                    precedence over all subjects of the Crown not of royal blood, and the archbishop
                    still retains such precedence over every Peer of Parliament. It is also his
                    privilege to crown the kings and queens of England. He is entitled to consecrate
                    all the bishops within his province, and was formerly entitled, upon
                    consecrating a bishop, to select a benefice within his diocese as his option for
                    one of his chaplains, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n391/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0391-0370"/> but this practice has been indirectly abolished
                    by 3 and 4 Vict. c. Ill, § 42. He is entitled to nominate eight chaplains, who
                    had formerly certain statutory privileges, which are now abolished. He is <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> an ecclesiastical commissioner for England, and
                    has by statute the right of nominating one of the salaried ecclesiastical
                    commissioners.</p>
                <p>The archbishop exercises the ordinary jurisdiction of a bishop over his diocese
                    through his Consistory Court at Canterbury, the judge of which court is styled
                    the Commissary-General of the city and diocese of Canterbury. The archbishop
                    holds a visitation of his diocese personally every three years, and he is the
                    only diocesan who has kept up the triennial visitation of the dean and chapter
                    of his cathedral.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Court of Peculiars is no longer held, inasmuch as the peculiars have been placed
                    by Acts of Parliament under the ordinary jurisdiction of the bishops of the
                    respective dioceses in which they are eituated.</p></note></p>
                <p>The province of York consists of six dioceses in England, Carlisle, Chester,
                    Durham, Manchester, Ripon, and York, to which may be added the diocese of Man,
                    which was annexed under that title by 33 Henry VIII. c. 31, to the province of
                    York. The latter diocese has been entitled in recent Acts of Parliament the
                    diocese of Sodor and Man, and it is now generally so designated. The bishops of
                    the above seven dioceses constitute the Upper House of Convocation of the
                    prelates and clergy of the province of York, of which the archbishop is <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> president, and which is convened, prorogued, and
                    dissolved under the same conditions as the Convocation of the province of
                    Canterbury.</p>
                <p>The archbishop of York has immediate spiritual jurisdiction as metropolitan in
                    the case of all vacant sees within the province of York, analogous to that which
                    is exercised by the archbishop of Canterbury within the province of Canterbury.
                    He has also an appellate jurisdiction of an analogous character, which he
                    exercises through his provincial court, whilst his diocesan jurisdiction is
                    exercised through his consistorial court, the judges of both courts being
                    nominated by the archbishop. His grace’s ancient testamentary and matrimonial
                    jurisdiction has been transferred to the Crown by the same statuteswhich have
                    divested the see of Canterbury of its jurisdiction in similar matters.</p>
                <p>The first archbishop of York was Paulinus, to whom Pope Honorius I. sent the <hi
                    rend="italic">pallium,</hi> in 634 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> in fulfilment
                    of the intention of Pope Gregory the Great. The successors of Paulinus exercised
                    metropolitan jurisdiction over the bishops of Scotland until the latter part of
                    the 15th century, when Pope Sixtus IV. raised the bishopric of St Andrews into
                    an archbishopric, and constituted the archbishop of St Andrews primate of all
                    Scotland, and <hi rend="italic">legatus natus</hi> of the apostolic see in
                    Scotland. The archbishop of York takes precedence over all subjects of the Crown
                    not of royal blood, next to the lord high chancellor of England, who is preceded
                    by the archbishop of Canterbury. He is <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> an
                    ecclesiastical commissioner for England.</p>
                <p>The first archbishop of St Andrews was Patrick Graham, who successfully disputed
                    the superiority of the see of York, and was constituted metropolitan over all
                    the diocesan bishops of Scotland in 1474 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His
                    successors continued to exercise metropolitan jurisdiction throughout Scotland
                    until 1491 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when Pope Innocent VIII. sent the <hi
                    rend="italic">pallium</hi> to the bishop of Glasgow, and constituted him
                    metropolitan over the dioceses of Argyle, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Galloway, and
                    Glasgow, whilst the archbishop of St Andrews continued to exercise metropolitan
                    jurisdiction over the dioceses of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Edinburgh,
                    Moray, Orkney, Ross, and St Andrews, until the Episcopal form of church
                    government ceased to have any legal authority in Scotland.</p>
                <p>The Church of Ireland was united, by the fifth article of the Act for the Union
                    of Ireland with Great Britain, into one Protestant Episcopal church with the
                    Church of England, and it had at that time four archbishops, who took their
                    titles from Armagh, Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam. The archbishop of Armagh was
                    primate of all Ireland and metropolitan of the province of Armagh, and the other
                    archbishops were primates of Ireland and metropolitans of their respective
                    provinces. By 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 37, and 4 and 5 Will. IV. c. 90, the
                    metropolitans of Cashel and of Tuam were reduced to the status of diocesan
                    bishops, and, with the then existing eighteen bishops, were reduced in number to
                    ten bishops by the consolidation of their dioceses, so that each of the two
                    archbishops had five diocesans subject to his metropolitan jurisdiction. By 32
                    and 33 Viet, c. 42, the union between the Churches of England and of Ireland was
                    dissolved, and the Church of Ireland has ceased to be established by law. (τ.
