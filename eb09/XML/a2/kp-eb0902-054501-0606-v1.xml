                <p><label type="entry">ARMAGH</label>, an inland county of Ireland in the province
                    of Ulster, situated between lat. 54° 3' and 54° 3Γ N., and long. 6° 14' and 6°
                    45' W.; comprising an area of 328,086 statute acres, of which 178,064 are under
                    tillage, 100,137 in pasture, 4670 in plantation, and 28,177 in waste, &lt;fcc.,
                    while 17,038 acres are under water. It is bounded on the N. by Lough Neagh, on
                    the E. by the county of Down, on the S. by Louth, and on the W. by Monaghan and
                    Tyrone. The general surface of the county is gently undulating and pleasingly
                    diversified; but in the northern extremity, on the borders of Lough Neagh, is a
                    considerable tract of low, marshy land, and the southern border of the county is
                    occupied by a barren range of hills, the highest of which, named Slieve Gullion,
                    attains an elevation of 1893 feet, being the highest mountain in Ulster
                    excepting Slieve Donard in the county of Down. The summit of Slieve Gullion,
                    commanding one of the finest prospects in the province, is crowned by a large
                    cairn or pile of stones, which forms the roof of a singular cavern of artificial
                    construction. In the western portion of the county are the Few Mountains, a
                    chain of abrupt hills mostly incapable of cultivation.</p>
                <p>The soil of the northern portion of the county is a rich, brown loam, on a
                    substratum of clay or gravel, with an abundance of limestone near Armagh and
                    other places. Towards Charlemont there is much reclaimable bog resting on a
                    limestone substratum. The eastern portion of the county is generally of a light
                    friable soil; the southern portion rocky and barren, with but little bog except
                    in the neighbourhood of Newton Hamilton. The climate of Armagh is considered to
                    be one of the most genial in Ireland, and less rain is supposed to fall in this
                    than in any other county.</p>
                <p>The county is well watered by numerous streams. The principal are the Callen, the
                    Tynan, and the Tallwater, flowing into the Blackwater, which, after forming the
                    boundary between this county and Tyrone, empties itself into the south-western
                    angle of Lough Neagh. The Tara, the Newtown-Hamilton, the Creggan, and the
                    Fleury flow into the Bay of Dundalk. The Cam or Camlin joins the Bann, which,
                    crossing the north-western corner of the county, falls into Lough Neagh to the
                    east of the Blackwater. The Newry canal, communicating with Carlingford Lough at
                    Warrenspoint, six miles below Newry, proceeds northwards through the county of
                    Armagh for about 21 miles, joining the Bann at Whitecoat. The Ulster Canal
                    commences at Charlemont on the River Blackwater, near its junction with Lough
                    Neagh, proceeding through the western border of the county, and passing thence
                    to the south-west by Monaghan and Clones into Upper Lough Erne, after a couse of
                    48 miles.</p>
                <p>The geological features of the county are various and interesting. The granite of
                    Slieve Gullion, an offset of the granite district of Down, is often used for
                    millstones, being very hard and fine grained. The Newry Mountains and the Fathom
                    Hills are also composed of granite. Around Camlough large beds of mica-slate
                    exist. Slate quarries have been worked partially at Dorcy, Newtown-Hamilton,
                    Creggan Duff, and in the neighbourhood of Crossmaglen. Lead mines have been
                    worked, but without much success, in several parts of the county. There are
                    extensive deposits of lignite in the district near Lough Neagh. The other
                    mineral substances found are potters’ clay and a variety of ochres.</p>
                <p>The total population in 1821 amounted to 197,427 souls. In 1831 the population
                    was 220,134, and in 1841 it was 232,393, but in 1851 the numbers had declined to
                    196,085, and by the census of 1871 it was 179,260.</p>
                <p>The land is in general but indifferently cultivated, yet owing to the occupation
                    of the peasantry in the linen manufacture they are better lodged, clothed, and
                    fed than in most other parts of Ireland. The cultivation of grain has been for
                    some time slightly on the decrease, and the number of acres under flax
                    diminished from 27,245 in 1866 to 7530 in 1872; but in the green crops there has
                    been considerable increase. The total number of acres under crops amounted in
                    1872 to 172,550, viz., wheat, 10,599; oats, 68,487; barley, bere, and rye, 379;
                    beans and pease, 254; potatoes, 32,799; turnips, 7998; other green crops, 3287;
                    flax, 7530; meadow and clover, 41,164.</p>
                <p>The farms are in general very small, and show less tendency to decrease in number
                    than in most other parts of Ireland. In 1872 there were 6220 holdings of less
                    than five acres each. Notwithstanding this, their owners are generally in
                    circumstances of comparative comfort, owing to their employment in the linen
                    manufacture. There are few* who do not keep at least one cow, or a few sheep;
                    none but the poorest cottar is without a pig. The usual diet is oatmeal,
                    potatoes, and milk-porridge, varied sometimes by salt-herrings. The better
                    description of farmers use animal food, chiefly bacon and poultry.</p>
                <p>The principal manufacture, and that which has given a peculiar tone to the
                    character of the population, is still that of linen, though it has somewhat
                    declined of late. It is noways necessary to the promotion of this manufacture
                    that the spinners and weavers should be congregated in large towns, or united in
                    crowded and unwholesome factories. On the contrary, most of its branches can be
                    carried on in the cottages of the peasantry. The men devote to the loom those
                    hours which are not required for the cultivation of their little farms; the
                    women spin and reel the yarn during the intervals of their other domestic
                    occupations. Smooth lawns, perennial streams, pure springs, and the open face of
                    heaven, are necessary for perfecting the bleaching process. Hence the extensive
                    bleachers dwell in the country with all their assistants and machinery. Such is
                    the effect of this combination of agricultural occupations with domestic
                    manufactures, that the farmers are more than competent to supply the resident
                    population of the county with vegetable, though not with animal food; and some
                    of the less crowded and less productive parts of Ulster receive from it a
                    considerable supply of oats, barley, and flour. Apples are grown in such
                    quantities as to entitle the county to the epithet applied to it, the orchard of
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>The antiquities consist of cairns and tumuli; the remains of the fortress of
                    Eamania near Armagh, once the residence of the kings of Ulster; the Dane’s Cast,
                    an extensive fortification in the south-east of the county, extending into the
                    county of Down; spears, battle-axes, collars, rings, amulets, medals of gold,
                    ornaments of silver, jet, and amber, &lt;kc., have also been found in various
                    places. The religious houses were at Armagh, Clonfeacle, Killevy, Kilmore,
                    Stradhailloyse, and Tahenny. Of military antiquities the most remarkable are
                    Tyrone’s ditches, near Poyntz-Pass, Castle Roe, the fort of Navan, the castles
                    of Criff-Keirn and Argonell, and that in the pass of Moyrath.</p>
                <p>Armagh, together with Louth, Monaghan, and some smaller districts, formed part of
                    a territory called Orgial or Urial, which was long subject to the occasional
                    incursions of the Danes.</p>

                <p>The county was made shire ground in 1586, and called Armagh after the city, by
                    Sir John Perrott. When James I. proceeded to plant with English and Scotch
                    colonists the vast tracts escheated to the crown in Ulster, the whole of the
                    arable and pasture land in Armagh, estimated at 77,800 acres, was to have been
                    allotted in sixty-one portions. Nineteen of these, comprising 22,180 acres, were
                    to have been allotted to the church, and forty-two, amounting to 55,620 acres,
                    to English and Scotch colonists, servitors, native Irish, and four corporate
                    towns, —the swordsmen to be dispersed throughout Connaught and Munster. This
                    project was not strictly adhered to in the county of Armagh, nor were the Irish
                    swordsmen or soldiers transplanted into Connaught and Munster from this and some
                    other counties.</p>
                <p>Armagh is now divided into eight baronies, viz., Armagh, Fews Lower and Upper,
                    Oneiland East and West, Orior Lower and Upper, and Tiranny. It contains
                    twenty-nine parishes and parts of parishes, the greater number of which are in
                    the archdiocese of Armagh, and a few in the diocese of Dromore. The county is in
                    the Belfast military district, having barracks at Armagh and Newry. The
                    constabulary force has its headquarters at Armagh, the county being divided into
                    five districts. Assizes are held at Armagh, where the county prison, the county
                    infirmary, and ,the district lunatic asylum are situated. The only savings bank
                    in the county is at Armagh. There are two poor-law unions, Armagh (partly in
                    Tyrone) and Lurgan (partly in Antrim and Down). The valuation of rateable
                    property in 1872 amounted to £410,757. The chief towns are— Armagh, population
                    in 1871, 8946; Lurgan, 10,632; Portadown, 6735; and part of Newry, with 5321
                    inhabb tants, the remainder of this place, with 9616 inhabitants, being in the
                    county of Down. The county returns three members to the imperial parliament, two
                    for the county generally,—constituency in 1873, 7044; and one for Armagh
                    city,—constituency, 621.</p>
                <p>In the towns and level parts of the county the Protestant religion, in its two
                    principal forms of the Episcopal and Presbyterian, predominates; but the Roman
                    Catholic faith is prevalent in the mountainous and less cultivated parts. By the
                    census returns of 1871 the Roman Catholics number 85,057, or nearly one-half of
                    the gross population. The number of children at school in 1871 amounted to
                    19,887, of whom 14,838 attended the various “National Schools.” There were in
                    the same year twenty-one persons who knew nothing but the native Erse, and 3903
                    were able to speak both that language and the English.</p>

                    county, 64 miles north of Dublin, in lat. 54° 20' 55 <hi rend="superscript">
                        z,</hi> N., and long. 6° 37' 57" W. It derives its name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ard-macha,</hi> or High-Field, from its situation on the sides of a steep
                    hill called Drumsailech, or the Hill of Willows, which rises in the midst of a
                    fertile plain. Of high antiquity, and, like so many other Irish towns, claiming
                    to have been founded by St Patrick, it long possessed the more important
                    distinction of being the metropolis of Ireland; and, as the seat of a
                    flourishing college, was greatly frequented by students from other lands, among
                    whom the English and Scotch were said to have been so numerous as to give the
                    name of Trian-Sassanagh, or Saxon Street, to one of the quarters of the city. Of
                    a synod that was held here as early as 448, we have interesting memorials in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Booh of Armagh.</hi> Exposed to the successive calamities
                    of the Danish incursions, the English conquest, and the English wars, and at
                    last deserted by its bishops, who retired to Drogheda, the venerable city sank
                    into an insignificant collection of cabins, with a dilapidated cathedral covered
                    with shingles. From this state of decay, however, it was raised by the unwearied
                    exertions of Primate Robinson (otherwise Lord Rokeby), which, seconded as they
                    have been by similar devotion on the part of his successors of the Beresford
                    family, have made of Armagh one of the best-built and most respectable towns in
                    the country. As the ecclesiastical metropolis of both the Anglican and Roman
                    organisations, it possesses two cathedrals—of which the Catholic.is of the more
                    recent construction—and two archiépiscopal palaces. As the county town it has a
                    court-house, a prison, a lunatic asylum, and a county infirmary. Besides these,
                    there is a fever hospital, erected by John George Beresford; a college, which
                    Primate Robinson was very anxious to raise to the rank of a university; a public
                    library founded by him, and containing upwards of 14,000 volumes; an
                    observatory, which has become famous from the efficiency of its astronomers; and
                    a number of churches and schools. Almost all the buildings are built of the
                    limestone of the district, but the Anglican cathedral is of red sandstone.
