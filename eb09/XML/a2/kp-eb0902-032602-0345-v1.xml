                <p><label type="entry">ARCESILAUS</label>, a Greek philosopher, and founder of the
                    New or Middle Academy, was born at Pitane in Aeolia, about 316 B.c. He received
                    careful training in his youth from the mathematician Autolycus, and then
                    proceeded to Athens, where for some time he studied under Theophrastus. He was
                    gained over to the Academy by Crantor, with whom he continued to live on terms
                    of the closest intimacy. After the death of Crantor, Arcesilaus continued to
                    study under Polemo and then under Crates, whom he succeeded as leader of the
                    school. There is a little doubt as to the philosopher’s mode of life. According
                    to some he lived in extravagant, even profligate style, and Diogenes Laertius
                    tells us that he died in his 7 5th year of excessive drinking. But the testimony
                    of others, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Cleanthes, seems to show that he
                    practised extreme moderation; and some of his practical precepts tend to confirm
                    this view. He was much beloved and respected by the Athenians, and is celebrated
                    for his acuteness, eloquence, and learning. His philosophical opinions can only
                    be gathered from scattered notices in Cicero, Sextus, and others. He advocated
                    the Socratic or colloquial method of discussion, although he depreciated
                    dialectic proper, and seems to have carried out thoroughly the sceptical element
                    in the Platonic school. His theory of knowledge was developed in direct
                    antagonism to that of the Stoics. He especially opposed their favourite
                    doctrine, that the criterion of truth was to be found in the irresistible or
                    irresistibly convincing impression, which served as a mean between science and
                    opinion, and was common to the wise man and the foolish. Arcesilaus denied that
                    such a mean was possible, and showed further, that as conviction implied
                    approval or judgment, it could not apply to impressions but only to thoughts.
                    Moreover, the mere force of conviction could not be a test of truth, since a
                    false conception might be quite as irresistible as a true one. Arcesilaus
                    brought forward no new arguments against knowledge in general; he appears to
                    have thought that by overthrowing the theory of knowledge which rests on the
                    truth of the senses, he had destroyed all possibility of rational conviction.
                    The final result of his speculation was accordingly, that he could not know
                    anything, not even his own ignorance. It was the part of a wise man to despair
                    of certainty. To the ordinary argument against scepticism, that it destroys the
                    power of acting, Arcesilaus replied by pointing out that impressions or ideas
                    affect the will and produce actions, whether they are true or not. Men can act
                    upon their ideas with or without a conviction of their truth. In practical
                    matters probability is a sufficient guide. We have no certain information as to
                    how this doctrine was applied to the questions of morals. (See Brodeisen, <hi
