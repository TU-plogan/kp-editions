                <p><label type="entry">APRIL</label> was, in the old Roman reckoning, the second
                    month of the year, but is counted in the Julian calendar as the fourth. The
                    derivation of the name is unknown, though as far back as Varro we find the
                    traditional etymology, <hi rend="italic">omnia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aperit,</hi> “it opens everything,” which is supported by comparison with the
                    modern Greek use of avoids (opening) for spring; while some would make out a
                    connection with <hi rend="italic">Aphrodite</hi> (Venus), and Grimm suggests the
                    name of a hypothetical god or hero, <hi rend="italic">Aper</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Aprus.</hi> Among the Romans this month was sacred to Venus, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Festum</hi><hi rend="italic">Veneris</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Fortunae Virilis</hi> being held on the first day. On the fourth and the five
                    following days, games <hi rend="italic">{Ludi Megalenses')</hi> were celebrated
                    in honour of Cybele; on the fifth there was the <hi rend="italic">Festum
                    Fortunae Publicae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> on the tenth (?) games in the
                    circus, and on the nineteenth, equestrian combats, in honour of Ceres; on the
                    twenty-first—which was regarded as the birthday of Rome—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vinalia urbana,</hi> when the wine of the previous autumn was first »tasted; on
                    the twenty-fifth, the <hi rend="italic">Robigalia,</hi> for the averting of
                    mildew; and on the twenty-eighth and four following days, the riotous Floralia.
                    In many countries of Europe, as England, France, and Germany, the first of April
                    has for long been appropriated to a facetious custom, for which no very
                    satisfactory origin has been assigned. To send an unsuspecting or ignorant
                    person on some bootless errand is the great endeavour of the day. In Scotland
                    the unfortunate subject of the trick is called a gowk—which has now, though the
                    words were probably at one time different, the meaning both of “fool” and
                    “cuckoo,”—and the mischievous errand-sending is “hunting a gowk.” In France the
                    dupe is called <hi rend="italic">poisson</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Avril,</hi> or April-fish.
                    One remarkable theory traces the custom to Noah, as sending out his dove on such
                    a quest; it is also referred either to the miracle plays representing the
                    sending of our Saviour from Annas to Caiaphas and from Pilate to Herod, or to
                    the change, in France, in 1564, of New Year’s day to the first of January, which
                    left the first of April destitute of anything but a burlesque of its former
                    festivities; and more recently an identification has been attempted with the
                    Hindoo festival of Huli, which is celebrated in a similar manner on the 31st of
                    March. No references to all-fools’-day have been found in our earlier
                    literature; and it seems that both England and Germany have derived the fashion
                    from France. St George’s day is the twenty-third of the month; and St Mark’s
                    Eve, with its superstition about those who were doomed to die, falls on the
                    twenty-fourth. In China the symbolical ploughing of the earth by the emperor and
                    princes of the blood takes place in their third month, which frequently
                    corresponds to our April; and in Japan a pleasant domestic festival, called the
                    feast of Dolls, is celebrated in the same month. The days of April <hi
                    rend="italic">{journées</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Avril)</hi> is a name appropriated in
                    French history to a series of insurrections at Lyons, Paris, and elsewhere,
                    against the government of Louis Philippe in 1834, which led to violent
                    repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Procès</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Avril.</hi> (See Chambers’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Book of Pays;</hi> Grimm’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Deutschen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sgrt'ache,</hi> cap. “Monate.”)</p>
                <p>A PRIORI and A POSTERIORI. The philosophical distinction expressed by these terms
                    is to be explained by referring to the phraseology of Aristotle. According to
                    him there may be a double starting-point in knowledge. When our individual
                    progress in learning is chiefly considered, the things with which we are first
                    and best acquainted may be termed earlier and <hi rend="italic">prior;</hi>
                    whereas the truths of a more general, primary, and fundamental character, to
                    which we are subsequently led, have a later and <hi rend="italic">posterior</hi>
                    position. But if we lose sight of our personal interest in knowledge, then the
                    priority may be more justly claimed by whatever is the cause or principle from
                    which something else springs. In this sense the causal, original, and primary in
                    the objective world is by nature prior <hi rend="italic">(πρότερον</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">φvσeι)</hi>; whilst the secondary and derivative existence is
                    posterior. Priority in the first acceptation is only relative to us, and for
                    general purposes may be called accidental; in the second acceptation, the
                    priority is absolute, and without qualification. It is the second acceptation
                    which Aristotle laid down as the properly philosophical one, and which regulates
                    the usage of the phrases <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a
                    posteriori</hi> by the schoolmen. In that sense of the term there can evidently
                    be no <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> demonstration of first and fundamental
                    principles. According to Aquinas, for example, there can be no <hi rend="italic"
                    >a priori</hi> knowledge of God; because He, as uncaused and uncreated, cannot
                    be deduced from anything prior in causation to Himself, and can only be
                    apprehended rationally by means of that which is consequent upon His action,
                    viz., the creatures of the natural world. In other words, our knowledge of Him
                    must be <hi rend="italic">a posteriori.</hi> It is obvious that science in the
                    highest sense must be <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> if <hi rend="italic">vere
                    scire</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >causas</hi><hi rend="italic">scire; i.e.,</hi> the knowledge must spring from
                    an insight into causes, which are the true primaries. By an extension of this
                    usage an argument is said to follow an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> path,
                    when from the basis of some conception it proceeds to evolve by analysis all or
                    some of the logical consequences; whereas, the mode of reasoning, which
                    endeavours to gather into a single formula the various facts of observation, is
                    described as <hi rend="italic">a posteriori.</hi> The argument of Anselm, which,
                    from the mere conception of God, proposes to deduce his existence, is an example
                    of <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> reasoning. An <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    reasoner has to predict what is or will be, by considering what ought to be in
                    accordance with certain presuppositions. He tries by argument to assign
                    beforehand the place of a fact which may not yet have been discovered by
                    observation. From the analysis of certain given conditions, or by constructing
                    the total product from some given elements, he seeks to anticipate experience.
                    Of course, if the original conception be bad or defective, the conclusions will
                    be false or inadequate. Often too, what <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n228/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0228-0215"/> claims to be the mere deduction from a
                    conception, is secretly and perhaps unconsciously supplemented by more efficient
                    elements of proof. It is this circumstance, that imperfect knowledge is taken as
                    the ground for further conclusions, which has brought <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> reasoning into discredit. Apart from these defects, however, this
                    style of argumentation merely expresses the natural and blameless tendency of
                    the mind to make every acquired truth a sort of lever and fulcrum from which to
                    move the yet undiscovered and untried; and error is introduced only where there
                    is a failure to correct this tendency by constant recurrence to the processes of
                    verification. The <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> argument is based upon what
                    was originally given through experience; but before this experiential truth
                    becomes <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> it must lose its first and empirical
                    character, and be invested with the attributes of universality and necessity. In
                    this sense, which since the time of Kant has been commonly given to the word,
                    the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> is the opposite of the empirical and
                    contingent. Any truth which is relatively universal and necessary may in its own
                    sphere form the basis of an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> argument; and if
                    there be anything which is absolutely universal and necessary throughout the
                    whole range of knowledge, it will be in a supreme sense <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori.</hi> Such, according to Kant, is the self-contained and original faculty
                    of mind, the forms and powers of the intellect and senses, as
                    contradistinguished from the materials presented by the senses and elaborated by
                    the understanding. To ascertain the special constitution of this <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> region, thus marked out by the criteria of
                    universality and necessity, to determine the features of thought when it is
                    independent of and prior to all experience, was the theme of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Critique of the Pure Reason.</hi> The general or universal form
                    and faculty of knowledge, thought in its native purity, constitutes the <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> element: whilst the particularising data of
                    experience, drifting in from the unknowable thing-in-itself, make up the region
                    of the <hi rend="italic">a posteriori.</hi> An example of an <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> science, according to Kant, in this sense of the term, as not
                    dependent upon experience, is seen in pure mathematics; and there may also,
                    according to him, be a pure or <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> philosophy of
                    nature; but there can be no pure or <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> doctrine of
                    the ultimate ideas which regulate experience,—that is, metaphysics in the older
                    sense is impossible. (w. w.)</p>
