                <p><label type="entry">ANNELIDA</label><hi> ANNELIDA</hi>, a class of the
                    sub-kingdom Annulosa, the title being derived from Lamarck’s term Annélides <hi
                    rend="italic">(Annellus,</hi> a little ring), given to Cuvier’s red-blooded
                    worms. The latter were included by Linnaeus under his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vermes,</hi> along with intestinal worms, molluscs, zoophytes, and sponges. The
                    labours of Pallas, Baster, Otho Fabricius, and especially 0. F. Müller, enabled
                    Gmelin, in the 13th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturoe</hi> of the great Swede, to make some improvements and
                    many additions. Cuvier ranged the Annelida under his Articulata, giving them the
                    chief position on account of their red blood; but they are now generally
                    classified as a separate type below the latter. It would be out of place to
                    enumerate all the advances that have occurred since Cuvier’s time, but among
                    those whose names stand prominently forward in this respect are Lamarck, De
                    Blainville, Bose, Audouin, Milne-Edwards, Dugès, Moquin-Tandon, and De
                    Quatrefages in France; Van Bene-den, Morren, and D’Udekem in Belgium;
                    Gruithuisen, Oken, H. Rathke, Grube, Max Schultze, Hoffmeister, Hering,
                    Kölliker, Schmarda, Keferstein, Ehlers, and Ratzel in Germany; Claparède in
                    Switzerland; Malmgren, Metschnikoff, and Kowalevsky in Russia; Sars in Norway;
                    Kinberg and Lovén in Sweden; Delle Chiaje in Italy; Stimpson, Leidy, A. Agassiz,
                    and Verrill in North America; and Montagu, Dalyell, G. Johnston, J. R. Johnson,
                    Williams, Huxley, Baird, and Ray Lankester in our own country.</p>
                <p>The Annelida may be described as bilaterally symmetrical animals, with flattened
                    or cylindrical bodies, composed of numerous soft rings, or without such. The
                    locomotive appendages (generally furnished with bristles) are not articulated.
                    Nervous system consisting of a cephalic ganglion or pair of ganglia, connected
                    on each side of the oesophagus with a chain of ganglia running along the ventral
                    aspect. Mouth ventral; alimentary canal with . an anus. Circulatory system with
                    distinct vessels. The majority are small animals, but some reach the length of 6
                    feet and upwards, and are as thick as a finger.</p>
                <p>In the present article the Annelida will be understood as comprehending the A.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Poly-</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">chaeta,</hi> A. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Oligochaeta,</hi> A. <hi rend="smallcaps">Onycophoba,</hi> A.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Discophoka,</hi> and A. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gephybea,</hi>
                    the first two being often placed together in the subclass Chaetopoda.</p>
                <p>I. In the first order, A. <hi rend="smallcaps">Polychaeta,</hi> the body (fig. 1)
                    is elongated, segmented, more or less cylindrical (certain tubicolous forms
                    having two well-marked regions), and almost universally furnished with uniramous
                    or biramous bristlebearing feet (parapodia, Huxley). The first segment is
                    modified, so as to form a head or snout, and has the eyes, tentacles, &amp;c.
                    The second or buccal segment bears the mouth and certain processes. The other
                    segments have foot-tubercles, bearing bristles developed in special sacs (e,
                    fig. 4),’ and various appendages, such as elytra, dorsal and ventral cirri,
                    &amp;c. The structure of the bristles <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> fig. 2) holds
                    a prominent part in the discrimination of species and even genera, and the same
                    may be said of the hooks of many of the Tubicola (fig. 3). A curious example of
                    the Opheliidae has no bristles, and <hi rend="italic">Tomopteris</hi> has only
                    one at the base of each tentacle. Posteriorly, the diminished body generally
                    terminates in two elongated cirri in the free forms, while in the sedentary such
                    processes are often absent. In <hi rend="italic">Poly-dor a</hi> (fig. 21) a
                    curious funnel-like structure exists.</p>
                <p>The body in the Polychaeta <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> fig. 4) is invested bv a
                    finely fibrous, cuticular, or chitinous layer (&lt;Z), to which the iridescence
                    in many forms is due. This is perforated at somewhat regular intervals by two
                    series Of pores, and cilia are generally present at certain points. In the
                    sedentary annelids the cuticle is thinner, a feature probably in connection with
                    their protective tubes. Beneath the cuticle is a cellulo-granular hypoderm, with
                    tubular glands, bacilliparous and glandular follicles in certain cases, as well
                    as the deposits of pigment. The muscular system is well developed, and the bands
                    variously arranged in the body-wall. A well-marked circular layer is generally
                    present externally, while in others it would seem to be represented only by
                    oblique bands. The longitudinal bundles follow different plans, such as forming
                    an almost continuous coat, or split up into various distinct ribands (α and <hi
                    rend="italic">l&gt;,</hi> fig. 4, the former representing one of the dorsal
                    bands, the latter one of the ventral). Schneider thought that the arrangement of
                    the muscular system might form the basis of a classification of this and allied
                    groups; but for sound reasons it has not been adopted. There is no tendinous
                    raphe at each segment, though fibres from the dissepiments pass through <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n75/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0075-0066"/> the longitudinal layer, in some cases even to the
                    hypoderm. The muscular fibres have a hyaline connective tissue. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Myxicola</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Protula</hi> the fibres of the
                    longitudinal coat have a dendritic appearance in transverse section. Besides the
                    foregoing, many have a powerful oblique band on each side, passing down to be
                    inserted near the nerve-cord, or elsewhere; and the proboscis <hi rend="italic"
                    >(a,</hi> fig. 5), bristles, branchiae, alimentary canal, and other organs, have
                    a series of special muscles. By the muscles of the body-wall the Polychaeta
                    execute all their movements in the water and on land, the feet-papillae with
                    their bristles playing quite a subordinate part. A few progress in addition by
                    special organs, such as the tentacles of the Terebellae.</p>
                <p>The cutaneous and muscular tissues enclose a space termed the perivisceral
                    cavity, which stretches from the anterior to the posterior extremity. This
                    chamber is lined by a special membrane, which likewise envelops the alimentary
                    canal, vessels, and other organs. It is generally divided into various
                    transverse spaces by muscular dissepiments or screens (which permit
                    communication), and occasionally there are longitudinal partitions. In this
                    cavity the highly organised perivisceral corpuscles float in a coagulable lymph,
                    which has no relation with sea-water. The lining membrane is ciliated in <hi
                    rend="italic">Aphrodita,</hi><hi rend="italic">Glycera,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Polycirrus, Tomopteris,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terébella</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and it is curious that in these the blood-vessels proper
                    are absent, with the exception of the first and last. Ray Lankester has found
                    that haemoglobin occurs in the perivisceral corpuscles of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glycera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Capitella.</hi> Professor Huxley, after Μ.
                    de Quatrefages, is inclined to think the perivisceraj. fluid the true blood of
                    the group, but this is doubtful.</p>
                <p>The circulation of the blood is effected by a system of closed vessels with
                    muscular walls (fig. 5), the funda mental arrangement consisting of a dorsal and
                    a ventral trunk <hi rend="italic">(v),</hi> with communicating branches in each
                    segment—the current in the former being directed forwards, and in the latter
                    backwards. Branches from the main trunks ramify on the wall of the alimentary
                    canal, body-wall, dissepiments, and other parts. The dorsal gives branches to
                    the branchiae, whence the blood passes by other twigs to the ventral. Sometimes
                    dilatations, termed “hearts,” occur at the bases of the branchiae —as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Eunice;</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Arenicola</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyophthaltnus</hi> similar dilatations exist in other parts.
                    Various modifications of the system take place, such as the bifurcation of the
                    dorsal vessel anteriorly or posteriorly, the presence of blood-sinuses or
                    lacunae round the intestine in certain sedentary forms, and great diversity in
                    regard to capillary distribution. The blood is usually reddish in colour, and
                    devoid of corpuscles—the latter, however, being present in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syllida,</hi> some of the Ophe-liidae, Cirratulidae, and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Staurocephal·us.</hi> It is colourless in <hi rend="italic">Aphrodita,</hi>
                    greenish in <hi rend="italic">Stylaroides</hi> and certain Sabellidae. Finally,
                    <hi rend="italic">Glycera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polycirrus</hi> are devoid
                    of a true circulatory apparatus. This system is compared by Professor Huxley to
                    the water-vascular system of the Echinoderms, Trematoda, and other groups; but,
                    as formerly mentioned, this is doubtful. Haemoglobin has been found by Ray
                    Lankester in. the blood of many of the Polychaeta.</p>
                <p>The Annelida composing this group generally possess a special branchial
                    apparatus, and where this is absent <hi rend="italic">(e.g.
                    Lumbriconereis),</hi> the skin and ciliated digestive chamber seem to carry on
                    the function. So characteristic are the branchiae, that the term Dorsibranchs
                    was aptly bestowed on one section (see fig. 4), and Cephalobranchs on the other
                    (see fig. 6). The branchiae have the form of simple filiform organs, or they are
                    pinnate, bipinnate, pectinate <hi rend="italic">(e,</hi> fig. 4), flabelliform,
                    or arbuscular processes. To each the blood is carried by a branch of the dorsal
                    vessel, which traverses the organ to its extremity, and, looping, carries the
                    aerated fluid to the ventral vessel. Vascular loops pass between the two
                    branches in the branchiae, and only very thin cuticular tissues covered with
                    cilia intervene between the water and the blood, so that due oxygenation occurs.
                    In the Ser-pulidae the branch from the dorsal vessel is continued directly into
                    the twig going to the ventral, and from their point of union a single vessel
                    traverses the branchia and sends processes into the pinnae, the blood, moreover,
                    in these presenting undulatory movements. A cartilaginous framework exists in
                    the branchial processes of the latter group and the Sabellidae (fig. 6).
                    According to Fritz Müller the opercular plug in certain forms is developed by a
                    gradual metamorphosis of the branchia.</p>
                <p>The digestive system consists of a rounded alimentary canal, commencing at the
                    second and terminating in an anus at the last or the penultimate segment. The
                    mouth opens in the form of a simple slit or grooved dimple on the under surface
                    of the second segment. In many the first region is a complex muscular and
                    protrusible proboscis (fig. 5, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> pharynx and oesophagus
                    of some, and the oesophagus of others), with papillae, homy or dense calcareous
                    teeth (fig. 7), with a narrow oesophageal region (α') behind. Certain glandular
                    organs in the oesophageal region of certain forms are termed salivary. The walls
                    of the succeeding portion (α") are often marked by numerous sacculations from
                    constrictions at the dissepiments; and in some <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,
                    Aphrodita)</hi> large diverticula occur. The inner surface bears vibratile
                    cilia, the walls are glandular, and there are also circular and longitudinal
                    muscular fibres. The gland-cells contain numerous refracting granules, and the
                    tissue is by some held to be homologous with the liver of the higher forms. Many
                    modifications of this system exist: thus, for example, there is in <hi
                    rend="italic">Syllis</hi> a firm, smooth anterior region <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pharynx'),</hi> often armed, then a region provided with glands <hi
                    rend="italic">(proventriculus</hi> or gizzard), a stomach with a glandular sac
                    on each side, and lastly the intestine. The food of the group consists of both
                    animal and vegetable substances, and sandy mud is swallowed by others for the
                    nutrient particles it contains.</p>
                <p>The nervous system has the form of a pair of cephalic ganglia, and a chain of
                    ganglia placed along the ventral aspect of the body (n, fig. 4). The former lie
                    over the oesophagus, and send branches to the eyes, tentacles, and other organs.
                    A cord (buccal) joins them on each side to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n76/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0076-0067"/> the ventral chain, and thus the oesophagus is
                    encircled by a nervous collar. In each segment the ventral ganglia give out
                    branches for the supply of the neighbouring organs and feet. The nerve-cells
                    chiefly occur on the ventral surface and sides of the ganglia. In some <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g., Terebella),</hi> while the nerve cords are united in the
                    anterior region, they are separate posteriorly. The eyes are much developed in
                    <hi rend="italic">Alciope,</hi> certain Syllidae, and others; but, on the other
                    hand, many are eyeless. Most of the eyes are mere masses of black pigment
                    (sometimes capsulated) situated on the head, destitute of means of
                    accommodation, with certain nerve-threads going to them. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alciope,</hi> sclerotic, lens, retina, and other parts exist. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Branchi-omma</hi> the eyes occupy the branchiae, and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Fabricia</hi> the posterior end of the body. Otolithes are stated
                    to be present in a few <hi rend="italic">{e.g. Arenicola),</hi> but on these and
                    other minute points further investigation is required. The sense of touch is
                    extremely delicate in the group; on the surface at large, as well as in the
                    tentacles and cirriform processes <hi rend="italic">Evame, Nephthys,
                    Ophiodromus,</hi> and others, exhibit remarkable irritability.</p>
                <p>The Polychaeta are for the most part dioecious, the sexual glands being variously
                    developed on the inner surface of the body-wall or on the dissepiments, and
                    developing in the forms of ruffs round the vascular axes. The products are
                    detached into the perivisceral cavity. The ciliated and looped segmental organs
                    of Dr Williams occur very generally, and may conduct outwards the sexual
                    elements, but they have also been supposed to be excrementitious. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Tomopteris</hi> their ciliary current carries spermatozoa inwards,
                    and the same may occur in other forms. The structure and deposition of the egg,
                    and the changes in its development, agree with those in other classes. Certain
                    Eunicidae are ovo-viviparous. Occasionally the ova are borne on the back <hi
                    rend="italic">(fPolynoe),</hi> or in a ventral pouch <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Auto-lytus</hi><hi rend="italic">cornutus),</hi> until hatched, while in <hi
                    rend="italic">Spirorbis</hi> a modification of the operculum acts as an ovisac.
                    The young escape as ciliated organisms with a long whip anteriorly; but, as
                    development progresses, the cilia are confined to certain zones. A few immature
                    forms, again, such as the young of <hi rend="italic">Nerine,</hi> carry
                    remarkable bristles, which are shed before the adult form is reached. Some have
                    arranged the larval forms according to -the zones of cilia and the temporary
                    bristles. In the growth of the young animal the development of the new segments
                    takes place between the first and last In certain Nereidae, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g. Nereis Du-merilii,</hi> at least two sexual forms exist,—viz., a small
                    adult which develops either ova or spermatozoa in the usual way (except that in
                    the male the elements occur in two testicles placed in one segment); and,
                    secondly, another which becomes transformed into a <hi rend="italic"

                    further found another <hi rend="italic">Nereis</hi> which is hermaphrodite. The
                    phenomena of alternate generations is also observed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Autolytus,</hi> and fissiparity in <hi rend="italic">Filigrana,</hi> —the
                    latter, with <hi rend="italic">Spirorbis</hi> and
                    J77φΛ(&lt;7Zenα,beingalsohermaphrodite. The female <hi rend="italic"
                    >Autolytus</hi> quite differs from, the male, and has its body loaded with ova,
                    which pass into a pouch in <hi rend="italic">A. cornutus,</hi> Agass., and the
                    products by-and-by get exit as fιee-swimming embryos. The male is wide in front,
                    and has large tentacles, the sperm-sacs occupying the first five bristled
                    segments. From the young of the foregoing is developed—so as to complete the
                    series—the third kind, viz., the “parent-stock” of A. Agassiz, which differs
                    from both the previous forms. No sexual elements occur in the parent-stock, but
                    the males and females are produced from the body by transverse fission (fig.
                    8).</p>
                <p>Regeneration of mutilated parts is common in the Polychaeta, even to the
                    reproduction of a head.</p>
                <p>The tubes formed by many exhibit an amount of precision and skill not far removed
                    from the powers of the most ingenious insects. In common with the Nemerteans,
                    their skin exudes a tenacious secretion which coheres under water, and this
                    alone forms the protective tube in some; while in others it is strengthened with
                    mud (fig.</p>
                <p>9), sand, gravel, shells, and stones. The secretion varies from the most delicate
                    film in the Syllidae, to the tough parchment-tubes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ghoetopterus,</hi> or the rigid crow-quills of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyalin&lt;xcia</hi> (fig. 10). The eyeless <hi rend="italic">Pectinaria
                    belgica</hi> (fig. 11), again, fashions a tube like a straight horn (fig. 12) of
                    minute pebbles or large grains of sand, carefully selected and admirably fixed
                    to each other by a whitish secretion. In placing the grains together in the wall
                    there is no haphazard, but angle fits angle as in a skilfully built wall.
                    Beautiful semi-transparent tubes are constructed by an allied species in the
                    deep sea from the siliceous spicules of sponges. The remarkable arborescent or
                    pectinate processes which ornament the free ends of the tubes of certain <hi
                    rend="italic">Terébelloe</hi> are also noteworthy. The calcareous tubes of the
                    fixed Serpu-lidae. or the free <hi rend="italic">(e.g. Ditrypa),</hi> differ
                    from those of the molluscs in the absence of organic connection between the
                    animal and its protective sheath. Lastly, large coherent masses of coarse gravel
                    and sand-tubes are formed on various beaches by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sabellaria.</hi></p>
                <p>The annelids are subject to many parasitic inroads, as by <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Polychaeta are all marine, and distributed over the whole surface of the
                    globe,—often at very great depths,—as early shown by General Sabine, and
                    recently by·the Norwegian dredgings, and those of the celebrated “Porcupine” and
                    “Challenger” expeditions. Many species are common to the entire North Sea, and
                    extend to the south as far as Gibraltar, while some northern forms enter the
                    Mediterranean in considerable numbers. The British species are common to the
                    North Sea, and many range to the shores of North America. The size of some of

                    tropical waters abound with lustrous and splendidly tinted speci mens,
                    especially amongst the Amphinomidae. The borers in shell, limestone, coral, and
                    Melobesia, seem cosmopolitan, and the swimming <hi rend="italic">Tomopteris</hi>
                    is likewise widely distributed. The forms frequenting the bottom of the sea live
                    in mud or sand, or lurk under stones, in chinks of rocks, shells, and seaweeds.
                    Many specially affect mud or muddy sand, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    Lumbriconereidae, Nephthydidrae, Glyceridae, and the Terebellidae; while some
                    prefer hard or stony ground, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic

                    abound in fissures of rocks, under stones in pools, under tangle-roots, and in
                    sand or sandy mud. Many live in captivity several years, but the duration of
                    their existence generally is unknown.</p>
                <p>Tubicolar Polychaeta occur in various strata, from the Lower Silurian upwards,
                    and <hi rend="italic">Serpulites</hi> even appear in the quartz of Durness. Many
                    of the tracks and burrows referred to the group (Polychaeta) are involved in
                    considerable doubt; but the <hi rend="italic">Eunicites, Lumbriconereites,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Merin-gosoma,</hi> from the Solenhofen rocks, are
                    satisfactory evidences of fossil forms. The arrangement of the apertures of <hi

                    peculiar.</p>
                <p>In regard to beauty of form and colour, complex structure and wonderful habits,
                    the Polychaeta are not surpassed by any invertebrate class. The splendid
                    bristles of the Aphroditidae, constantly glistening with all the hues of a
                    permanent rainbow, the brilliant tints of the Phyllo-docidae, Hesionidae, and
                    Nereidae, and the gorgeous branchial plumes of the Terebellidae, Sabellidae, and
                    Serpulidae, can only be compared with the most beautiful types of butterflies
                    and birds.</p>
                <p>The class Annelida has been divided into the sections <hi rend="italic"
                    >Branchiata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Abranchiata,</hi> the former
                    comprehending the Polychaeta, the latter the other groups; but this does not
                    always hold good, since many Polychaeta have no branchiae. The latter, again,
                    have been separated into the Dorsibranchs and Cephalobranchs, the former
                    corresponding to the Maricola, Errantia, or Nereidae of others, the latter to
                    the Tubicola or Sedentaria. Grube’s divisions, Rapacia and Limivora, are based
                    on the nature of their food. In the present state of the department it will
                    suffice to indicate the following families (chiefly after Malmgren) under which

                <p>II. The A. <hi rend="smallcaps">Oligochaeta</hi> are annelids without tentacles,
                    cirri, or specialised branchial processes. Bristles, variously grouped, from two
                    to eight and upwards in each transverse series. They are hermaphrodite, and the
                    young undergo no metamorphosis.</p>
                <p>The body is enveloped in a delicate cuticle resembling that of the Polychaeta,
                    and pierced by many pores. Underneath is a cellulo-granular hypoderm, with
                    numerous glands. The setae are simple, bifid, or hair-like. The muscular layers
                    are an external circular, and an internal longitudinal, marked by the bristle
                    sacs. The foregoing tissues enclose a perivisceral space, with the usual septa
                    and the characteristic corpuscles in a coagulable lymph, which performs
                    important functions in the economy.</p>
                <p>The circulatory system consists essentially of a dorsal trunk situated over the
                    digestive chamber, carrying the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n78/mode/1up"

                    sub-intestinal conveying the fluid in the opposite direction. The former is
                    broken up into a plexus of vessels in the anterior segments, and generally gives
                    off a large branch (perivisceral) on each side in the others. The periviscerals
                    in certain segments behind the anterior plexus are enlarged, and so evidently
                    contractile as to have received the name of “hearts,” and propel the blood into
                    the ventral vessel. In the other segments the periviscerals pass to the latter,
                    either with or without division into branches—in the form of cutaneous plexuses,
                    which are greatly developed in this group. Branches pass from the ventral to the
                    intestinal wall, inosculating with others from the dorsal, and forming a rich
                    capillary network. In the <hi rend="italic">Lumbrici</hi> there is also a third
                    longitudinal vessel underneath the nerve-cord, and it is in communication with
                    both dorsal and ventral, especially by the cutaneous system. The blood is
                    generally reddish, devoid of corpuscles, and coagulable. Respiration seems to be
                    effected by the cutaneous and special plexuses, aided, probably, in some by the
                    currents of water in the ciliated digestive canal.</p>
                <p>The digestive system is in the form of a simple straight, more or less muscular
                    tube, differentiated into oesophagus, crop, gizzard, and sacculated intestine in
                    <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus,</hi> and coated internally with the usual glandular
                    elements (certain glands anteriorly being supposed to be salivary), and lined
                    internally with cilia. In the same group a peculiar closed fold of the chamber
                    constitutes the <hi rend="italic">typhlosolis</hi> of authors. The anus is
                    situated at the posterior end of the body. In the Limicolous group the structure
                    is less complex—pharynx, oesophagus, and intestine only being present. The
                    nervous system consists of a pair of cephalic ganglia, from each of which a
                    trunk passes by the side of the oesophagus to join the ventral chain, which
                    gives off branches in each segment to the surrounding parts. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> another small gangliated chain lies over the
                    commencement of the alimentary tract. The nervous system agrees in intimate
                    structure with that of the Polychaeta. Besides touch, and in some sight, the
                    special senses are not much developed. Several have epidermal papillae connected
                    with cutaneous nerves, which probably aid tactile sensibility.</p>
                <p>The Oligochaeta are hermaphrodite, the sexual elements being developed in certain
                    anterior segments in the form of testicles, deferent canals, receptacles,
                    copulatory papillae in some males, and ovaries and accessories in the female. In
                    each segment, with a few exceptions (while there are two in each in <hi
                    rend="italic">Lumbricus),</hi> the segmental organs occur. Claparède thought
                    that in the Limicola the latter are absent from the segments bearing the
                    oviducts and seminal receptacles, but present in those having male organs; while
                    in <hi rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> they are present in all the segments except
                    the four last. In some, special glands exist for secreting the egg-capsules. A
                    cincture or clitellum occurs in certain segments anteriorly (in <hi
                    rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> from the eighteenth to the twenty-ninth or
                    thirtieth, and in the others from the tenth to the fifteenth segment). The ova
                    are deposited in chitinous capsules (containing one or more), and the young
                    issue therefrom in a tolerably complete condition. Besides the ordinary
                    development by ova, it has long been known that <hi rend="italic">Nais</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Chaetogaster</hi> exhibit fissi-parous reproduction. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Nais,</hi> after a certain degree of growth has been reached,
                    budding takes place, so that several tolerably complete young forms may be found
                    attached to the adult. The process goes on until the <hi rend="italic">Nais</hi>
                    has been reduced to twelve or fourteen rings; then a pause occurs, and the
                    animal increases in length to forty or fifty rings, when a new cycle commences
                    by division in the middle of the body. <hi rend="italic">Chcetogaster</hi> shows
                    similar features, the budding taking place between the third and fourth segments
                    in the androgynous form—many zoids or buds being attached in line; but while the
                    second in position is one of the newest, the second in age is near the middle of
                    the series.</p>
                <p>Reproduction of lost parts readily takes place in this group. Parasites, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">Gregarinoe, Opalinoe,</hi> Nema-toids, and larval cestodes,
                    are met with internally, and <hi rend="italic">Vorticelloe</hi> are common
                    externally. Commensalism is seen in <hi rend="italic">Chcetogaster,</hi> which
                    lives on the pond-snails <hi rend="italic">(Limnoeus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    ectopara-sitic.</p>
                <p>They are distributed over the land and fresh waters (in sand and mud) of the
                    whole world: very few are marine.</p>
                <p>Two of the most important classifications are those of D’Udekem and Claparède.
                    The former arranges the suborders according to the gemmiparous, or
                    non-gemmiparous condition of the constituents. The latter group live in earth or
                    mud, are unable to swim or follow their prey, and have always their organs of
                    generation. The former are elegant little worms, living in stagnant or running
                    water, able to swim, and their generative organs are developed only at certain
                    periods. Claparède divides them into two families, viz., the <hi rend="italic"
                    >0.</hi><hi rend="italic">Terricola</hi> (including the earthworm and its
                    allies), and the <hi rend="italic">0.</hi><hi rend="italic">Limicola,</hi> an
                    arrangement much resembling Grube’s <hi rend="italic">Lumbridna</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Naidea.</hi></p>
                <p>III. The A. <hi rend="smallcaps">Onychophoea</hi> are represented by a single
                    aberrant family, <hi rend="italic">Peripatus.</hi> They are hermaphrodite forms
                    (with claws instead of bristles) approaching the Arthropods, and inhabiting land
                    and moist places in Chili, the West Indies, and other parts. The ventral
                    nerve-cords remain separate.</p>
                <p>IV. The A. <hi rend="smallcaps">Discophoea</hi> (leeches) are ringed forms (fig.
                    17), without lateral appendages (except in <hi rend="italic">Branchellion),</hi>
                    but possessing an anterior and posterior sucker. There is no specialised
                    respiratory system. They are generally hermaphrodite, and often
                    ectoparasitic.</p>
                <p>Externally there is a delicate porous cuticle; beneath lies a thick glandular
                    cutis, which pours out an abundant secretion of mucus, as in the Nemerteans. The
                    muscular system consists of an external circular coat of considerable strength,
                    from which various vertical or decussating bands pass at intervals, powerful
                    longitudinal bundles being held in the intermediate spaces, especially
                    laterally. There are also special muscles connected with the pharynx and other
                    parts. Each end of the body is generally formed into a flattened muscular
                    sucker, consisting apparently of several amalgamated segments. By aid of the
                    latter organs they move from point to point, and they can also progress rapidly
                    by swimming like the Nemerteans. The perivisceral space is · quite absent. The
                    circulatory system shows a main dorsal, a ventral, and two lateral trunks, all
                    communicating by branches in each ring. In <hi rend="italic">Branchiobdella</hi>
                    the blood is corpusculated. The blood is probably aerated on the cutaneofis, and
                    perhaps, in some cases, on the digestive surface. The digestive system consists
                    of a mouth opening into the anterior sucker, a muscular pharynx, oesophagus, a
                    large stomach with various caecal diverticula, and an anus which opens in front
                    of the posterior sucker, though sometimes into it. In some <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.</hi> the common leech), the mouth is furnished with three horny serrated
                    teeth. The nervous system is composed of two cephalic ganglia, which supply
                    branches to the eyes when present, and the usual gangliated ventral cord—giving
                    off branches to the surrounding parts. The gullet passes through the connecting
                    trunks as in the former groups. The last ganglion in the ventral cord of <hi
                    rend="italic">Clepsine</hi> is larger than the others; and, as in the
                    Polychaeta. the ganglia do <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n79/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0079-0070"/> not always correspond in number with the rings.
                    Other nerves occur in several, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the leech, which has
                    a trunk running along the dorsal surface of the digestive canal. Eye-specks are
                    present in some, and touch is generally much developed. The cupuliform organs,
                    in the cutaneous tissues of the head and anterior region in certain leeches are
                    supposed to be connected with the latter sense.</p>
                <p>The Discophora are hermaphrodite (with the exception of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Malacobdellidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ilistriobdellidae),</hi> with the
                    male organs ranged along the ventral surface in the form of a series of testes,
                    which are connected with a common vas deferens leading into a vesicula seminalis
                    on each side. The latter conveys the fluid into the intromittent organ, and its
                    secretion agglutinates the spermatozoa into a seminal rope or spermatophore. The
                    female organs consist of two ovaries leading to a common duct, opening into the
                    vagina, which receives the spermatophore. The segmental organs are present, but
                    not in direct communication with the reproductive structures, nor do they carry
                    the products to the exterior, since they are often caecal. The foregoing
                    diverges from the arrangement in the other Annelida, since the generative
                    products are not extruded into a perivisceral cavity, but pass outwards by a
                    particular apparatus. The ova are deposited in capsules formed by special
                    secretions, those of the leech being called cocoons. No metamorphosis occurs in
                    the development of the young, which by-and-by, in some cases, attach themselves
                    in crowds to the abdominal surface of the parent.</p>
                <p>The Discophora do not possess much power of regenerating lost parts. They are
                    distributed everywhere, chiefly in fresh water and moist places; some are
                    marine. A few attain a large size, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a species from
                    Valdivia is described as being two and a half feet long. Many are ectoparasitic,
                    living on fishes, crabs, and even in jellyfishes (Bolinidae). In swampy ground
                    in tropical countries certain leeches are often troublesome to travellers.
                    Fossil leeches have been found in the lithographic stones of Germany They have
                    been grouped into five families, viz., Malacobdellidae, Histriobdellidae,
                    Acanthobdellidae, Branchiobdellidae, and Rhynchobdellidae—the latter including
                    the medicinal leech of Europe, the green leech (fig. 18), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bdella nilotica</hi> of Savigny (fig. 19), the horse-leech, skate-leech,
                    pond-leech, which is devoid of an anterior sucker, and other well-known
                    forms.</p>
                <p>V. The A. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gephyrea</hi> seem to approach the Echinoderms
                    through the Holothuroidea. The body is more or less cylindrical, and, though
                    corrugated, is not definitely segmented. There is generally a protrusible
                    proboscis, having the mouth at the end or at its base; and the anus is terminal
                    or dorsal.</p>
                <p>The cuticle is chitinous, has numerous processes of similar composition,
                    longitudinal and transverse rugae, and many pores. Beneath is a hypoderm
                    containing certain glandular organs or sacs, and, in some, bodies like
                    trichocysts. Bristles occur in <hi rend="italic">Echiurus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Bonelha.</hi> The muscular system consists of external circular
                    and internal longitudinal fibres, and special groups of retractor and other
                    muscles of the proboscis. In some the longitudinal layer is arranged in separate
                    bands, stretching from one end of the body to the other. The circulatory system
                    shows a dorsal and ventral vessel, both in the Sipunculidae communicating with a
                    circular vessel (ciliated internally) surrounding the oesophagus, and sending
                    prolongations into the ciliated tentacles. The latter contains a corpus-culated
                    fluid. Certain ciliated infundibuliform organs also' occur on the intestinal
                    mesentery of <hi rend="italic">Sipunculus,</hi> and are thought to be connected
                    with the so-called water-vascular system. In <hi rend="italic">Echiurus</hi>
                    there is a more distinct circulation, consisting, according to De Quatrefages,
                    of three longitudinal trunks—a dorsal, ventral, and intestinal. The perivisceral
                    cavity is large, with rudimentary dissepiments in some, and contains a
                    corpusculated fluid, which in the living animal shows very lively currents—most
                    marked posteriorly, and generally in a longitudinal direction. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Boneilia</hi> the respiratory structures open into the latter
                    chamber. Two kinds of excretory organs occur—in some opening into the rectum,
                    and in others into the alimentary cavity anteriorly. The protrusible proboscis
                    is often armed with chitinous processes. The mouth opens at the base of the
                    proboscis in the Echiuridae, but at its tip in the Sipunculidae, the latter also
                    having short ciliated tentacles surrounding the aperture. It is followed by a
                    pharynx and much-convoluted alimentary canal lined with cilia. The anus is
                    either terminal, or situated dorsally at a point near the anterior third of the
                    body. ‘ The walls of the alimentary canal are glandular, and there are also
                    muscular fibres. The nervous system consists of a ventral cord giving off
                    various branches, but showing no distinct ganglionic enlargements, nor
                    indication of a fusion of two cords. There is an oesophageal collar, but the
                    cephalic ganglia do not seem to be always distinct. There are no organs of the
                    special senses except those of touch, which is fairly developed, and in a few
                    eye-specks, especially in young forms.</p>
                <p>The A. Gephyrea are dioecious, and have structures homologous with the segmental
                    organs of the other groups, in the form of a series of tubes or caeca. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sipunculi,</hi> according to Keferstein and Ehlers, there are
                    two testicles, and the ova are developed in ovaries attached to the wall of the
                    body, but they vary in situation in other families. The products fall into the
                    perivisceral cavity. Iu some the young undergo certain metamorphoses <hi
                    rend="italic">(Actino-trocha-iona),</hi> but in others the larval condition
                    differs from the adult chiefly in the possession of ciliated zones.</p>
                <p>The Gephyrea are widely distributed on the surface of the globe, generally iu
                    muddy regions, and some are common in empty univalves. They are all marine. They
                    have been grouped in three families: (1.) <hi rend="italic">Echiuridae,</hi>
                    containing forms with bristles, such as the common spoon-worm (Echiurus
                    vulgaris) and <hi rend="italic">Boneilia;</hi> (2.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sipunculidae,</hi> with a dorsal anus, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Phascolosoma
                    Bernhardi</hi> of the univalve shells; (3.) <hi rend="italic">Priapulidae,</hi>
                    with a terminal anus, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Priapulus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >caudatus.</hi><hi rend="italic">Sternaspis</hi> has lately been removed to the
                    Poly-chaeta, and <hi rend="italic">Phoronis</hi> has been included in the group
                    as a tubicolar Gephyrean.</p>
                <p>The Chaetognatha and the higher Turbellaria approach the Annelida proper very
                    closely, though from different points of view, and may be regarded as
                    intermediate between them and the Nematodes, Tematodes, and Cestodes. The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nemerteans</hi> (the highest group of the Turbellaria)
                    especially come near the Annelida, notwithstanding the condition of the nervous
                    system. They have cilia externally, and a cutis which secretes similar hyaline
                    tubes to those of many Annelida. The muscular system is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n80/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0080-0071"/> greatly developed, and in definite layers, and
                    many swim as freely as the most active leeches. The digestive system intimately
                    agrees, having cilia on the inner surface of the canal, a muscular oesophageal
                    region, and a sacculated intestine, while the glandular and other elements in
                    the wall are very similar; it differs in not passing through a buccal nervous
                    collar, although it lies beneath the nervous system in this region. The
                    circulatory apparatus is fairly developed, and in some corpusculated. The
                    special plexus, in certain forms, in the oesophageal part of the digestive tract
                    points out not only the true function of the vessels (which have been considered
                    a water-vascular system without reference to the cephalic sacs and their
                    ciliated vessels in the Enopla), but shows a close analogy with the anterior
                    plexuses of many Annelida proper and <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus,</hi> and
                    even foreshadows the branchial system of certain vertebrates, as seen, for
                    instance, in the young <hi rend="italic">Petromyzon.</hi> The appending of the
                    branchial system to the anterior end of the digestive is characteristic. Though
                    it is quite inaccurate to say that the Nemerteans have a corpusculated fluid in
                    the general cavity of their bodies, yet a highly organised corpusculated fluid
                    exists in their muscular proboscidian chamber, and evidently performs important
                    functions in their economy Moreover, the remarkable proboscis and its sheath
                    pass through a ring of nervous tissue consisting of the superior and inferior
                    commissures and their connections with the ganglia. The cephalic ganglia are
                    large, and lie over the digestive system, but the nerve-cords are separated
                    throughout. The Nemerteans are chiefly dioecious, and the products of their
                    sexual organs, which are developed in the form of a series of sacs on each side
                    between the muscular wall of the body and the digestive canal, find exit by
                    lateral pores, the contents of the male organs being often vented in clouds, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Hermella</hi> The young sometimes undergo a metamorphosis,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the 2⅛√i√⅛m-development of certain Anopla. To this
                    the 7 <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> omαnα-condition of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balanoglossus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Actinotrocha-</hi> state of
                    certain Gephyrea show similar features; and the three forms lead by separate
                    channels to the Annelids proper. There is little analogy with the Tunicates, but
                    the similarity of the development of certain Echinoderms to the three forms just
                    mentioned is eminently suggestive,</p>
                <p>Finally the Annelida as a whole show certain general features which may be
                    grouped under three heads— (1.) The uses of the class to man; (2.) The property
                    of phosphoresence; and (3.) The power of boring into hard substances.</p>
                <p>The Annelida are not devoid of value in an economical sense. All round the
                    British and many other coasts the lobworm <hi rend="italic">{Arenicola
                    marina,</hi> fig. 20) is used as bait; and here and there <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nephthys caeca</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nereilepas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fucata.</hi> In the Channel and Channel Islands two of the most plentiful of
                    the Nereidae <hi rend="italic">{Nereis cultrifera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">N.
                    diversicolor)</hi> are extensively employed in fishing. They are constantly
                    sought for between tide-marks with a pointed instrument resembling a spear, and
                    kept in vessels amongst sand and seaweeds. One of the most esteemed baits in
                    ordinary and in conger fishing in the same regions is the large <hi
                    rend="italic">Marphysa sanguinea.</hi> The anterior segments of the living
                    annelid only are preserved, since the posterior region is apt to decay and cause
                    the death of the whole. The natives of the Fiji group much relish a form allied
                    to our <hi rend="italic">Lysidice ninetta,</hi> and they predict its annual
                    appearance in their seas by observing the phases of the moon. It is called
                    Palolo by the Samoans and Tonguese, and Mbalolo by the Fijians. Occurring in
                    vast numbers, formal presents of the esteemed food are sent by the fortunate
                    chiefs considerable distances to those whose dominions are not visited by the
                    annelid. If the latter has similar habits to the British <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lysidice,</hi> it probably leaves its retreats in the coral-reefs and rocks for
                    the purposes of reproduction. The extensive use of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lumbrici</hi> in fresh-water fishing, and that of the leech in medicine, need
                    only be alluded to— the latter forming a considerable item in British
                    importations. <hi rend="italic">Echiurus</hi> is employed as bait by the Belgian
                    fishermen, and Pallas records that the natives of the same coast formerly
                    considered the muscular proboscis of the sea-mouse good food. .Lastly, a <hi

                    the stomachs of our most valuable fishes shows the important part played by the
                    Annelida in their food-supply; and the large number of species of fish w hich

                    instance, are often quite filled with sea-mice with Polynoidae, Tere-bellidae,

                    >Lumbricus.</hi> In the first-mentioned, light greenish and somewhat steady
                    scintillations are given off at the attachment of each scale, and the separate
                    organ gleams with pulsations of light at the ruptured surface. It was probably
                    the latter appearance which caused Μ. de Quatre-fages to state that it was
                    emitted in muscular contraction. The synchronous emissions of light by the
                    Italian fire-flies is interesting in this respect. In the Syllidae the light
                    comes from the under surface of each foot; in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Choetopterus</hi> the most vivid luminosity is on the dorsum of the tenth
                    segment; and <hi rend="italic">Polycirrus</hi> is so phosphorescent, that the
                    slightest tremor - in the water causes vivid pale bluish fire to gleam along
                    every tentacle. The exact physiology of ' the luminosity is still open to
                    investigation, though P. Panceri of Naples connects it with certain fatty
                    granules. The luminous emissions have no connection with light or darkness, with
                    the capture of prey, or the alluring of their enemies, nor with the illumination
                    of the depths of the sea.</p>

                    muddy clay and the debris in fissures of rocks. The labours of the earthworm in
                    passing through the soil only require indication; and the Gephyrea and some
                    leeches show the same habits in clay and mud. Certain Polychaeta and Gephyrea
                    have also the power, in common with cirripedes, molluscs, Bryozoa, and sponges,
                    of perforating rocks, stones, shells, and other solid media. The most
                    conspicuous forms are <hi rend="italic">Poly dor a</hi> (fig. 21), <hi

                    limestone, chalk, and shells, yet their occurrence-in large numbers in aluminous
                    shale and sandstone shows that their perforations are not necessarily due to an
                    acid. The influence of the boring annelids in disintegrating the foregoing
                    substances is considerable. (w. c. Μ.)</p>
