                <p><label type="entry">ARCHILOCHUS</label>, one of the first Greek lyric poets, was
                    born at Paros, one of the Cyclades. The date of his birth is uncertain, but he
                    flourished between 720 and 680 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His father,
                    Telesicles, was of noble family, and had been selected to consult the Delphic
                    oracle relative to sending out a colony from Paros. His mother, Enipo, was a
                    slave. While still young, Archilochus gained a prize for a hymn to Demeter; he
                    soon after left Paros and proceeded to Thasos, according to some authorities, as
                    leader of a colony. But his chief reasons for leaving his native place seem to
                    have been personal disappointment and disgust. Lycambes had promised him his
                    daughter Neobule in marriage, and had afterwards withdrawn his consent.
                    Archilochus, taking advantage of the licence allowed at the feasts of Ceres,
                    poured out his wounded feelings in verses of unmerciful satire. Lycambes he
                    accused of perjury, and his daughters of leading the most abandoned lives. Such
                    was the effect produced by his verses, that Lycambes and his daughters are said
                    to have hanged themselves. The satire was written in iambics, a measure
                    introduced for tho first time, and from its structure admirably adapted for
                    light sarcastic poetry. At Thasos the poet passed some unhappy years, and
                    incurred the great dishonour of throwing away his shield and fleeing from the
                    field of battle. He does not seem to have felt the disgrace very keenly, for,
                    like Alcaeus and Horace, he commemorates the event in his verses. After leaving
                    Thasos he is said to have visited Sparta, but to have been at once banished from
                    that city on account of his cowardice. His works, owing to their licentious
                    character, were also prohibited by the Spartans. He next visited Siris, in lower
                    Italy, a city of which he speaks very favourably. He then returned to his native
                    place, and was slain in a battle against the Naxians by one Calondas or Corax,
                    who was cursed by the oracle for having slain a servant of the Muses.</p>
                <p>The writings of Archilochus consisted of elegies, hymns, —one of which used to be
                    sung by the victors in tho Olympic games,—and of poems in the iambic and
                    trochaic measures. To him certainly we owe the invention of iambic poetry and
                    its application to the purposes of satire. The only previous measures in Greek
                    poetry had been the epic hexameter, and its offshoot the elegiac metre; but the
                    slow measured structure of hexameter verse was utterly unsuited to express the
                    quick, light motions of satire. Archilochus made use of the iambus and the
                    trochee, and organised them into the two forms of metre known as the iambic
                    trimeter and the trochaic tetrameter. The trochaic metre he generally used for
                    subjects of a serious nature; the iambic for satires. He was also the first to
                    make use of the arrangement of verses called the epode. Horace in his metres to
                    a great extent follows Archüochus. All ancient authorities unite in praising the
                    poems of Archilochus, in terms which appear to be somewhat exaggerated. His
                    verses seem certainly to have possessed strength, flexibility, nervous vigour,
                    and, beyond everything else, impetuous vehemence and energy. Horace speaks of
                    the “rage” of Archilochus, and Hadrian calls his verses “raging iambics.” By his

                    statues of these two poets were dedicated on the same day. The fragments of
                    Archilochus are to be found in the collections of smaller Greek poets by Jacobs,
                    Bergk, and Gaisford, and have been published separately by Liebel, <hi
