                    commencement of the 4th century, engaged in conflict with his bishop, Alexander.
                    At a previous period he is said to have been connected with the Meletian schism,
                    and on this account to have been excommunicated by Peter of Alexandria, who had
                    ordained him deacon. But if so, he had regained a position of importance in the
                    Alexandrian Church, as he is found, under Peter’s successor, Achillas, in charge
                    of one of the great city churches, Baucalis or Boucalis, where he continued to
                    discharge his duties with apparent faithfulness and industry for six years after
                    the accession of Alexander, the third bishop in order with which ecclesiastical
                    tradition connects him. Theodoret <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Eccl.,</hi> i. 2)
                    does not hesitate to say that Arius was chagrined because Alexander, instead of
                    himself, was appointed to succeed Achillas in the see of Alexandria, and that
                    the beginning of his heretical attitude is, in consequence, to be attributed to
                    discontent and envy. But this is so common an explanation of heretical movements
                    with the early church historians, that it is not to be received without reserve.
                    Upon the whole, there is no evidence that Arius was animated by mere personal
                    considerations in the advocacy of his doctrinal opinions. Rather, it seems
                    evident, as Neander says <hi rend="italic">{Church Hist.,</hi> vol. iv. 25),
                    that he thought he was only unfolding the traditionary church doctrine. Although
                    an African he appears to have been trained in the school of Antioch, under
                    Lucian, and there to have imbibed a strong leaning towards the subordination
                    system as to the relation of the Father and Son, which prevailed in that school.
                    Probably it was this training, and a natural lack of insight and speculative
                    depth, which led him into a line of negative thought, from which the church had
                    hitherto wisely abstained. Yet the idea of his craft and ambition deeply
                    pervades early Christian history. In his well-known treatise against eighty
                    heresies <hi rend="italic">(Lib. II.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hoer.,</hi> lxix. c.
                    3), Epiphanius describes him as a man “inflamed by his own opinionativeness; of
                    tall stature, with a downcast look; his figure composed like that of a subtle
                    serpent, to deceive the guileless by his crafty exterior.” “His dress,” he adds,
                    “was simple; his address soft and smooth, calculated to persuade and attract, so
                    that he had drawn away seven hundred virgins from the church to his party.”</p>
                <p>The views of Arius first attracted attention about 319 A.D. According to the
                    church historian Socrates (lib. i. c. 5), Bishop Alexander, in addressing the
                    presbyters and other clergy on the doctrine of the Trinity, dwelt so strongly on
                    the cons.ubstantial unity of the Father and the Son that Arius charged him with
                    holding Sabellianism. But, according to Sozomen, a contemporary historian of the
                    5th century, Arius made himself conspicuous by the advocacy of his special
                    opinions, and Alexander only interfered after being charged with remissness in
                    leaving him so long to disturb the faith of the church. Having called Arius and
                    his opponents before him, Alexander heard their respective arguments, and
                    finally, after due examination, gave judgment against Arius. The result was a
                    wide-spread commotion, extending not only through Africa, but other provinces of
                    the Roman empire. Bishops joined issue with bishops; congregations were
                    violently excited; and the greatest mystery of the Christian religion became a
                    subject of irreverent controversy among women and children. Even the heathen
                    joined in the profane uproar. Arius himself cannot be excused from stirring up
                    this popular and unworthy clamour: for he conwosed verses, under the name of
                    Thalia (Θαλeια), which appear to have been a sort of popular miscellany for
                    diffusing his opinions. He addressed at the same time an elaborate letter to
                    Eusebius of Nicomedia, which remains to this day one of the clearest statements
                    of his dogmatic position. It sets out with a complaint of the persecution which
                    he had suffered at the hands of Alexander, who had driven him and his adherents
                    (he says) out of the city as impious men or atheists <hi rend="italic"
                    >(άθεους),</hi> “merely for dissenting from his public declaration that ‘ as God
                    is eternal so is His Son ’—when the Father, then the Son—the Son is present in
                    God without a birth <hi rend="italic">(άγεννήτως),</hi> ever begotten
                    (α∈ιγev77ς), an unbegotten-begotten <hi rend="italic">(άγεννητογενής)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;—</hi> an eternal God, an eternal Son; the Son is from God
                    himself.” .... “These blasphemies we cannot bear to hear even,” he says, “no,
                    not if the heretics should threaten us with ten thousand deaths. What, on the
                    other hand, do we maintain? that the Son is not unoriginate (αγtw⅛7τov), nor
                    part of the Unoriginate, nor made of any previously existing substance, but that
                    by the will and purpose of God He was in being before time <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πpo</hi><hi rend="italic">χρόνων καί προ</hi> αιώνων), perfect God, the only

                <p>There is another letter to the same purpose, but more moderate in statement,
                    addressed to Alexander after his banishment; and the student will find in those
                    letters, and in the Thalia, the most original and trustworthy account of the
                    opinions of Arius. “We believe,” he says in the letter to Alexander, “in one God
                    alone without birth, alone everlasting, alone unoriginate . . . . We believe
                    that this God gave birth to the only begotten Son before eternal periods <hi

                    (αιώναν) and all things else; that He gave birth to Him, not in semblance, but

                    again, as Manichaeus, a consubstantial part <hi rend="italic">(μεpoς

                    make two out of one, . . . but created by the will of God, and endowed with His
                    own glorious perfections—yet not so that the Father did thereby deprive himself
                    of attributes which are His without origination <hi rend="italic"
                    >(άγεννήτως),</hi> being the Source (τττ/γ?)) of all things; so that while there
                    are three persons <hi rend="italic">(υποστάσεις)</hi> yet God is alone the Cause
                    of all things and unoriginate. The Son, on the other hand, is originate,
                    begotten by the Father time-apart. The Son is not, therefore, co-eternal or
                    co-unbe-gotten with the Father, as if these were two unbegotten principles; but
                    God is before all things as <hi rend="italic">(μονάς)</hi> single and the
                    principle of all, and therefore before Christ also.”</p>
                <p>On the one side, therefore, Arius denied of Christ that He was <hi rend="italic"
                    >unoriginate;</hi> or part of the Unoriginate; or con-substantial <hi
                    rend="italic">(oμooυσιov)</hi> with the Father; or without beginning <hi
                    rend="italic">(άναρχος)·,</hi> or a mere development of God. The Son, he said,
                    “did not exist before He was begotten <hi rend="italic">(oυκ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ήν πριν</hi><hi rend="italic">γεwηθη)T</hi> In other words, “He is

                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Exoucontian»</hi> sometimes given to his
                    followers. But, on the other side, Arius affirmed of the Son that He was in
                    being before time <hi rend="italic">(προχρόνων)</hi>; that lie was perfect God
                    <hi rend="italic">(πλήρης</hi> ©eôç); only begotten <hi rend="italic"

                    >(αιώνας)</hi> through Him; that He was the making or offspring of the Father,

                <p>Such were the questions which distracted the church beyond all precedent in the
                    beginning of the 4th century, and led to the first great oecumenical council,
                    which was convened in Nicaea in 325. The account of the proceedings<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n597/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0597-0538"/> of this council will be given under its own
                    heading. It requires only to be mentioned here, that after various turns in the
                    controversy, it was finally decided against Arius, that the Son was “of the same
                    substance” (ό/χ-οοΰ-σιov) with the Father, “very God of very God.” Constantine
                    embraced the decision of the council, and resolved to uphold it. Arius and the
                    two bishops of Marmarica and Ptolemais, who refused to subscribe the creed of
                    Nicaea, were excommuniated and banished to Illyria; and even Eusebius of
                    Nicomedia, who accepted the creed, but not its anathemas, was exiled to Gaul.
                    Alexander returned to his see triumphant, but died soon after, and was succeeded
                    by Athanasius, his deacon, who had been the soul of the orthodox party of
                    Nicaea, and with whose indomitable fortitude and strange vicissitudes the
                    further course of the controversy is bound up. This will be explained in detail
                    under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Athanasius,</hi> and it only remains for
                    us to sketch at present what is known of the future career of Arius.</p>
                <p>Although defeated at the Council of Nicaea, Arius was by no means subdued. He
                    obtained means of access to Constantia, the sister of the emperor, who, on her
                    deathbed, strongly urged her brother to reconsider the question, and to recall
                    the heresiarch from banishment. Restored to court, he, along with the Eusebian
                    party, who, although professing to accept the Nicene doctrine, were in reality
                    indifferent, if not hostile, to it, renewed the theological strife, in which
                    Athanasius was nothing loth to join. Interchanges, now of friendly recognition
                    and now &lt;jf menace, passed betwixt the emperor and the intrepid bishop of
                    Alexandria, who obstinately refused to reinstate Arius as presbyter. At length,
                    on the banishment of Athanasius to Treves in 336, Arius returned to Alexandria
                    to claim his old position; but even in the absence of the bishop the people rose
                    in uproar against the heretic, and the emperor was forced to recall him to
                    Constantinople. There the bishop was reluctantly compelled to profess his
                    willingness to receive him once more into the bosom of the church, but before
                    the act of admission was completed Arius was taken suddenly ill, while walking
                    with a friend in the evening, and died in a few moments. This was interpreted by
                    the adherents of the Nicene theology as a special interposition of Providence on
                    their behalf, and they openly gave thanks to God in the church. The modern
                    reader will look with less credulity upon an event which was probably quite
                    natural in its occurrence, but he will hardly see any cause in it for
                    lamentation. The character of Arius, if not originally tainted by self-seeking
                    and restless ambition, appears to have gathered something of this taint in the
                    course of his career, and the most impartial student of church history fails to
                    see anything in it to admire beyond the pertinacity of his courage and his
                    faithful devotion to his own opinions.</p>

                    rend="italic">—</hi> The death of Arius, as described above, did not extinguish
                    the Arian party. On the contrary, they continued active and zealous <hi
                    rend="italic">within</hi> the church for upwards of fifty years, or till the
                    second general council at Constantinople, in 381. Afterwards they may be said to
                    have existed, as a distinct Christian sect, outside the Catholic Church, till
                    about the middle of the 7th century. Constantine, while strongly disposed at
                    first to enforce the Nicene decrees, was gradually won toamore conciliatory
                    policy by the influence especially of Eusebius of Caesarea, and his namesake,
                    Eusebius of Nicomedia. On the other hand, the Nicene doctrine found the most
                    able and ardent defender in Athanasius, the young deacon who had attended Bishop
                    Alexander at the council, and who shortly afterwards succeeded him in the see of
                    Alexandria. An unceasing contention ensued betwixt the Eusebian and Athanasian
                    factions of the church. Constantius, who succeeded his father in 337, strongly
                    favoured the former, or semi-Arian party, and successive synods were called with
                    the view of adjusting differences and compelling uniformity of faith. “The
                    highways were covered,” says an ancient historian (Ammianus, xxi. 15, quoted by
                    Gibbon, vol. iii. 67, Milman’s ed.) “with troops of bishops galloping from every
                    side to these assemblies.” At length the tenet of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homoiousion</hi> was substituted for that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hornoousioη</hi> at the Council of Rimini (Ariminum) in 360. But the war of
                    words raged as fiercely as ever during the reigns of Julian (the Apostate) and
                    his successors till after the accession of Theodosius the Great, under whose
                    auspices the Council of Constantinople was convened and the Nicene doctrine was
                    confirmed and finally accepted as the catholic doctrine of the church. Even
                    then, however, Arianism was warmly espoused by several of the German
                    nationalities then assailing the empire. The entire nation of the Ostrogoths
                    became Arian; the Visigoths followed their example, till, at the request of
                    their king, Reccared, they embraced the catholic faith at the Council of Toledo
                    in 589. The Vandals in Africa, the Suevi in Spain, and the Burgundians in Gaul,
                    were all for a time zealous Arians, and the heresy maintained its influence
                    amongst the Lombards in the north of Italy to a later period than elsewhere.
                    Gradually, however, it perished as a distinctive national type of Christianity
                    before the growth of mediaeval Catholicism, and the name of Arian ceased to
                    represent a definite form of Christian doctrine within the church, or a definite
                    party outside of it. Individual Christian teachers of great eminence, such as
                    John Milton and Samuel Clark, and even Ralph Cudworth, have been accused of
                    Arianism, but even where, as in Milton’s case, the accusation seems well
                    founded, the peculiar heresy known by that name has never assumed any influence,
                    or regained, for any length of time, its influence in the church. (j. τ. )</p>
