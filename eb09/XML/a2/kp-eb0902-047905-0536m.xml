                    which begin in the department of the Meuse are continued in a north-west
                    direction, and divide the basin of the Meuse from the basin of the Aisne, till
                    they form a junction with the Ardennes proper. At one time this was a very
                    inaccessible region, and formed a strong defence, as Dumouriez showed in 1792,
                    against invasion from the east. The Meuse (Maas), flowing in a northern
                    direction, enters obliquely from the east, and cuts off a narrow and irregular
                    strip along the Belgian side of the department, which it leaves at the extreme
                    north, to flow through Belgium and join the western branch of the Rhine. The
                    Aisne enters near the south-east corner and leaves at the south-west; its course
                    through the department skirting the base of the Argonne range, and forming an
                    irregular arc with its convexity to the north. The chief wealth of Ardennes
                    consists in mineral productions, wood, cattle, and sheep The number of cattle in
                    1872 was 82,975, of sheep 393,044, of horses 49,748, and of pigs 51,809. The
                    sheep are small, but are valued for the quality of their mutton. Agriculture has
                    recently made considerable advances in the department. There are upwards of 150
                    iron-mines, as at Grandpré, Champigneulle, Raucourt, Brevilly, Monthermé, and
                    Flize; a great number of excellent slate-quarries, as at Deville, Monthermé,
                    Rimagne, and Fumay; while copper also is obtained in considerable quantities,
                    and there is an abundant supply of building-stone, limestone, and marl. Peat is
                    very common in the north, and coal is wofked near Sedan. The people are well
                    educated, active, and industrious, and can boast of having furnished from their
                    ranks such men as Gerson, Robert de Sorbon, Mabillon, Corvisart, Marshal
                    Macdonald, de Wailly, Léon Renier, H. Taine, and the publisher Hachette. It is
                    said that they are marked by a special aptitude for the exact sciences. The
                    department has about 240 miles of imperial road and 131 of departmental. Its two
                    great rivers are united by the Canal des Ardennes. A branch of the Paris and
                    Strasburg railway runs through it in a north·east direction, joining Rheims (in
                    Marne) with Réthel and Mézières, and holding north along the valley of the Meuse
                    to Namur (in Belgium). At Mézières this branch meets almost at right angles with
                    a line running north-west, and connecting Thionville (in the district acquired
                    by Germany) with Montmédy, Sedan, Maubert, &lt;fcc. The department is divided
                    into five arrondissements: Mézières, towards the centre; Rocroy, in the N.;
                    Rethel, in the W. and S.; Vouziers in the S.; and Sedan in the E. Mézières is
                    the capital, and a prefecture. Ecclesiastically the department, which has 46
                    cures, is part of the diocese of Rheims. It contains communal colleges and
                    normal schools, and has 720 free public schools. The population in 1872 was
                    320,217, the falling off from 331,296 in 1851 being due to the war of 1870-71.
