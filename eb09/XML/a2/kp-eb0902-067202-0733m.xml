                <p><label type="entry">ARYAN</label>, a technical term, applied to one of the great
                    families of language, which extends from India to Europe, and which, for that
                    reason, is called also <hi rend="italic">Indo-European.</hi> Friedrich Schlegel,
                    who first recognised the family relationship of these languages <hi
                    rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Sprache und Weisheit der Indier,</hi>
                    1808), assigned to them the name of <hi rend="italic">Indo-Germanic,</hi> a name
                    still used by preference by many scholars in Germany (Pott, Benfey, &amp;c.)
                    Bopp <hi rend="italic">{Vergleichende Grammatik,</hi> vol. i. p. xxiv.) decided
                    in favour of <hi rend="italic">Indo-European</hi> as a more appropriate name for
                    that large family of speech. Other scholars have used the names <hi
                    rend="italic">Japhetic, Sanskritic</hi> (W. von Humboldt), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mediterranean</hi> (Ewald).</p>
                <p>The objection to <hi rend="italic">Indo-Germanic</hi> as the technical name of
                    the whole family is that it is too long, and yet not sufficiently extensive. If
                    the family is to be distinguished by the names of its two extreme members, the
                    name ought to be <hi rend="italic">Indo-Celtic,</hi> rather than Indo-Germanic;
                    if by its most important members, then, as remarked by Bopp, the name should be
                    <hi rend="italic">Indo-Glassic. Indo-European</hi> is an equally cumbersome
                    name, and less correct even than Indo-Germanic, considering that there are many
                    languages spoken both in India and Europe which do not belong to that family.
                    <hi rend="italic">Sanskritic</hi> would be a misleading name, as countenancing
                    the idea that all the members of this family are derived from Sanskrit. <hi
                    rend="italic">Japhetic</hi> seems to revive the Jewish conception of the three
                    ancestors of the human race, <hi rend="italic">Shem, Ham</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Japhet</hi> and would, from the strictly Hebrew point of view,
                    comprehend many tribes in the north of Asia and Europe who speak Turanian
                    languages. Ewald, who suggested the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mediterranean,</hi> distinguishes, besides the Mediterranean, three other
                    families of speech, the <hi rend="italic">Northern,</hi> commonly called North
                    Turanian or Altaic, the <hi rend="italic">Semitic,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Copto-</hi><hi rend="italic">African.</hi> He explains the name of
                    Mediterranean by saying, that “the races speaking these languages inhabited the
                    large central circle, surrounded by Semitic, South-Indian, Chinese,
                    Turko-Tataric, and Bask languages” <hi rend="italic">(Lehrbuch der Hebräischen
                    Sprache,</hi> p. 17, note). The reason why this name has not been accepted,
                    seems to be that locality has little to do with the essential character of
                    languages, and that the central position once occupied by the people who spoke
                    these tongues belongs to them no longer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aryan,</hi> as a name for a whole family of languages, has the
                    advantage of being short, and, being a word of foreign origin, of lending itself
                    more easily to any technical definition that may be assigned to it. It has been
                    accepted by many writers in England, France, and India. In Germany, too, it is
                    used in this wide sense by Lassen and others, while some scholars have used the
                    term in the more restricted sense of <hi rend="italic">Indo-Iranian,—i.e.,</hi>
                    as comprehending the languages of India and Persia, which constitute the
                    south-eastern as distinct from the north-western (Greek, Latin, Celtic,
                    Teutonic, Slavonic) branch of the family.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Origin of the Word.—Aryan,</hi> as a technical term, has been
                    borrowed from the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">arya</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ärya,</hi> the Zend <hi rend="italic">airy a.</hi> In the later Sanskrit <hi
                    rend="italic">ärya</hi> means, of a good family. It is used as a complimentary
                    address. Originally, however, it was used as a national name, and even as late
                    as the time of the Laws of Manu, India is still called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arya-aυarta, i.e.,</hi> the abode of the Aryas. In the Veda, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ärya</hi> is the name by which the believers in the gods of the Veda call
                    themselves, in opposition to their enemies, who are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Däsas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Dasyus.</hi> The distinction appears in
                    passages such as the following :—</p>
                <p>I. 51, 8. “Distinguish, Indra, the <hi rend="italic">Aryas</hi> and those who are
                    <hi rend="italic">Dasyus</hi>” (vi ^ânïhi âryàn yé Ära däsyavaÄ).</p>
                <p>X. 86, 19. “I, Indra, distinguishing the <hi rend="italic">Däsa</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ärya”</hi> (viÂinvân dâsam äryam).</p>
                <p>We frequently read of the gods protecting the <hi rend="italic">Ärya</hi> and
                    destroying his enemies.</p>
                <p>III. 34, 9. “Indra, having killed the <hi rend="italic">Dasyus,</hi> protected
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aryan</hi> colour” (hatvï dâsyün prâ ärya in vârnam ävat).
                    This looks like an ethnological distinction of colour between <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ary as</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dasyus..</hi></p>
                <p>X. 49, 3. “I (Indra) who do not give over the <hi rend="italic">Aryan</hi> name
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Dasyu”</hi> (nâ <hi rend="italic">yàh</hi> raré äryam
                    näma dasyave).</p>
                <p>In X. 11, 4, we read of Aryan clans, äryä/t visah.</p>
                <p>I. 103, 3. “Indra, increase the <hi rend="italic">Aryan</hi> power” (äryam sâliaA
                    vardhaya).</p>
                <p>VIII. 103, 1. “Agni, the increaser of the <hi rend="italic">Arya”</hi> (äryasya
                    vardhanam).</p>
                <p>VII. 18, 7. “Indra, the companion of the <hi rend="italic">Arya”</hi> (sadhamää
                    äryasya).</p>
                <p>I. 130, 8. “Indra protected in battles the <hi rend="italic">Aryan</hi>
                    sacrificer” (ΓndraΛ samâtsu yâ^amânam äryain prâ ävat).</p>
                <p>The gods, it is said, bring light for the Ärya.</p>
                <p>I. 59, 2. “Agni is made a light for the <hi rend="italic">Arya”</hi> (tâm tvä
                    deväsa/i ayanayanta devâm vaisvänara yyötiÄ it Sryäya); or, “Agni creates broad
                    light for the <hi rend="italic">Arya,</hi> driving the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dasyus</hi> from the house” (VII. 5, 6).</p>
                <p>II. 11, 18. “He (Indra) uncovered the light for the <hi rend="italic">Arya,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dasyu</hi> was left on the left hand” (âpa avrino/i
                    ^ry0ti7⅛ äryäya ni' savyatäÄ sädi dâsyuâ indra).</p>
                <p>III. 26, 2. “I gave the earth to the <hi rend="italic">Arya,</hi> and rain to the
                    liberal mortal” (Ahâm bhιimim adadâm âryàya ahâm vrishrim dâsùshe mârtyâya).</p>

                <p>I. 117, 21. “The two Asvins have made the light wide for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arya”</hi> (uni <hi rend="italic">gybtih</hi> ZrakrathuA äryäya).</p>
                <p>That light itself, the light of the day or the daily light and life, are called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aryan</hi> light, X. 43, 4, and some of the gods too are
                    addressed by the name of <hi rend="italic">Arya.</hi> In V. 34, 6, we read of
                    Indra, “that he, the <hi rend="italic">Arya,</hi> leads the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dosa,</hi> according to his will” (yathävasAm nayati däsam SryaΛ). In X. 138,
                    3, too, Indra seems to be called by that name.</p>
                <p>Most frequently, no doubt, the <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> is conceived as the
                    worshipper of the gods. He was called so in I. 130, 8; again in I. 156, 5, <hi
                    rend="italic">Arya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Yagamäna,</hi> sacrificer, are
                    mentioned together.</p>
                <p>In IX. 63, 5, the <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> is opposed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ärävän,</hi> the enemy, the man who offers no sacrifices; and I. 51, 8, the
                    same distinction is drawn between the <hi rend="italic">barhishmat,</hi> the
                    sacrificer or <hi rend="italic">Arya,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >avratd,</hi> the lawless, the <hi rend="italic">Dasyu.</hi></p>
                <p>But the enemies of the poets and their friends are not only among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dasyus,</hi> but also among the <hi rend="italic">Aryas,</hi> and
                    in their tribal feuds one Arya speaks of the other as <hi rend="italic"
                    >adeva,</hi> godless, in the original sense of the word. Thus we read :—</p>
                <p>_ X. 102, 3. “Turn away the weapon of the <hi rend="italic">Däsa</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arya”</hi> (däsasya vä maghavan äryasya vä sanutAΛ yavaya
                    vadhâm).</p>
                <p>X. 83, 1. “Let us withstand the <hi rend="italic">Däsa,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arya,</hi> with thee as helper” (sahyäma däsam äryam tvAyä
                    yuyä).</p>
                <p>VI. 33, 3. “Thou, O hero, struckest these two enemies, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Däsa</hi> fiends and the <hi rend="italic">Arya”</hi> (tvAm tän indra ubhAyän
                    amiträn däsa vriträni äryä Ä-a süra vAdhlΛ).</p>
                <p>VI. 60, 6. “They (Indra and Agni) kill the <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> fiends,
                    they kill the <hi rend="italic">Däsa</hi> fiends, they strike off all haters
                    (fem.)” (hatA7i vriträni äryä hatA7i däsäni sAtpatï hatAÄ visväÄ Apa
                    dvisha/ø.</p>
                <p>Similar passages, mentioning <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Däsa</hi> enemies, occur, VI. 22, 10; VII. 83, 1; X. 69, 6, &amp;c. In VIII.
                    24, 27, the <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> enemy is contrasted with the <hi
                    rend="italic">riksha,</hi> literally, the bear.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> enemy 13 called godless in X. 38, 3, “Whatever
                    <hi rend="italic">Däsa</hi> or godless <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> means to
                    fight us” (yA7t naλ däsaA äryaÄ vä purustuta AdevaÄ indra yudhäya
                    Λ∙iketati).</p>
                <p>Lastly, <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> means in some passages what befits or belongs
                    to an <hi rend="italic">Arya,</hi> what is proper and right.</p>
                <p>X. 65, 11. “The gods spread all over the earth the <hi rend="italic">Aryan</hi>
                    laws” (sudanavaΛ, äryä vratä vi sriyAntaΛ∙ Adhi kshâmi).</p>
                <p>In IX. 63, 14, the sacred receptacles of the Soma are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ärya</hi> (été dhämäni äryä sukräA ritâsya dhärayä väyam gômantam
                    aksharan).</p>
                <p>It is clear from these passages that <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> is one of the
                    oldest names by which people belonging to this great family of speech called
                    themselves in distinct opposition to their enemies. It is admitted also that the
                    Veda, in which this name occurs, surpasses in antiquity every other literary
                    document belonging to the same race, and it would be difficult, therefore, to
                    find another name better adapted to serve as a technical term for the whole
                    Aryan family of languages^</p>
                <p>As <hi rend="italic">Arya</hi> had become a proper name as early as the poems of
                    the Veda, its original and etymological meaning would be of little consequence,
                    had it not been used as an additional argument both in favour of and against the
                    technical use of Arya. Professor Bopp derived ärya from the root ar, to go, or
                    even from ar£, to venerate. The former etymology would give no adequate sense,
                    the latter is impossible. Lassen explains ärya as <hi rend="italic"
                    >adeundus,</hi> like âAeârya, teacher. But in explaining ärya, it must be
                    remembered that it cannot be separated from ärya with a short a, and that in
                    consequence no etymology of ärya can be entertained which does not at the same
                    time account for ärya. This word is used in the Yayurvcda in exactly the same
                    sense as ärya in the Rig-veda. Thus we read, Väyasaneyi-Sanhitä, 20, 17,
                    “Whatever sin we have committed against an Arya, or against a xS <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> udra” <hi rend="italic">(yhk</hi> AeÂüdré yAd Arye
                    yAd énas Aeakrimâ vayäm).</p>
                <p>Here Arya is used in opposition to &gt;Sudra, as Arya was used in the Rig-veda in
                    opposition to Däsa. In the Rig-veda, too, we find at least some traces of arya,
                    used in the sense of arya, and in opposition to däsa, viz., in the compound
                    aryA-patni, having an Arya as husband, as opposed to dâsâ-patnï, having a Däsa
                    as husband.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt, therefore, that ärya, the word which, as soon as the
                    system of the four castes became more firmly established, took the technical
                    meaning of “belonging to the three upper castes,” viz., the Brähmanas,
                    Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, came from ärya, and that in <hi rend="italic">ärya</hi>
                    must be discovered the original etymological meaning of the word.</p>
                <p>Here it is of great importance to observe, that ärya is not only used as a
                    comprehensive title of the three upper castes, but also as the special name of
                    one of them, viz., the third caste, the householders or cultivators of the
                    soil.</p>
                <p>InVä^-Sani/dtä, XXVI. 2, it can mean nothing but Vaisya, a man of the third
                    class, for it is used together with Brahman, Räyanya, and &gt;Sudra. It is
                    therefore not the commentator only, as Dr Roth says, who here gives the meaning
                    of Vaisya to the word ärya, but, from the context itself, it can have no other
                    meaning in that passage. This meaning is still clearer in a passage from the
                    Lätyäyana Sütras, IV. 3, 6. Here it is said that some sacrificial^ act should be
                    performed, primarily by jn Arya, but if no Ärya is forthcoming, then by any
                    Arya, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> either by a Brähmana or Kshatriya (Aryäbhäve
                    yaΛ kas Ä-äryo vamaÄ. Comment, yadi vaisyo na labhyate <hi rend="italic"
                    >yah</hi> kas Aeâryo varna/i syät, brähmano vä kshatriyo vä).</p>
                <p>Päjzini (III. 1, 103) distinctly ascribes to ärya the meaning of Vaisya and
                    master; in IV. 1, 49, the 7th Värttika distinguishes between Arya and Kshatriya;
                    and what is still more important, both the author of a Värttika to Pän., III.
                    1,103, and the author of the Phii-sütras, state that when ärya means Vaisya, it
                    has the accent on the first syllable, like ärya.</p>
                <p>Having thus traced the connection of ärya and Arya, both in form and meaning, we
                    have now to consider how <hi rend="italic">drya</hi> came to mean Vaisya.
                    Vaisya, is formed from vis, house, settlement, like ärya and Arya, from ar. We
                    have also vesyàm in the Veda, meaning, as it seems, family or clan. Vaisya,
                    meant a householder, and vis also, plural visaÄ, is frequently used in the Veda
                    as a name for people. Other old names for people in the Veda are kshιti, a
                    dwelling and a dweller, from kshi, to dwell; Greek, κτι in <hi rend="italic"
                    >άμφι.-</hi><hi rend="italic">κτiove&lt;s</hi>; or krishri ploughing or
                    ploughers.</p>
                <p>If, therefore, there was a Sanskrit word <hi rend="italic">ar,</hi> meaning
                    earth, then Arya, in the sense of landholder, or country man, would have been
                    formed regularly like KshAmya, <hi rend="italic">χθ0vιo&lt;s,</hi> from kshAm,
                    <hi rend="italic">χθων,</hi> earth; like gAvya, from go, cow, nArya, from nAr,
                    man. Now ar, in the sense of earth, does not occur in Sanskrit; but that such a
                    word existed is proved by its derivatives. The Greek epα in <hi rend="italic"
                    >tpaζe</hi> would correspond to a Sanskrit irä, which irä again stands to ir,
                    like kshudhä, hunger, to kshudh. Finally, ir must be traced back to a radical
                    ar, the change of a to i being analogous to that of Sk. pitar, father, as
                    compared with <hi rend="italic">τraτηp,</hi> pater, Goth, fad ar.</p>
                <p>The question now arises, whether irä or ir ever occurs in Sanskrit as a name of
                    earth. The native dictionaries, such as the Amarakosha, assign that meaning to
                    irä, and to ilä, and the latter form occurs in the famous name of Ilävrita
                    (explained as ilä prithivï vritä yena), the district of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ilä,</hi> the centre of yambudvïpa or India, &lt;7ambudvipa itself <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0735-0674"/> being the centre of the seven great continents of
                    the world (Vishnu-Puräna, B. II. cap. 2).</p>
                <p>In the Big-veda irä occurs but once, and there, V. 83, 4, it has the meaning of
                    food springing from the earth. “Food is produced for every being, when Paryanya
                    quickens the earth with seed” (ira visvasmai bhüvanäya yâyate yât paryânyaA
                    prithivïm rétasâ âvati).</p>
                <p>Here irä cannot mean simply <hi rend="italic">“a</hi> liquid, a draught, feast,
                    particularly a draught of milk;” for the simile shows that the rain is taken as
                    seed, and that from it the food (ira) is supposed to spring (yäyate).</p>
                <p>In another passage in the Atharva-veda, IV. 11, 10, irä may mean earth, but the
                    sense is doubtful. If it be asked how irä, originally meaning earth, could take
                    the meaning of food, we must remember the tendency of ancient language to mix up
                    cause and effect, the producer and the produced. Irä, meaning originally earth,
                    would be used in many circumstances as the food and sustenance supplied by the
                    earth, just as gauA, cow, in the Veda is used, not only for milk, but even for
                    leather.</p>
                <p>The adjective irävat means possessed of nourishment, nourishing. Anira means
                    without food, and anirä amïvâ seems to be a name for famine. In one place,
                    Rig-veda, IX. 97,17, i/ävat stands for irävat; vrishrim naÂ arsha divyâm
                    yigatnùm ïZâvatîm, “Give us the heavenly, streaming, fruitful rain.”</p>
                <p>Considering the antiquity of the name arya, we may refer its origin to a period
                    in the history of the Aryan language, when the primitive substantive ar was
                    still used instead of the later *arä, irä, <hi rend="italic">εpα.</hi> As from
                    <hi rend="italic">χaμaζε</hi> we should be justified in postulating the former
                    existence not only of χ&lt;ψα, earth, but even of a more primitive substantive
                    χα/x, which is actually preserved in <hi rend="italic">χθων,</hi> so from <hi
                    rend="italic">Zpaζε,</hi> we conclude the former existence not only of <hi
                    rend="italic">ερa,</hi> but also of a substantive <hi rend="italic">εp,</hi> Sk.
                    ar.</p>
                <p>Whether ärya means born of the earth, or holding, cultivating, possessing the
                    earth, in either case such a name finds ample analogies in the names by which
                    the early dwellers on the earth spoke of themselves. It is not in modern
                    languages only that people call those of their own country, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Landsmann,</hi> countryman, but in Greek, too, γψ'τyς is used in that sense,
                    while γecτ-ωv, equally derived from <hi rend="italic">γη,</hi> means neighbour.
                    The Latin vicinus, neighbour, is derived from vicus, the Greek, <hi
                    rend="italic">dικoς,</hi> the Sanskrit, vesa; all connected with the Sanskrit
                    vis, dwelling or dweller, the synonym of ärya in Sanskrit. In Gothic, gaujan, a
                    countryman, is derived from gauja, land, probably connected with <hi
                    rend="italic">χaμ</hi> in χα∕x-2-ξ∈. Connected with this same <hi rend="italic"
                    >χa</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi rend="italic">(χθων,
                    χθαμαλός)</hi> is the Gothic guma(n), man; Lithuanian, zmôn-es, plur., men; and
                    the Latin, hemönes (ne-hemo ≈ nemo), and homines, men, not derived from humus,
                    but from an older nominal base, ham, hem, or horn.</p>
                <p>Mythology also supplies several instances showing that man was conceived as born
                    of the earth, the son and then the lord of the earth, made of dust, and meant to
                    “till the ground from whence he was taken.” Erechtheus or Erichthonios (both
                    chtheus and chthonios point to <hi rend="italic">χaμ,),</hi> the national hero
                    of the Athenians, worshipped in the oldest shrine on the Acropolis, was
                    represented as <hi rend="italic">γηγενής</hi> or <hi rend="italic">αυτόχθων</hi>
                    (Her., VIII. 55), while Homer <hi rend="italic">(il.,</hi> II. 548) says of him
                    that the Earth bore him (τεκε δέ ζείδωρος <hi rend="italic">apovpd).</hi> Hellen
                    is the son of Pyrrha, and Pyrrha, the red, was the oldest name of Thessaly. The
                    Germans derive their race from Mannus, who was the son of Tuisco, the heavenly,
                    who was the son of the Earth.</p>
                <p>The root ar, which as a substantive supplied the oldest names for earth, took in
                    its verbal application the meaning of ploughing, at least among the members of
                    the northwestern branch, Gr., <hi rend="italic">Spo-τpov,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >àpo</hi><hi rend="italic">-τηρ, άρό-ω</hi>; Lat., ar-ä-re, ar-ä-trum, ar-ä-tor;
                    Goth., ar-jan, to ear; Lith., ar-ti, to plough; Old Slav., oralo, plough; Irish,
                    airim, I plough, arathar, plough. In the south-eastern branch it took the
                    technical meaning of ploughing the sea, Sanskrit, ari-tram, meaning rudder,
                    never plough (c∕. <hi rend="italic">κvp,aτa τεμvειv</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >άρουραν τίρ-νειν).</hi> Yet the meaning of moving, stirring up, belonged to the
                    root ar from the beginning, and though we ought not to derive *ar, *arä, irä,
                    εpα, from a root ar, to plough, as little as homo from humus, we may well
                    understand how ar, as the broken, reclaimed, arable land could be used, even
                    before the Aryan separation, as one of the names of earth.</p>
                <p>The common etymology which would assign to ârya the meaning of “belonging to the
                    faithful” (Roth) is untenable, because arya, with the short a and accent on the
                    last syllable, does not mean faithful or devoted, and it is extremely doubtful
                    whether ari, from which aryâ is said to be derived, occurs anywhere in the Veda
                    with the meaning of desirous, devoted, or faithful. But even if it did, it would
                    be impossible to leave out of consideration the name ârya, meaning simply
                    landholder, Vaisya, without any admixture of the meaning of faithful or devoted.
                    The national name, ärya, comes directly from this ârya, landholder, and ârya,
                    landholder, comes from ar, land, not from ari, which means enemy. To distinguish
                    aryâ, as a term of honour, in the sense of lord or master, from ârya, the mere
                    appellative, a change of accent was admitted, which is recognised by the
                    earliest grammarians who mention aryâ, lord, as distinguished from ârya,
                    landlord, while no native authority ever assigns to arya, still less to ari, the
                    meaning of faithful.</p>
                <p>Arya and Ârya, as national names, can be traced from India to Persia. In the
                    Avesta, <hi rend="italic">airya</hi> means venerable, and is at the same time
                    the name of the people. The first country created by Ormuzd or Ahuramazda is
                    called in the Avesta, Airyanem vaëyô, <hi rend="italic">Arianum semen.</hi> The
                    whole extent of country occupied by the worshippers of Ormuzd is also called
                    Airyä. As opposed to the Aryan clans (airyäo dainhävo), we hear in the Avesta of
                    the un-Aryan clans (anairyäo dainhävo), and the same name is contained in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Άναριάκαι</hi> of Strabo, a people and town on the frontiers
                    of Hyrcania. Greek geographers use the name of Ariana in a wider sense than the
                    Avesta. All the country between the Indian Ocean in the south and the Indus on
                    the east, the Hindu-Kush and Paropamisus in the north, the Caspian gates,
                    Karamania, and the mouth of the Persian Gulf in the west, is included by Strabo
                    under the name of Ariana; Bactria is called by him the ornament of the whole of
                    Ariana. As the Zoroastrian religion spread westward, Persia, Elymais, and Media,
                    all claimed the Aryan title. Hellanicus, who wrote before Herodotus, gives Aria
                    as a name of Persia. Herodotus attests that the Medians were called Arii; and
                    even for the northernmost part of Media, Atropatene, the name of Ariania has
                    been preserved by Stephanus Byzantinus. Even Elymais has been supposed to be
                    derived from Ailama, a modification of Airyama. That airya was considered a name
                    of honour we see from the cuneiform inscriptions. There Darius calls himself
                    Ariya and AriyaHtra, an Aryan, and of Aryan descent. The same element enters
                    into many historical Persian names, Ariaramnes, Ariobarzanes, &amp;c. When after
                    centuries of foreign invasion and occupation Persia rose again under the sceptre
                    of the Sassanians to the rank of a national kingdom, the kings, the worshippers
                    of Masdanes, called themselves again in their inscriptions, Kings of the Aryan
                    and un-Aryan races, Irän va Anirän, <hi rend="italic">Άριάνων καί
                    Α,ναριάνων.</hi> Hence the modern name of Persia, Irân.</p>
                <p>In the name of Armenia the same element of arya has been supposed to exist. The
                    old name of the country is Armina, and its etymology is doubtful. In the
                    language of Armenia, however, ari exists, used in the widest sense <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n736/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0736-0675"/> for Aryan or Iranian, and also with the meaning
                    of brave.</p>
                <p>More westward still traces of the name have been discovered in Aghovan, the name
                    of the Albanians on the border of the Caspian Sea, the gh being the
                    representation of an original r or 1. In the Caucasus itself the only class
                    speaking an Iranian language, the Os of Ossethi, call themselves Iron.</p>
                <p>Along the Caspian and in the country washed by the Oxus and Yaxartes, Aryan and
                    non-Aryan tribes were mingled together. Their wars find their poetical record in
                    the Persian epic, the Shahnameh, describing the feuds and friendships between
                    Iran and Turan. Many Scythian names, preserved by Greek writers, have an Aryan
                    character. Beyond the Oxus, in Transoxiana, too, people are mentioned under the
                    name of Ariacae and Antariani. Here, however, all certain traces of the word, as
                    a geographical term, vanish. We have indeed Aria as an old name of Thrace, and
                    on the Vistula we meet a German tribe called Arii; but nothing is known of the
                    origin of these names, and no conclusions should be built on them.</p>
                <p>It should be mentioned that some scholars (Curtius) connect the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">apιστo&lt;s</hi> with Sanskrit arya, though deriving it from a
                    different root; -while others (Pictet) recognise arya in the Irish er, good,
                    brave, hero. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. μ. μ.)</hi></p>
