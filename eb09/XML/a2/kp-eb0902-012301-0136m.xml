                <p><label type="entry">ANTHROPOMORPHISM</label> is a term used in theological
                    writings to denote the figure by which words expressing human organs and
                    activities are applied to the divine Being; in short, it is the conception and
                    representation of God as possessed of corporeal and human properties. Originally
                    and literally the word implied only the ascribing to God a physical form
                    resembling the human body, and consequently included under it all forms of
                    expression which attribute to Him the exercise of physical organs and senses.
                    But its meaning was soon extended so as to comprehend all representations of God
                    which require Him either to be in himself corporeally extended, or to possess a
                    corporeal body as the necessary condition of His activity. In this wider sense
                    all theories were designated anthropomorphic, which identified God with light or
                    the physical universe, or which placed alongside of Him a primeval, uncreated
                    matter.</p>
                <p>Primitive ideas of God are necessarily framed by man from the analogy of his own
                    nature. He is, however, able to represent God to himself under the analogy of
                    his mental or spiritual, as well as under that of his material nature. This more
                    refined form was called anthropo-pathism, and is that mode of contemplating the
                    divine attributes founded on the analogy of God to the human spirit All forms of
                    expression which ascribe to God passions, intelligence, or volition, rest
                    ultimately upon this supposed analogy. In modern theology and philosophy, it is
                    this mode of thought that usually receives the name of anthropomorphism.</p>
                <p>Anthropomorphism is inseparable from early religion. The first dim intuition of
                    God as the ruler of the universe, on whom we depend, cannot at an early time be
                    seized in all its purity by reason. Sense and imagination are developed before
                    reason, and in semi-barbarous intelligences completely overbalance it. The
                    object of their faith is not God himself, but God as manifested in nature and
                    history. It is only through ideas derived from sensible objects and elevated by
                    the imagination that man can clothe his primitive thought of God with attributes
                    that enable him to realise it, to bring it home to himself. He must represent
                    God as in all respects like himself, superior only in power. The very words by
                    which alone he can give expression to the first workings of his consciousness of
                    God carry with them a sensible meaning, and hence react powerfully on the
                    development of his belief. They imperceptibly fix attention upon the physical
                    facts involved in them, and their merely symbolic use is forgotten. Hence arise
                    myths. Even among peoples in whom the growth of the religious consciousness was
                    extraordinarily favoured, strong traces of anthropomorphism are to be found. In
                    the Hebrew literature there is a prevailing anthropomorphic idea of God. He is
                    represented as seeing, hearing, smelling; as having a visible, corporeal
                    presence; as hating, loving, and repenting. Although the pure idea of God as a
                    spirit, as the very essence of being, is distinctly recognised and insisted upon
                    by the prophets and lawgivers, the people demanded a visible symbol, a sensible
                    emblem of their faith. Great part of the ceremonial law is taken up with the
                    attempt to reconcile this desire for visible symbol with the purer requirements
                    of their faith. Christian thought freed itself completely from the yoke of this
                    crude anthropomorphism by its fundamental axiom that God is a spirit. Theology
                    since then has had to steer its course with care between two opposite
                    tendencies: one striving to attain to a living personal community with God
                    through Christ, and thereby running the risk of introducing foreign elements
                    into the idea of God; the other, from undue fear of anthropomorphism, tending to
                    reduce the idea of God to a blank negation, a substance without qualities. In
                    the history of the church these tendencies appeared at a very early period. In
                    the Clementine homüies, but particularly in Tertullian (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adv. Praxean,</hi> c. vii.; <hi rend="italic">De Came Christi,</hi> c. xi.)
                    there is distinct anthropomorphism. Tertullian declares that nothing can have
                    real being that is not extended, corporeal; God, therefore, he seems to identify
                    with an ethereal being of light. An example of the finer form in which human
                    affections are ascribed to God may be found in Lactantius <hi rend="italic">(De
                    Ira Dei,</hi> c. ii.) The Alexandrian theologians, from their philosophical
                    training, were specially opposed to anthropomorphism, but in their hands the
                    danger of the opposite tendency is seen. According to some of them, we know God
                    only by negation,—we know what He is not, not what He is. Others <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Irenaeus, Novatian) declare that all the predicates of
                    God are only in image; and that, from the finitude of our minds, we must use
                    terms expressing not God’s nature, but our own ignorance. Phrases in Scripture
                    which seemed to be anthropomorphic were explained by the Fathers as revelations
                    of God in such a way as to be intelligible to us. This revelation was called
                    (see Chrysostom, <hi rend="italic">Hom.</hi> iii. c. 3) condescension or divine
                    economy.</p>
                <p>The church itself was not free from anthropomorphism of the crudest type. In the
                    2d century Melito, bishop of Sardis, wrote a book concerning the corporeity of
                    God, and in the 4th century Audaeus, in Mesopotamia, held <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n137/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0137-0124"/> similar views, and had many followers. In the
                    Middle Ages the question gradually merged into the more philosophical one of the
                    relation between reason and faith. In modern theology the problem again appears,
                    but its aspect is completely philosophical. Philosophy, indeed, has never ceased
                    to concern itself with this very question. Xenophanes mocked the
                    anthropomorphism of his countrymen; Aristotle denied to the gods ethical virtue
                    and the possession of emotions or passions; he allowed to them only a life of
                    intellectual speculation. The Epicureans thought the gods lived in complete
                    quiescence, and concerned themselves not at all with the affairs of men (see
                    Lucretius, ii. 646). Philo exhibits very strongly the tendency to reduce the
                    Deity to a lifeless abstraction, whose attributes are only negatively known. In
                    modern philosophy, Descartes attempted to settle the problem, by affirming that
                    any attributes in us which involve limitation or imperfection cannot be ascribed
                    to God, but that attributes which do not imply imperfection can be predicated of
                    Him. Spinoza is one of the strongest opponents of any form of anthropomorphism,
                    and from him the modern aspect of the question may be said to proceed. He
                    brought clearly to light the fundamental difficulty, the reconciliation of the
                    infinite and absolute nature of God with any attribute whatsoever; for
                    attribute, as such, implies negation, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> limitation.
                    Spinoza dismisses as anthropomorphic the idea of God as an intelligence, as free
                    to act, and as ruling the world, and thus destroys the ideas of design in nature
                    and of providence. The consequences of this theory on questions relating to the
                    personality of God, miracles, prayer, &amp;c., have been worked out very fully
                    in the most recent times.</p>
                <p>Thus the real problem at the root of the question as to the legitimacy of
                    anthropomorphic modes of thought, is the philosophical one of the limits of
                    human intelligence, of the relation between the divine thought in itself and in
                    nature and human intelligence. A long line of philosophic thinkers affirm the
                    impossibility of human intelligence penetrating the nature of the divine, and
                    point out our inability to solve the many contradictions which arise in the
                    attempt to do so. According to them, we can only think of God by analogy; our
                    ideas of Him must be anthropomorphic, but they are at the same time known to be
                    entirely symbolical. The best known representatives of this mode of thought are
                    Bishop Browne and the late Dean ManseL</p>
