                    and comfort the people by holding forth the speedy restoration of the Davidic
                    kingdom of Messiah. Attaching itself to the national hope, it proclaimed the
                    impending of a glorious future, in which Israel, freed from her enemies, should
                    enjoy a peaceful and prosperous life under her long wished for Deliverer. The
                    old prophets became the vehicle of these utterances. Revelations sketching the
                    history of Israel and of heathenism are put into their mouths. The prophecies
                    take the form of symbolical images and marvellous visions. As the old remained
                    unfulfilled in the progress of events, and doubts arose about their
                    truthfulness, it was necessary to give them a new turn and a more correct
                    interpretation. Working in this fashion upon the basis of well-known writings,
                    imitating their style, and artificially reproducing their substance, the authors
                    naturally adopted the anonymous. The difficulty was increased by their having to
                    paint as future, events actually near, and to fit the manifestation of a
                    personal Messiah into the history of the times. Hence apocalyptists employed
                    obscure symbols and mysterious pictures, veiling the meaning that it might not
                    be readily seen. The artificial imitative character of their productions caused
                    certain peculiarities; and the main object was attained by fastening the spirit
                    of their contemporaries on the immediate fulfilment of their highest
                    aspirations. From the intentionally dark imagery enfolding the ideas, it is
                    difficult to discover the exact times of their appearance and the historical
                    interpretation.</p>
                <p>The earliest of such apocalypses is the canonical book of Daniel, in which an old
                    seer in the Chaldean captivity is employed to portray the oppressions of the
                    Jews under Antiochus Epiphanes. This was the model for all later ones. The
                    literature in question was not confined to the Jews. Christians not only used
                    the productions in which the Messiah was described after the Jewish fashion, but
                    composed similar ones themselves,—Jewish Christians in particular. Here the
                    Apocalypse of John is the noblest example, and deserves the honour of naming the
                    entire range of literature.</p>
                <p>The most obvious division of apocalyptic works is that <pb break="no"

                    This, however, cannot be carried out with exactness because of later
                    interpolations, proceeding from Christians who used the Jewish prophecies with
                    the object of making them more suitable. But it is not easy to trace the extent
                    of subsequent elaborations; and we have only to rely on probable conjecture.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Jewish Apocalyptic.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Enoch.—</hi> Under the name of this antediluvian patriarch a
                    book exists which is quoted in the epistle of Jude. After it had disappeared,
                    except the fragments preserved by ecclesiastical writers, it was found in
                    Ethiopia among the Abyssinians, and published by Laurence in 1821; subsequently
                    by Dillmann in 1851, to which the latter scholar added a German translation in
                    1853. The book has been divided into five parts, exclusive of an introduction
                    and a conclusion. The first contains an account of the fall of the angels, and
                    their intercourse with the daughters of men producing a race of giants, with the
                    consequences of such apostacy; followed by a description of Enoch’s travels
                    through heaven and earth under the guidance of holy angels, who explain to him
                    the mysteries of the visible and invisible world (chapters vi.-xxxvi.) The
                    “second vision of wisdom” is occupied with a description of the mysteries
                    belonging to the heavenly kingdom, the angel-world, the Messiah, the growth and
                    completion of His kingdom, the blessedness of the elect, and the condemnation of
                    the unbelieving (xxxvii-lxxi.) The third part is astronomical and
                    physical,including an account of the movements of the stars, the sun, and the
                    moon; of the four winds, and various earthly objects (lxxii.-lxxxii.) The fourth
                    part describes two dream visions shadowing forth the history of man, from his
                    origin to the completion of the Messianic kingdom (lxxxiii-xci.) The fifth
                    contains a series of admonitory discourses addressed by Enoch to his own family
                    in the first place, and then to all inhabitants of the earth (xcii·-cv.) Several
                    appendices are subjoined containing a narrative of the wonders which happened at
                    Noah’s birth, and a writing of Enoch’s about the future retribution of the just
                    and unjust (cvi.-cviii.)</p>
                <p>The work contains much curious matter about the secrets and powers both of the
                    visible and invisible world. Besides its historical views which relate mainly to
                    the past, present, and future of the Jewish people, as also to heathen kings and
                    potentates, much of the legendary and hagadic is interspersed. Daniel’s seventy
                    weeks, reaching down to the Messianic age, are changed into seventy periods of
                    heathen rulers. The writer has withal a religious spirit. He is a strict
                    moralist, warning and threatening. His imagination is vivid, but incapable of
                    sublimity. The sweep of his prophetic vision is extensive. He has poetic force
                    and rigour. The work is an interesting product of pre-Christian Judaism,
                    multifarious, artificial, rabbinising.</p>
                <p>The document consists not only of the prophecy of Enoch, but of extracts from a
                    Noah-prophecy interspersed. The latter are found in places often unsuitable,
                    consisting of chapters liv. 7-lv. 2, lx., lxv.-lxix. 25; perhaps also of xx. and
                    lxx. In cvi, cvii. ·the same hand may be partly traced. Setting aside these
                    insertions, the book of Enoch itself seems to be composed of three documents,
                    the oldest of which is chapters xxxrii.-lxxi. The other two are not easily
                    collected, but the chapters xci. 3-cv. have the clearest claim to belong to the
                    second, and xxxiii,-xxxri., lxxxv.-xc. to the third. The rest is all uncertain.

                    Hilgenfeld contends that chaptersxxxvii.-lxxi. proceed from a Christian

                    arguments are insufficient. Still more improbable is the hypothesis of Volkmar,

                    believe, however, in opposition to Dillmann, that they have been interpolated by
                    a Jewish Christian, since the christology is higher than what Judaism produced;
                    while the eschatology and angelology are developed in a manner which savours of
                    Christianity. Thus, in the 51st and 62d chapters the Messiah is described as
                    sitting on the throne of His glory and taking part in the judgment, while He is
                    also called the Son of woman, the Son of man. To make Messiah the judge of
                    mankind, either as the delegate of the Father, or together with Him, is not a
                    Jewish, but a Christian idea. This differs from the representation in the 90th
                    chapter, where he is symbolised by a white bull with great horns, whom all the
                    beasts of the field and all the birds of heaven feared and entreated at all
                    times. All races are to be changed into white bulls; the first among them became
                    a great animal; and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced over them and all the bulls.
                    Here Messiah is simply the chief of God’s people, elevated above the rest, but
                    still of the same nature with them, haring no share in the judgment, or in
                    founding the new church of God. He comes into the description by way of
                    appendix, as it were, as though the author could not well omit all notice of
                    Him. His part is entirely subordinate. In the 105th chapter, which, with the
                    next three, show traces of Christian influence, the Messiah is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Son of God,—</hi> an appellation which seems to carry the idea of
                    His person beyond Judaism, especially in connection with that in the 62d
                    chapter, <hi rend="italic">Son of woman,</hi> for the two come very near the
                    idea of an incarnation. The whole work presents no trace of Rome as a power
                    dangerous to Israel, so that the latest parts cannot be brought down far into
                    the 1st century. The book had a very limited circulation among the author’s
                    countrymen. They do not quote it. It proceeded from a private individual, who
                    may have belonged to a small circle or sect such as the Essenes. But Jude cites
                    it. It has been translated into English by Laurence; into German, but chiefly
                    from Laurence’s English, by Hoffmann; and much more correctly by Dillmann in
                    1853. The translation of the last mentioned scholar has superseded those of his
                    predecessors. See also Ewald’s <hi rend="italic">Abhandlung,</hi><hi

                    of Esdras,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Prophecy of Ezra,</hi> originally
                    written in Greek, but known now only in versions,—Latin, Ethiopie, Syriac,
                    Arabic, and Armenian. The whole consists of a series of visions, which Ezra, who
                    is put unchronologically into the 30th year of the Babylonian captivity, is
                    supposed to have had. The questions that troubled the seer arose out of the
                    state in which the Jews were at the time. They were deeply oppressed and
                    afflicted. The heathen had trodden them down to the ground. Why had the promises
                    of God to His own people been unfulfilled? Was not Israel still the chosen race,
                    though often sinning? Were they not better than the heathen? The Romans had <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n189/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0189-0176"/> destroyed Jerusalem, and the Jews were scattered
                    to the four winds; so that the writer was deeply perplexed by the establishment
                    of a heathen power over the Jews, involving an indefinite delay of the Messianic
                    kingdom, or an apparent hopelessness as to its inauguration. Heathenism
                    triumphed over Judaism, rending it to pieces. What had become of the divine
                    faithfulness? The first vision (ch. iv.-v. 20) contains an angelic answer to the
                    questions which the seer had painfully pondered, as in the 3d chapter. After
                    being reminded of his inability to comprehend God’s ways, the signs of the end
                    are given. The second vision (v. 21-vi. 34) is similar. The third vision (vi.
                    35-ix. 25) and the fourth (ix. 27-x. 59) refer to the Messianic future. The
                    fifth, relating to an eagle coming up out of the sea (x. 60-xii. 59), describes
                    the Roman empire, its destination and period of duration; the sixth (ch. xiii),
                    the setting up of Messiah’s kingdom; and the seventh (ch. xiv.), an account of
                    Ezra’s re-writing the holy books. It is very difficult to discover the date of
                    this singular book, and the question is not yet satisfactorily settled, though
                    many critics have investigated it. One thing is pretty clear, that the
                    destruction of Jerusalem had taken place, and that Christianity had passed its
                    incipient stage, exercising some influence even upon Judaism. Original sin, a
                    dying Messiah, a general resurrection, &lt;fcc., point to a Christian origin; so
                    that the passages in which these features appear, and others too, were probably
                    interpolated. Hilgenfeld even thinks that vi. 18-vii. 45 were interpolated by a
                    Christian at the commencement of the 3d century,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Messias</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Judoeorum,</hi> p. 49, &amp;c.</p></note> but his arguments are
                    not cogent, as Langen has shown. As the data for determining the time lie
                    chiefly in the interpretation of the eagle’s wings and heads, the diversity of
                    opinion is,increased. Perhaps the 30th year after the ruin of the city (iii. 1)
                    points to the like time after the Roman conquest of Jerusalem. The six wings of
                    the eagle on the right side are the six Julian emperors; the six on the left,
                    are Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vindex, Nymphidius, Piso; and the three heads, the
                    Flavian emperors. Either Titus’s or Domitian’s reign should be fixed upon;
                    probably the latter, about 96 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Hilgenfeld assigns
                    30 B.C.; Volkmar seems nearer the truth who gives it to 97 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    interpretations are far fetched. It is impossible to tell whether the author
                    lived at Rome or in Egypt. The few internal evidences bearing on the point
                    favour the latter.</p>
                <p>The poetic excellence of this production is much greater than that of Enoch It
                    is, indeed, below the Apocalypse of Daniel; but its merit is considerable. In
                    modern times Messrs Frere and Irving gave it a place beside Daniel and St
                    John,—strangely combining the prophecies of the three into one, as though all
                    were formed upon the same plan, and referred to the same events. Chapters i.,
                    ii., and xv., xvi., which need not be separated, seem to have been written by
                    Egyptian Christians; the first two chapters about 201 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d</hi>; the last two about 263 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> according to

                    Like the Fourth Book of Esdras, these were also written in Greek, but exist only

                    in recent times are Volkmar and Hilgenfeld; but the list since Whiston and
                    Sender is very copious.</p>

                    γeveσις,</hi><hi rend="italic">parva</hi><hi rend="italic">Genesis.—</hi> This
                    work is apocalyptic only in part, though called the Apocalypse of Moses in the
                    notices of it by George Syncellus and George Cedrenus. In the form of a
                    revelation made to Moses during his stay on Mount Sinai, it professes to be
                    intended for future races, and to contain prophetic admonitions relating to
                    coming times. It is predominantly historical and chronological, beginning with
                    the old histories of the creation. From the commencement of the world till the
                    entrance into Canaan is divided into 50 jubilee years; and every event is
                    arranged according to jubilees, years of weeks, and years. Later Jewish ideas
                    are transferred to earlier times, especially to the patriarchal; and difficult
                    questions connected with the ancient worship are solved. Traditional views and
                    hagadic materials appear with Jewish ritual and exclusiveness. The author was an
                    energetic Palestinian Jew, conversant with the history of his people, and
                    conservative, who meant to confirm them in attachment to the faith, by narrating
                    their past fortunes over again, and keeping them alive to their principles. Amid
                    the multifarious contents it is not easy to trace the precise origin of the
                    book, though it is easy to see that the author was a patriotic Jew, whose object
                    was to keep his countrymen firm in their religion at a time when it was in great
                    peril both from without and within. It has been assigned to an Alexandrian, an
                    Essene, and a Samaritan source, none of which opinions can be maintained. The
                    writer has respect to different sects and parties in Judaism, to the various
                    tendencies existing within the old religion when he wrote; and he endeavours to
                    mediate between them by making concessions in this direction and that,—to
                    conciliate and blend them together, that they may be more united against
                    anti-Jewish influences. Hence Samaritan, Essene, Sadducean, and Pharisean
                    peculiarities are found in the work. There is little doubt that he was an
                    orthodox Jew, who had in view the consolidation of Judaism against heathenism
                    and Christianity—the uniting of all sects and shades of belief in the common
                    faith of Levitical monotheism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    p. 523, &amp;c.</p></note> It is worthy of remark that the Hebrew text he used
                    agrees with the Samaritan more than the Masoretic, though he himself was not a
                    Samaritan, else he would not have mentioned Zion among the four holy places, to
                    the exclusion of Gerizim. The date is the 1st century of our era; and before the
                    destruction of the temple, as may be inferred from the first chapter. The writer
                    seems to have used the book of Enoch, for he speaks in the fourth chapter of
                    Enoch writing out the signs of heaven according to the order of their months.
                    There are also coincident passages which go to prove the same thing. And there
                    is evidence that the writer of the Testaments of the patriarchs employed our
                    book; though this does not necessarily take the latter’s origin into the 1st
                    century. So, too, the Fourth Book of Esdras was used, as we infer from what is
                    said in relation to Abraham, Esdras iii. 14, &amp;c., and Jubilees xii. The date
                    cannot be fixed nearer than about 50 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi><note

                    mystic and supernatural in its tendency; its angelology less developed. Jerome
                    refers to it twice by name, and Syncellus thought highly of it. It had been
                    rendered into Greek before the time of Jerome. Dillmann has published the

                    brief and unpoetical. But it seems to have been large at first, for according to
                    Nicephorus, it consisted of 1400 stichs, while the Jubilees had only 1100.<note

                    sequel to the Jubilees, but it seems to have proceeded from a different writer,
                    though he lived at the same time. Internal evidence points to its composition
                    after the death of Herod the Great, and before the destruction of Jerusalem. In
                    the third chapter Pompey the Great is clearly depicted; but there is no trace of
                    Jerusalem’s overthrow. The author was a Jew who wrote in Hebrew or Aramaean, and
                    his production was afterwards translated into Greek and Latin. We need not
                    assign him to any other place than Palestine, though Fritzsche conjectures that
                    Rome was his abode. Fragments of the Latin version were first edited from a
                    palimpsest at Milan by Ceriani. The version is by the same hand as that of the
                    Jubilees, for both are found in one MS. and agree in character. The translator
                    may have, therefore, taken the two for the work of the same author. After
                    Ceriani, it has been published by Fritzsche. Hilgenfeld has tried to put it into
                    Greek. The same has been done by Volkmar, Schmidt, and Merx. The ancients
                    believed that Jude borrowed from this work his statement as to the dispute
                    between Michael and the devil about the body of Moses. See Ceriani, <hi

                    disposal of the latter’s body beside that of Abel. This work was first published
                    in Greek by Tischendorf from four MSS. It was afterwards accurately edited from
                    one of these (D in the Ambrosian library at Milan) by Ceriani. But this text is
                    incomplete, wanting chapters xviii,~ XXXV. Tischendorf thinks that Greek is the
                    original, and that its date is about the time of Christ, but it is probably
                    later, though certainly not mediaeval, as Dillmann supposes. The <hi

                    >—</hi> The rise of Jewish apocalyptic literature of a sibylline character
                    probably dates soon after Alexander the Great, when Judaism began to look with a
                    spirit of philosophic inquiry into Greek and Oriental literature, attaching
                    itself to such elements as seemed congenial. A composite product was the result.
                    The Alexandrian Jews were the first to adopt this course by fusing the remnants
                    of Greek sibyllism with their native prophecy. The former seemed to them an
                    indication of an Adamic or Noachic religion which had filtered into heathenism
                    notwithstanding its polytheism. It was a species of natural prophetism, distinct
                    from the priestly oracles, of a more ancient and higher type, in which Jewish
                    gnosis could discover a point of contact, amid its endeavours to trace the
                    pre-Abrahamic religion in the most enlightened Hellenism. As Noah was thought to
                    be the second great progenitor of humanity, who represented the primitive
                    theocratic religion before its division and corruption, the sibyl was his
                    daughter, prophesying of the tower of Babel, and exhorting the people to worship
                    the true God. Her voice was predominatingly threatening, like that of the
                    heathen sibyl, foreshadowing the downfall of paganism. Anti-theocratic kingdoms
                    and cities must be overthrown. There is but one religion, the old Noachic one,
                    which even the heathen sibyl darkly echoed, and her utterances can only be
                    interpreted aright in their relation to the world’s history by the Jewish sibyL
                    Thus Jewish gnosis found support in Hellenism. After using the method and form
                    of the latter in the sibylline oracles, it drew them into a higher region.
                    Uniting them with theosophy and history, it spiritualised them. The prophetic
                    spirit was discerned in the cultus of heathenism, stripped of priestly and
                    polytheistic phenomena. But it was still the main object of the sibyllines to
                    combat heathenism itself, by exposing its idolatry and opposition to the truth,
                    to anticipate its total destruction at the advent of Messiah.</p>
                <p>Under this general name there exists a collection of oracles said to proceed from
                    the sibyl, in which Jewish ideas are promulgated and recommended to the
                    Gentiles. The contents, however, are of a mixed character. Instead of a
                    connected whole written by one person at a specific time, we have a
                    heterogeneous assemblage of materials, Jewish, Christian, and heathen, of
                    earlier and later origin, which must be separated and sifted before they can be
                    assigned to their respective origins.</p>
                <p>Books i., ii., iii. 1-96 are late. The first begins with the creation and fall of
                    man, enumerates the six races, and characterises them, the first after Noah
                    falling in the <pb break="no"

                    sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension; the apostles, and the cessation
                    of prophets. The Hebrews will be oppressed by a Roman king, and be scattered
                    abroad after the destruction of Solomon’s temple. The description is continued
                    in the second book. The world will be shaken throughout, and especially will
                    heathen Rome be destroyed at the time of the tenth race. The whole piece is
                    evidently Christian, for the eschatological ideas rest upon Matthew xxiv., xxv.
                    Hellenic mythology and Hebrew tradition are intermixed with the author’s
                    utterances. The date is obscure. Bleek, with whom Lücke agrees, assumes the 5th
                    century. There are, indeed, late views in the books, such as Christ’s descent
                    into hell to preach the resurrection, the worship of the Virgin, the
                    intercession of the saints for a class of the condemned. It is also true that
                    millennarianism does not appear, and that no Christian writer of the first four
                    centuries cites them. Still the 5th century is too late. We prefer the second

                    at least verses 97-828. It enumerates the kingdoms of the world that followed
                    one another, emphasising the Hebrew one in particular, and mentioning the Roman.
                    Woes are pronounced upon various cities and lands, and the appearance of Messiah
                    is depicted, accompanied with the punishment of the wicked, the downfall of all
                    worldly kingdoms, the conversion of the heathen, and the restoration of Judah to
                    more than former splendour. As the destruction of Carthage by the Romans is
                    alluded to, the date must be after 146 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Various
                    indications point to 124. There is little doubt that the writer was an
                    Alexandrian Jew, whose hopes of a personal Messiah were feeble and vague, for
                    after touching upon a king sent by God from the sun who will put an end to war,
                    and under whose sway Israel will enjoy abundant prosperity, he paints the golden
                    age again without mentioning the king.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> book, which is but a short poem of less than
                    two hundred lines, arranges history according to twelve ages, terminating in the
                    Messianic one. The writer’s descriptions are general. He evinces no decided
                    Jewish sympathies, nor does he utter ideas distinctively Christian. Sinful
                    heathenism in an indefinite way is the chief object of his veiled descriptions.
                    Hence Friedlieb makes him a Jew; Ewald, a Christian. The passages which have
                    been supposed to show either his Christian or Jewish tendencies<note

                    Alexandre,</p></note> are hardly decisive as to the one or the other; and the
                    interpretations of them by Lücke are somewhat strained in support of the strong
                    statement about the Christian character of the contents generally, with which he
                    begins his sketch of the fourth book. Probably he was a Jewish Christian who
                    came out of an Essene circle. The date of his oracle is somewhat later than that
                    of the Apocalypse, since the destruction of the temple is presupposed as well as
                    the eruption of Vesuvius, 79 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The return of a
                    matricidal emperor from beyond the Euphrates to overthrow Rome is also expected.
                    Such allusion to Nero, which is a prominent feature in the Apocalypse, and a few
                    other particulars, incline us to assume Christian authorship, though the absence
                    of evangelical ideas marks a stage not far beyond Judaism. Yet the writer
                    rejects sacrifices. The date may be about 80 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> book presents great difficulty both in
                    separating the component parts, and in assigning them to Jewish or Christian
                    authorship. The absence of ideas characteristic of Judaism or of Christianity
                    marks the poem. Nor is it easy to discover any internal connection, so that the
                    whole might be attributed to the same authorship. The religious views of the
                    author or authors are vaguely expressed. The first part, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> 1-51, appears to be of Christian, the rest, i.e., 52-530, of Jewish
                    origin. The former describes in prophetic language the series of Roman emperors
                    from Julius Caesar to Hadrian. In this way we are brought to the end of
                    Hadrian’s reign as the date, about 138 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The second
                    part, which expresses among other things the hope of a temple to be erected in
                    Egypt, in which sacrifices should be offered, and the people of God should enjoy
                    Messianic happiness, points to a Jew of Alexandria living after the destruction
                    of the temple at Jerusalem, about 80 A.D.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sixth</hi> book contains a short hymn to Jesus the Son of
                    God, touching upon His doctrine, miracles, and death, with a curse on the
                    Sodomite land which platted His crown of thorns. It is curious that the fire at
                    Jordan on the occasion of the baptism of Jesus, and the representation of the
                    dove, vary from the canonical Gospels, though the former appears in the Gospel
                    of the Hebrews. Something of a Gnostic element shows itself here.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> book is a fragmentary collection of oracles
                    loosely connected. The contents are varied. Several pieces treat of Christ;
                    several of the oracles are threatening, some are of the nature of hymns. The
                    baptism at Jordan is mentioned in a peculiar way;<note anchored="true"

                    The allusion to the Persians reigning is indefinite; but it is all the

                    there is a tinge of Gnosticism in the book similar to that of the sixth, they

                    supposes; but whether he was a Jewish Christian is uncertain.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">eighth</hi> book contains a prophecy of the judgment of the
                    world. Rome is coming at length to an end. There is also a summary of the
                    history of Jesus, His life, sufferings, and resurrection. The writer commences
                    with Hadrian, to whom he gives three successors of his house. He is also
                    acquainted with the king of another house, Septimius Severus, in whose days, 948
                    of Rome, the end comes. The date is therefore 211 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    It is curious that Antichrist Nero is here made to come with the third from
                    Hadrian, viz., Commodus. In this oracle occurs the celebrated sibylline
                    acrostic, the initial letters of thirty-four lines (verses 217-250) representing
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">Iησoυς Xpeιστoς</hi> Θeoυ υlos <hi rend="italic"

                    They contain various fragments of prior poems. It is noticeable that a
                    historical insertion about the birth of Jesus Christ from the Virgin occupies an
                    unsuitable place, having been the product of a late time, when the dogma about
                    the mother of God was developed. With this exception the second part of the book
                    belongs to the 2d century. The whole is thoroughly Christian.</p>
                <p>Books xi·-xiv. were discovered in MSS. at Milan and Rome, and published by Mai,

                    that the Christian element appears but little. The writer used the preceding
                    books and heathen oracles besides. The date is uncertain, but cannot be earlier
                    than the 5th centuιy. The eleventh book surveys the history of kings and people,
                    till the death of Cleopatra and the end of the Egyptian kingdom; the twelfth

                    down the sketch to Aureolus. The names of the emperors and rulers are partially
                    disguised, and eventually become unrecognisable. See Friedlieb, <hi

                    this rhetorical production Baruch receives revelations respecting the future of
                    Israel. Though Jerusalem has been destroyed by the Romans, and the calamities of
                    the chosen people seem excessive, the prophet is comforted with the hope of
                    better times, since the Messiah will come shortly to set up his kingdom after
                    the Roman one has been destroyed. Then will be the judgment and the
                    consummation; sinners will be punished, and the righteous rewarded. Part of this
                    production, viz., the epistle of Baruch to the nine tribes and a half (chapters
                    lxxviii.-lxxxvi.), was published in the Paris and London Polyglotte in Syriac
                    and Latin. The Syriac was again edited more correctly by De Lagarde. Whiston
                    translated the Latin into English; and he has been followed by Jolowicz, 1855.
                    The whole book was published from a Syriac MS. in the Ambrosian library by
                    Ceriani, first in a Latin translation<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    written after the destruction of Jerusalem, how long it is difficult to say. The
                    author was acquainted with the Book of Enoch and the Apocalypse of Esdras, for
                    he has many passages which are echoes of sentiments contained in them. He has
                    also later Jewish legends, which point to the 2d century of the Christian era as
                    that in which he wrote; and there is little doubt that Greek was the original.

                    a Palestinian. From its length and wordiness, with the absence of poetic spirit,

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Christian Apocalyptic.</hi></p>
                <p>Christians followed the example of the Jews in using the sibyl as a vehicle of
                    their ideas. Besides referring to the past, which they did mainly with reference
                    to the person and work of Jesus Christ, they looked forward to the destruction
                    of the world-power, and the consummation of all things at the second coming of
                    Christ. They employed to a considerable extent both Jewish and heathen
                    documents, interpolating or modifying them not very strongly. Often content with
                    non-Christian sources, they adapted them but slightly, so that the ideas
                    peculiar to Christianity shine forth dimly. The prophetic form of the Apocalypse
                    does not demand the enunciation of doctrine, but rather a general indication of
                    historic events, or the threatening announcement of destruction to the enemies
                    of God. It deals with the utterance of principles exemplified by kingdoms and
                    their rulers.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Sibyllines.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    vii, viii., xi.-xiv., belong to this head, though they incorporate Jewish as
                    well as heathen pieces with small adaptation.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Apocalypse of Esdras.—</hi> This Greek production
                    resembles the more ancient fourth book of Esdras in some respects. The prophet
                    is perplexed about the mysteries of life, and questions God respecting them. The
                    punishment of the wicked especially occupies his thoughts. Since they have
                    sinned in consequence of Adam’s fall, their fate is considered worse than that
                    of the irrational creation. The description of the tortures suffered in the
                    infernal regions is tolerably minute. At last the prophet consents to give up
                    his spirit to God who has prepared for him a crown of immortality. The
                    composition is feeble and tame, a poor imitation of the ancient Jewish one.
                    There are no internal marks of date in it. It may belong, however, to the 2d or
                    3d centuries of the Christian era. Tischendorf published the Greek text for the
                    first time in his <hi rend="italic">Apocalypses</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Apocryphae.</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Apocalypse of Paul.—</hi> This work contains a
                    description of the things which the apostle saw in heaven and hell. The text, as
                    first published in the original Greek by Tischendorf, consists of fifty-one
                    chapters, but is imperfect. The narratives descend to minute particulars, and
                    possess no force or poetic power. Imitated from the Revelation of St John, their
                    great inferiority is apparent. Internal evidence assigns it to the time of
                    Theodosius, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> about 390 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> Where the author lived is uncertain. Dr Perkins found a Syriac MS. of
                    this Apocalypse, which he translated into English, and printed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of the American Oriental Society,</hi> vol. viii. This
                    version is an enlarged and exaggerated edition of the Greek, which it
                    supplements and illustrates. See Tischendorf’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apocalypses</hi><hi rend="italic">Apocryphae.</hi></p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Apocalypse of John</hi> contains a description of the
                    future state, the general resurrection, and judgment, with an account of the
                    punishment of the wicked, as well as the bliss of the righteous. It appears to
                    be the work of a Jewish Christian, for the bodily appearance of Antichrist is
                    derived from Jewish sources; and there are numerous quotations from the Old
                    Testament, especially from David. The date is late, for the writer speaks of the
                    “venerable and holy images,” as well as “the glorious and precious crosses and
                    the sacred things of the churches,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    century, when such things were first introduced into churches. We cannot put it
                    earlier than the 5th. This Apocalypse was first published by Birch,<note

                    French translation, what is termed a fragment of the apocryphal Revelations of
                    St Bartholomew, and of the history of the religious communities founded by St
                    Pachomius. After narrating the pardon obtained by Adam, it is said that the Son
                    ascending from Olivet prays the Father on behalf of His apostles; who
                    consequently receive consecration from the Father, together with the Son and
                    Holy Spirit—Peter being made archbishop of the universe. The late date of the
                    production is obvious.</p>

                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">The Apocalypse of Daniel</hi> has been published only in
                    part (a little more than the half), by Tischendorf from Greek MSS., in St
                    Mark’s, Venice, and in Paris. The date of the document is determined by the
                    monarch going to Jerusalem to deliver up his kingdom to God, and being succeeded
                    by his four sons, who reside in different and distant cities.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">The Ascension and Vision of Isaiah.—</hi> The first portion
                    of the work called the Ascension of Isaiah in the Ethiopie text, gives an
                    account of Isaiah’s being put to death by the saw, under the reign and at the
                    command of Manasseh. The prophet had had a vision respecting Christ, His
                    crucifixion and ascension, as well as of the general apostacy which should take
                    place in the early churches, of the descent of Berial in the form of a
                    matricidal king, the duration of his reign, the descent of the Lord from heaven
                    to destroy the wicked, and cast the ungodly into the fire. For this vision and
                    prophecy Isaiah is condemned, and dies the death of a martyr (chapters i.-v.)
                    The second part (chapters vi.-xi.) is essentially the same as Isaiah’s vision in
                    iii. 14-iv. 22. The prophet is transported in an ecstatic state into the seven
                    heavens successively, and describes what he sees in each, the chief object being
                    Christ himself. It is not the future of Christianity and of the world which
                    fills the mind of the seer, but the past, the first advent of Christ. The two
                    divisions form distinct works. The first is based on the Jewish legend of
                    Isaiah’s martyrdom, and may be merely the Christian expansion 'of a Jewish
                    writing embodying it. Indeed, with the exception of the Christian interpolations
                    (i. 5, iii. 13-iv. 22), the whole is Jewish. Both Tertullian and Origen knew the
                    martyrdom part of the document. The date must, therefore, be the 2d century. The
                    second, or the <hi rend="italic">Vision</hi> of Isaiah, properly sb called, has
                    a Gnostic colouring. Its christology bears a Docetic stamp. As it presupposes an
                    acquaintance with the first it may have originated in the early part of the 3d
                    century. Epiphanius speaks of it, and gives an extract.<note anchored="true"

                    version, in 1819. The Greek original is lost; and the Latin version, published
                    at Venice in 1522, and again by Gieseler in 1832, is of late origin. Fragments
                    of an older one were printed by Mai in his <hi rend="italic">Veterum,

                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">The Shepherd of</hi><hi rend="italic">Hermas.—</hi> This
                    production belongs in a certain sense to the present class of writings, and is
                    usually reckoned among the apostolic fathers. It is not, however, apocalyptic in
                    the proper acceptation of the epithet, because it wants the form. The
                    apocalyptic idea has a different phase. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Apostolic
                    Fathers.)</hi> The same remark applies to—</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.</hi></p>
                <p>Many apocalyptic writings, both Jewish and Christian, are mentioned in ancient
                    works of which nothing is now known. Time has swept them away beyond recovery.
                    It would be useless to collect the scattered notices of them. Such as wish to
                    see these notices may consult the articles of Dillmann and Hofmann, in the 12th
                    volume of <hi rend="italic">Herzogs</hi><hi rend="italic">Encylclopoedie,</hi>
                    Lucke’s <hi rend="italic">Einleitung,</hi> and the Prolegomena to Tischendorf’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Apocalypses</hi><hi rend="italic">Apocryphae,</hi> where he
                    will find references to other works. Since the very able treatise of Bleek and
                    the valuable publications of Gfrörer, which were followed by the masterly review
                    of the whole subject in Lücke’s second edition, the literature has greatly
                    increased. Hilgenfeld and Volkmar, Ewald and Dillmann, Ceriani and Langen,
                    Fritzsche, Gutschmid, Merx, and others, have thrown welcome light upon it.</p>
                <p>The line between <hi rend="italic">Apocryphal</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apocalyptic</hi> literature is not exact. The works now described are those
                    which properly belong to the latter, and are extant, or have been published, if
                    not entire, at least partially. Notices of many others lost or hidden occur in
                    various sources and catalogues of MSS. belonging to public libraries. The
                    apocalyptic idea passed into the life and belief of the church. It became an
                    element of dogma and of morals, finding expression in works somewhat different
                    from the proper apocalyptic. Taking a millennarian direction, using the typical
                    extensively, developing eschatological ideas more or less fantastic, the
                    apocalyptic element receded before other conceptions to which it had given rise.
                    These, indeed, did not suppress it; they merely shaped and developed it into
                    other forms, widening the sphere of its action, and giving it more realism. (s.
