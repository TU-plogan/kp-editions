                <p><label type="entry">ANNEALING</label> is the process of removing the brittleness
                    peculiar to glass vessels and metal castings immediately after manufacture.
                    Newly-blown glass is so fragile as to be altogether unfit for use; and the
                    common occurrence of the breaking of a lamp-glass on lighting the lamp, or of a
                    tumbler on pouring in hot water, shows the want of proper annealing.</p>
                <p>The process consists generally in heating the vessels up to a red or white heat
                    in a close oven, and allowing them to cool gradually over a space of several
                    hours or even days. The brittleness of rapidly-cooled glass is exhibited by the
                    philosophical toy known as <hi rend="italic">Rupert's drops</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">glass tears,</hi> said to have been first brought over to England
                    by Prince Rupert and exhibited at the court of Charles I. They are small
                    tadpole-shaped pieces of glass, which have been formed by allowing fused glass
                    to drop into water. A pretty hard blow may be given with impunity to the thick
                    part or head of the glass tadpole; but the mere breaking off of the tail causes
                    the whole to fly to pieces, or rather to dust, with a sharp explosion. An
                    illustration of the same kind is given by what are known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bologna phials.</hi> These are vessels of thickish glass about half the size of
                    a common Florence oil-flask, with no apparent flaw or cause of weakness. Though
                    they will stand the shaking of a small bullet within them, yet the shaking of a
                    few particles of sharp sand hardly visible will cause the bottom to fly to
                    pieces. It is the mere scratching of the skin that is fatal; and the explanation
                    is easily found. The particles of the glass have a cohesive polarity which
                    dictates a certain regularity in their arrangement, but which requires some time
                    for its development. When the vessels are suddenly cooled, the surface molecules
                    only can have had time to dispose themselves duly, while those within are kept
                    by this properly formed skin in a highly constrained situation; and it is only
                    so long as the surface film keeps sound that this constraint can be resisted. In
                    the Rupert’s drops it is plainly visible that the interior substance is cracked
                    in every direction, and ready to fly to pieces.</p>
                <p>In the process of annealing the glass is kept for some time in a state
                    approaching fluidity, and admitting of &amp;.</p>

                <p>uniform molecular arrangement throughout. Of course the thicker the glass the
                    more careful must be the annealing and the longer the process; very thin glass
                    requires little or no annealing, because it is, so to speak, all skin; and glass
                    thread requires no such treatment to make it possess the exquisite flexibility
                    of silk.</p>
                <p>The large sheets of plate glass, now used for shop windows require to be very
                    carefully annealed before being ground and polished, otherwise they would be
                    unable to stand the scratching of the surface. Imperfection in this respect is
                    often revealed by the spreading in every direction of a crack once begun. These
                    plates require as long as a fortnight to complete the annealing; and smaller
                    articles from six to sixty hours, according to their thickness and weight</p>
                <p>In the manufacture and working of the various metals, annealing is frequently
                    employed to reduce the brittleness usually resulting from a rapid or important
                    change of molecular structure, such as is produced by hammering, long-continued
                    vibration, rolling, and sudden cooling. The coppersmith who hammers a flat sheet
                    of copper into a vessel of any description he pleases, must leave off hammering
                    at intervals, and anneal the piece of metal to prevent it going to pieces under
                    his blows. The extreme degree of tenuity to which gold is reduced by heating, is
                    attainable only by very frequent and careful heating and slow cooling at each
                    stage of the processes of forging, rolling, and beating</p>
                <p>Perhaps no better example can be given of the importance of annealing in metals
                    that have to be subjected to frequent concussion than the art of die-forging.
                    The matrix, from which the die-punches are impressed, is the product of many
                    months’ labour, and the subject of tender care in its manufacture. Being a mass
                    of steel of considerable dimensions, it is extremely liable to fracture after
                    the operation of hardening, so much so that it Λvill not bear even sudden
                    changes of atmospheric temperature. This brittleness is removed by putting it in
                    water, gradually raised to the boiling-point, and then allowed slowly to cool.
                    The matrix is used, not so often for the stamping of medals and coins directly,
                    as for the manufacture of die-punches, which shall be used to produce any
                    required number of dies exactly like the original matrix. For this purpose a
                    conical plug of fine soft steel is compressed by powerful machinery against the
                    matrix, but in receiving the impression its texture is condensed and hardened,
                    so that the annealing process has to be repeated after every few blows in the
                    die-press, to prevent cracking of the surface Coins, whether gold, silver, or
                    copper, are usually impressed by a single blow, and in their case the blank
                    metal is annealed before coining But in medals, where the design is in bolder
                    relief, a number of blows, sometimes as many as thirty, is required; and in this
                    case it is necessary to anneal after every third blow</p>
                <p>Wheels and axles of railway carriages, from the constant vibration to which they
                    are subjected, become, in course of time, dangerously brittle; and they require
                    to be re-worked and annealed anew to restore the requisite toughness to the
                    material. So also in the processes of metal rolling and wiredrawing, frequent
                    annealing is necessary to allow the cohesive force to produce the most stable
                    arrangement of the particles. The soft metals, such as lead, tin, and zinc, are
                    annealed by immersion in water, which is made to boil and then to cool slowly.
                    Sudden changes of temperature have the effect, almost invariably, of rendering
                    metals brittle. And, as sudden cooling is required to give to steel its peculiar
                    and invaluable hardness, so unfortunately it renders it at the same time brittle
                    as unannealed glass, from the unnatural strain which the inner substance of the
                    metal possesses. Annealing must, therefore, be employed to reduce this molecular
                    strain, and to give the steel a workable flexibility. This is done by raising it
                    to a red heat within a close vessel, and then allowing it gradually to cool.
                    Heating in an <hi rend="italic">open</hi> fire is very injudicious, because the
                    carbon which enters the steel as an element combines with the oxygen of the air
                    to the detriment of the quality of the steel Usually steel goods are heated in
                    an iron oven with charcoal powder, or placed in the heart of hot cinders, so as
                    to exclude all air and oxygen. Large castings, such as are used in the
                    manufacture of cannon, are kept covered with hot cinders and allowed to cool
                    down sometimes over a space of about three months.</p>
                <p>In proportion as this brittleness and hardness are reduced by annealing, the
                    flexibility is increased, which allows of the employment of steel for an
                    infinite variety of purposes. A bath of oil, which boils at about 600° Fahr., is
                    often used for the annealing of steel tools, when a temperature between the
                    boiling-point of water and 500° or 600° Fahr, is required. Annealing is also
                    employed to render cast-iron malleable or less brittle than it is naturally, so
                    that a dozen of small articles— such as buckles and knifeblades—can be
                    manufactured at less cost than a single article can be otherwise.</p>
                <p>Annealing may be said to be the inverse process of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tempering,</hi> which is the fixing of the molecular condition of steel by more
                    or less sudden cooling from a particular temperature.</p>
                <p>The real nature of the change which metals undergo by annealing is not thoroughly
                    understood. Most of the malleable metals are susceptible of two distinct forms .
                    one, called the crystalline form, which they assume by slow cooling; and the
                    other, the fibrous, which is acquired by hammering or rolling. When this,
                    however, is carried beyond a certain point, the metal becomes so hard that it is
                    not capable of being bent far without breaking, and recourse must be had to
                    annealing or slow cooling.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if the annealing be long continued the malleability
                    diminishes, and themetai again has a crystalline fracture. Zinc by wire-drawing
                    becomes very flexible, and possesses a degree of tenacity not inferior to that
                    of copper; but, if it be kept in boiling water for a length of time, it will
                    resume its original brittleness, and show a crystalline appearance when broken.
                    Thus it appears that little can be said of the theory of the subject; little
                    more, indeed, can be attempted than the enumeration and classification of the
                    facts.</p>
