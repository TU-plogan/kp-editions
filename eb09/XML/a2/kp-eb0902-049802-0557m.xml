                    The rise of this family of Scottish peers, originally the Campbells of Lochow,
                    first ennobled as Barons Campbell, and still retaining the family name Campbell,
                    is referred to in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Argyllshire</hi> (g <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>.v.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Archibald,</hi> the eighth earl and first marquis, was born
                    in the year 1598, and educated in the principles of the Reformation, of which
                    his ancestors had been zealous promoters. His father, however, renounced
                    Protestantism, whereupon the young earl was put in possession of his patrimonial
                    estates by order of Government, and quickly promoted to places of trust and
                    power. From the commencement of his political career he espoused the cause of
                    the Presbyterian party, and defended the Covenanters when summoned to London to
                    give his opinion of their proceedings before the king. In 1638 he remained with
                    the General Assembly after it had been dissolved by the king’s commissioner, and
                    with other nobility and gentry signed the Solemn League and Covenant. Having
                    thus openly committed himself to the Presbyterian cause, he became its
                    recognised leader both in political negotiations and in the field. He was
                    created a marquis during the king’s visit to Scotland in 1641. This mark of
                    favour, intended probably to conciliate a powerful subject, did not prevent
                    Argyll from leading an army against the royal troops in 1644. The campaign ended
                    in his signal defeat by Montrose at Inverlochy on the 1st February 1645. In 1651
                    he placed the crown on the head of King Charles II. at Scone, having, like the
                    rest of his party, been alienated from the republicans of England by the
                    execution of Charles I. Having gone to London at the Restoration in 1660, he was
                    arrested and thrown into prison. In the following year he was tried at Edinburgh
                    for high treason, and, principally on ground of alleged treasonable
                    correspondence with Monk, he was condemned to death, and executed on the 25 th
                    of May, dying with great firmness and calmness. He was the author of <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Archibald,</hi> the ninth earl, son of the preceding, from
                    his youth distinguished himself by his loyalty and attachment to the royal
                    family. Though his father headed the Covenanters, he attached himself to the
                    king’s party. On the establishment of the Commonwealth he was committed to
                    prison, and was jealously watched till the Restoration, when the king remitted
                    his father’s forfeiture, and created him earl of Argyll. He continued in high
                    favour with the king and court till the passing of the Test Act in 1681, when,
                    by opposing the exemption of princes of the blood from the oath, he drew down on
                    himself the indignation of the duke of York. When called to take the test,
                    Argyll refused, except with an explanation, which he believed to have been
                    approved by the duke, to the effect that he took it only so far as it was
                    consistent with itself and with the Protestant religion. The duke accepted the
                    qualification, and Argyll was admitted to sit in council; but a few days
                    afterwards he was committed to prison, and indicted for high treason. On being
                    tried, three judges did not scruple to convict him of treason; a jury of fifteen
                    noblemen gave a verdict against him; and the king ordered sentence to be
                    pronounced, but the execution of it suspended till further orders. Argyll,
                    however, seeing no reason to trust to the justice or mercy of his enemies, made
                    his escape from prison, and concealed himself for some time in London,
                    afterwards escaping to Holland, where he remained during the remaining part of
                    the reign of Charles II. On the accession of James II. he took part in the
                    rising of the duke of Monmouth, and returned to Scotland to command the forces
                    raised there; but after a few unsuccessful skirmishes he was taken prisoner and
                    carried to Edinburgh, where he was beheaded on his former sentence, June 30,
                    1685, submitting to death with heroic firmness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Archibald,</hi> the first duke, son of the preceding, was an
                    active promoter of the Revolution. He came over with the Prince of Orange, and
                    was admitted into the Convention as earl of Argyll, though his father’s
                    attainder had not been reversed. Having been deputed, along with Sir James
                    Montgomery and Sir John Dalrymple, to present the crown in name of the Scottish
                    Convention to the Prince of Orange, and to tender to him the coronation oath, he
                    was admitted a member of the Privy Council, and, in 1690, made one of the lords
                    of the Treasury. In 1701 he was created duke of Argyll. He died in 1703.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">John,</hi> the second duke (also duke of Greenwich), son of
                    the preceding, was born on the 10th October 1678. He entered the army in 1694,
                    and in 1701 was promoted to the command of a regiment. On the death of his
                    father in 1703, he was appointed a member of the Privy Council, and at the same
                    time captain of the Scotch horse guards, and one of the extraordinary lords of
                    Session. In return for his services in promoting the Union, he was created a
                    peer of England, by the titles of baron of Chatham and earl of Greenwich, and in
                    1710 was made a knight of the Garter. He first distinguished himself in a
                    military capacity at the battle of Oudenarde, where he commanded as
                    brigadier-general; and was afterwards present under the duke of Marlborough at
                    the sieges of Lisle, Ghent, Bruges, and Tournay, and did good service at the
                    battle of Mal-plaquet in 1709. Soon after this action he was sent to take the
                    command in Spain; but being seized with a violent fever at Barcelona, and
                    disappointed of supplies from home, he returned to England. Having a seat in the
                    House of Lords, he censured the measures of the ministry with such freedom that
                    all his places were disposed of to other noblemen; but at the accession of
                    George I. he recovered his influence. On the breaking out of the Rebellion in
                    1715 he was appointed commander-iι «chief of the forces in North Britain, and
                    was principally instrumental in effecting the total extinction of the rebellion
                    in Scotland without much bloodshed. He arrived in London early in March 1716,
                    and at first stood high in the favour of the king, but in a few months was
                    stripped of his offices. This disgrace, however, did not deter him from the
                    discharge of his parliamentary duties; he supported the bill for the impeachment
                    of Bishop Atterbury, and lent his aid to his countrymen by opposing the bill for
                    punishing the city of Edinburgh for the Porteous riot. In the beginning of the
                    year 1719 he was again admitted into favour, appointed lord-steward of the
                    household, and, in April following, created duke of Greenwich. He continued in
                    the administration during the remaining part of that reign, and, after the
                    accession of George II., till April 1740, when a violent speech against the
                    Government led again to his dismissal from office. He was soon restored,
                    however, on a change of the ministry, but disapproving of the measures of the
                    new administration, he finally resigned all his posts, and spent the rest of his
                    life in privacy and retirement. He died on the 3d September 1743. A monument,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Archibald,</hi> the third duke, brother of the preceding,
                    was born at Ham House in Surrey, in June 1682. On his father being created a
                    duke, he joined the army, and served for a short time under the duke of
                    Marlborough. In 1705 he was appointed treasurer of Scotland, and in the
                    following year was one of the commissioners for treating of the Union; on the
                    consummation of which, having been raised to the peerage of Scotland as earl of
                    Islay, he was chosen one of the sixteen peers for Scotland in the first
                    parliament of Great Britain. In 1711 he was called to the Privy Council, and
                    commanded the royal army at the battle of 'Sheriffmuir in 1715. He was appointed
                    keeper of the privy seal in 1725, and was afterwards intrusted with the
                    principal management of Scottish affairs. In 1734 he was made keeper of the
                    great seal, an office which he held till his death. He succeeded to the dukedom
                    in 1743. The duke was eminent not only for his political abilities, but foi his
                    literary accomplishments, and had collected one of the most valuable private
                    libraries in Great Britain. He died suddenly on the 15th of April 1761.</p>
