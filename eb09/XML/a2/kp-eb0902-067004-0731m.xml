                    of Canterbury, born in 1353, was the second son of Robert, earl of Arundel and
                    Warren. At 22 years of age he was raised to the bishopric of Ely, to the church
                    and palace of which he was a great benefactor. In 1386, after the deposition of
                    the earl of Suffolk, he was appointed lord chancellor of England; he was
                    deprived of this office in 1389, but again reinstated. In 1388 he was translated
                    to the see of York, and in 1396 was advanced to the primacy of Canterbury, when
                    he resigned the chancellorship. This was the first instance of the translation
                    of an archbishop of York to the see of Canterbury. Scarcely was he fixed in this
                    see when he had a contest with the University of Oxford about the right of
                    visitation. The affair was referred to the king (Richard II.), who determined it
                    in favour of the archbishop. At his visitation in London he revived an old
                    constitution, by which the inhabitants of the respective parishes were obliged
                    to pay to their rector one halfpenny in the pound out of the rent of their
                    houses. While bishop of Ely, Arundel had taken a leading part in forcing the
                    king to consent to the commission of regency; Richard never forgave this, and in
                    1397 the parliament, with the king’s leave, impeached the archbishop, with his
                    brother Richard earl of Arundel, and the duke of Gloucester, on a charge of high
                    treason. He was sentenced to be banished, and to depart the kingdom within forty
                    days on pain of death. He retired, first to France, and then to the <pb

                    kind reception, and nominated him to the Scottish archbishopric of St Andrews.
                    He was actively engaged in the plot to depose Richard, and place the duke of
                    Lancaster on the throne; and on Henry’s accession, he was restored to the see of
                    Canterbury. Two years after, the Commons moved that the revenues of the church
                    might be applied to the public service, but Arundel opposed the measure with
                    such vigour that it was thrown out. In the year 1408 his zeal for the
                    suppression of heresy was directed against the followers of Wycliffe. Sir John
                    Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, was arrested by his orders, and sentenced to the flames,
                    but contrived to escape from prison. The archbishop also procured a synodical
                    constitution, which prohibited the translation of the Scriptures into the vulgar
                    tongue. He died at Canterbury on the 20th February 1413 of inflammation of the
                    throat, with which he was seized, as was affirmed by the Lollards, while
                    pronouncing sentence upon Lord Cobham.</p>
