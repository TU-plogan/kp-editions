                <p><label type="entry">ARARAT</label>. This name, originally designating a whole
                    district of Asia (Gen. viii. 4), has long been appropriated by the uniform usage
                    of Europeans to the lofty Armenian mountain which stands on the confines of the
                    Russian, Turkish, and Persian dominions, in lat. 39° 42' N., long. 44° 35' E.,
                    known to the Armenians as <hi rend="italic">Masis,</hi> to the Turks as <hi
                        rend="italic">Ak-Dagh,</hi> and to the Persians as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kuh-i-Nuh,</hi> or Noah’s Mountain. Whether the tradition, which makes it
                    the resting-place of the ark, is of any historical value or not, there is at
                    least poetical fitness in the hypothesis, inasmuch as this mountain is about
                    equally distant from the Black Sea and the Caspian, from the Mediterranean and
                    the Persian Gulf. Another tradition—accepted alike by Christians and
                    Mahometans—fixed on Mount Judi, ιa the south of Armenia, as the ark’s
                    resting-place. There so-called genuine relics of the ark were exhibited, and a
                    monastery and mosque of commemoration were built; but the monastery was
                    destroyed by lightning in 776 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and the tradition
                    has declined in credit. Mount Ararat is the culminating point of the Armenian
                    plateau, which reaches at its base a height of 3000 feet. From this it rises in
                    a graceful isolated cone (having at its side the more perfect but less lofty
                    cone of Little Ararat) far into the region of perennial snow. It was long
                    believed by the Armenian monks that no one was permitted to reach the “secret
                    top” of Ararat with its sacred remains. The summit, however, has been frequently
                    reached in the course of this century. Tournefort had failed in 1700; the Pasha
                    of Bayazeed had been equally rmsuccessful; but on Sept. 27, 1829, Dr Parrot of
                    Dorpat, a German in the employment of Russia, set foot on the “dome of eternal
                    ice.” Ascents have since been made by Antonomoff (1834 and 1843); Wagner and
                    Abich (1845); Chodzko, Chanykoff, Moritz, and a party of Cossacks in the service
                    of the Russian Government (1850); Major Stuart (1856); and Colonel Monteith
                    (1856). Mr Freshfield, who reached within about 800 feet of the summit in 1868,
                    thus describes the mountain:—“It stands perfectly isolated from all the other
                    ranges, with the still more perfect cone of Little Ararat (a typical volcano) at
                    its side. Seen thus early in the season (May), with at least 9000 feet of snow
                    on its slopes, from a distance and height well calculated to permit the eye to
                    take in its true proportions, we agreed that no single mountain we know
                    presented such a magnificent and impressive appearance as the Armenian Giant.”
                    It has been ascertained that the higher peak, or <hi rend="italic">Ak-Dagh,</hi>
                    is 17,112 (1331 higher than Mount Blanc), and the lower, or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Allah-Dagh,</hi> about 13,085 feet above the level of the sea. That the
                    mountain was of volcanic origin was well known, but all eruptive activity was
                    supposed to have long ceased. Reineggs was discredited, it may be justly, when
                    he spoke of seeing it in eruption in 1785. But in 1840 there was a vast eruption
                    of sulphurous vapours from its sides, and a tremendous earthquake shook the
                    surrounding country. The village of Arguri and the monastery of St James were
                    destroyed, and great damage was done to Nakhchevan, Sharur, and Ardubad. Major
                    Voskoboinikoff ’ s Report <hi rend="italic">{Athenaeum,</hi> 1841, p. 157) was,
                    as V agner has pointed out, erroneous in some of its details, but in the main
                    trustworthy. There are a number of glaciers in the upper portion, and the
                    climate of the whole district is ∖ery severe. The greater part of the mountain
                    is destitute of trees, but the lower Ararat is clothed with birches. The fauna
                    and flora are both comparatively mea&lt; <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> re.</p>
