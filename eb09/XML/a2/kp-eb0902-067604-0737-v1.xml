                <p><label type="entry">ASCETICISM</label>, from Greek dσ∕ojσιs, meaning the exercise
                    or training to which the athletes subjected themselves when preparing for the
                    games or contests, is used metaphorically to denote the habitual practice of
                    exercising restraint over, or subduing, the bodily desires and affections which
                    tend to lower objects, in order thereby to advance in the higher life of purity
                    and virtue. It is the means by which the mind withdraws itself from the
                    hindrances and temptations of the world, and clears its vision for what is
                    spiritual and true. In its lowest stage it consists in the mortification of the
                    flesh by fasting, penance, and the like; but in a higher sense it involves the
                    uprooting of all worldly or temporal desires, and withdrawal from the natural
                    relations of life. The origin of such a peculiar aspect of thought or mode of
                    action is to be found in the wide-spread idea, not wholly Oriental, that in
                    Unity or Identity alone is true goodness and happiness, while in Multiplicity or
                    Difference is evil and misery. Unity is but the abstract expression for God, the
                    Absolute, or Spirit, and Multiplicity for Matter, in which both Orientals and
                    Greeks thought to find the origin of evil. Now, in man exist both spirit, which
                    is the shadow of or emanation from the divine, and the body, with its various
                    desires <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0738-0677"/> and passions, which is of the nature of
                    matter, and therefore in itself evil. True happiness—nay, true life for man
                    —consists in contemplation of God, absorption into the divine unity and essence;
                    and this ecstatic vision can only be attained by the cultivation of the spirit,
                    and the mortification of the body. The desires and passions must be subdued,
                    rooted up, and the means recommended are solitude, poverty, celibacy, fasting,
                    and penance. We find, accordingly, that in all nations, those who seek divine
                    illumination prepare themselves by these means. In this respect the Hindoo
                    fakirs, jogis, dervishes, and gymnoso-phists, and the numerous sect of the
                    Buddhists, are at one with the Hebrew prophets, Nazari tes, and Chasidim, and
                    with the priests of the Grecian mysteries. In most of the Greek schools of
                    thought, however, asceticism had less a mystical and religious than a moral and
                    practical bearing. Even the solitude and abstinence practised by the
                    Pythagoreans were connected partly with their theory of metempsychosis, but
                    mainly with their ethical training. Socrates, who called temperance, or
                    self-restraint, the chief of virtues, had in view only the higher ethical life
                    of the human spirit; and the Cynics and Stoics, who carried out his doctrine to
                    an extreme, endeavoured to stifle the natural desires, and violate the natural
                    relations of life, in order to realise their ideal of a wise and self-sufficing
                    man of virtue. In Plato, however, appears very prominently the idea of matter as
                    in itself evil and hostile to the divine; and among the neo-Platonic and
                    neo-Pythagorean schools of Alexandria, who draw mainly from him, the doctrine
                    and practice of a mystical and religious asceticism were essentially involved in
                    their philosophical systems. About the same time similar principles had taken
                    root among the Jews, and appeared in Palestine among the Essenes (by some
                    supposed to be an offshoot from the Chasidim), in Egypt among the Therapeut»,
                    Into the heart of this circle of ideas Christianity entered; it incorporated
                    many of them, and lent additional strength to the principle of asceticism in its
                    higher signification. The deep sense of the nothingness of temporal phenomena
                    when compared with spiritual realities, the conviction that in this world
                    believers are but pilgrims, exposed to many temptations through the weakness of
                    the flesh, in which is the origin of sin, and the many expressions which seemed
                    to imply that riches and the ties of marriage were real hindrances in the
                    Christian life, contributed to strengthen the already powerful tendency towards
                    ascetic practices. Accordingly, in the early church celibacy and poverty, with
                    occasional fasting and penance, were commonly recommended as means for the
                    attainment of true virtue and communion with God, and such practices soon began
                    to be looked upon as having a special merit in themselves. The natural
                    consequence was that certain enthusiasts—such as Paul of Thebes, Anthony, and
                    Simeon Stylite⅛—vied with each other in their fanatical asceticism, withdrawing
                    to the desert, and spending their lives in self-mortification. The persecutions
                    of the church, which drove the Christians together, and the introduction of
                    cenobitisιn by Pachomius in the 4th century, gave rise to monasticism, in which,
                    for the first time, asceticism was reduced to an organised system. But the
                    constant reforms required to preserve the purity of the monastic life, and the
                    continuous protests against the whole practice, which began in the 11th century
                    with such men as Peter of Bruis and Henry of Lausanne, and culminated in the
                    Reformation, demonstrated the weakness of the foundation on which the system had
                    been built. Asceticism, meanwhile, was not confined to the church, but had
                    spread through the heretical and religious sects which sprang up alongside of
                    it. The Ebionites and Gnostics inculcated the subjection of the body to the
                    spirit; the new religion of Mani advocated the absolute withdrawal of all
                    desires from the world; and among the followers of Mahomet, one sect, the
                    Persian Sufis, specially distinguished themselves by their practice of
                    abstinence and solitary meditation. Even in modern times, although ascetic
                    practices have been modified, traces of the idea on which they rest are not
                    wanting. The principles of the Quaker Society, of the Methodists, of the
                    Communist bodies in America,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Shakers,—and
                    other enthusiasts, are modifications, more or less pronouncod, of the ascetic
                    way of thinking.</p>
