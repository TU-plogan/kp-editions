                <p><label type="entry">ANTIQUITIES</label>. In keeping with its derivation, the word
                    “antiquities” had for long a wide and general acceptation, embracing everything
                    belonging to the knowledge of the remoter past. The range of the term has been
                    gradually lessened, and a distinction has grown up between history on the one
                    hand and antiquities on the other, though the line of demarcation is not of the
                    most definite kind. Dr Arnold made the distinction between the historian and the
                    antiquary to consist in this, that the historian studied the past for the sake
                    of its bearing on the present, while the antiquary was content to investigate it
                    for its own sake alone. It might rather be said, however, that the historian is
                    concerned with the activities of the past, the antiquary with the products—the
                    one with the progress and variation of the creative nrocesses, the other with
                    the perceptible <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0148-0135"/> and permanent results. In the vast range of
                    subjects with which both classes of inquirers have to do,—religious rites,
                    social customs, legal forms, architectural remains, sculptures, paintings, and
                    so on,—it is plain that the more decidedly anything takes outward form the more
                    undoubtedly it is the property of the antiquary rather than of the historian;
                    and thence it has happened that the antiquary is not unfrequently thought of as
                    having little concern with anything beyond purely material relics.</p>
                <p>With respect to its treatment of the past three periods in a nation’s history may
                    be roughly distinguished—the period of emotional interest, the period of
                    neglect, and the period of scientific attention. To the last of these the true
                    antiquarian spirit belongs. Of the prevalence of this spirit in the classical
                    ages of Greece and Rome we have but little evidence, though a considerable
                    interest in archaeological subjects was manifested by the greater historical
                    intellects, such as Thucydides, Polybius, or Livy. But in the Alexandrian school
                    there was a great, though somewhat irregular, development of antiquarianism,
                    which acquired more of a scientific character from its being rather cosmopolitan
                    than national.</p>
                <p>At the revival of learning, when such enthusiasm was felt for everything
                    classical, the relics of Greece and Rome were carefully collected and preserved;
                    but it was some time before a transition took place from classical to national
                    antiquarianism; and hence it is that the earliest literature of archaeology is
                    almost solely confined to the classical area. Manutius the younger (1511-1574),
                    Sigonius (1520-1584), Meursius (1579-1639), Gruter (1560-1627), Gronovius
                    (1645-1716), Graevius (1632-1703), Pitiscus (1637-1727), &amp;c., kept up the
                    line of laborious scholarship which laid the massive foundations of our present
                    archaeological erudition. The discoveries at Herculaneum (1713) and Pompeii
                    (1755) gave a great impulse to such studies in general, besides supplying a
                    special field of inquiry for such men as Venuti, Jorio, Bayardi, Rossini, and
                    Ciampitto, Mazois, Gau, Gell, Barré, Fiorelli, Overbeck, Dyer, Monier, Gaιτucci,
                    &amp;c. The names of Heeren, Müller, Niebuhr, Creuzer, Boeckh, Hartung, and
                    Zumpt are well known to all who are familiar with the subject of classical
                    antiquities; and to these may be added Curtius, Waddington, Braun, Lasaulx, Le
                    Bas, Roulez, Rangabé, Schömann, .Canina, Panofka, Becker, Marquardt, and Lange.
                    The results of their labours have been collected in such books as Pauly’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopädie der</hi><hi rend="italic">classischen
                    Alterthumswissenschaft;</hi> Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Greek and
                    Roman Antiquities;</hi> and Darem-berg and Saglio’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionnaire des Antiquités grecques et romaines.</hi> The capitals of Greece
                    and Italy have naturally attracted particular attention to themselves. On Rome
                    we have the special works of Desgodetz (1682), Piranesi (1784), Overbeck,
                    Rossini, Reber, Dyer, Reumont, Nibby, besides the famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beschreibung</hi> by Bunsen, Platner, Gerhard, Röstell, &amp;c.; on Athens
                    those of Leake, Forch-hammer, Wordsworth, Stuart and Revett, Beulé, Laborde,
                    &amp;c. In connection with Etruscan antiquities, Micali, Dempster, Inglirami,
                    Dennis, Hamilton, Heyne, Lanzi, and Raoul-Rochette are well known. The mysteries
                    of the Egyptian monuments have found interpreters in Young, Champoilion, Bunsen,
                    Letronne, Lenoir, Leemans, Sharpe, &amp;c.; while the marvels of Assyria have
                    employed the energies of such men as Botta, Layard, Rawlinson, Munter,
                    Grotefend, Rask, Burnouf, Lassen, Westergaard, Hincks, De Saulcy, Holtzmann,
                    Haug, Spiegel. The antiquities of the northern nations of Europe have been
                    treated by Mallet, Thorlacius, Nyerup, Werlauff, Worsaae, Thomsen, Brunius,
                    Grupen, Heineccius, Roessig; those of France by Montfaucon, Caylus, Martin,
                    Sauvagère, Ramé, Lajard, Renouvier, Didron, Gailhabaud, Gilbert, Beugnot,
                    Cochet, and a multitude of others. The Russian antiquities have been
                    magnificently represented in a great work issued by order of the Government.</p>
                <p>In our own country the names of Leland, Camden, Hearne, Dugdale, Grose, and Roy,
                    are not forgotten in the newer fame of Fosbrooke, Palgrave, Ellis, Wright,
                    Stuart, Wilson, Brand, Lodge, Laing, Bateman, &amp;c. For a knowledge of
                    American antiquities we are largely indebted to Davies, Squier, Lapham, Haven,
                    Rosny, Stephens; and for those of Mexico to Ranking.</p>
                <p>In what are called ecclesiastical antiquities, besides the older works of
                    Ugolinus, Canisius, and Bingham, we may mention Buchon, Bourassé, Martigny,
                    Guenebault. The names of Lubbock and Tylor are especially famous in those
                    inquiries which relate to the general condition of primeval humanity.</p>
                <p>Associations of various kinds have naturally been formed by scholars interested
                    in archaeological pursuits for tho promotion of their favourite studies, and a
                    large number of periodical publications have been established, partly in
                    connection with such associations, and partly as matters of commercial
                    speculation.</p>
                <p>As early as 1572, in our own country, a sort of society was formed by Bishop
                    Parker, Sir Robert Cotton, William Camden, and a few kindred spirits, for the
                    preservation of the national antiquities, and it continued to exist till 1604,
                    when it was broken up by James I., who was afraid that it might degenerate into
                    a political association. Papers on subjects discussed by them have been
                    preserved in the Cottonian library, and were printed by Hearne, in 1720, as <hi
                    rend="italic">A Collection of Curious Discourses,</hi> and again, in 1771, by
                    Sir Joseph Ayloffe, with considerable additions. In 1707 Humphry Wanley and a
                    number of other gentlemen began to meet together for a similar purpose, and next
                    year they received the co-operation of the brothers Gale, Dr Stukeley, Rymer,
                    &lt;fcc. In 1717 they were reconstituted, and in 1750 they obtained a charter
                    from George II. as the <hi rend="italic">Society of Antiquaries of London.</hi>
                    In 1780 they were presented by George III. with apartments in Somerset House in
                    the Strand. The council consists of twenty members and a president, who, during
                    his tenure of office* is one of the trustees of the British Museum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</hi> was founded in
                    1780, and has the management of a large national Antiquarian Museum in
                    Edinburgh. In Ireland there is a <hi rend="italic">Royal Historical and
                    Archaeological Association,</hi> which holds its meetings at Kilkenny. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Société des Antiquaires</hi><hi rend="italic">de France</hi> was
                    formed, in 1813, by the reconstruction of the <hi rend="italic">Académie
                    Celtique,</hi> which had been in existence since 1805 In Germany there are a
                    large number of societies that, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Historische
                    Vereine,</hi> embrace the study of antiquarian subjects, and keep up a
                    connection with each other through the <hi rend="italic">Corresp&amp;ndenzblatt
                    des Gesammtυereins</hi><hi rend="italic">der deutschen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geschichts-</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Alter-thumsvereine,</hi> published since 1853 at Stuttgart. There is a
                    well-known <hi rend="italic">Société Royale des Antiquaires du Nord</hi> at
                    Copenhagen. Similar associations, far too numerous to mention, have been formed
                    in all countries of European civilisation.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">antiquarius</hi> first appears in the later Roman
                    classics (Tacitus, Suetonius, Juvenal), with the signification of an affecter of
                    old words and phrases. In the Middle Ages it was employed as the designation of
                    one who was skilled in copying ancient manuscripts; and in modern German it has
                    kept, in the form <hi rend="italic">Antiquar,</hi> the cognate meaning of a
                    dealer in old books.</p>
