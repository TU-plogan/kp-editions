                    against England in 1588 by Philip of Spain. His principal motive for this
                    enterprise was the desire to strike a decisive blow at the Protestant faith, of
                    which England was then the bulwark. For many months the whole energies of the
                    Spanish nation had been directed towards the construction and equipment of the
                    requisite ships. In 1587 everything was nearly ready, but the sailing of the
                    expedition was delayed for a year by Drake, who made a bold dash into the
                    harbour of Cadiz and destroyed nearly a hundred ships, with immense stores of
                    provisions. A further delay was caused by the sudden death of the marquis of
                    Santa Cruz, who had been originally intrusted with the chief command. His loss
                    was a serious blow to the Spanish, cause, for he was an experienced sailor. The
                    duke of Medina Sidonia, a man almost entirely ignorant of naval affairs, was
                    then made admiral. All preparations being at length completed, the great fleet
                    sailed from Lisbon on the 29th (19th o. s.) May 1588. It consisted of 129 large
                    vessels, and carried 19,295 soldiers, 8460 sailors, besides slaves as rowers,
                    and 2431 cannon. Their destination was the coast of Flanders, where Alexander
                    Farnese, prince of Parma, was lying with about 35,000 men and a flotilla of
                    boats. This force was to be landed on the Isle of Thanet at the mouth of the
                    Thames, under the protection of the Armada, which would be able to keep the
                    Channel perfectly clear. Another body of troops was then to be landed further
                    north; and it had been hoped at one time that the duke of Guise would effect a
                    diversion by landing a force on the west coast. These plans, however, were
                    considerably deranged by the length of time occupied in preparing the
                    expedition, and by the further delays encountered. For tho fleet had scarcely
                    sailed from Lisbon, when it was overtaken by a severe storm, which shattered
                    several of the ships, and compelled them all to put in for repairs at Coruna. It
                    was the 22d (12th) July before they finally sailed from Spain. England meanwhile
                    had not been idle; when tho news arrived that the great expedition waβ really
                    about to set out, the most intense enthusiasm took possession of the people, who
                    gladly furnished ships and stores, · and raised volunteer bands for coast
                    defence. The command of the army was given to the earl of Leicester, who took
                    his post, with about 16,000 men, at Tilbury to oppose the landing of Parma.
                    About 45,000 were assembled round the Queen, to protect her person. The royal
                    navy, which consisted of about thirty ships, was at once put in order, and
                    gradually increased, by the addition of merchantmen and privateers, to about 180
                    vessels. These carried about <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0605-0544"/> 18,000 sailors, but they had not half the weight
                    of the Spanish artillery, and they were scantily supplied with ammunition and
                    provisions. The ships, however,—those of the Queen in particular,—were in
                    splendid order, and the sailors were the finest in England. The lord high
                    admiral was Lord Howard of Effingham, who had under him Drake, Hawkins,
                    Frobisher, and others, the most celebrated mariners of the age, He took his
                    station with the main body of the ships, about eighty in number, at Plymouth,
                    and another squadron, under Lord Seymour, cruised off Dunkirk, commanding the
                    straits and blockading the prince of Parma. Meantime news was brought to England
                    that the Armada had encountered severe storms, and that the expedition was given
                    up. So much faith was put in this report that several ships began to discharge
                    their crews. Howard, however, sailed down towards Coruna, and discovered that
                    the report had no foundation. On the 29th (19th) July, the fleet was observed
                    entering the Channel, and the beacon-lights along the coast gave warning to
                    England that the dreaded enemy was at hand. That evening Howard’s ships were
                    moored so as to be able to elip out of Plymouth Sound at a moment’s notice. On
                    the following day the Armada was seen standing up the Channel in the form of a
                    crescent, seven miles long, and numbering 150 ships. They passed Plymouth
                    towards evening, and during the night the English fleet sailed out of the Sound,
                    and took up a position to windward. On the following day the action began by the
                    duke of Medina Sidonia attempting to close and come to a general engagement. But
                    he found this to be impossible; the English ships, light and admirably handled,
                    sailed so swiftly, and were manoeuvred with such dexterity, that it was out of
                    his power to inflict any injury on them. Their fire also was rapid and deadly,
                    while the Spanish guns were worked slowly, and generally sent the shot far over
                    the light English vessels. Dismayed at their want of success, the Spanish fleet
                    stood off up the Channel, closely pursued by the English. Throughout all the
                    next week the same tactics were pursued; the English, hovering on the rear of
                    the Armada, harassed and weakened it without coming to a general engagement. At
                    length, on the 6th August (27th July), Medina Sidonia cast anchor in the roads
                    of Calais, and sent messengers to the prince of Parma, asking him for ammunition
                    and light vessels, and suggesting that he should now attempt his landing on the
                    coast of England. But the prince declared that it was impossible to cross the
                    Channel while the English fleet was on the sea, that he had no light ships, and
                    that the state of the weather prevented him sending such ammunition as he could
                    spare. Lord Howard had now been joined by Seymour’s squadron and by many private
                    ships, but he and the other commanders were still in the deepest anxiety. They
                    were almost destitute of provisions and powder, and did not yet know what damage
                    they had inflicted on the Armada, which, after all their endeavours, seemed now
                    to have reached its destination. At last it was resolved to drive the Spanish
                    fleet out into the open sea, and to effect this by means of fire-ships. Eight
                    ships were selected and filled with combustibles, their rigging was smeared with
                    pitch, and on the night of the 7th August (28th July) they were drifted down
                    with the tide and set on fire. The Spaniards, in great alarm, immediately cut
                    their cables and cleared off from the shore. Next morning Drake pursued them,
                    while Howard remained for some time to attack a galleon that had gone ashore
                    during the night. The Spanish fleet was scattered over a large space off
                    Gravelines, and Drake at once began the action, driving them together into a
                    confused mass by his rapid firing and swift manoeuvring, and forcing the whole
                    towards the coast of Flanders. Had his ammunition held out he might have
                    completed the ruin by driving them on shore; as it was, the injury inflicted by
                    this one day’s fighting was enormous. Nearly 4000 men were killed and many ships
                    were disabled, and the hopes of the Spaniards were broken. Their courage
                    completely deserted them; and next day, when a council of war was held, it was
                    resolved to try the perilous voyage to Spain by the North Sea and Pentland Firth
                    rather than again face Drake and the English fleet. The whole fleet, still
                    numbering 120 vessels, stood off accordingly towards the North Sea. Drake and
                    Howard pursued for some days, till want of provisions compelled them to return.
                    But the weather proved a sufficiently formidable enemy to the unhappy Spaniards.
                    The continuous violent gales which accompanied them along their route, by the
                    north of Scotland and the wild Irish coast, completely shattered their
                    unseaworthy vessels. The shores were strewn with wrecks, and many hundreds of
                    unfortunates who were saved from the sea were slain by the Irish. Constant
                    sickness had decimated the troops, and when at length, in September and October,
                    fifty-four shattered vessels reached Spain, they conveyed only 9000 or 10,000
                    men, and these were in a pitiable state from sickness and want.</p>
