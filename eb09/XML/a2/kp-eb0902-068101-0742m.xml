                <p><label type="entry">ASHANTEE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sianti</hi></label>, a
                    country in Western Africa, iu the interior of the Gold Coast, the extent and
                    population of which can only be approximately given. Stretching from lat. 5° to
                    9° N., and from long. 0° to 4° W., it comprises about 70,000 English square
                    miles, and its population has been variously stated at from 1,000,000 to
                    3,000,000.</p>
                <p>Tradition represents the Ashantees as deriving their origin from bands of
                    fugitives, who, two or three centuries ago, were driven before the Moslem tribes
                    migrating southward from the countries on the Niger and Senegal. Having cleared
                    for themselves a region of impenetrable forest, they defended themselves with a
                    valour which, becoming part of their national character, raised them to the rank
                    of a powerful and conquering nation. They are supposed to be originally of the
                    same race as the Fan tees, nearer the coast, and speak the same language. The
                    separation of Fantees and Ashantees is ascribed to a.famine which drove the
                    former south, and led them to live on <hi rend="italic">fan,</hi> or herbs,
                    while the latter subsisted on <hi rend="italic">san,</hi> or Indian corn,
                    &lt;fcc. (whence the names Fantees and San tees).</p>
                <p>Ashantee proper is covered with almost impenetrable forest, the routes through
                    which consist merely of narrow winding tracts, where, though it is possible for
                    a man to ride, or a palanquin to be carried, no waggon of any description could
                    pass. Many of the trees attain splendid proportions, but the monotony is
                    oppressive, and is hardly ever relieved by the sight of either bird or beast.
                    The country round the towns in the interior, however, is cultivated with care,
                    the fields being kept clean, and yielding in abundance grain, yams, vegetables,
                    and fruits. The territory yields also a considerable quantity of gold. The
                    Ashantees are skilful in several species of manufacture, particularly in weaving
                    the great African fabric of cotton. Their pottery and works in gold also show
                    skill, though surpassed by those produced in the more southern countries. A
                    large quantity of silver-plate and goldsmith’s work of great value and
                    considerable artistic elaboration was found in 1874 in the king’s palace of
                    Coomassie, not the least remarkable objects being masks of beaten gold. The
                    influence of Moorish art is perceptible in everything.</p>
                <p>The government of Ashantee is a mixture of monarchy and military aristocracy; the
                    lower orders being held in complete thraldom, and liable to be put to death or
                    sold into slavery at the will of the chiefs. The king carries on all the
                    ordinary administration of the state; but in questions relating to peace or war
                    he is bound to consult the council of the caboceers or captains. Each of these
                    cabo-ceers keeps a little court, where he makes a profuse display of barbaric
                    pomp. Polygamy is indulged in to an enormous extent, the king has a regular
                    allowance of 3333 wives, but many of these are employed as guards or in menial
                    services. The crown descends to the king’s brother, or his sister’s son, riot to
                    his own offspring.</p>
                <p>The dreadful system of human sacrifice, practised among the Ashantees, is founded
                    on a wild idea of piety towards parents and other connections—the chiefs
                    fancying that the rank of their dead relatives in the future world will be
                    measured by the number of attendants sent after them. There are two periods,
                    called the great Adai and little Adai, succeeding each other at intervals of
                    eighteen and twenty-four days, at which human victims, chiefly prisoners of war
                    or condemned criminals, are often immolated to a monstrous extent. On the great
                    Adai, which always falls on a Sunday, the king visits the burial-grounds of the
                    princes and the royal mausoleum at Bantama, where the skeletons of his
                    predecessors—their bones held together by links of gold—sit in grim mockery of
                    state. Still more dreadful is the “custom” celebrated after the death of the
                    king, or any member of the royal house.</p>
                <p>Early in the 18th century the Ashantees first came under the notice of Europeans,
                    through their successful wars with the kingdoms bordering on the maritime
                    territory. Osai Tutu may be considered as the real founder of the Ashantee
                    power. He either built or greatly extended Coomassie, the capital; he subdued
                    the neighbouring state of Denkera (1719) and the Mahometan countries of Gaman
                    and Banna, and extended the empire by conquests both on the east and west. At
                    last he was defeated and slain (1731); but his successor, Osai Apoko, made
                    further acquisitions towards the coast.</p>
                <p>In 1800, Osai Tutu Quamina, an enterprising and ambitious man, who appears early
                    to have formed the desire of opening a communication with white nations, became
                    king. About 1807 two chiefs of the Assins, whom he had defeated in battle,
                    sought refuge among the Fantees, the ruling people on the coast. On the refusal
                    of the Fantees to deliver up the fugitives, he invaded their country, defeated
                    them, and drove them towards the sea. At length they reached the town of
                    Annamaboe, where there was then a British fort. The governor exhorted the
                    citizens to come to teπns, and offered to mediate; but they resolved to abide
                    the contest. The resuit was the destraction of the town, with great slaughter of
                    the inhabitants. The Ashantees failed, however, to storm the English fort,
                    though the garrison was reduced from 24 to 8 men. A truce was agreed to, and the
                    king refusing to treat except with the chief governor of Cape Coast, Colonel
                    Torranne repaired to Annamaboe, where he was received with great pomp. A treaty
                    was concluded by which the whole territory of Fantee, including Cape Coast
                    Castle, was ceded by right of conquest to the Ashantee empire.</p>
                <p>In 1817 the British Government sent Messrs James, Bowdich, and Hutchison on a
                    mission to Coomassie. They were received with dignified politeness. After one or
                    two harmonious interviews, the king advanced a claim for certain sums which the
                    British were bound to pay to the native Governments, and which the Fantees had
                    been accustomed to receive, for permission to hold fortified factories. Mr James
                    proposed to refer this claim to the Government at Cape Coast Castle; whereupon
                    the king broke out into uncontrollable rage, calling the deputies cheats and
                    liars. Messrs Bowdich an&lt;l Hutchison, thinking that the English interests and
                    the safety of the mission were endangered, took the negotiation into their own
                    hands. A treaty was concluded, by which all the king’s demands were satisfied;
                    and, after a residence of several months, they returned to Cape Coast.</p>
                <p>The Government at home, though they demurred somewhat to the course that had been
                    pursued, saw the wisdom of cultivating intercourse with this powerful African
                    king. They sent out, therefore, to his court, as a fixed resident, Μ. Dupuis,
                    who arrived at Cape Coast in January 1819. By that time the British local
                    Government had been gained over to the interest of the Fantees. An insurrection
                    had arisen in the interior of the Ashantee territory, respecting which
                    exaggerated rumours had been listened to with blind credulity. Insulting
                    messages were sent to the king, who was also informed that the inhabitants of
                    Cape Coast were setting his authority at defiance, and were forming a wall to
                    defend the town. The governor, on various pretences, detained Μ. Dupuis for some
                    time; but at length, on the arrival of more than one ambassador from the king,
                    allowed him to proceed. Μ. Dupuis set out on the 9th February 1820, and on the
                    28th arrived at Coomassie. After several confidential meetings with the king, a
                    treaty was drawn up, which adjusted all the differences between the two parties.
                    The king dismissed Μ. Dupuis with many marks of esteem and kindness, sending
                    along with him two natives of distinction, to proceed as ambassadors to England.
                    On his return to Cape Coast he found that the governor disowned the treaty, as
                    betraying British interests and transferring to Ashantee the sovereignty of the
                    Gold Coast. At the same time the Fautee party persuaded Sir George Collier to
                    refuse to transport the Ashantee ambassadors to Britain.</p>
                <p>Μ. Dupuis returned to England to represent the particulars to the Government; but
                    an entire change meantime took place in the administration of British affairs in
                    Africa. The African Company was abolished by Act of Parliament in 1821, and the
                    forts and possessions transferred to the Crown. Sir Charles McCarthy was
                    invested with the government of all this range of coast. On his arrival in 1822
                    he adopted the Fanteo policy, placed the town in a posture of defence, and
                    formed alliances with the neighbouring tribes. It was hoped that the hostile
                    attitude of the English would overawe the king, but lie speedily declared open
                    war.</p>
                <p>After one or two unimportant successes, the British force was completely routed
                    in Essamaco, near the boundary stream of the Prah, by a native army of about
                    10,000 men. Sir Charles M*Carthy was slain, and only 50 men, including two
                    officers, returned to the castle. On the very day of this defeat Osai Tutu
                    Quamina died, and was succeeded by Osai Okoto. The Ashantee army now marched
                    upon Cape Coast, laying waste the country with fire and sword. At that place,
                    however, detachments of reserve had united with the wrecks of the main corps,
                    and vigorously prepared for defence. The king made repeated and desperate
                    assaults, but at last sustained a signal defeat at Dudowab, on the 7th August
                    1826. In 1828 all public establishments were withdrawn by the British
                    Government, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n743/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0743-0682"/> and the chief power was transferred to a company
                    of African merchants. In 1831 the king was obliged to purchase peace at the
                    price of 6000 ounces of gold, and to send his son as a hostage to Cape Coast
                    Castle. Since this event the Ashantee power has become extinct on the coast. By
                    the treaty concluded at the end of the war, the river Prah was fixed as the
                    boundary of the Ashantee kingdom, and all the tribes to the south of it were
                    placed under British protection.</p>
                <p>In 1843 the Crown resumed the government of the Gold Coast. Towards the end of
                    1852 the Ashantee monarch seemed disposed to interfere with the states absolved
                    from his jurisdiction. Two Assin chiefs, who had revolted from Ashantee and
                    joined the Fantee alliance, were discovered to be intriguing with the king of
                    Ashantee; and that monarch, under pretext of making “custom” for the late chief
                    of Denkera, crossed the Prah with a force of about 7000 men. These warlike
                    movements naturally excited much uneasiness at Cape Coast Castle, but the
                    negotiations of the authorities were successful in averting the storm. From 1853
                    to 1863 there was peace between Ashantee and the Government of Cape Coast
                    Castle; but in the latter year disagreements broke out on account of a refusal
                    to deliver up certain Ashantee refugees. In 1867 it was agreed that all the
                    Dutch forts to the east of the Sweet Biver should be handed over to Britain in
                    exchange for all the British forts to the west cf that river. Unexpected
                    difficulties, however, arose, which led the Dutch Government to offer all their
                    possessions in that district to Britain, on certain commercial privileges being
                    guaranteed to them. Hereupon the king of Ashantee objected to the transfer of
                    Fort Elmiι∣a; but the superiority he alleged was completely disproved, and the
                    proposal took effect on April 6,1872.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile another matter of dispute arose between the king and the English.
                    Messrs Kühne, Ramsayer, and Palmer, and a Frenchman named Bonnat, having been
                    inveigled into captivity by an Ashantee chief, the British Government demanded
                    their surrender; but this, on various pretexts, was obstinately refused by the
                    king. War had for some time been imminent, and at length, on January 22, 1873,
                    an Ashantee force crossed the Prah, and invaded. the British protectorate. The
                    importance of the invasion was soon recognised, not only by the local
                    authorities, but by the Government at home; and measures were taken for the
                    defence of the territory and the punishment of the assailants, which ultimately
                    culminated in the despatch of Sir Garnet Wolseley as her Majesty’s
                    administrator, £800,000 being voted in parliament for the expenses of the
                    expedition. On landing (October 2) at Cape Coast, he found that the Ashantee
                    nation was in arms to the number of 40,000; the Fantee tribes were fragmentary
                    and languid; and the country was extremely unhealthy for European troops. He
                    determined, however, to march to Coomassie, and dictate terms to the king from
                    his own capital. On January 20, 1874, the river Prah was crossed; on the 24th
                    the Adansi hills were reached; on the 31st there was severe fighting at Amoaful;
                    on the 1st of February Becquah was captured; and on the 4th the victorious army
                    was in Coomassie. The town was full of Ashantee soldiers, but no attempt was
                    made to turn the fortune of the war. As the rainy season was setting in, all
                    possible haste was requisite; in two days, therefore, the homeward march was
                    commenced, the city being left behind in flames. By the time that Fommanah was
                    reached (February 13), the king sent his envoys to conclude a treaty, whereby he
                    agreed, among other conditions, to pay 50,000 ounces of gold, to renounce all
                    claim to homage from certain neighbouring kings, and all pretensions of
                    supremacy over any part of the former Dutch protectorate, to promote freedom of
                    trade, to keep open a road from Coomassie to the Prah, and to do his best to
                    check the practice of human sacrifice. Besides coloured troops, there were
                    employed in this campaign about 2400 Europeans, who suffered severely from fever
                    and otherwise, though the mortality on the whole was slight. The success of the
                    expedition was greatly facilitated by the exertions of Captains Glover, Butler,
                    and Dalrymple, who effected important diversions with very inadequate
                    resources.</p>
