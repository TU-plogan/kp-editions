                <p><label type="entry">ARGENTINE REPUBLIC</label></p>
                <p>THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC comprises the greater part of what was formerly.the
                    Spanish viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres. On the separation of the country from Spain
                    the remainder of the viceroyalty seceded from the authority of the government
                    established at Buenos Ayres, and formed the three important republics of
                    Bolivia, Paraguay, and the Banda Oriental del Uruguay, commonly called either
                    the Oriental Republic or Uruguay. The city of Buenos Ayres, the capital of the
                    province of the same name, then became the seat of the national government of
                    the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata,—so named in the treaty with
                    England, by which their independence was recognised, and since termed the
                    Argentine Republic. Including the Indian tribes, who are in almost undisputed
                    possession of half its territory, the country does not contain half so many
                    inhabitants as the city of London, though it extends over an area as great as
                    all Central and Western Europe combined; and the fertility of its vast plains,
                    together with the yet undeveloped wealth of its mineral resources, indicate that
                    it is well able to sustain as numerous a population as that of the part of
                    Europe just alluded to. Its extent in latitude is greater than that of any other
                    existing country, if we except the comparatively useless foreign regions of
                    British America and those of the Russian empire, though it only slightly exceeds
                    that of the comparatively narrow slip of land which forms the neighbouring
                    Republic of Chili. It is bounded on the W. by Chili; on the S. by the Strait of
                    Magellan; on the E. by the Atlantic Ocean, the Oriental Republic, the Empire of
                    Brazil, and the Republic of Paraguay; and on the N. by the Republic of Bolivia.
                    The boundary to the W. is formed by the mountain chain of the Andes. The
                    southern limit is at present a question in dispute with the Government of Chili,
                    who claim the entire extent of the Strait of Magellan; but it is probable that
                    the Argentine Government will make good its claim to the eastern portion. The
                    broad stream of the Uruguay below its tributary, the Guarey, or Cuareim, divides
                    it from the Oriental Republic, except that the small but important island of
                    Martin Garcia, close to the Oriental shore of the Uruguay at its junction with
                    the Parana, belongs to the Argentine Republic. The boundary with Brazil is then
                    formed by the Uruguay and its tributary, the Pepiri Guazu, from the head waters
                    of which it crosses the Sierra de los Missiones to the head waters of the San
                    Antonio Guazu, the course of which it follows, and then that of the Iguazu, or
                    Rio Grande de Caritiba, an important tributary of the Parana. The Parana, down
                    to its junction with the Paraguay, and the latter upwards as far as the mouth of
                    the Pilcomayo, form the boundary with the Republic of Paraguay. South of the 22d
                    degree of latitude the country between the Pilcomayo and the Paraguay is
                    disputed by the Argentine Republic and Paraguay. The boundary with Bolivia lies
                    along the 22d degree of latitude between the Pilcomayo and the Vermejo, and
                    then, leaving important tributaries of the latter to Bolivia, it follows the
                    course of that river to its source, whence it takes a devious course westwards
                    among the mountains which form spurs to the Andes. On reaching the latter it
                    follows the main chain southwards to latitude 25° 30', where it passes to a more
                    westerly ridge of the Andes on which the boundaries of the three neighbouring
                    republics unite. The boundary we have described with Bolivia cannot be
                    considered as permanently settled; and the boundary between Bolivia and Paraguay
                    to the north of the Argentine Republic has not been determined. The boundary
                    questions with all these republics are in an unsatisfactory state.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable feature of the country is its plains, which may be said to
                    extend over more than three-fourths of it. The plains of Patagonia in the south,
                    the Pampas across the extending central part of the country, and the Chaco in
                    the north-east, have no very definite natural boundaries. The two latter are, in
                    fact, the same continuous formation, in which a slight undulation divides the
                    streams of the Chaco, which join the Parana, from those of the Pampas, which
                    either flow into the Atlantic south of the mouth of the latter river, or
                    disappear by absorption into the soil, and evaporation as they spread over the
                    plains. The best parts of these plains are covered with a rich alluvial soil
                    from 3 to 6 feet in thickness, formed by the constant decaying of the luxuriant
                    vegetation which grows upon it, and this soil rests upon a sedimentary deposit
                    of earth, which appears to have been scoured away from the Andes and the high
                    lands of the central part of the continent. A great part of Patagonia and the
                    western Pampas consists of gravel and coarse detritus from the Andes, and,
                    though apparently sterile, only requires irrigation to become productive. Other
                    parts of the plains are dry, saline wastes or brackish marshes, which probably
                    mark the former position of an inland sea. Excepting the hills in the south <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n547/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0547-0488"/> of the province of Buenos Ayres and those of
                    Cordova, the mountain districts of the country consist of the eastern elope of
                    the gigantic range of the Andes and its branches, which latter make all the
                    north-western part of the country a mountainous region. The great chain of the
                    Andes consists of a confused mass of broken and contorted strata, piled upon an
                    elevated ridge of granite, through which numerous volcanoes, many of them still
                    active, have ejected vast quantities of lava and scoriae. Along most parts of
                    the great mountain chain there are three subsidiary and more or less parallel
                    ridges, between which fertile valleys are formed in many places, whilst in other
                    parts the separation between them is not very clearly defined. In the north-west
                    the boundary with Bolivia lies along the most eastern of the ridges just
                    mentioned, so that the valleys to the west of it are within that republic, but
                    the boundary with Chili lies along the western ridge, so that the central and
                    eastern ridges, with the fine valleys which lie between them, belong to the
                    Argentine Republic. The great chain of the Andes, as described by Mr Evan
                    Hopkins, who made extensive explorations in various parts of it, is formed of
                    innumerable varieties of granite, gneiss, schists, hornblende, chloritic slates,
                    porphyries, &lt;fcc., and these rocks alternate with each other in great
                    meridional bands. The crystalline rocks follow no particular order in the
                    alternation. For miles only granite and gneiss are found, and again schist,
                    quartz, gneiss, &lt;kc., intervening, <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> The whole of
                    the crystalline rocks, especially the micaceous <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>
                    variety, pass insensibly from the crystalline to the laminated structure. We
                    have first the granite base, in which the crystals are somewhat confusedly
                    mixed; these gradually become arranged upwards into parallel lines, and the rock
                    is then called gneiss; by degrees the felspar is decomposed, and the mass
                    becomes schistose, with enclosed veins of the predominating element of the
                    compound below. This is the general character of the primary structure of the
                    Andes, and upon it there are many bits of sandstones, limestones, &lt;fcc.,
                    especially on the eastern chain.</p>
                <p>9 The most careful and elaborate researches into the geological conformation of
                    the country were made by Mr Darwin, who published the results in his work on the
                    geology of South America. He points out evidences of a gradual upheaval of the
                    plains of Patagonia and the Pampas, to the extent of 400 feet in the southern
                    part of the former, and 100 feet in the latter district. The Pacific and
                    Atlantic Oceans were once connected through what is at present the basin of the
                    Santa Cruz river, in latitude 50° S. This latter district appears to have been
                    upheaved at least 1400 feet before the period of the gradual upheaval above
                    mentioned, as indicated by the present position of gigantic boulders, which have
                    been transported on icebergs 60 and 70 miles from their parent rock. The
                    enormous layers of gravel and sand, on the plains and even on the hills of
                    eastern Patagonia, give evidence of its having at one time formed the bed of an
                    ocean which rolled against the Audes or intervening ranges of mountains. The
                    characteristic feature of the plains of Patagonia is gravel, whereas that of the
                    Pampean formation, which includes the Chaco, is earth which, according to Mr
                    Darwin’s lucid arguments, has been deposited in the form of sand in the estuary
                    of the River Plata, the position of which has been continually changing in
                    consequence of the gradual upheaval of the country. This formation extends to
                    the south-west and north-west from the present estuary, over an area at least
                    750 miles long and 400 miles broad, and the thickness of the deposit is from 30
                    to 100 feet. The hills of Tapalquen, Tandil, and Vulcan, composed of
                    unstratified granular quartz, project through the eastern part of this Pampean
                    formation. The higher range of the Sierra Ventana further south is also quartz.
                    South of the Sierra Ventana, for a distance of 380 miles, crystalline rocks are
                    seldom if ever met with on the east coast; and beyond that a porphyritic
                    formation is found resembling the lowest stratified formation of the Andes.</p>
                <p>“The highest peaks of the Cordillera, ’ says Mr Darwin, “appear to consist of
                    active, or more commonly, dormant volcanoes—such as Tupungato, Maypu, and
                    Aconcagua, which latter stands 23,000 feet above the level of the sea, and many
                    others. The next highest peaks are formed of the gypseous and porphyritic
                    strata, thrown into vertical or highly inclined positions. . . . This grand
                    range has suffered both the most violent dislocations, and slow, though grand,
                    upward and downward movements in mass: I know not whether the spectacle of its
                    immense valleys, with mountain masses of once-liquefied and intrusive rocks now
                    bared and intersected, or whether the view of those plains, composed of shingle
                    and sediment hence derived, which stretch to the borders of the Atlantic Ocean,
                    is best adapted to excite our astonishment at the amount of wear and tear which
                    these mountains have undergone. "</p>
                <p>We commend Mr Darwin’s work to the attention of readers desirous of becoming
                    better acquainted with the geological conformation of the Argentine
                    Republic.</p>
                <p>The great extent of this country in latitude makes its climate range through all
                    diversities of temperature from that of Northern Europe and Canada to that of
                    Egypt and Arabia. The climate of Southern Patagonia is less intemperate than
                    that of Labrador at the same distance from the equator in the northern
                    hemisphere, but colder than the Atlantic shores of Europe in the same latitude.
                    As the difference of climate in the same latitude in the northern hemisphere is
                    in a great measure attributed to the fact of the warm water from the equatorical
                    regions drifting towards the shores of the north of Europe, whilst the cold
                    water from the Arctic regions is constantly flowing southwards along the coast
                    of Labrador, so also the intermediate nature of the climate of Patagonia is
                    doubtless, in some measure, due to the tendency of the cold water of the
                    Antarctic regions to flow northwards through the central parts of the Atlantic
                    Ocean, as pointed out by Maury, thus throwing the warm water southwards along
                    the coasts of Brazil and Patagonia. Argentine Patagonia might, not inaptly, be
                    termed the Sweden, and Chilian Patagonia the Norway of the southern hemisphere.
                    In the north of Patagonia and the southern part of the province of Buenos Ayres
                    the climate, as regards temperature, resembles that of England; and northwards
                    of this is the broadest part of the republic, which contains the city of Mendoza
                    in the far west, and Buenos Ayres in the east, and enjoys one of the finest
                    climates in the world, rivalling that of Southern France and Northern Italy.
                    North of this the summer heat becomes too oppressive, and in the extreme north
                    the climate is thoroughly tropical. In some parts of the northwest the altitude
                    of the country gives it a cooler climate than that of the Chaco in the same
                    latitude. Along the Argentine slopes of the Andes and the adjacent country the
                    climate is remarkable for its dryness, because the prevalent westerly winds lose
                    the moisture which they bring from the Pacific before crossing the mountains.
                    This peculiarity is most marked in the southern part of the continent, where
                    Chilian Patagonia is deluged with almost incessant rain, whilst Argentine
                    Patagonia is dry and arid. In the east, as at Buenos Ayres, there is more rain,
                    which, with southerly winds and occasional north-westerly storms, is often very
                    heavy. The oppressive humidity which is characteristic of the northerly and
                    north easterly winds forms the most disagreeable and unhealthy weather
                    experienced in that part of the country. The climate of Cordova, and also that
                    of some of the more westerly districts, is found very suitable for consumptive
                    patients.</p>
                <p>The first Europeans who visited the River Plate were a party of Spanish explorers
                    in search of a south-west passage to the East Indies. Their leader, Juan Dias de
                    Solis, landed, in 1516, with a few attendants on the north coast <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n548/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0548-0489"/> between Maldonado and Monte Video, where,
                    according to Southey, they were treacherously killed, and then cooked and eaten
                    by the Charrua Indians in sight of their companions on board the vessels. The
                    survivors at once abandoned the country and returned to Spain, reporting the
                    discovery of a fresh-water sea. In 1519 Magalhaens, in the service of the king
                    of Portugal, entered this freshwater sea, or Mar Dulce, as it was then called,
                    but finding no passage to the west, he left it without landing, and then
                    achieved his famous voyage to the East Indies, passing through the strait which
                    bears his name in 1520. After this Sebastian Cabot, already a renowned
                    navigator, who, in the service of Henry VII. of England, had attempted to find a
                    north-west passage to the East Indies, entered the service of Charles I. of
                    Spain, and sailed in command of an expedition fitted out for the purpose of
                    colonising the discoveries of Magalhaens in the East Indies. He, however,
                    entered the River Plate in 1527, and anchored off the present site of the city
                    of Buenos Ayres. He then ascended the Parana, and established a settlement,
                    named San Espiritu, among the Timbù Indians in Santa Fé; and he succeeded in
                    bringing that tribe of Indians to friendly terms with the colony. He continued
                    the ascent of the Parana as far as the cataracts in Missiones, and afterwards
                    explored the Paraguay, from which he entered the Vermejo, where his party
                    suffered severely in a savage fight with the Agaces, or Payaguà Indians. Of this
                    tribe a subdued remnant now lives on the delta of the Pilco-mayo, opposite
                    Asuncion, amalgamating neither with the Spaniards nor with the wild Guaycurus of
                    the surrounding parts of the Chaco. The profusion of silver ornaments worn by
                    these Indians, as well as by the Timbus and Guaranis, led him to give the name
                    of Rio de la Plata, or Silver River, to the splendid stream which he had thus
                    far explored. This name, rendered in English <hi rend="italic">Piver Plate,</hi>
                    is now applied only to the estuary below the junction of the Paranâ and Uruguay.
                    One of Cabot’s lieutenants, detached on a separate exploring expedition up the
                    Uruguay, was killed, together with a great part of his crew, by the Charrua
                    Indians. And subsequently at San Espiritu, an attempt of the chief of the Timbus
                    to obtain possession of one of the Spanish ladies in the settlement led to a
                    treacherous massacre of the garrison. Before this latter occurrence Diego Garcia
                    arrived in the river with an expedition fitted out in Spain, for the purpose of
                    continuing the explorations commenced by De Solis; and Cabot returned to Spain,
                    where he applied to Charles I. for the means of opening communications with Peru
                    by way of the Vermejo. But the resources of the king were absorbed in his
                    struggle as emperor (under the name of Charles V.) with Francis I. of France, so
                    that he was obliged to leave the enterprise of South American discoveries to his
                    wealthy nobles. In August 1534 Mendoza left Cadiz for the River Plate at the
                    head of the largest and wealthiest expedition that had ever left Europe for the
                    New World. In January 1535 he entered the River Plate, where he followed the
                    northern shore to San Gabriel, and then crossing the river, he landed on the
                    Pampas. The name of Buenos Ayres was given to the country by Del Campo, who
                    first stepped ashore where the city of that name now stands, and where, on the
                    2d February, the settlement of Santa Maria de Buenos Ayres was founded; the
                    smaller vessels having been safely harboured in the Riachuelo, half a league
                    south of the settlement. Mendoza’s captains then explored the country between
                    Paraguay and Peru, in which latter country Pizarro had, in 1535, founded the
                    city of Lima. Of one of these expeditions consisting of 200 men, who left
                    Paraguay in February 1537, and are said to have reached the south-east districts
                    of Peru, under Ayolas, every man was killed by the Payaguà Indians in the
                    northern part of the Chaco whilst the expedition was returning laden with
                    plunder. Ayolas had, on his way up the river, built and garrisoned a fort named
                    Corpus Christi among the Timbus in Santa Fé, near the deserted settlement of San
                    Espiritu; and in Paraguay, after three days’ fighting with the Guarani Indians,
                    as narrated by Du Graty, he had, on the 15th August 1536, established a
                    settlement where the city of Asuncion now stands. In the meantime the settlement
                    of Buenos Ayres was attacked and burnt by the Indians; and after terrible
                    sufferings from famine as well as attacks of the Indians, jaguars, and pumas,
                    the Spaniards abandoned the place on the arrival of a fresh expedition from
                    Spain, in company with which they ascended the river, first to Corpus Christi,
                    and then to Asuncion, where, in 1538, Irala was elected captain-general. In 1542
                    Buenos Ayres was re-established by an expedition sent out from Spain for the
                    purpose under Cabesa de Vaca. This able leader landed at Santa Cathe-rina, in
                    Brazil, and marched overland to Asuncion, from which he sent vessels to join the
                    new expedition at Buenos Ayres, reaching that place, according to Southey, just
                    in time to save the new comers from extermination by the Indians. Here the
                    Spaniards again found themselves unable to withstand the incessant attacks of
                    the savages, and the place was a second time abandoned on the 3d February 1543.
                    At Asuncion the Spaniards were more successful in establishing themselves among
                    the Guarani Indians, who, after much severe fighting, finding themselves unable
                    to vanquish the Spaniards, made alliance with them both offensive and defensive,
                    and also intermarried with them. The events which transpired at Asuncion belong,
                    however, to the history of Paraguay. In 1573 Garay, at the head of an expedition
                    despatched from Asuncion, founded the city of Santa Fé near the abandoned
                    settlements of San Espiritu and Corpus Christi. The expulsion of the Spaniards
                    from the latter place had, according to the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Argentina,</hi> resulted from a wanton attack made by them on the
                    Caracara Indians, slaughtering the men, and taking the women captive,—a mode of
                    procedure which all Pampa Indians adopted, and have ever since acted on. It is
                    unfortunate, both for the Indians and for the Spaniards, that the bold <hi
                    rend="italic">conquistadores</hi> were not always under the guidance of such
                    high principled men as Cabot and Cabesa de Vaca. In 1580, when the new colony
                    had been firmly established, Garay proceeded southwards and made the third
                    attempt to establish Buenos Ayres, under the name “Cuidad de la Santissima
                    Trinidad, Puerto de Santa Maria de Buenos Ayres;” and notwithstanding the
                    determined hostility of the Querandi Indians, who were encouraged by the success
                    of their two preceding wars, the Spaniards succeeded in holding the place. The
                    settlement prospered, and the cattle and horses brought from Europe multiplied
                    and spread over the plains of the Pampas. Whilst the Spaniards of the River
                    Plate were thus engaged, Pizarro had effected the conquest of Peru; and his
                    lieutenant, Almagro, had extended the conquest to the south of Chili, from
                    which, in 1559, Hurtado de Mendoza crossed the Andes, and, having defeated the
                    Araucanian Indians, founded the city of Mendoza. It is interesting to observe,
                    that up to the present day the giant chain of the Andes has been a less
                    effective barrier to trade than the rich plains of the Pampas. This state of
                    affairs will, however, now soon be altered by the railway, for which Mr Clark
                    has just obtained a concession, direct from Buenos Ayres to Mendoza. In 1550 the
                    Spaniards from Peru entered the north-western provinces by way of Catamarca, and
                    founded the city of Tucuman in 1565, and that of Cordova in 1573. It was only in
                    1873, just three hundred years after the cities were founded, that the boundary
                    between the jurisdiction of Cordova and that of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n549/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0549-0490"/> Santa Fé was determined by the intervention of
                    the national Government. In 1620 Buenos Ayres was separated from the authority
                    of the Government established at Asuncion, and was made the seat of a Government
                    extending over Mendoza, Santa Fé, Entre Rios, and Corrientes, but at the same
                    time remained, like the Government at Asuncion and that of Tucuman, which latter
                    included Cordova, subject to the authority of the viceroyalty of Peru.</p>
                <p>After the vast expenditure of blood and treasure which was incurred by the
                    Spaniards in establishing themselves on the River Plate as just described, the
                    restrictive legislation of the home Government became a more effective hindrance
                    to the development of its resources and the spread of civilisation over the
                    country than the hostility of the Indian tribes. Cabot had urged the feasibility
                    of opening an easier channel for trade with the interior of Peru through the
                    River Plate and its tributaries than that by way of the West Indies and Panama;
                    and, now that his views seemed about to succeed, the interests of the trade,
                    which had in the meantime been established by the northern route, combined to
                    crush the threatened development of that of the River Plate. Spanish legislation
                    endeavoured to exclude all European nations except Spain from the trade by way
                    of the West Indies, and to prevent any trade from being transacted by way of the
                    River Plate, thus enacting most flagrant injustice towards the people it had
                    enςouraged to settle in the latter country. The hardy pioneers of European
                    civilisation in these regions so far overcame the pernicious influences which
                    acted upon Spanish legislation, that in 1602 they obtained permission to export
                    two shiploads of produce a year. But, to prevent internal trade with Peru, a
                    custom-house was established at Cordova, to levy a duty of fifty per cent, on
                    everything in transit to or from the River Plate. In 1665 a relaxation of this
                    system was brought about by the continued remonstrances of the people; and in
                    1774 free trade was permitted between several of the American posts. In 1776,
                    with a view to better maintaining the country against the encroachments of the
                    Portuguese in their colonies in Brazil, Buenos Ayres was decreed the capital of
                    a viceroyalty, with jurisdiction over the territories of the present republics
                    of Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the Argentine Confederation. All this country
                    was then opened to Spanish trade, even with Peru, and the development of its
                    resources, so long thwarted, was allowed comparatively free play. From this time
                    a succession of viceroys exercised jurisdiction over the whole of these
                    territories. Velasco, however, was made governor of the semi-civilised Indians
                    in the Jesuit settlements of Missiones on the Rivers Parana and Uruguay, subject
                    only to the direct authority of the home Government; and in 1806 he became also
                    governor of the province of Paraguay, under the authority of the viceroyalty of
                    Buenos Ayres, and these offices he still held when the independence of the
                    country was declared.</p>
                <p>The authority of the viceroys was interrupted in the lower part of the River
                    Plate during the wars between England and Spain. On the 27th June 1806 General
                    Beresford landed with a body of troops from a British fleet under command of Sir
                    Home Popham, and obtained possession of the city of Buenos Ayres. The viceroy,
                    Sobremonte, retired to Cordova, where Liniers collected an army from all parts
                    of the country, with which, on the 12th August, he assaulted the city, and
                    Beresford with his troops surrendered. In the meantime Sir Home Popham had taken
                    Maldonado; and in February 1807 Sir Samuel Auchmuty stormed and took the city of
                    Monte Video. In May 1808 General Whitelock, with 8000 men, endeavoured to regain
                    possession of Buenos Ayres; but the inhabitants had made great preparations for
                    resistance, and as all the houses were at that time built with their windows
                    opening on the streets, protected with strong iron railings like prison bars,
                    and with flat roofs, each one was of itself a fortress; so that after suffering
                    terrible slaughter in the long straight streets of the city, the invading army
                    capitulated, agreeing to abandon both banks of the River Plate within two
                    months. Whitelock was brought before a court-martial appointed to inquire into
                    the cause of the failure of the enterprise entrusted to him; the indignation
                    excited against him in England, in consequence of his want of success, was as
                    great as that excited on the River Plate against the viceroy, Sobremonte, in
                    consequence of the first success of the English. The events which we have
                    narrated tended to give self-confidence to the people of Buenos Ayres, who, on
                    applying to the home Government for assistance against the English, had been
                    told that they must protect themselves. But the disturbances which ultimately
                    led to the separation of the country from Spain were initiated by the refusal of
                    the Argentines to acknowledge the Napoleonic dynasty established at Madrid.
                    Liniers, who was viceroy on the arrival of the news of the crowning of Joseph
                    Buonaparte as king of Spain, was deposed by the adherents of Ferdinand VII.; and
                    on the 19th July 1809, Cisneros became viceroy in the name of Ferdinand. In
                    compliance with the urgent appeals of the people, he opened the trade of the
                    country to foreign nations; and on the 25th May 1810, a council was formed, with
                    his consent, under the title of the Provisional Government of the provinces of
                    the Rio de la Plata. This has since been regarded as the commencement of the era
                    of the political independence of the country. Of this council Mariano Morino,
                    the secretary, was the most prominent member, and the people of the city of
                    Buenos Ayres were for some time its only effective supporters. An attempt of the
                    Spanish party to make Cisneros president of the council failed, and he retired
                    to Monte Video. On the 31st January 1813 a congress was assembled at Buenos
                    Ayres, and Posadas was elected dictator of the republic. Monte Video still
                    supported the cause of Spain, but was besieged by the revolutionary army of
                    Buenos Ayres, and capitulated in 1814. A sanguinary struggle between the party
                    of independence and the adherents of Spain spread over all the country of the
                    River Plate; but on the 25th March 1816, a new congress of deputies elected by
                    the people was assembled at Tucuman, where Payridon was declared president of
                    the republic; and on the 9th July the separation of the country from Spain was
                    formally declared, and a state of comparative order was re-established. Buenos
                    Ayres was then declared the seat of government. The whole of the viceroyalty did
                    not, however, acknowledge this Government. Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay,
                    established themselves each as a separate republic, after passing through scenes
                    of disorder, whilst the city of Buenos Ayres was itself the scene of sanguinary
                    disturbances. From this time, however, the struggle for independence became, as
                    regards the Argentine Republic, more of a foreign than a domestic war. The
                    combined forces of Buenos Ayres and Chili defeated the Spaniards at Chacabuco in
                    1817, and at Maypu in 1818; and from Chili the victorious General San Martin led
                    his troops into Peru, where, on the 9th July 1821, he made a triumphal entry
                    into the city of Lima, which had been the greatest stronghold of the Spanish
                    power, having been, from the time of its foundation by Pizarro, the seat of
                    government of the viceroyalty of Peru. A general congress was assembled at
                    Buenos Ayres on the 1st March 1822, in the presence of ambassadors from all the
                    liberated states, and a general amnesty was decreed, though the war was not
                    ended until the 9th December 1824, when the republican forces gained the final
                    victory of Ayacucho, in the Peruvian <pb break="no"

                    did not, however, formally acknowledge the independence of the country until the
                    year 1842. On the 23d January 1825, a National Constitution for the federal
                    states which form the present Argentine Republic was decreed; and on the 2d
                    February of the same year, Sir Woodbine Parish, acting under the instructions of
                    Mr Canning, signed a commercial treaty in Buenos Ayres, by which the British
                    Government acknow ledged the independence of the country. For details of the
                    history of the country up to the time of independence the reader is referred to
                    the work of Sir Woodbine Parish, and to the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Argentina,</hi> published in Buenos Ayres. These works have been
                    followed in this short narrative, except when otherwise stated, or in
                    unquestionable matters to which they do not allude.</p>
                <p>Whilst the events already described were in progress, Buenos Ayres was involved
                    in a war with Brazil, in consequence of the Government of the country having, in
                    1817, taken possession of the Banda Oriental, which, under the rule of Artigas,
                    had become a scene of anarchy. Buenos Ayres, unassisted by the northern
                    provinces, waged war with Brazil for the possession of the Banda Oriental,
                    until, in the year 1827, by the mediation of England, that country was made
                    independent of both powers. The origin and progress of that war are more
                    connected with the history of the Oriental than with that of the Argentine
                    Republic. Under the new régime, inaugurated as above described in 1825,
                    Rivadavia, who was elected president, endeavoured to establish a strong central
                    government; and his party obtained the name of Unitarians in contradistinction
                    to their opponents the Fédérais, who endeavoured to keep each state or province
                    as independent as possible of the National Government At the expiration of
                    Rivadavia’s term of office his opponents triumphed in the election of Vicente
                    Lopez as president; and he was followed in 1827 by Dorrego, another
                    representative of the Federal party. The Unitarians, under the leadership of
                    General Lavalie and his troops, relieved from the war in the Banda Oriental,
                    rebelled against the administration, and in 1828 they defeated the Federals,
                    under Dorrego and General Rosas, in a battle in which Dorrego waβ taken prisoner
                    and afterwards shot. General Rosas then became chief of the Federal party. In
                    1829 he defeated Lavalle; and obtaining from Congress, during a “reign of
                    terror,’’ such extraordinary powers as enabled him to rule as dictator, he
                    became as hostile to many members of the Federal party as to the Unitarians. In
                    1838, a dispute between Rosas and the French Government led to a blockade of the
                    port of Buenos Ayres by the French fleet; and, encouraged by this occurrence,
                    Lavalle, in 1839, returned to the country to rally the Unitarian party. In 1840
                    he invaded the province of Buenos Ayres at the head of troops raised chiefly in
                    the province of Entre Rios; but he was routed by the Federal army under General
                    Pacheco, and was chased as far as the city of Jujuy, where he was overtaken and
                    shot by troops under the command of Oribe. The rule of Rosas was now one of
                    terror and almost incessant bloodshed in Buenos Ayres, whilst his partisans,
                    General Oribe and Colonel Mazza, endeavoured to exterminate the Unitarians
                    throughout the province. This scene of slaughter was extended to the Banda
                    Oriental by the attempt of Oribe, with the support of Rosas, and of Urquiza,
                    governor of Entre Rios, to establish himself as president of that republic,
                    whose existing Government was hostile to Rosas, and sheltered all political
                    refugees from the country under his despotic rule. The siege of Monte Video by
                    the forces of Rosas led to a joint intervention of England and France, and in
                    1845 the English minister plenipotentiary declared Buenos Ayres blockaded, and
                    determined to establish direct communications with the Republic of Paraguay by
                    ascending the Parana, the right of navigating which was denied to foreign flags
                    by Rosas, who had always refused to acknowledge the separation of the Government
                    of Paraguay from the authority of Buenos Ayres. At Point Obligado, just above
                    the delta of the river, a severe fight occurred, in which the men of the
                    combined squadrons landed and carried the batteries by storm, after Captain Hope
                    of the “Firebrand” and his crew had succeeded in cutting a heavy iron chain
                    which closed the river under their fire. The allied forces then proceeded to
                    Paraguay, and proclaimed the navigation of the mighty river which forms the
                    highway to that country free to all nations. Ineffectual attempts were made by
                    the allies to induce the people of the River Plate, and more especially Urquiza,
                    to rise against the despotic rule of Rosas; and finding the accomplishment of
                    this impracticable without an army, they withdrew their several forces, and
                    raised the blockade of Buenos Ayres in 1847. Brazil, whose alliance England and
                    France had rejected in consequence of the opposition of that country to the
                    English policy in the suppression of the slave trade, now came to terms with
                    Urquiza; and the forces of Brazil, under Caxias, allied with those raised and
                    commanded by Urquiza, invaded the province of Buenos Ayres, and routed the army
                    of Rosas on the 3d February 1852 at Monte Caseros, about 10 miles from the city.
                    Rosas escaped from the battlefield in disguise, and sought protection at the
                    house of the English <hi rend="italic">chargé</hi><hi rend="italic">d'affaires
                    fay</hi> whom he was conveyed on board H.B.M. steamer “Locust,” leaving the city
                    in a delirium of joy at its sudden emancipation from his tyranny. A provisional
                    Government was formed under Urquiza, and the Brazilian and Oriental troops
                    retired. Urquiza then assembled all the provincial governors at San Nicholas, in
                    the province of Buenos Ayres, and on the 31st May they proclaimed a new
                    constitution, with Urquiza as provisional director of the Argentine nation. This
                    constitution gave each province two representatives in the Senate or Upper
                    Chamber of a Congress of Representatives, which was duly elected and met at
                    Santa Fé; but the people of Buenos Ayres, considering that their political and
                    commercial pre-eminence were not duly represented in the Congress, rose in
                    rebellion against it on the 11th September. Alsina then became governor of
                    Buenos Ayres; and in the new civil war which was now inaugurated might be
                    regarded as the representative of the city, which was his chief support, in
                    opposition to the peasantry, who throughout the country districts were chiefly
                    partisans of Urquiza, or of Rosas. Alsina resigned office in face of a rising of
                    the country districts, under Colonel Lagos, in favour of a restoration of Rosas;
                    but Pacheco, who had defeated the Unitarian General Lavalle in 1840, rallied the
                    city party, and with the support of the most influential citizens, proclaimed
                    the aged General Pintos provisional governor, and the influence of the leading
                    members of the foreign community was actively exerted in his favour. The defence
                    of the city, now besieged by Lagos, was entrusted to General Hornos; and
                    Urquiza, having been duly elected president by the other thirteen provinces,
                    came to terms with Lagos, and took command of the army of the besiegers; and in
                    April 1853 his fleet blockaded the port. In July the besiegers suddenly
                    disappeared without awaiting an expected sally of the city forces under General
                    Paz, now commander-in-chief. Urquiza signed, on board H.B.M. steamer“Locust,” as
                    representative of the thirteen provinces, a treaty with Sir Charles Hotham, by
                    which the free navigation of the rivers was confirmed. The province of Buenos
                    Ayres then became established as an independent state, and inaugurated an era of
                    commercial and political development, with Obligado as constitutional governor,
                    whilst Parana became the capital of the thirteen provinces under Urquiza.

                    ordinary course through Buenos Ayres caused great irritation in the latter
                    province; but peace was, nevertheless, maintained until 1859, when Alsina again
                    became governor of Buenos Ayres, and the numerous questions in dispute soon led
                    to active hostilities between the Government at Parana and Buenos Ayres. The
                    army of the latter, under General (then Colonel) Mitre, was defeated by the
                    Confederate forces at Cepeda, in the province of Buenos Ayres, in October 1859;
                    and Urquiza re-entered the city, when Alsina resigned his office of governor to
                    Ocampo, and Buenos Ayres rejoined the Confederation, of which Urquiza resigned
                    the presidency. Derqui was then elected president of the fourteen provinces,
                    with the seat of government at Parana; whilst Urquiza became governor of Entre
                    Rios, and Mitre governor of Buenos Ayres. Hostilities, however, recommenced in
                    1861, and the armies of the opposite parties, under Generals Urquiza and Mitre
                    respectively, met at Pavon, in the province of Santa Fé. Mitre this time was
                    victorious, and in 1862 he was elected president of the Argentine Confederation,
                    of which, with the consent of the provincial Legislature, the city of Buenos
                    Ayres became provisionally the capital. Urquiza retired to the province of Entre
                    Rios, of which he continued to be governor. The history of these struggles is
                    ably told by Mr Latham from a Buenos Ayrean point of view; and also, from the
                    opposite side, by Μ. De Moussy, in his able and elaborate work dedicated to
                    Urquiza.</p>
                <p>In 1864 the Republic of Paraguay commenced war against Brazil, and on the 5th
                    February 1865, President Lopez sent a despatch to the Argentine Government,
                    requesting permission for the passage of a Paraguayan army through the province
                    of Corrientes. This Mitre refused, the neutrality of the country having
                    previously been declared. On the morning of the 13th April a Paraguayan fleet
                    entered the port of Corrientes, and, without any previous warning of belligerent
                    intentions, fired into and took possession of two vessels of the Argentine navy
                    which were lying at anchor in the port, and also fired on the crew as they
                    endeavoured to swim ashore to escape the unexpected slaughter. In the course of
                    the following day a detachment of Paraguayan troops took possession of the city,
                    whilst the main body of an invading army marched across the province, and,
                    crossing the Uruguay, invaded Brazil. The sudden seizure of the vessels in the
                    port of Corrientes was the first notification of war which reached the Argentine
                    Government. The official declaration of war, which was dated the 29th March, and
                    was based on a declaration passed in Congress on the 18th, did not reach the
                    Argentine Government until the 3d May. The people of Buenos Ayres were thrown
                    into a frenzy of indignation on the receipt of the news of the above-mentioned
                    hostilities; and on the 1st May a treaty was signed between the Argentine
                    Government, Brazil, and the Oriental Republic, by which these powers mutually
                    bound themselves not to lay down their arms until they had abolished the
                    Government of Lopez, but at the same time guaranteeing the independence of
                    Paraguay. Thus the National Government established at Buenos Ayres was launched
                    into a war which sorely tried its resources, both for the prosecution of the war
                    itself, and for the suppression of the opponents of its policy in some
                    districts. The war was soon carried into Paraguay; but the withdrawal of the
                    main body of the Argentine army, under Generals Paunero and Arredondo, was
                    necessitated by a rebellion in the north-west (January 1867), where the rebels,
                    under Saa and Videla, had obtained control of several of the Provincial
                    Governments. The rebel army was not able to cope with the veterans fresh from
                    the battlefields of Paraguay, who drove them across the Andes into Chili, where
                    they laid down their arms. These internal troubles made it requisite for Mitre
                    to retire from the post of commander-in-chief of the allied forces in the field,
                    which then devolved upon the Brazilian General Caxias. Urquiza, though nominally
                    under the order of the National Government, having, on the outbreak of the war
                    accepted from them the appointment of commander-in-chief of the forces of Entre
                    Rios, virtually held that province in a state of neutrality throughout the war,
                    which was ended by the shooting of Lopez on the 1st March 1870, after the
                    extermination of his army and a large majority of the inhabitants of the
                    country. Urquiza, at the outbreak of the war, was the most renowned and powerful
                    chieftain in the country, and doubt regarding the course he might take was a
                    source of anxiety in Buenos Ayres. He had accumulated immense estates and wealth
                    in Entre Rios; and he was doubtless actuated by an earnest desire to preserve to
                    his province the blessings of peace and commercial prosperity in the midst of
                    the surrounding disturbances. The hope of obtaining support from him is,
                    however, supposed to have encouraged the rebellion of the north-western
                    provinces, which neutralised the reckless audacity with which the Argentine
                    troops fought their first battle in Paraguay. In 1868, whilst the war was going
                    on, Mitre’s term of office as president expired, and Sarmiento was peacefully
                    elected in his place. The close of the Paraguayan war did not bring permanent
                    peace to the country; for, on the 12th April 1870, Urquiza was assassinated at
                    his family residence by some well-known officers of his army, and the provincial
                    Legislature immediately elected Lopez Jordan as governor in his place. The new
                    governor, in his address to Congress on his installation, took upon himself the
                    responsibility of the assassination, and the National Government refused to
                    acknowledge him as governor of the province, on the ground of undue influence
                    having been brought to bear on the members of the Legislature by which he had
                    been elected. The National troops accordingly invaded the province, for the
                    avowed purpose of affording protection for the free expression of opinion in a
                    new election. This became the commencement of a civil war, which materially
                    interfered with the former prosperity of the province, but which was fortunately
                    brought to a conclusion in the end of January 1873, by the Entre-Riano army
                    being completely routed by the National troops, armed with Remington rifles,
                    under Colonel Gainza. The Entre-Riano leader, with about 40 followers, escaped
                    across the Uruguay. Tranquillity has since that time prevailed in Entre
                    Rios.</p>
                <p>Whilst these events were in progress, a rupture between the Argentine Republic
                    and Brazil regarding the settlement of the boundaries of Paraguay, was at one
                    time imminent; but, by the influence of Mitre, who went as special envoy to Rio
                    on the occasion, the friendly relations of the two Governments have, it is
                    hoped, been placed on a secure basis.</p>
                <p>The prosperity of the country received a temporary check in 1874, from a brief
                    revolution initiated when President Avellanda was declared elected. The
                    unsuccessful party, under Brigadier-General Mitre, incensed at their defeat,
                    asserted that the elections had been gained by corrupt and fraudulent practices,
                    and resolved to appeal to arms to overthrow the president-elect. The revolution
                    was declared on 24th September. President Sarmiento, whose tenure of office was
                    just expiring, took active measures to repress the revolt; and no collision of
                    forces had taken place when the new president, Don Nicolas Avellanda, was
                    constitutionally installed on the 12th October. The president followed up with
                    energy the measures of his predecessor to suppress the revolution, and his
                    efforts were crowned with success in two decisive victories over the insurgents
                    by the Government troop»; <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0552-0493"/> whereupon Generals Mitre and Arredondo, with
                    their forces, surrendered at discretion, and were made prisoners (Dec. 2). The
                    revolution had lasted but seventy-six days. On the 17 th December a state
                    holiday was declared, and dedicated to rejoicings on the restoration of peace.
                    The complete and absolute crushing of this revolution has great significance, as
                    it has brought about the dissolution of a powerful and ambitious party, whose
                    movements might have seriously affected the onward march of the country. Those
                    who know the country believe that it will be long before any similar
                    revolutionary attempts can be made with the slightest hopes of success, or the
                    welfare of one of the most favoured countries in the world jeopardised by
                    internal commotion.</p>

                </table>
                <p>The most remarkable features of the present state of the country, as shown by the
                    foregoing table, are the vast extent of the Indian territory and the small
                    number of its inhabitants. Excepting a comparatively narrow tract of land
                    stretching from the southern part of the province of Santa Fé into that of
                    Cordova, and dividing the Indians of the Chaco from those of the Pampas, the
                    dominions of the Indians may be said to extend from the extreme south of the
                    republic, over all the plains of Patagonia, the central parts of the Pampas, and
                    through the Chaco, into the territories of Paraguay and Bolivia. The civilised
                    districts of the west and north-west, which we have seen were settled, the
                    former by way of Chili, and the latter by way of Peru, have now established
                    means of communication with those of the east, except through the district just
                    mentioned. In that district civilisation, of which the Central Argentine Railway
                    is the chief representative, is rapidly establishing and extending itself; but
                    even during the last few years warfare with the Indians on both sides of the
                    line of railway has been almost incessant. In the neighbourhood of Frayle Muerto
                    or Belleville, many Englishmen possessed of some amount of capital established
                    themselves some years ago as cattle farmers, under the protection of modern
                    rifles; but they have been obliged to turn their attention to sheep and
                    agriculture, as offering less tempting plunder to the Indians. It is interesting
                    to record that the city of Cordova, on the west of the Chaco, was founded on the
                    same day, in 1573, as the city of Santa Fé, on the east of that region; and an
                    exploring party from the latter city was saved from being exterminated by the
                    Indians by the timely and unexpected assistance of another party of explorers
                    from the city of Cordova. To the north of Belleville, the land lying between the
                    cities just mentioned is now being peopled by families of Swiss, German, French,
                    Italian, English, and Anglo-American immigrants, who are encouraged by liberal
                    grants of land and assistance from the Provincial Government of Santa Fé; and
                    they appear to be gradually establishing themselves in the country,
                    notwithstanding the hardships they have suffered from the ravages of locusts and
                    the hostility of the Indians. Some of the tribes of the Chaco are among the most
                    savage and intractable in the territory of the republic, though even before the
                    arrival of the Spaniards they supported themselves to some extent by
                    agriculture, and were not so nomadic as the hunting tribes of the south. On the
                    Pampas the Indians appear to be in larger tribes, and their warfare is more
                    formal, since powerful chiefs of the different tribes have considerable control
                    over them, and they in general conform themselves to the policy of peace or war
                    determined on by their chiefs. For many years past the border lands between the
                    Indians and the European settlers in the province of Buenos Ayres have been a
                    scene of constant bloodshed; and some of the Indian invasions have been made on
                    a very extensive scale by a combination of the different tribes. The relations
                    of the Argentine Government with the Indians, it will thus be seen, are in a
                    very unsatisfactory state; and in the midst of all this the condition of the
                    Argentine peasant, or Gaucho, is most deplorable. He has constantly been subject
                    to conscription for service in the army engaged in foreign or civil wars,
                    leaving in the frontier districts his home defenceless against the depredations
                    of the savages. It is true that the Gauchoes may be said to be the primary cause
                    of the civil wars which have devastated the country; for, despising, or at least
                    not appreciating, their constitutional influence, they have been accustomed to
                    regard war as a normal means of subsistence, and to be used as such for its own
                    sake. Nevertheless, in face of the peculiar hardship of the condition of these
                    men, even though in the aggregate self-inflicted, it is scarcely surprising that
                    immigrants are occasionally subjected to annoyances and dangers through a spirit
                    of hostility engendered by feelings of envy, as the Gaucho is subjected to the
                    conscription, whilst the foreigner is undisturbed in his industrious
                    occupations. Families have fallen victims to the sudden outburst of animosity on
                    the part of the Gauchoes, who when once roused have been as cruel as the
                    Indians; and, though the arguments which might be pleaded in extenuation for the
                    latter cannot be applied to the former, their condition is a practical evil, and
                    enlightened legislation for these frontier districts is one of the most urgent
                    necessities of the country. The war with Paraguay, and subsequently the war in
                    Entre Rios, have exhausted the resources of the Government, leaving the Indian
                    frontier almost undefended. The tribes of the Pampas have established
                    settlements, from which they scour the country in pursuit of game; and it is not
                    improbable that some of their recent raids upon the civilised districts have
                    been forced upon them by the immediate necessities of their position, resulting
                    from their improvident mode of living and the absence of agricultural pursuits
                    among them. On the slopes of the Sierra Ventana, north of Bahia Blanca, many
                    Englishmen have established themselves as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0553-0494"/> sheep farmers, where the land stretches away into
                    the Indian territories, without an armed force or a barrier of any sort
                    intervening, and their protection from the savages lies in the respect the
                    latter have for the Snider rifle, combined with the greater attraction which the
                    cattle farms of the north have for the plunderers. On the Rio Negro English
                    settlers are engaged in agricultural pursuits on a soil whose fertility for the
                    production of wheat and other cereals may be said to be unrivalled. To the south
                    of this the country to a great extent accords with the description erroneously
                    applied to all the country south of the River Plate by Guerara, who says that it
                    is a barren land without timber for building, without firewood, without water,
                    without soil to receive seed, and without anything that a city requires for its
                    maintenance. Nevertheless, in the country thus described, a Welsh colony has
                    established itself on the Chupat River; and, though at first they suffered
                    severe hardships, and were saved from starvation only by food supplied by the
                    Tehuelche Indians in the first instance, and afterwards by similar supplies from
                    the Argentine Government, there appears no reason now why it should not become a
                    prosperous colony. In the far south, on the Santa Cruz River, the Argentine
                    Government have a military establishment. The tribes of Patagonia do not appear
                    to have any settled villages, but make the whole country a vast hunting ground.
                    The different parties meet in their excursions either as friends or as foes,
                    just as accident, the humour of the moment, or any occasion of enmity between
                    the chieftains determines. The game on which they live is superabundant, and the
                    chief impediment to an increase of the population seems to be the remorseless
                    butchery which ensues on the meeting of hostile hunting tribes, which sometimes
                    results in the extermination of one party or the other; and also the incessant
                    slaughter resulting from sudden quarrels among members of the same party.
                    Lieutenant Musters, of the Royal Navy, has recently traversed the country from
                    the Strait of Magellan to the Rio Negro with one of the hunting tribes; his book
                    may be commended to those who desire to be better acquainted with that wild
                    country and its inhabitants. The Tehuelche Indians, with whom he travelled,
                    average about 5 feet 10 inches in stature, but he describes the Arau-canians as
                    somewhat taller and equally athletic. All the Indian tribes have more or less of
                    the peculiar characteristics of the red or copper-coloured race, and analogies
                    in the languages of the numerous tribes also indicate an identity of origin.
                    According to their traditions at the time of the discovery of the country by the
                    Spaniards, as recorded by Guerara, their ancestors came from the north, and they
                    also held confused traditions of the disasters of the deluge.</p>
                <p>The foregoing historical sketch will have given the reader some insight into the
                    government of the country. The framers of the Constitution professed to be
                    guided by that of the United States of North America, and freely adopted the
                    liberal principles there embodied. The president is elected for a term of six
                    years, and the president of the Senate, elected to that office by his
                    fellow-senators, becomes ex-officio vice-president of the republic. The
                    government is conducted by a ministry responsible to Congress, and an adverse
                    vote of the Senate and deputies on any important question leads to the formation
                    of a new ministry. The number of senators and deputies returned by each province
                    is in proportion to the number of its inhabitants. Each province has its own
                    independent form of government for all matters not expressly delegated to the
                    National Gover-ment, and is supposed to have irresponsible jurisdiction in its
                    own affairs so long as the articles of the National Constitution are not
                    contravened. The city of Buenos Ayres, besides being the seat of the Government
                    of the province, is also the seat of the National Government, having been so
                    declared by the Constitution, until such time as a suitable site for a new
                    capital for the republic may be determined on by the Legislature. Not only the
                    Constitution itself, but also the spirit in which its enactments are carried
                    out, is thoroughly liberal, and worthy of the magnificent country over which
                    civilisation, under its enlightened regulation, is struggling successfully
                    against barbarism. Fresh arrivals from Europe are not only cordially welcomed,
                    but every effort is made by the authorities to induce foreigners to settle in
                    the country. They are free either to naturalise themselves as Argentines, or to
                    maintain their foreign nationality; in the latter case they have not the
                    privilege of a vote in the government of the country, nor are they liable to the
                    conscription for service in the army. In other respects the law is the same for
                    all. Every one born in the country is by law an Argentine.</p>
                <p>The population of the city of Buenos Ayres is almost thoroughly European, nearly
                    one-half being, in fact, foreigners born in Europe. But on passing from that
                    city into the country the Mestizo race becomes more prominent; and in the
                    northern provinces, as in Paraguay and Peru, the Mestizoes, with Indian blood
                    predominating, form the majority of the population. The Negroes, or Mestizoes in
                    whom Negro blood can be traced, do not form an important part of the population
                    as they do in Brazil. The difference between the two countries in this respect
                    is, in fact, very striking. Slavery was abolished during the war of
                    independence; and the importation of Negroes, which had never been an extensive
                    trade, then ceased; and the constant stream of immigration from Europe, which of
                    late years has been steadily augmenting, is gradually changing the aspect of the
                    population of the country. In 1858 the arrivals amounted to only 4600 persons;
                    but they increased every year till they amounted to 29,000 in 1868, 37,000 in
                    1869, 41,000 in 1870, 20,000 in 1871, 40,000 in 1872, 80,000 in 1873, and about
                    90,000 in 1874. This constantly increasing stream of immigration has been
                    absorbed into the various industries of the country as fast as the new arrivals
                    reach its shores. As regards the nationalities of the immigrants, the Italians
                    are the most numerous, then the French, Spaniards, Germans, English, and Swiss.
                    During the above-mentioned years the new arrivals have almost always found their
                    services eagerly sought for at wages of 8 to 10 shillings a day for the most
                    ordinary employments, and at proportionally higher rates for skilled workmen.
                    The comparatively small amount of the immigration in 1871 is due to the
                    occurrence of the epidemic of yellow fever which decimated the population of the
                    city of Buenos Ayres in the early part of that year, and caused the bulk of the
                    emigrants from Europe on their way to the country to stop at the ports of Brazil
                    and at Monte Video, and turned the tide of emigration from Europe in other
                    directions at the close of the year. Though this terrible pestilence is said to
                    have been imported from Brazil, its rapid spread in the city can clearly be
                    ascribed to temporary causes which even the unrivalled salubrity of the climate
                    was insufficient to neutralise. In the absence of any artificial drainage the
                    cleanliness of the city had depended on its occasional scouring by the heavy
                    rains, whilst an ever increasing number of cesspools have been accumulating
                    filth beneath the houses; and up to the year 1870 the consumption of water,
                    beyond the amount of rain water accumulated in tanks in the houses of the
                    wealthy, was limited by the cost of cartage from the river; but in that year new
                    water-works w ere opened, by which a supply is pumped up from the river, and
                    conveyed by pipes to all parts of the city, and the increased waste of water
                    may, by leading to an unusual disturbance of the cesspools, have partly
                    contributed to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0554-0495"/> the spread of the epidemic. Though frightfully
                    contagious in the city, the disease was not so in the country; and no instance
                    could, it is believed, be recorded in which it was communicated to those who
                    nursed patients that took the disease from the city, and sickened and died in
                    the suburbs. It is hoped that the extensive drainage works which the Provincial
                    Government is having constructed under the superintendence of Mr Bateman will
                    obviate the risk of another outbreak of a plague, which whilst it lasted put a
                    stop to commercial pursuits and almost disorganised society. The total number of
                    foreigners in the Argentine Republic at the time of the last census, was,
                    according to the <hi rend="italic">Almanach</hi><hi rend="italic">de Gotha,</hi>
                    212,000. A recent writer, who has given particular attention to the subject,
                    says, “There are about 40,000, between Irish, Scotch, and English settlera and
                    their families, in quiet and undisputed possession of about two millions of
                    acres of land in the province of Buenos Ayres alone; in the full enjoyment of
                    all religious and social liberty. They own upwards of 35,000,000 sheep, besides
                    horned cattle, horses, and valuable buildings The bulk of this vast property has
                    been acquired in the country by men who on their arrival did not possess a
                    sixpence.”</p>
                <p>Excepting the mining districts in the north-west of the republic, the
                    agricultural district of Chivilcoy, in the north of the province of Buenos
                    Ayres, the agricultural colonies of Santa Fé, and the establishments of the
                    English settlers in the north of Patagonia, the Argentine Republic is at present
                    a pastoral country. The manufacturing and agricultural pursuits of the
                    north-western provinces are not important items in the general wealth of the
                    republic. The development of its vast resources as a mining and agricultural
                    country has scarcely commenced; and its greatest wealth is at present
                    represented by the herds of cattle and sheep -which graze upon its fertile
                    plains. The manufactures and luxuries imported into the country are paid for
                    with the annual increase of these flocks and herds, though the latter are not so
                    numerous as in an equal area of Central and Western Europe. The number of herd
                    cattle in the country may be roughly estimated at from 15 to 18 millions; of
                    which, in the year 1866, the province of Buenos Ayres contained 6,800,000; Entre
                    Rios, 2,500,000; and Corrientes, 2,000,000. In the same year Buenos Ayres
                    contained 60,000,000 sheep; and Entre Rios and Corrientes together, 7,000,000.
                    The number of sheep in the whole country is estimated at 100,000,000.</p>

                <p>Of this tonnage the proportion returned for English vessels is no less than 30
                    per cent.; French vessels rank next, with 16 per cent.; then Argentine and
                    Italian, 12 per cent. each. There are twelve lines of steamers constantly plying
                    between Europe and Buenos Ayres. The passage occupies about twenty-nine
                    day3.</p>
                <p>The advancement of the Argentine Republic has received a great impetus from the
                    introduction of steam communication and telegraphy. The first railway was opened
                    in 1857; and in 1874 there were more than 800 miles open for traffic, with about
                    1000 miles more in course of construction. A system of tramways was commenced in
                    the city of Buenos Ayres in 1869. There are now about 80 miles within the city
                    and suburbs, and this means of transit is being extended to all the smaller
                    towns. There are in use within the republic above 7000 miles of telegraphic
                    wires. Complete communication is now established with Europe, the first
                    telegrams having been exchanged with London on 4th August 1874.</p>
                <p>The province of Buenos Ayres is, in wealth and general importance, far in advance
                    of all the other provinces of the Confederation. Under the enlightened
                    administration of Senor Castro, the late governor, great improvements have been
                    made in the means of communication throughout the province, which is the first
                    step requisite for the due development of its resources. Besides railway
                    extensions a great number of iron bridges have been imported from England and
                    erected under the superintendence of Mr Coghlan, by order of the Provincial
                    Government of Buenos Ayres. The National and Provincial Governments established
                    in the city of Buenos Ayres are rivals in their efforts to promote the true
                    welfare and prosperity of the country. Senor Acosta, the governor of the
                    province, may be relied on to continue the policy of assisting the development
                    of the resources of the country, which may almost be said to have been
                    inaugurated by his predecessor. And his Excellency Senor Sarmiento, whose term
                    of ^office as president of the republic expired in October 1874, must, from his
                    unceasing exertions in the cause of education, be regarded as one of the
                    greatest benefactors of the country.</p>

                <p>The revenue, as shown by the above tables, is obtained chiefly from the
                    Custom-House; and of the duties on the foreign trade of the country more than
                    four-fifths are collected in Buenos Ayres. The ordinary expenditure for 1872 is
                    returned as 7,419,832 dollars; but to this the interest of the national debt has
                    to be added, with other extraordinary expenditure, raising the whole amount to
                    23,992,975 dollars. The deficit in 1872 was thus 5,820,596 dollars. Besides the
                    expenses of the National Government, each province has its separate, revenue.
                    That of the province of Buenos Ayres amounted in 1871, as shown by the Report of
