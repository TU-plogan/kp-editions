                        Frederick</hi></label>, a German philosopher and philologist of considerable
                    distinction, was born at Gotha in 1778. He was educated at the gymnasium of that
                    town, and afterwards at the university of Jena. He distinguished himself as a
                    student, and in 1802 he became a privat-docent in his alma mater. Three years
                    later he was appointed professor of classical literature in the university of
                    Landshut, where he remained until 1826. when that institution was transferred to
                    Munich. In this latter city he spent the rest of his life. In recognition of his
                    services as a teacher and author he was made an aulic councillor, and a member
                    of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. He died on the 30th of December 1841. Ast
                    was an independent although not an original thinker. He was more of a scholar
                    and critic than a philosopher. He belonged to the school of Schelling, but was
                    ready to welcome truths from the most diverse quarters. His writings on
                    aesthetics,— <hi rend="italic">System</hi><hi rend="italic">der Kunstlehre</hi>
                    (1805) and <hi rend="italic">Grundriss der</hi><hi rend="italic">Aesthetik</hi>
                    (1807),—although containing no distinctively new thoughts, had the merit not
                    only of combining and elaborating the principles of Schelling on beauty and art,
                    but of supplementing them to some extent by the views of Winckelmann, Lessing,
                    Kant, Herder, Schiller, Jean Paul, and others, on these subjects. His <hi
                        rend="italic">Grundlinien der Philosophie,</hi> published in 1807, was
                    republished in 1809, but soon after sank into oblivion. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Grundriss einer Geschichte der Philosophie,</hi> also published in 1807,
                    was longer lived, and deservedly. It was the best book of the kind which the
                    Schelling school could show, at least until the publication of Rixner’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Manual,</hi> fifteen years later. It is among the earliest of
                    the works pervaded by the thought, so familiar now but so fresh then, that the
                    history of philosophy is not a history of opinions, but the history of reason,
                    the several philosophies being only stages in the development of the one true
                    philosophy, the gradually self-revealing absolute reason. It is also among the
                    earliest attempts to “construe” the history of philosophy and to formulate its
                    law of movement. The author published a second edition of it in 1825, and <hi
                        rend="italic">Hauptmomente der Geschichte der Philosophie</hi> in 1829. In
                    two works, both published in 1808, he sought to determine and expound the
                    principles of the chief divisions of the study in which he was strongest. They
                    are his <hi rend="italic">Grundlinien der Philologie</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Grundlinien der Grammatik, Hermeneutik, und Kritik.</hi> Both have been
                    commended by competent judges. His reputation as a philologist, however, rests
                    mainly on the vast and toilsome labours on Plato, which occupied the last
                    twenty-five years of his life. His <hi rend="italic">Platon’s</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Leben und Schriften,</hi> published in 1816, is the earliest
                    of those elaborate critical inquiries regarding the life of Plato, the
                    authenticity of the works which have come down to us under his name, the order
                    of their composition, their purpose, plan, &amp;c., which may be regarded as
                    having had their proximate cause in the celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                        >Introductions</hi> of Schleiermacher, and their primary cause in the
                    historical scepticism of Niebuhr and Wolf. He allows scarcely any weight to the
                    ancient biographies and traditions; but, taking a few of the finest dialogues as
                    standards, he draws from them the criteria in virtue of which he accepts or
                    rejects the others. He pronounces spurious not only those compositions which are
                    generally admitted to be so,—the <hi rend="italic">Epinomis, Minos,
                        Theages,</hi><hi rend="italic">Erastae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Clitopho,
                        Hipparchus, Eryxias,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Letters and
                        Definitions,</hi> but also the <hi rend="italic">Meno, Euthydemus,
                        Charmides, Lysis, Laches,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">First and
                        Second</hi><hi rend="italic">Alcibiades,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Hippias</hi><hi rend="italic">Major and Minor,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ion, Euthyphron, Apology,</hi><hi rend="italic">Crito,</hi> and even, in
                    defiance of the explicit testimony of Aristotle, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Laws.</hi> He arranges the dialogues, which he admits to be genuine, into
                    three series; the group which he regards as the earliest in date of composition,
                    and which he describes as characterised by the predominance of the poetical and
                    dramatical element, consists of the <hi rend="italic">Protagoras,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Phoedrus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gorgias,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Phoedo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the second, distinguished
                    by the marked prominence of dialectic keenness and subtility, comprises the <hi
                        rend="italic">Theaetetus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sophist, Statesman,
                        Parmenides,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cratylus;</hi> while the third,
                    displaying the dialectical and poetical qualities of Plato’s mind in
                    interpenetration and harmony, includes the <hi rend="italic">Philebus, Banquet,
                        liepublic, Timaeus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Critias.</hi> This book was
                    followed by a complete edition of Plato’s works (1819-32) in 11 vols., with a
                    Latin translation, and a learned commentary, which occupies the last two
                    volumes. Professor Ast crowned these laboura by his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic">Platonicum</hi> (1834-9), in 3 vols., one of
                    the most comprehensive and valuable of special dictionaries. He wrote various
                    other works of less importance than those which have been mentioned. <hi
