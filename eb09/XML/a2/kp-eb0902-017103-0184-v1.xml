                    the islands and in Greece proper. The obvious facts are—first, that Aphrodite
                    was not associated with any of the legendary families of the mainland of Greece,

                    non-Hellenic, and more or less Asiatic in origin; secondly, that her worship in
                    Cyprus, as Herodotus was told (i. 105), had been transplanted from Ascalon,
                    where was the oldest temple of a goddess whom the Greeks translated into
                    Aphrodite Urania, and identified with the Alitta of the Arabians, the Mylitta of
                    the Assyrians, and the Astarte of the Phoenicians; thirdly, that this Astarte or
                    Mylitta was a goddess of the heavens (Urania), or better, of the heavenly
                    bodies, and, though the details are unknown, doubtless personified the harmony
                    of their movements while controlling their supposed influence on human affairs,
                    not least their influence on the sea, in which respect her worship would commend
                    itself to a seafaring and trading people like the Phoenicians. As the universal
                    goddess of love, her province embraced every phase of nature. While this, which
                    was the basis of the character of Astarte, was the basis also of the character
                    of Aphrodite; and while, through commercial ascendency, the alphabet of the
                    Phoenicians, and their system of numbers, weights, and measures were adopted by
                    the Greeks, there is nothing in the way of assuming that the idea of their
                    goddess Aphrodite was borrowed under similar circumstances. If the 15th century
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> be correctly assigned as the period of the
                    Phoenician settlements in Greece, there would be interval enough before the time
                    of Homer to admit of the new goddess becoming Hellenised and obtaining a place
                    in Olympus; and this would be brought about with the greater facility if, as is
                    supposed, the Oriental goddess really supplanted a cruder form of a goddess of
                    love previously existing in the Greek system. How widely the scope of love was
                    interpreted in the last days of Greece, may be seen, on the one hand, from the
                    manner in which the unseemly account of the birth of Aphrodite in Hesiod was
                    elevated into a scene at which all the higher deities were present, as rendered
                    by Phidias on the base of the statue of Zeus at Olympia; and, on the other hand,
                    from the fact that the philosophers, particularly the earlier thinkers in
                    natural philosophy, conceived heaven, earth, and sea as bound into an harmonious
                    whole by the power of love. A very different interpretation was put upon it in
                    later times when sensual indulgence was the master feeling, and Aphrodite became
                    the patroness of hetaerae. For these two different characters she bore the
                    titles of <hi rend="italic">Urania</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pandemus.</hi>
                    Under the former title she was not only a goddess of the heavens, in respect of
                    the fertility which they produce on earth, but was also a goddess of victory,
                    either herself armed or occupied with the arms of Ares (Mars). Her power
                    extended to the sea, but only to soothe it, and hence she was worshipped in
                    seaports with the epithet of ∈{⅛∙λoια. Where her influence, however, was mostly
                    felt was in the gardens among the flowers in springtime. It was then that her
                    principal festivals occurred, and in such places and at such a time the full
                    charm of her character as goddess of love was appreciated. The Graces <hi
                        rend="italic">{Charites')</hi> and the Seasons <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Horoe)</hi> worked her garments with flowers, from which a scent came as
                    in nature. The sweetness of her smile, her persuasive voice, and her entire
                    beauty were then irresistible. From being the goddess of beauty and love
                    throughout nature, she became goddess of love in the hearts of gods and men;
                    either inspiring a passion for herself, as in the case of Pygmalion and
                    Anchises, or herself inflamed with love, as for Adonis and Cinyras, the reputed
                    founder of her worship in Cyprus; or again inspiring a passion between two other
                    persons, as between Paris and Helena, and between Phaon and the women of Lesbos.
                    When the subjects were women, her power was frequently carried to a desperate
                    issue, as in the cases of Medea, Pasiphaë, Phaedra, and many others. But she
                    gave also the pleasures of love, and while this led to the degradation of her
                    character finally, it was differently viewed in earlier times, in which she was
                    in this matter simply the goddess of domestic life and of the relations between
                    families, being in some places associated with Eileithyia, the goddess of
                    childbirth, or elsewhere regarded, like Artemis, as a guardian of children and
                    young maidens. It seems, indeed, as if it had been for the protection of family
                    love that she was made to assume after Solon’s time the protection of the
                    institutions for hetaerae. Among the other deities her power and also—after the
                    rivalry of Hera (Juno) and Athene (Minerva) had been set aside by the judgment
                    of Paris—her surpassing beauty were acknowledged. Eros (Cupid), the male
                    personification of love, who at one time is called her son, at another is
                    present at her birth, is the chief of her companions, the others being Himeros,
                    Pothos, Anteros, Peitho, the Graces, and the Seasons. She was the wife of
                    Hephaestos (Vulcan), and if in that capacity she was unfaithful with Ares, as in
                    the ludicrous incident when the two were caught in the cunning net made by her
                    husband, there yet appears some ground for the invention of this myth, in the
                    fact of her being associated in worship with Ares at</p>
                <p>Thebes. Her connection with Ares may have originated in the character of <hi
                        rend="italic">Areia,</hi> which she derived from the Oriental goddess, her
                    prototype. As an armed goddess she appeared at Cythera and in other of the
                    earliest seats of her worship. It was only as <hi rend="italic">Charis,</hi> the
                    personification of grace and refined skill, that she could have been the wife of
                    Hephaestos, and this is the name which in that capacity she bears in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> In the Trojan war she was opposed to the Greeks,
                    and protected Aeneas, Hector, and Paris. The chief seats of her worship were
                    Cyprus, Cythera, Cnidus, Corinth, Thebes, Sicily, and Athens. Her usual symbols
                    were the tortoise, dove, swan, hare, dolphin, and goat. In Paphos, where was the
                    oldest form of her religion, she was worshipped under the image of a ball or
                    pyramid surrounded by burning torches. In the best days of art every charm of
                    beauty was exhausted for her statues, culminating in the Aphrodite at Cnidus by
                    Praxiteles. Of existing statues, the Venus of Milo and the Venus of Capua are
                    the best examples. With regard to the native Roman goddess Venus, as
                    distinguished from the Venus who through contact with the Greeks was afterwards
                    identified with Aphrodite, it is known that her worship did not exist in the
                    time of the kings, and that it was introduced into Rome from Lavinium, Ardea,
                    and Gabii, where she was connected with Aeneas and his advent into Italy. But
                    for the rest, whether she was the goddess called Venilia, or a native goddess of
                    gardens, is uncertain. Doubtless her functions were in important instances
                    exchangeable with those of Aphrodite; and this being so, it was an obvious gain
                    to incorporate with their own goddess another whose relations with Mars and
                    Anchises, the founders of the Roman race, were express and distinct <pb

                    fields Venus was associated with Priapus; in the spring time with its flowers
                    she was sacrificed to by young maidens; in war she was Victrix; in peace,
                    Concordia and Conciliatrix; on the sea she was Marina; as Libentina (Lubentina)
                    she was goddess of desires; as Libitina, goddess of death; and as Genetrix, the
                    founder of families, especially of the Julian family. The derivation of her name
