                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0602-0541"/> a valuable chemical process for dyeing hair, he
                    was in consequence enabled to amass a little property. It is unfortunate that
                    very little is known of the steps by which he was led to those inventions that
                    have immortalised his name. His residence in a district where a considerable
                    manufacture of linen goods, and of linen and cotton mixed, was carried on, must
                    have given him ample opportunities of becoming acquainted with the various
                    processes that were in use in the cotton manufacture, and of the attempts that
                    had been made and were then making to improve them. His attention was thus
                    naturally drawn to this peculiar department; and, while he saw reason to
                    conclude that it was likely to prove the most advantageous in which he could
                    engage, he had sagacity and good fortune to invent and improve those
                    extraordinary machines by which, unlike most inventors, he amassed vast wealth,
                    at the same time that he added prodigiously to the demand for labour, and to the
                    riches and comfort of the civilised world.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">spinning-jenny,</hi> invented in 1767 by Hargraves, a
                    carpenter at Blackburn in Lancashire, gave the means of spinning twenty or
                    thirty threads at once with no more labour than had previously been required to
                    spin a single thread. The thread spun by the jenny could not, however, be used,
                    except as weft, being destitute of the firmness or hardness required in the
                    longitudinal threads or warp. But Mr Arkwright supplied this deficiency by the
                    invention of the <hi rend="italic">spinning-frame—</hi> which spins a vast
                    number of threads of any degree of fineness and hardness. It is not difficult to
                    understand the principle on which this machine is constructed, and the mode of
                    its operation. It consists of two pairs of rollers, turned by means of
                    machinery. The lower roller of each pair is furrowed or fluted longitudinally,
                    and the upper one is covered with leather, to make them take a hold of the
                    cotton. If there were only one pair of rollers, it is clear that a carding of
                    cotton, passed between them, would be drawn forward by the revolution of the
                    rollers; but it would merely undergo a certain degree of compression from their
                    action. No sooner, however, has the carding, or <hi rend="italic">roving</hi> as
                    it is technically termed, begun to pass through the first pair of rollers, than
                    it is received by the second pair, which are made to revolve with (as the case
                    may be) three, four, or five times the velocity of the first pair. By this
                    ingenious contrivance the roving is drawn out into a thread of the desired
                    degree of tenuity, a twist being given to it by the adaptation of the spindle
                    and fly of the common flax wheel to the machinery. Such is the principle on
                    which Arkwright constructed his famous spinning-frame. It is obvious that it is
                    radically different from the previous methods of spinning either by the common
                    hand-wheel or distaff, or by the jenny, which is only a modification of the
                    common wheel. The idea was entirely original, and was perfected and reduced to
                    practice with consummate skill. Arkwright stated that he accidentally derived
                    the first hint of his great invention from seeing a red-hot iron bar elongated
                    by being made to pass between rollers; and though there is no mechanical analogy
                    between that operation and his process of spinning, it is not difficult to
                    imagine that, by reflecting upon it and placing the subject in different points
                    of view, he might be led by it to his invention. The precise date of the
                    discovery is not known; but it is most probable that the idea had occurred to
                    his mind aβ early as the period when Hargraves was engaged in the invention of
                    the jenny, or almost immediately after. Not being himself a practical mechanic,
                    Arkwright employed John Kay, a watchmaker at Warrington, to whom we shall
                    afterwards have to refer, to assist him in the preparation of the parte of his
                    machine. An application in 1767 to Mr Atherton of Liverpool for pecuniary
                    assistance was unsuccessful, though he is said to have sent some workmen to
                    assist in the construction of the machine, the first model of which was set up
                    in the parlour of the house belonging to the Free Grammar School at Preston.</p>
                <p>His inventions being at length brought into a pretty advanced state, Arkwright,
                    accompanied by Kay, and a Mr Smalley of Preston, removed to Nottingham in 1768,
                    in order to avoid the attacks of the same lawless rabble that had driven
                    Hargraves out of Lancashire. Here his operations were at first greatly fettered
                    by a want of capital. But Mr Strutt of Derby, a gentleman of great mechanical
                    skill, and largely engaged in the stocking manufacture, having seen Arkwright’s
                    inventions, and satisfied himself of their extraordinary value, immediately
                    entered, conjointly with his partner, Mr Need, into partnership with him. The
                    command of the necessary funds being thus obtained, Arkwright erected his first
                    mill, which was driven by horses, at Nottingham, and took out a patent for
                    spinning by rollers in 1769. But as horsepower was found too expensive, he built
                    a second factory, on a much larger scale, at Cromford in Derbyshire, in 1771,
                    the machinery of which was turned by a water-wheel, after the manner of the
                    famous silk-mill erected by Sir Thomas Lombe. Having made several additional
                    discoveries and improvements in the processes of carding, roving, and spinning,
                    he took out a fresh patent for the whole in 1775; and thus completed a series of
                    machinery so various and complicated, yet so admirably combined and well adapted
                    to produce the intended effect in its most perfect form, as to excite the
                    admiration of every one capable of appreciating the ingenuity displayed and the
                    difficulties overcome.</p>
                <p>When the vast importance of these discoveries became generally known, it is not
                    surprising that, every effort should have been made to have the patents set
                    aside, and Arkwright deprived of the profit and honour to be derived from them.
                    But an attentive consideration of the various proceedings relative to this
                    subject will show that there are no good grounds for crediting the statement
                    made in the Court of King’s Bench in 1785, and again repeated by Mr Guest in his
                    work on the cotton manufacture, which ascribes the invention of spinning by
                    rollers to Highs, or Hayes, from whom Arkwright is said to have learned it.</p>
                <p>Arkwright’s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> patent for spinning by rollers, which is
                    the essential part of his inventions, was obtained, as we have previously
                    stated, in 1769; and its value and importance were no longer doubtful after the
                    establishment of the factory at Cromford in 1771. The success which attended
                    this novel method of spinning naturally excited the strongest desire on the part
                    of the Lancashire manufacturers to participate in the advantages to be derived
                    from it; and the fair presumption is that, instead of attempting clandestinely
                    to pirate the invention, they would, had they conceived there were any good
                    grounds to go upon, have at once contested the validity of the patent. But no
                    such attempt was made till 1781, <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> years after the
                    date of the first patent, and <hi rend="italic">six</hi> years after the date of
                    the second. And even then, Arkwright’s opponents came forward only in
                    consequence of his having resolved to vindicate his rights, which had begun to
                    be invaded on all sides, by raising an action against Colonel Mordaunt for an
                    infringement of his patent. Mordaunt was supported by a combination of
                    manufacturers and, as they felt the question to be of the greatest importance,
                    it is all but impossible to suppose that anything would be omitted on their part
                    which was conceived likely to contribute to their success. The case having been
                    tried in the Court of King’s Bench, after Trinity term, July 1781, the decision
                    was unfavourable to Arkwright. But it is of importance to observe, that no
                    attempt was made at the trial to charge him with having purloined the inventions
                    of others, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n603/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0603-0542"/> and that the verdict was given on the sole ground
                    of the <hi rend="italic">description of the machinery in the specification being
                    obscure and indistinct.</hi> Arkwright admitted that this was partly the case;
                    adding, however, that the obscurity had been intended only to prevent foreigners
                    from pirating his inventions. On any other principle, indeed, his conduct would
                    be inexplicable; for, as his inventions were fully known to hundreds of workmen
                    in his own employment, and as he had sold the privilege of using them to many
                    persons in different parts of the country, it is impossible to suppose that he
                    could either have expected or intended to conceal his inventione after the
                    expiration of his patent. In consequence of the result of this trial, Arkwright
                    and his partners prepared a “case,” setting forth the value of the inventions,
                    and the circumstances which had led to the indistinctness complained of in the
                    specification, which they at one time intended to lay before Parliament, as the
                    foundation of an application for an Act for their relief. But this intention was
                    subsequently abandoned; and in a new trial (Arkwright <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Nightingale), which took place in the Court of Common Pleas on the 17th of
                    February 1785, Lord Loughborough, the presiding judge, having expressed himself
                    favourably with respect to the sufficiency of the specification, a verdict was
                    given for Arkwright. On this, as on the former trial, nothing was stated against
                    the originality of the invention.</p>
                <p>In consequence of these conflicting verdicts, the whole matter was brought, by a
                    writ of <hi rend="italic">scire facias,</hi> before the Court of King’s Bench,
                    to have the validity of the patent finally settled. And it was not till this
                    third trial, which took place before Mr Justice Buller and a special jury, on
                    the 25th of June 1785, that Arkwright’s claim to the inventions which formed the
                    subject of the patent was disputed. To support this new allegation, Arkwright’s
                    opponents brought forward, for the first time, Highs, or Hayes, a reed-maker at
                    Bolton. He stated that he had invented a machine for spinning by rollers
                    previously to 1768; that he had employed the watchmaker Kay to make a model of
                    that machine; and Kay was produced to prove that he had communicated that model
                    to Arkwright, and that that was the real source of all his pretended inventions.
                    Having no idea that any attempt was to be made at so late a period to overturn
                    the patent on this new ground, Arkwright’s counsel were not prepared with
                    evidence to repel this statement; but it was stated by Mr Sergeant Adair, on a
                    motion for a new trial on the 10th of November of the same year, that he was
                    furnished with affidavits contradicting, in the most pointed manner, the
                    evidence that had been given by Kay and others with respect to the originality
                    of the invention. The court, however, refused to grant a new trial, on the
                    ground that, whatever might be the fact as to the question of originality, the
                    deficiency in the specification was enough to sustain the verdict. But,
                    independently altogether of the statements made on the motion for a new trial,
                    the improbability of the story told by Highs and Kay seems glaring and obvious.
                    Highs states in his evidence that he had accused Arkwright of getting possession
                    of his invention by means of Kay so early as 1769, or about that period. Where,
                    then, it may be asked, was this Mr Highs ever since that period, and
                    particularly during the first trial in July 1781, and the second in February
                    1785? Living in Lancashire, associating with manufacturers, and in the habit, as
                    he declares in his evidence, of making machines for them, he could not fail to
                    be speedily informed with respect to the vast importance and value of the
                    invention Arkwright had purloined from him. It is impossible but he must have
                    been acquainted with the efforts that were making by the Lancashire
                    manufacturers to set aside the patents; and is it to be supposed, had he really
                    been the inventor, that he would have remained for <hi rend="italic"
                    >sixteen</hi> years a passive spectator of what was going forward? that he would
                    have allowed Arkwright to accumulate a princely fortune by means of <hi
                    rend="italic">his</hi> inventions while he remained in a state of poverty 1 or
                    that he would have withheld his evidence when the manufacturers attempted to
                    wrest from Arkwright what he had so unjustly appropriated? A single hint from
                    Highs or Kay would, had their story been well founded, have sufficed to force
                    Arkwright to give them a share of his profits, or would have furnished the
                    manufacturers with the means they were so anxious to obtain, of procuring the
                    immediate dissolution of the patents. But it has never been alleged that
                    Arkwright took any pains to conciliate these persons; on the contrary, he
                    treated Highs with the most perfect indifference, and not only dismissed Kay
                    from his service, but even threatened to prosecute him on a charge of felony.
                    The supposition that persons with so many and such overpowering temptations to
                    speak out, and with no inducement of any sort to be silent, should have kept so
                    important a secret for so many years is almost incredible; and it is infinitely
                    more consistent with probability to suppose that the story of Highs and Kay had
                    been manufactured for the occasion than that it was really true. None of
                    Arkwright’s most intimate friends ever had the slightest doubt with respect to
                    the originality of his invention. Some of them, indeed, could speak to the
                    circumstances from their own personal knowledge; and their testimony was uniform
                    and consistent.</p>
                <p>On their introduction, Arkwright’s machines were regarded by the lower classes as
                    even more adverse to their interests than those of Hargraves, and repeated
                    attacks were made on the factories built for them. But however extraordinary it
                    may appear, it was amongst the manufacturers that the greatest animosity existed
                    against Arkwright; and it required all the prudence for which he was so
                    remarkable to enable him to triumph over the powerful combination that was
                    formed against him. At the outset of the business they unanimously refused to
                    purchase his yarn; and when his partners, Messrs Strutt and Need, had commenced
                    a manufacture of calicoes, the manufacturers strenuously opposed a bill to
                    exempt calicoes from a discriminating duty of 3d. a yard laid on them over and
                    above the ordinary duty of 3d. by an old Act of Parliament. Luckily, however,
                    the manufacturers failed of their object; and, in 1774, an Act of Parliament was
                    obtained (14 Geo. III. cap. 72) for the encouragement of the cotton manufacture,
                    in which fabrics made of cotton are declared to have been <hi rend="italic"
                    >lately</hi> introduced, and are allowed to be used as “a lawful and laudable
                    manufacture the duty of 6d. the square yard on such cottons as are printed or
                    stained being at the same time reduced to 3d. But this disgraceful spirit of
                    animosity, which must, had it been successful, have proved as injurious to the
                    interests of the manufacturers as to those of Arkwright, did not content itself
                    with actions in the courts of law, or a factious opposition to useful measures
                    in Parliament, but displayed itself in a still more striking and unjustifiable
                    manner. A large factory, erected by Arkwright at Birkacre, near Chorley, in
                    Lancashire, was destroyed by a mob collected from the adjacent country, in the
                    presence of a powerful body of police and military, without any one of the civil
                    authorities requiring them to interfere to prevent so scandalous an outrage.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, however, not for himself only, but for his country and the world,
                    every corner of which has been benefited by his inventions, Arkwright triumphed
                    over every opposition. The same ingenuity, skill, and good sense, which had
                    originally enabled him to invent his machine and get it introduced, enabled him
                    to overcome <pb break="no"

                    which he had subsequently to contend.</p>
                <p>Though a man of great personal strength, which he is said to have displayed, when
                    young, in election riots at Preston, Arkwright never enjoyed good health. During
                    the whole of his memorable career of invention and discovery, he was labouring
                    under a very severe asthmatic affection. A complication of disorders at length
                    terminated his truly useful life in 1792, at his works at Cromford, in the
                    sixtieth year of his age. He was high sheriff of Derbyshire in 1786; and, having
                    presented a congratulatory address from the wapentake of Wirksworth to his
                    Majesty George III., on his escape from the attempt on his life by Margaret
                    Nicholson, received the honour of knighthood. No man ever better deserved his
                    good fortune, or has a stronger claim on the respect and gratitude of posterity.
                    His inventions have opened a new and boundless field of employment; and while
                    they have conferred infinitely more real benefit on his native country than she
                    could have derived from the absolute dominion of Mexico and Peru, they have been
                    <hi rend="italic">universally</hi> productive of wealth and enjoyment.</p>
