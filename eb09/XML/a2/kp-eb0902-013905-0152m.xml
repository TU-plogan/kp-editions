                    island from the Frith of Clyde on the west to the Frith of Forth on the east.
                    The former of these appellations it has received from the Roman emperor in whose
                    reign it was erected; the origin of the latter is more doubtful, a probable
                    opinion being that which regards it as a corruption of the Celtic <hi
                    rend="italic">greim,</hi> a place of strength, and <hi rend="italic">diog,</hi>
                    a trench or rampart.</p>
                <p>We are informed by Tacitus that Agricola, during his fourth summer in Britain (81
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> occupied himself in consolidating his previous
                    conquests, and that for this purpose he caused a series of detached forts to be
                    built on the isthmus that joins the two friths as a barrier against the still
                    unconquered Caledonians of the north. It was along, or almost along, the same
                    line, that one of his successors in the command of the Roman troops in Britain
                    raised the more permanent military work known as Antonine’s wall.</p>
                <p>The writer of the life of the emperor Antoninus Pius in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historice Augustee Scriptores</hi><hi rend="italic">Sex,</hi> usually supposed
                    to have been Julius Capitolinus, expressly states that Lollius Urbicus, a legate
                    of that emperor, erected, after several victories over the Britons, “another
                    rampart of turf” to check their inroads. No locality is specified, but a
                    fragment of a stone, now in the museum of the university of Glasgow, has an
                    inscription in which the name of this Lollius seems to occur. This fragment, and
                    the numerous monumental records bearing the name of Antonine that have been
                    discovered along its course, identify beyond all reasonable doubt the wall
                    between the Forth and Clyde as that spoken of by the annalist, and furnish
                    satisfactory proof of the correctness of its best-known name. And if a small
                    pillar figured by Gordon, and at one time in the library of the university of
                    Edinburgh, was found, as is probable, near the wall, it fixes the year 140 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> as the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n153/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0153-0140"/> exact date at which the portion of the work
                    connected with the pillar was executed.</p>
                <p>In addition to the annalist just mentioned, several other ancient historians are
                    supposed to allude to Antonine’s wall; but their brief statements are so vague
                    that further reference to what they say is unnecessary. Of mediaeval writers
                    Bede is almost the only one who notices it, but he erroneously ascribes its
                    erection to the natives of the south acting according to advice given them by
                    the Romans. Timothy Pont, who early in the 16th century personally surveyed a
                    large portion of Scotland while gathering materials for his projected <hi
                    rend="italic">Scottish Atlas,</hi> drew the attention of antiquaries to this
                    memorial of Roman times, though to him, as well as to his successors in
                    antiquarian research for nearly a century, it was known as “Agricola’s vallum,
                    or Graham’s Dike.” It is to Gordon that the merit must be awarded of having been
                    the first to give to the world a satisfactory account of the “wall of Antoninus
                    Pius.” A chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium, Septentrionale</hi> is
                    devoted to it, and plans are given of the principal forts, as well as engravings
                    of the legionary tablets and other objects of interest that had, up to the
                    author’s day, been dug out of its ruins. Gordon was followed by Horsley and Roy,
                    the latter of whom made in 1755 a new survey of it, which enabled him to correct
                    Gordon in some particulars. Lastly, in the <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Romana</hi> of Stuart, we have a complete and, on the whole,
                    accurate description of the wall, with figures of all the sculptured stones
                    found near its course up to the date at which he wrote.</p>
                <p>The nature and appearance of the wall when perfect have been described by all
                    these writers in very similar terms, though they differ somewhat as to the.
                    measurement of its several parts. “It consisted,” says Stuart, “in the first
                    place, of an immense fosse or ditch—averaging about 40 feet in width, by some 20
                    in depth — which extended over hill and plain in one unbroken line from sea to
                    sea. Behind this ditch on its southern side, and within a few feet of its edge,
                    was raised a rampart of intermingled stone and earth, strengthened by sods of
                    turf, which measured, it is supposed, about 20 feet in height, and 24 in
                    thickness at the base. This rampart was surmounted by a parapet, behind which
                    ran a level platform for the accommodation of its defenders. To the southward of
                    the whole was situated the military way—a regular causewayed road about 20 feet
                    wide—which kept by the course of the wall at irregular distances, approaching in
                    some places to within a few yards, and in others receding to a considerable
                    extent.” Along the entire line there were at least eighteen principal stations
                    or forts, with smaller watchtowers in the intervening spaces. The rampart seems
                    to have consisted for the most part of earth or turf, as stated by the annalist;
                    but stone was, no doubt, employed in the building of the forts and watchtowers
                    as well as in certain portions of the rampart itself.</p>
                <p>Although in many parts of its course all traces of Antonine’s wall have long been
                    obliterated, the line along which it stretched has been mapped out by Gordon and
                    others with sufficient accuracy. Commencing in the west on a height called
                    Chapel Hill, near the village of Old Kilpatrick in Dumbartonshire, and now
                    distant from the River Clyde about 150 yards, it ran eastwards, passing in
                    succession Kirkintilloch, Croy, Castlecary, and Falkirk, and terminated at
                    Bridgeness, a rocky promontory that projects into the Frith of Forth south of
                    Borrowstounness in Linlithgowshire. Its eastern termination was long supposed to
                    have been near the kirk of Carriden. In 1869, however, a sculptured legionary
                    tablet, since deposited in the museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,
                    was found at Bridgeness, in such a position that it is impossible to avoid the
                    conclusion that the wall actually terminated there. Its entire length may be set
                    down at about 36 English miles.</p>
                <p>Of the sculptures found near or on the site of this wall a considerable number
                    are records of the different portions of the work executed by the legionaries
                    employed on it, and who mainly belonged to the second, sixth, and twentieth
                    legions. Some of these tablets are in the museum of the university of Glasgow,
                    and are of much interest, but the finest of them all is the Bridgeness one
                    already referred to. From the number of Roman paces mentioned on the
                    inscriptions, Horsley and others have attempted to determine the exact length of
                    the work. Unfortunately for their purpose, the paces on the stones already
                    discovered considerably exceed its w hole length, and as we cannot suppose that
                    all the monuments of this kind that were erected by the legionaries have been
                    preserved and brought to light, we must conclude with Stuart that they had
                    raised more than one memorial of the same piece of work.</p>
                <p>How many years Antonine’s wall continued to be the boundary of the Roman
                    territories in Britain it is impossible to say, but there is every reason for
                    believing that it was so for only a brief period.</p>
