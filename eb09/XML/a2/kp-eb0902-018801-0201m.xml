                <p><label type="entry">APOLLONIUS</label>, surnamed <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tyanaeus,</hi> a Pythagorean philosopher, born at Tyana, the capital of
                    Cappadocia, shortly before the Christian era. According to his biographer
                    Philostratus, he studied grammar and rhetoric at Tarsus under Eu thy demus, but
                    he soon left that gay and luxurious city for the quiet town of Aegae in the
                    vicinity, where he spent his time in the company of philosophers and priests
                    within the temple of Aesculapius. Among these he met Eυxenus, one of the
                    followers of Pythagoras, and from him he learned with enthusiasm the doctrines
                    of the Samian sage. While yet a mere youth he renounced all the ordinary
                    pleasures of life. Abjuring the use of flesh and wine, he lived on the simple
                    fruits of the soil, wore no clothing but linen and no sandals on his feet,
                    suffered his hair to grow, and slept on the hard ground. He strictly observed
                    the Pythagorean penance of five years’ silence, suffering often the most painful
                    trials of his patience without a murmur. Philostratus relates so many wonderful
                    stories of his hero—how on one occasion, for instance, he awed an excited
                    populace to silence by the mere waving of his hands, how he performed many
                    miracles with a word, and how he knew all tongues without ever having learned
                    them—that some have questioned the very existence of Apollonius; while others,
                    admitting with reason the fact of some such ascetic having lived about this
                    time, regard him as a compound of magician, impostor, and religious fanatic.</p>
                <p>After spending some time in the cities of Cilicia and Pamphylia, Apollonius
                    extended his travels into the East, and wandered on foot over Assyria, Persia,
                    and India, conversing with Magi, Brahmins, Gymnosophists, and priests, visiting
                    the temples, preaching a purer morality and religion than he found, and
                    attracting wherever he went admiration and reverence. At Nineveh he met with
                    Damis, who became his adoring disciple and the companion of his journeyings, and
                    left those doubtful records of his life which Philostratus made use of, and
                    probably improved upon. The account of his exploits during his wanderings in
                    India reads like the tales of the Arabian Nights; and where Damis cannot vouch
                    for having seen the prodigies he mentions, he unhesitatingly adduces in support
                    of them the authority of his master. From his visit to the Hill of Sages
                    (described in the third book), Apollonius returned an accomplished sage himself,
                    able to foretell earthquakes and eclipses, to cure the plague, to summon spirits
                    from the unseen world, and to restore the dead to life.</p>
                <p>On his return from the East he had the greatest reverence <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0202-0189"/> paid him everywhere by Grecian priests and
                    oracles. He visited Crete and Rome, where he astonished the magistrates by
                    raising to life the dead body of a noble lady. Spain, Sicily, Egypt, Ethiopia,
                    Greece, and Asia Minor became in time the scenes of his wanderings and his
                    wonderworkings; and so distinguished had he become that even during his life he
                    was raised almost to the rank of a divinity.</p>
                <p>He is supposed to have died at Ephesus at a very great age, but his biographer
                    finds it convenient to represent his end as involved in mystery, in order to
                    heighten the reverence due to his hero. The words of the biographer are: “Here
                    ends the history of Apollonius the Tyanaean, as written by Damis. Concerning the
                    manner of his death, <hi rend="italic">if he did die,</hi> the accounts are
                    various.” Like Pythagoras, his master, he left no indication of his age; and
                    Philostratus could not ascertain whether he died at Ephesus, or <hi
                    rend="italic">vanished</hi> at Lindus, or in Crete.</p>
                <p>After his death Apollonius was worshipped with divine honours for a period of
                    four centuries. A temple was raised to him at Tyana, which obtained from the
                    Romans the immunities of a sacred city. His statue was placed among those of the
                    gods, and his name was invoked as a being possessed of superhuman powers. The
                    defenders of paganism, at the period of its decline, placed the life and
                    miracles of Apollonius in rivalry to those of Christ; and some moderns have not
                    hesitated to make the same comparison. There is no reason to suppose, however,
                    that Philostratus entertained any idea of this sort in composing his life of
                    Apollonius. That biography was undertaken by order of Julia, wife of the Emperor
                    Severus, more than a century after the death of the subject of it; and it is
                    extraordinary that Apollonius, if so renowned and widely known in his day, found
                    no place in history for 120 years after his decease. The preamble of
                    Philostratus, in which he professes to set forth things with which men were
                    before unacquainted, is in striking contrast with the commencement of the Gospel
                    of Luke.</p>
                <p>Apollonius is not to be looked upon as a shallow and vulgar impostor, though to
                    influence men’s minds he had recourse to artifices and pretensions unworthy of a
                    true philosopher. With some of the spirit of a moral and religious reformer, he
                    appears to have attempted, though vainly, to animate expiring paganism with a
                    new and purer life. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Philostrδ,tus.</hi></p>
