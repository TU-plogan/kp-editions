                    rend="italic">q.v.,</hi> the Olympus of northern mythology. The city of Asgard
                    is fabled to have been built on the highest part and in the middle of Ida’s
                    plain, which is the very centre of the universe. Here the Aesir erected a court
                    for themselves with seats for twelve, and one high seat for Odin, the
                    All-father, also a lofty abode for the goddesses, called Vingolf. They worked
                    diligently, played at games, were rich in gold and all precious things, and
                    happy, till three maidens from Jotunheim, the giants’ world, crossed Ida’s
                    plain, and entered Asaheim, when corruption spread amongst its inmates. Asgard
                    had many mansions, the largest and noblest of which was Gladsheim; whilst
                    another, not so spacious, but the fairest of all, and brighter than the sun, was
                    called Gimli. This will stand when both heaven and earth have passed away, and
                    will be the habitation of all good and upright men through eternity. When the
                    Aesir created men, and placed them in Midgard, they connected the latter with
                    Asgard by a bridge, Bifrösh, known to mortals as the rainbow, which also leads
                    to the sacred fountain of Urd, by the ash Yggdrasil, where the gods of Asgard
                    take council together. For the other parts of Asgard, which are closely

                    The historical explanation of Asgard, as given by the early northern
                    authorities, is that, in the country called Asaheim to the east of Tanagvise
                    (the Tanais or Don) in Asia, there was a city, Asgard, in which ruled a great
                    chief, known as Odin or Woden, who presided over the religious sacrifices which
                    were held there. At that time the Roman generals were marching over the world,
                    and reducing nations to subjection, and Odin, foreknowing that he and his
                    posterity would occupy the northern lands, and unwilling to encounter the
                    Romans, left Asaheim with a vast multitude of followers, and wandered first
                    westward to Garderike (Russia/, and afterwards to Saxland (North and East
                    Germany). After some time he proceeded northward, till at length he came to the
                    Malar Lake in Sweden, where he settled at a place known as Sigtuna, the present
                    Upsala. His twelve diar, or chief priests, in the course of time founded states
                    for themselves, and everywhere set up the laws and usages which they had
                    followed in Asaheim. Here we have an historical link with the mythic story of
                    Odin’s halls in Asgard, and his twelve attendant Aesir; but we have no means of
                    fixing the date of the events referred to. It has been conjectured that Odin may
                    have lived at the time when Mithridates Eupator was defying the armies of Rome,
                    120-80 B.c.; and that, to avoid subjection to either power, he and other
                    Sarmatian or Caucasian chiefs Jeft their settlements on the Black Sea, and
                    wandered forth in search of new and independent homes, to the north and west of
                    the primary Asiatic seat of their tribes. It is not improbable that traditionary
                    records of such earlier migrations had lingered among the people dwelling on the
                    shores of the Euxine, for it is certain that, whatever may be the age of Odin’s
                    appearance in Scandinavia, previous waves of population had passed from the
                    Black Sea to the Baltic, and cleared the way for the reception of that highest
                    phase of Aryan civilisation brought to Northern Europe by Odin and his
                    followers.</p>
