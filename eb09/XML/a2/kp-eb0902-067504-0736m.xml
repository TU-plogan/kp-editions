                    amphibole or hornblende family of minerals, and akin to tremolite, actinolite,
                    and common hornblende. The chemical composition of the whole family is chiefly
                    silica, magnesia, alumina, and ferrous oxide, but varies considerably. Those
                    containing most iron are most easily fused. Asbestos consists of fine
                    crystalline elastic fibres, with a silky lustre, varying in colour from white to
                    grey and green, and derives its name from being specially indestructible by
                    fire. A single fibre of it fuses to a white enamel, but in the mass it is
                    capable of resisting ordinary flame, and has on this account been regarded from
                    ancient times as a most interesting substance. Woven into cloth it forms a
                    fireproof texture, which, to be purified, requires only to be thrown in the
                    fire; gloves, napery, towels, handkerchiefs, and even dresses have been woven of
                    it; and it is said that the ancients used to wrap the bodies of their dead in
                    asbestos cloth to keep their ashes separate from those of the surrounding
                    funeral pile. There are several varieties of asbestos :—(1.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amianthus</hi> is the rarest and most delicate kind, its fibres being
                    beautifully white, flexible, long, and regularly laid. It is found in the centre
                    of the older crystalline rocks, in the Pyrenees, the Alps of Dauphiny, on Mount
                    St Gotthard, in North America, in the serpentine of Sweden, in the Ural
                    Mountains, Silesia, and New South Wales. But the most beautiful specimens come
                    from Tarantaise, in Savoy, and from Corsica, where it is somewhat abundant (2.)
                    <hi rend="italic">Common Asbestos</hi> is not so light, either in colour or
                    weight, as amianthus, and is more splintery, inflexible, and irregular in
                    structure. It fuses with difficulty before the blow-pipe into a black scoria. It
                    is found in serpentine rocks in Anglesea, in Cornwall, and also in several parts
                    of Scotland, as Glenelg, in Inverness. (3.) <hi rend="italic">Mountain
                    leather</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mountain cork</hi> are other varieties, where
                    the fibres are less <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n737/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0737-0676"/> flexible and regular than in either of the above.
                    Their colour is brown or a dirty white. Mountain leather is in thin flexible
                    sheets, and mountain cork is so named from being not unlike common cork, and so
                    light as to swim on water. It is found in Lanarkshire. (4.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mountain wood</hi> is a soft, tough, opaque, brownish-coloured variety of
                    asbestos, much heavier than the last, and melting to a black slag before the
                    blow-pipe. It is found in Tyrol, in Dauphiny, and in Scotland at Glen Tilt,
                    Portsoy, and Kildrummy.</p>
                <p>It has been often proposed to employ asbestos in the manufacture of fireproof
                    goods, and it was at one time thought that an important industry would grow out
                    of this application. In early times the art of weaving ami-anthine cloth was its
                    chief application, and was much valued. It was accomplished by weaving the
                    fibres along with those of flax, and then heating the cloth in a furnace to
                    destroy the flax. It is said that Charlemagne had an amianthine tablecloth,
                    which he used to have thrown into the fire after dinner for the astonishment of
                    his guests. Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, is said to have had a complete
                    dress—cap, gloves, tunic, and stockings—made of asbestos cloth, and to have made
                    very successful experiments with it by way of testing its protective power for
                    firemen. Advantage has also been taken of its qualities for the performance of
                    clever tricks of fire-handling. Paper has been manufactured from asbestos, and
                    would prove invaluable, in case of fire, for charters and other important
                    documents, were it not that the paper is rather tender for use, and that the
                    writing disappears after a red heat. Its feeble consistency has proved the chief
                    obstacle to its use in textile fabrics. More success has attended its employment
                    for fireproof roofing and flooring, for non-conducting envelopes of steam pipes,
                    and for the packing in fireproof safes. Lately it has been proposed to use it
                    for pistonpacking in steam engines, it having been found to exceed in durability
                    any material hitherto employed—a matter of importance, especially in the case of
                    marine engines that have to be at work night and day on long voyages.</p>
