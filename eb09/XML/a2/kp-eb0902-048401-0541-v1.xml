                <p><label type="entry">AREQUIPA</label>, one of the 18 departments of Peru. It lies
                    along the Pacific from lat. 15° to 17° 20' S. Its chief productions are silver,
                    alpaca and other wools, sugar, wine, and brandy. The population is stated at
                    200,000, which is probably in excess. The district is volcanic, and contains
                    several volcanoes, which appear, however, to be mostly extinct. Of these Misti,
                    otherwise known as the Arequipa, one of the most perfectly cone-shaped of
                    mountains, occasionally throws out smoke or vapour. It rises to the height of
                    20,320 feet above the sea. An eruption of Ubinas, a mountain on the eastern
                    boundary of the department, occurred in 1839.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arequipa,</hi> the chief town of the department, stands at
                    the foot of Misti, in the fertile valley of the Chile, 7775 feet above the level
                    of the sea, in lat. 16° 16' S., long. 72° 3Γ W. It is divided into five
                    districts—Santo Domingo, San Francesco, La Merced, San Augustin, and Miraflores—
                    contains 2064 houses, and has a population of about 30,000. In each of the
                    districts there is a monastery and a church; and besides there are three
                    nunneries in the city. The cathedral is quite modern, the former building having
                    been destroyed by fire in 1849. Solidity rather than beauty is the principal
                    characteristic of Arequipan architecture, as might be expected in a city so
                    liable to suffer from earthquakes. These occur with great frequency, and are
                    sometimes of great severity; in 1582, 1609, 1784, and 1868 the city was greatly
                    damaged. In general the streets run at right angles, and are wide and well
                    paved. The better houses are all built in the Spanish style, with two or three
                    courts; the walls are massive, and the ceilings vaulted. The material used is a
                    soft magnesian limestone. The town has a faculty of medicine which rivals that
                    of Chu-quisaca in Upper Peru, a university, two academies, a college founded by
                    Grand-Marshal de la Fuente, a public library, established in 1821, two
                    printing-offices, each publishing a small newspaper, an hospital, and a
                    foundling asylum. Arequipa is united to Molienda on the coast by a railroad
                    completed in 1870, 107 miles in length, nearly the whole of which is over a
                    waterless desert. An iron pipe, which supplies Molienda with water, runs along
                    the line for 85 miles. The railway has now been extended across the Andes,
                    reaching a height of 14,660 feet, to Puno, which is connected with Bolivia by
                    steam navigation across Lake Titicaca.</p>
