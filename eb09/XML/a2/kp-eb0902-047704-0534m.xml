                    rend="italic">Annals of Indian Administration</hi> for 1871-72, is 15,146 square
                    miles; the population, as ascertained by a census taken in July 1871, being
                    2,007,667 souls. The aspect of the country, in the eastern and southern parts,
                    is flat and uninteresting; but the western parts, where it runs along the foot
                    of the Eastern Ghâts, as well as all the country northwards from Trivellam to
                    Tripali and the Karkambadi Pass, are mountainous, with an agreeable diversity of
                    scenery. The elevated platform in the west of the district is comparatively
                    cool, being 2000 feet above the level of the sea, with a maximum range of the
                    thermometer in the hottest weather of 88°. The hills are composed principally of
                    granite and sienite, and have little vegetation. Patches of stunted jungle here
                    and there diversify their rugged and barren aspect; but they abound in minerals,
                    especially copper and iron ores. The narrow valleys between the hills are very
                    fertile, having a rich soil and an abundant water-supply even in the dryest
                    seasons. The principal river in the district is the Palâr, which rises in Mysor,
                    and flows through North Arcot from west to east past the towns of Vellor and
                    Arcot, into the neighbouring district of Chengalpat, eventually falling into the
                    sea at Sadras. Although a considerable stream in the rainy season, and often
                    impassable, the bed is dry or nearly so during the rest of the year. Other
                    smaller rivers of the district are the Paini, which passes neaç Chittur and
                    falls into the Palâr, tho Sonâmukhi, and the Chayaur. These streams’are all dry
                    during the hot season, but in the rains they flow freely and replenish the
                    numerous tanks and irrigation channels. The principal roads in the district
                    of.North Arcot are tho Trunk road from Madras to Bangalor, running from east to
                    west; a road from north-east to south-west from Madras through North Arcot to
                    Coimbator; and a road running north and south from Chittur to Arcot. The Madras
                    Railway, and the Great Southern Indian Railway, also pass through the district.
                    Grain of many species and cotton are largely grown throughout North Arcot, as
                    well as sugar-cane and indigo. A part of the latter is sent to the Madras
                    market. Cotton cloth is largely manufactured^ and oil is prepared in
                    considerable quantities for local consumption and for export. For fiscal
                    purposes, the district is divided into the following fifteen <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arcot, South,</hi> lies between 11° 0' and 11° 39' N. lat.,
                    and between 78° 42' and 80° 4' E. long. The district of South Arcot is bounded
                    on the N. by the districts of North Arcot and Chengalpat; on the E. by the
                    French territory of Pondecherri and the Bay of Bengal; on the S. by the British
                    districts of Tanjor and Trichinopoly; and on the W. by the British district of
                    Sâlem. It contains an area, according to the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Indian
                    Administration</hi> for 1871-72, of 4779 square miles; and a population<pb

                    of 1,762,525. South Arcot is divided into thirteen fiscal divisions or tâluks,
                    as follows:—(1.) Tindevanum, (2.) Trivadi, (3.) Vilup-puran, (4.) Bhawangiri,
                    (5.) Managudi, (6.) Chilambram, (7.) Trinsmâli, (8.) Vardhâchalam, (9.)
                    Elovansa, (10.) Trikalor, (11.) Kalakurchi, (12) Chaitpet, and (13.) Cuddalor.
                    The aspect of the district resembles that of other parts of the Coromandel
                    coast. It is low and sandy near the sea, and for the most part level till near
                    the western border, where ranges of hills form the boundary between this and the
                    neighbouring district of Sâlem. These ranges are in some parts about 5000 feet
                    high, with solitary hills scattered about the district. In the western tracts,
                    dense patches of jungle furnish covert to tigers, leopards, bears, and monkeys.
                    The principal river is the Coleroon or Kalerun, which forms the southern
                    boundary of the district, separating it from Trichinopoly. This river is
                    abundantly supplied with water during the greater part of the year, and two
                    irrigating channels distribute its waters through the district. The other rivers
                    are the Vellaur, Ponnâr, and Gadalum, all of which are used for irrigation
                    purposes. Numerous small irrigation channels lead off from them, by means of
                    which a considerable area of fresh land has been brought under cultivation.
                    Under the East India Company, a Commercial Resident was stationed at Cuddalor,
                    and the Company’s weavers were encouraged by many privileges. The manufacture
                    and export of native cloth have now been almost entirely superseded by the
                    introduction of European piece goods. The sea-ports of the district of South
                    Arcot are Cuddalor or Fort St David, with a population, in 1855, returned at
                    36,686; and Porto Novo, with a population estimated, in 1855, at about 12,000
                    souls. The other places of importance in the district are Chilambram,
                    Vardhâchalam, Trivadi, Tiagâr, Ginji or Chenji, Trinomâli, Chaitpet, Mer-kanam,
                    and Verdur. The number of villages in South Arcot was returned, in 1850, at
                    3376. The total revenue of the district in that year amounted to £284,708, of
                    which £234,055, or 82 per cent., represented the land revenue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arcot City,</hi> the principal town in the district of North
                    Arcot, is situated on the south bank of the Palâr river, in 12° 54' N. lat., and
                    79° 24' E. long. It is a station on the line of railway from Madras to Beypur,
                    and is also a military cantonment. The population of the town, in 1862, was
                    returned at 53,474 souls, inhabiting 10,042 houses. Arcot occupies a very
                    prominent place in the history of the British conquests of India. In the middle
                    of the last century, during the war between the rival claimants to the throne of
                    the Carnatic, Muhammad All and Chandâ Sâhib, the English supported the claims of
                    the former and the French those of the latter. In order to divert the attention
                    of Chandâ Sâhib and his French auxiliaries from the .siege of Trichinopoly,
                    Clive suggested an attack upon Arcot, and offered to command the expedition. His
                    offer was accepted; but the only force which could be spared to him, was 200
                    Europeans and 300 native troops to attack a fort garrisoned by 1100 men. The
                    place, however, was abandoned without a struggle, and Clive took possession of
                    the fortress. The expedition produced the desired effect; Chandâ Sâhib was
                    obliged to detach a large force of 10,000 men to recapture the city, and the
                    pressure on the English garrison at Trichinopoly was removed. The siege of
                    Arcot, in 1751, was conducted with great vigour by Râjâ Sâhib, son of Chandâ
                    Sâhib, and is thus described by Macaulay:—</p>
                <p>. Raja Sahib proceeded to invest the fort, which seemed quite incapable of
                    sustaining a siege. The walls were ruinous, the ditches Ury, the ramparts too
                    narrow to admit the guns, and the battlements too low to protect the soldiers.
                    The little garrison had been greatly reduced by casualties. It now consisted of
                    120 Europeans and 200 Sepoys. Only four officers were left, the stock of
                    provisions was scanty, and the commander who had to conduct the defence under
                    circumstances so discouraging was a young man of five-and-twenty, who had been
                    bred a book-keeper. During fifty days the siege went on, and the young captain
                    maintained the defence with a firmness, vigilance, and ability which would have
                    done honour to the oldest marshal in Europe. The breach, however, increased day
                    by day. Under such circumstances, any troops so scantily provided with officers
                    might have been expected to show signs of insubordination; and the danger was
                    peculiarly great in a force composed of men differing widely from each other in
                    extraction, colour, language, manners, and religion. But the devotion of the
                    little band to its chief surpassed anything that is related of the Tenth Legion
                    of Caesar, or the Old Guard of Napoleon. The Sepoys came to Clive, not to
                    complain of their scanty fare, but to propose that all the grain should be given
                    to the Europeans, who required more nourishment than the natives of Asia. The
                    thin gruel, they said, which was strained away from the rice would suffice for
                    themselves. History contains no more touching instance of military fidelity, or
                    of the influence of a commanding mind. An attempt made by the governor of Madras
                    to relieve the place had failed; but there was hope from another quarter. A body
                    of 6000 Marhattas, half soldiers, half robbers, under the command of a chief
                    named Murari Râo had been hired to assist Muhammad Ali; but thinking the French
                    power irresistible, and the triumph of Chanda Sahib certain, they had hitherto
                    remained inactive on the frontiers of the Carnatic. The fame of the defence of
                    Arcot roused them from their torpor; Murâri Râo declared that he had never
                    before believed that Englishmen could fight, but that he would willingly help
                    them since he saw that they had spirit to help themselves. Raja Sâhib learned
                    that the Marhattas were in motion, and it was necessary, for him to be
                    expeditious. He first tried negotiations,—he offered large bribes to Clive,
                    which were rejected with scorn; he vowed that if his proposals were not
                    accepted, he would instantly storm the fort, and put every man in it to the
                    sword. Clive told him, in reply, with characteristic haughtiness, that his
                    father was a usurper, that his army was a rabble, and that he would do well to
                    think twice before he sent such poltroons into a breach defended by English
                    soldiers. Râjâ Sâhib determined to storm the fort. The day was well suited to a
                    bold military enterprise. It was the great Mahometan festival, the Muharram,
                    which is sacred to the memory of Husain, the son of Ali. Clive had received
                    secret intelligence of the design, had made his arrangements, and, exhausted by
                    fatigue, had thrown himself on his bed. lie was awakened by the alarm, and was
                    instantly at his post. The enemy advanced, driving before them elephants whose
                    foreheads were armed with iron plates. It was expected that the-gates would
                    yield to the shock of these living battering-rams. But the huge beasts no sooner
                    felt the English musket balls than they turned round and rushed furiously away,
                    trampling on the multitude which had urged them forward. A raft was launched on
                    the water which filled one part of the .ditch. Clive perceiving that his gunners
                    at that post did · not understand their business, took the management of a piece
                    of artillery himself, and cleared the raft in a few minutes. Where the moat was
                    dry, the assailants mounted .with great boldness; but they were received with a
                    fire so heavy and so well directed, that it soon quelled the courage even of
                    fanaticism and of intoxication. The rear ranks of the English kept the front
                    ranks supplied with a constant succession of loaded muskets, and every shot told
                    on the living mass below. The struggle lasted about an hour; 400 of the
                    assailants fell; the garrison lost only five or six men. The ’besieged passed an
                    anxious night, looking for a renewal of the attack. But when day broke, the
                    enemy were no more to be seen. They had retired, leaving to the English several
                    guns and a large quantity of ammunition.”</p>
                <p>^,rcot was afterwards captured by the French; but in 1760 was retaken by Colonel
                    Coote after the battle of Wandiwash. It was also taken by Haidar All when that
                    invader ravaged the Carnatic in 1780, and held by him for some time. The town of
                    Arcot, together with the whole of the territory of the Carnatic, passed into the
                    hands of the British in 1801, upon the formal resignation of the government by
                    the Nawâb, Azim-ud-daulâ, who received a liberal pension.</p>
