                    Clemens Alexandrinus, <hi rend="italic">Stromata,</hi> iii. c. 4. When applied
                    to writings (απόκρυφα sc. <hi rend="italic">βιβλία)</hi> the name may be
                    supposed to have first expressed the nature of their contents; the writings were
                    <hi rend="italic">secret,</hi> embodying an esoteric teaching, profounder than
                    that contained in the ordinary books of the system, and unknown to the ordinary
                    people who professed it. Such writings were held to exist in connection with
                    almost all the ancient systems of religion.</p>
                <p>From the nature of the case, the same word might very well describe such writings
                    further, either in respect of their <hi rend="italic">use</hi> or in respect of
                    their <hi rend="italic">origin.</hi> In use these writings were, of course, like
                    the doctrines they contained, private and secret; they were not read in general
                    meetings, and did not belong to the publicly recognised books of the system.
                    Only some were admitted to the knowledge of them. That which formed the subject
                    of public reference and instruction was the general doctrines of the system,
                    while these peculiar and more recondite works were at most brought forward on
                    rare occasions. And naturally the same secrecy which hung over their use
                    generally also shrouded their origin. In some cases this might be a real
                    mystery; the books were sometimes of ancient and uncertain date, and their
                    authorship unknown. But of tener the mystery was fictitious, created for the
                    purpose of securing respect for the doctrines inculcated in the writings, which
                    themselves were forgeries of very recent times. Works of this kind were of very
                    common occurrence in the East during the centuries immediately preceding and
                    following the birth of Christ. In order successfully to float them and give them
                    impulse, they were generally launched under some ancient and famous name; and
                    books existed, bearing to be the productions of almost every renowned patriarch
                    or sage from Adam downwards. Even when sent out anonymously, and of an
                    historical rather than a doctrinal character, the scene of their narratives was
                    laid in far back times, and famous personages were introduced acting and
                    speaking, the design being to recommend to the living generation the conduct
                    pursued or the sentiments expressed by the ancient hero or saint.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Apocrypha</hi> appears in this way to have passed
                    through several stages of meaning, and from expressing a meaning good, or at
                    least neutral, it came at last to have a very bad sense, differing very little
                    from <hi rend="italic">spurious.</hi> From the use of the word in ancient
                    writers it does not appear that this progress from a good or indifferent to a
                    bad sense was a matter of time, for the indifferent and bad meanings of the word
                    seem to have existed side by side. Some ecclesiastical writers divide the sacred
                    books into three classes,—recognising first, some that are canonical; second,
                    some that are not canonical, but of inferior value, profitable <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n194/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0194-0181"/> to be read for moral uses, but not to be founded
                    on for doctrine—to this class the name <hi rend="italic">ecclesiastical</hi> was
                    sometimes given; and third, some that are apocryphal. Other writers know of only
                    two classes, embracing both the second and third classes of the former division
                    under the name apocryphal· This difference indicates a milder and a severer use
                    of the term.</p>
                <p>Besides those books known distinctively as the Old Testament Apocrypha, a very
                    large number of apocryphal writings were in existence in the early centuries of
                    our era. Some of these are still extant, but many of them have perished, or are
                    known only through MS. translations lying in our great libraries. Our only
                    information regarding many of them is derived from references to them in
                    ecclesiastical writers. These references are sometimes so general that we cannot
                    be sure whether the book referred to was a Jewish or a Christian production. By
                    far the largest number even of those bearing Jewish titles were works by
                    Christian writers. Of the extant writings of this class the most important are
                    fully treated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Apocalyptic Literature</hi>
                    immediately preceding. In addition to those discussed there may be mentioned the
                    very interesting collection of hymns called the <hi rend="italic">Psalms of
                    Solomon.</hi> This small work consists of eighteen poems of varying length, to
                    appearance all by one writer, and existing now only in Greek, though in all
                    probability originally written in a Shemitic dialect. These poems arose in a
                    time of trouble to the Jewish people, most probably in the Greek persecution,
                    and they were designed to sustain the nation under its trials, partly by moral
                    considerations, but chiefly by picturing the certain glories of the Messianic
                    kingdom. The hymns are remarkable no less for the vigour of their poetry than
                    for the fervid theocratic hopes and distinct faith in the resurrection and
                    kindred doctrines which find expression in them. O. F. Fritzsche has appended
                    this little work, along w ith other select <hi rend="italic">Pseudepigraphi</hi>
                    of the Old Testament, to his edition of the Old Testament Apocrypha.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Apocrypha of the Old Testament.</hi> —The books bearing this
                    name are not contained in the Jewish or Palestinian Canon, t.e., in the Hebrew
                    Bible, but in the Alexandrian Canon, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in the Greek
                    translation known as the Septuagint. Considerable obscurity hangs over the date
                    and the circumstances of the close of the Hebrew Canon, and the principles which
                    guided the collectors in their selection of books to be embodied. It is most
                    probable that the <hi rend="italic">three</hi> divisions referred to in the New
                    Testament, of law, prophets, and writings (Psalms) are of ancient origin; that
                    the first two divisions were closed while prophetic men were still living, that
                    is, considerably anterior to the close of the Persian period, while the third
                    still remained open; and that at whatever time the third was closed, the books
                    added to it were added under the impression that they were books composed before
                    the succession of Prophets had ceased. This is the view expressed by Josephus
                    <hi rend="italic">(Con. Λp.,</hi> i. 8), and may be considered the general
                    Jewish tradition regarding all books in the Hebrew Canon.</p>
                <p>With the Greek or Alexandrian Canon the case was very different. This was,
                    properly speaking, not an ecclesiastical, but a literary collection at first,
                    for the tradition that it was commenced under the auspices of Ptolemy
                    Philadelphus cannot be altogether set aside. At first only the books of Moses
                    and perhaps Joshua were translated, the interest felt in the book being confined
                    to the law. Only gradually and at intervals other books were added, for the
                    translations are not only by different hands, but of very different dates. But
                    it is evident that the collection was formed under the guidance of a principle
                    quite different from that which guided the Palestinian collectors. The feeling
                    in Palestine was that prophecy had ceased (1 Macc. ix. 27, comp. ch. xiv. 41),
                    and no books were held worthy of a place in the Canon which were composed after
                    the succession of prophets had come to an end. In Egypt this theory did not
                    prevail, or rather another theory seems to have prevailed. The doctrine of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi> which appears in Proverbs, ch. i.-viii., received
                    a fuller development in successive ages even in Palestine, and naturally much
                    more in Alexandria, where the speculative Jews came under the influence of Greek
                    thought. This <hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi> is spoken of in a way which at times
                    almost identifies it with the Spirit of God, and at other times almost with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Logos</hi> or Word. But at any rate this divine Wisdom is
                    all-pervading, and subject to no interruption in the constancy of its influence.
                    The famous passage, Wisdom of Solomon, ch. vii. 22, <hi rend="italic">f.,</hi>
                    in which the attributes of wisdom are counted up to the number of twenty-one,
                    speaks of her as “going through all things by reason of her pureness,” and at
                    last says of her, that “in all ages entering into holy souls she maketh them
                    friends of God and prophets.” The particularism of Judaism gave way in
                    Alexandria before the universalistic principles of Western speculation. Prophecy
                    was the product of the Wisdom, and Wisdom was like a subtle element,
                    all-pervasive and incessant in its influence; and consequently a break in the
                    line of prophets, or any distinction between the productions of one age and
                    those of another except in degree, was hardly to be conceived. Thus to the
                    Alexandrian the varied Jewish literature of the post-prophetic times was
                    precious as well as the books that were more ancient, and he carefully gathered
                    the scattered fragments of his national thought, as far as they were known,
                    within the compass of his Canon.</p>
                <p>The following books form the Apocrypha of the English Bible. They are given in
                    the order in which they stand there :—1. I. Esdras. 2. II. Esdras. 3. Tobit. 4.
                    Judith. 5. The additions to the Book of Esther. 6. The Wisdom of Solomon. 7. The
                    Wisdom of Jesus, the son of Sirach, or Ecclesiasticus. 8. Baruch. 9. The Song of
                    the Three Holy Children. 10. The History of Susanna. 11. The History of the
                    Destruction of Bel and the Dragon. 12. The Prayer of Manasses, king of Judah.
                    13. The First Book of Maccabees. 14. The Second Book of Maccabees.</p>
                <p>A few statements may be made regarding the general characteristics of the
                    Apocrypha.</p>
                <p>1. These books are of very great interest and value as a reflection of the
                    condition of the fragments of the scattered nation, and of the feelings and
                    aspirations which they cherished for a period of several hundred years, and in
                    all the chief countries of the world. Some of the books, such for example as <hi
                    rend="italic">Tobit,</hi> belong to the Persian period, and were composed in the
                    East, in Babylon or Persia, and describe the external life as well as the
                    feelings and hopes of the exiles there; others arose in Palestine, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecclesiasticus,</hi> and reflect the condition of life and the
                    shades of religious speculation in the home country; while others, such as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Wisdom of Solomon,</hi> originated in Egypt, and afford means
                    of estimating the influence of Greek thought upon the native doctrines of the
                    Old Testament; and perhaps in the <hi rend="italic">2d Esdras</hi> there may
                    even be detected traces of Christian influence. The broad undivided stream of
                    Old Testament doctrine and hope breaks at the era of which we are speaking into
                    three channels. The largest, and that which best preserves its primary
                    direction, continues to run in Palestine, diverging to some extent, and widening
                    under the contributions which time and a very chequered experience and
                    reflection made to it; while on each side of this another runs, one on the east
                    and one on the west, directed and partly fed by the ideas of Persia and Greece
                    respectively. To a certain extent the streams reunite further on, and pour their
                    united contributions into the great sea of Christian thought. The central stream
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n195/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0195-0182"/> is, of course, the most interesting, although to
                    estimate it properly the books of the English Apocrypha are quite insufficient,
                    other works belonging to the same region must also be taken into account, such
                    as the great <hi rend="italic">Book of Enoch,</hi> and several more. The two
                    collateral currents are also of extreme interest, although it is far from easy
                    to analyse their waters, and say with assurance what elements belong to the
                    primary Old Testament sources and what are local contributions. Many have
                    discovered traces of Persian ideas even in the canonical books of the Old
                    Testament, particularly in the doctrine of angels in the later books, but the
                    trustworthiness of such discoveries may be very fairly questioned. At the same
                    time, there either is, in the book of <hi rend="italic">Tobit,</hi> an advance
                    absolutely on the Old Testament doctrine of angels and demons, or there are
                    traces of a method of interpreting the history in Gen. ch. vi., and a carrying
                    out of the method to further consequences, which are both unknown to the
                    canonical Scriptures (below No. 3). And if in the Alexandrian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wisdom of Solomon</hi> a progress directly <hi rend="italic">in advance</hi> of
                    what is found in Prov. viii., on the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">Wisdom,</hi>
                    may be justly contested, there is certainly what may be called a progress <hi
                    rend="italic">round about,</hi> the ideas about Wisdom are expanded and placed
                    in new lights, and made to enter into new relations, in such a way that a
                    general approximation to the New Testament doctrine of the Logos is the result.
                    But in general, as a means of estimating the changing shades of feeling, the
                    rise and fall of hopes, or rather the steady glow of a hope which no hardship
                    could extinguish, the efforts to accommodate faith to circumstances and hold it
                    fast in spite of all that was against it, in a word, as a means of estimating
                    the inner life of a most interesting people in the very crisis of their history,
                    the apocryphal books are invaluable. No more beautiful picture of piety and
                    disinterested benevolence and patriotic warmth could be seen than is presented
                    in the book of <hi rend="italic">Tobit;</hi> neither could religious zeal and
                    courageous, even almost reckless, patriotism, easily find higher expression than
                    in the first book of <hi rend="italic">Maccabees,</hi> or even in the
                    unhistorical tale of <hi rend="italic">Judith;</hi> while the under current of
                    observant thoughtfulness, that contemplates but hardly mixes in life, runs in a
                    deep, if calm and passionless stream in the proverbs of the Son of Sirach. At no
                    time was the nation idle. A people that had conceived such hopes, hopes which at
                    last culminated in Christianity, could not be idle or even anything less than
                    restless and turbulent. There is no form of deed celebrated in the ancient
                    history of the people that they did not try to reproduce, ana no form of
                    literary composition which, in those mournful centuries so full of oppression,
                    they did not strive to imitate, with an inextinguishable life and hopefulness.
                    This last fact, perhaps, might furnish the means of a classification of the
                    books different from that suggested above, and similar to the division usually
                    adopted in the Old Testament Scriptures. (1.) Historical, such as lsi <hi
                    rend="italic">Maccabees,</hi> although most that assume the historical form,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Judith,</hi> are simple romances, and can be used only
                    as an index of ideas and feelings, not in proof of facts; while others, like <hi
                    rend="italic">Bel and the Dragon,</hi> are completely fabulous. (2.)
                    Prophetical, such as <hi rend="italic">Baruch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">2d
                    Esdras.</hi> In these the religious hopes of the people are most fully
                    exhibited; for example, the Messianic expectations. Fully to understand these,
                    however, other works, such as the book of Enoch, not contained in the recognised
                    Apocrypha, have to be included. The prophetic literature almost always assumes
                    the form called apocalyptic. (3.) Philosophical, or books coming under the
                    Hebrew name of Wisdom. Here belong the <hi rend="italic">Son of Sirach,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Wisdom of Solomon,</hi> to which must be added others not
                    included in the English Apocrypha, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Psalter of Solomon</hi> and 4/Ä <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maccabees.</hi><hi rend="italic">2.</hi> It has already been said that the
                    Hebrew or Palestinian Canon was formed on the feeling that, before the close of
                    the Persian period, the succession of prophets ceased. It is too evident that
                    this feeling was a true one. The restoration from exile was little more than an
                    external form with almost no real life within. The new community was feeble in
                    the extreme. It had no productive power of its own. It must fall back entirely
                    upon the past. The most and the best it could do was to conserve the forms and,
                    if possible, the spirit of what was ancient. But the spirit, which should also
                    have been its own, was lacking. Hence everything in the new state was mechanical
                    and rigid. Even the canonical writings of this epoch, such as Chronicles, are
                    mere compilations. And the further off from the ancient times the people
                    removed, the stiffer and more mechanical they grew. No doubt a certain energy
                    was infused into the people at various epochs, particularly in the Maccabean
                    struggles, yet even then there is a certain stiffness and awkwardness both in
                    the acts and writings of the time, as when old age girds itself.’up for deeds to
                    which it is no longer equal. This loss of the prophetic and productive power,
                    and the consciousness of the loss, explains most of the characteristics of the
                    apocryphal literature. For example, there is wanting in it, even where most
                    genial and natural, that original freshness which is so charming in a book like
                    Ruth; and even the proverbial philosophy of the Son of Sirach, instead of
                    bubbling up in living springs, as in Solomon, often appears forced and unwilling
                    in its flow; while in others of the philosophic books there is an elaborate
                    redundancy of language, and a floridness of rhetoric, most unlike the simplicity
                    and terseness of the ancient Wisdom.</p>
                <p>Again, the consciousness of the loss of real creative power and complete
                    dependence on the past explains another peculiarity of these books—their
                    pseudonymous character. They do not come forth as the products of their own
                    time, and with the authority of their real authors; they are transferred into
                    the distant past, into the stirring times of living Israelitish history, and
                    their authors are made to be the great historic names of the nation. The
                    Alexandrian philosopher calls his work the <hi rend="italic">Wisdom of
                    Solomon.</hi> The author of <hi rend="italic">Judith</hi> pitches his romance in
                    Assyrian times. In this way effect is sought, and truths and actions are
                    commended by an authority that is felt no longer to exist.</p>
                <p>A defective sense of truth very naturally becomes more serious. To compose a work
                    in what is believed to be the spirit of some ancient sage or hero, and put it
                    forth under his name, may seem a venial wrong. Yet in an uncritical age it often
                    led to very unfortunate results. Neither might it seem greatly amiss to advocate
                    a cause and recommend an action by exhibiting ancient names uttering similar
                    sentiments, or following the same course, and in an age like our own little evil
                    might follow. Yet the next step downward is the direct forgery of documents,
                    such as the Letters of Artaxerxes, which we find in the additions to Esther, or
                    the Epistles at the beginning of 2 Maccabees. The apocryphal books everywhere
                    demonstrate that all true historic consciousness was deserting the people; and
                    though we may gather truth out of the Apocrypha, it is rarely truth directly
                    stated, but reached by our own inferences from the character of the writings and
                    the objects the author plainly enough had in view.</p>
                <p>3. One of the most interesting inquiries connected with the Apocrypha is, as to
                    the advance in doctrine and opinion over the Old Testament to be found in it,
                    and its nearer approach to the New Testament. This is a very delicate inquiry,
                    although the existence of a certain advance cannot be denied, and is most
                    certainly to be expected. For the church did not cease to exist in these
                    centuries, and if she was to appearance barren, yet in fact she was maturing
                    into life the seed which she had already conceived.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n196/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0196-0183"/>
                <p>Parallel to this inquiry, or almost a part of it, runs another, viz., that as to
                    the origin and development of the <hi rend="italic">parties</hi> which figure so
                    prominently in the pages of the New Testament. All these parties date in their
                    germs from the times of the Restoration, or those not greatly posterior, and may
                    roughly be divided into <hi rend="italic">two—</hi> those who rigidly adhered to
                    their native Judaism, of whom the Pharisees may be considered the chief
                    representatives; and those who ethnicised, either attaching themselves
                    exclusively to Gentile culture, or combining elements of foreign thought and
                    worship with their native faith, the most prominent sect in this class being the
                    Sadducees. We may expect to come in the Apocrypha upon many traces of such
                    diverging opinions. A specimen here and there will illustrate the position of
                    things in these books.</p>
                <p>The want of real life at the time of the Restoration, and the consequent
                    mechanical adherence to ancient forms, was the direct parent of the Pharisaic
                    morality so well known. Already this appears in Tobit. The Pharisee, who went up
                    to the temple to pray, might almost have gathered the elements of his prayer
                    from this book. " Prayer is good with fasting, and alms, and righteousness For
                    alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin” (ch. xii. 8, comp.
                    ch. xiv. 11, and Judith viii. 6, xi. 11, ff.} On the other hand, traces of quite
                    a different morality, allied to asceticism, appear elsewhere, as in the
                    statement of Wisdom ix. 15, regarding the body: “For the corruptible body
                    presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that
                    museth upon many things.” On the general doctrine of God no advance perhaps was
                    possible. Very lofty things are said by the author of Ecclesiasticus, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> ch. xliii. 30, and in many places, but nothing to
                    surpass or even equal what is said in the Old Testament. Perhaps a certain
                    effort is discernible to emphasise the spirituality of God, both directly and by
                    avoiding anthropomorphic images. This effort is far less discernible in the
                    Apocrypha than in the other productions of the same and succeeding ages, such as
                    the Septuagint, the Targums, &amp;c., which are apt to use circumlocutions like
                    the <hi rend="italic">Word of God,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Shelcinah,</hi>
                    &amp;c., for God.</p>
                <p>As to the doctrine of the Wisdom there is no doubt a certain development of it in
                    these books. But it is doubtful if Wisdom be anything more anywhere than a
                    personification, to which attributes are given that sometimes make it closely
                    resemble the Spirit, and sometimes the Word or Messiah of the New Testament.
                    Certainly the Wisdom is nowhere in these books identified with the Messiah,
                    although the predicates of Wisdom are applied to the Messiah in the New
                    Testament. (Comp. Wisdom vii. 26, with Hebrews i. 3, and the general
                    descriptions of Wisdom, Wisdom ix. 4, ⅛,ff∙, vii. 12, ff., &amp;c.,
                    Ecclesiasticus, ch. i.) The doctrine of the existence of spirits intermediate
                    between God and man, through whom God’s providence is often executed, is
                    certainly found in the Old Testament. These spirits seem mostly benevolent,
                    although there is one whose office it is to accuse and detract, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Satan,</hi> whose character seems evil· This spirit appears
                    formally in the prologue to Job, and in Zech. ch. iii; comp. 1 Chron, xxi. 1.
                    And some have found traces of the belief in evil spirits in the word <hi
                    rend="superscript"> il</hi> Azazel” (Lev. xvi.), as well as in the “satyrs” of
                    Isaiah (xxxiv. 14). In the book of Daniel the doctrine of angels receives a
                    certain addition, inasmuch as—first, the general activity and superintendence of
                    these spirits is indicated by the name given to them of “watchers” (ch. iv. 10,
                    ff.~) ∙, and second, it is intimated that every kingdom has its guardian spirit
                    (Dan. x. 13, 20). The Apocrypha repeats this last idea, Eccles, xvii. 17, and so
                    does the Septuagint on Deut, xxxii. 8. But the angelology of the book of Tobit
                    makes a double step forward—first, in the direction of teaching a hierarchy
                    among angels—“the seven holy angels, which go in and out before the glory of the
                    Holy One” (ch. xii. 15, though comp. Dan. x. 13); and second, in assigning
                    special functions to angels, they “present the prayers of the saints,” and
                    assume the care of individuals (ch. V. ff.) And demonology receives even a more
                    striking though grotesque development. A wicked spirit, named Asmodeus, is
                    represented as falling in love with Sara, daughter of Raguel, and slaying out of
                    jealousy the seven young men to whom she had been successively married, but is
                    at last put to flight by the fumes of the heart and liver of a fish, and bound
                    in chains in the utmost parts of Egypt (ch. iii. 8, vi. 14, viii. 3).</p>
                <p>Even more instructive is it to trace the advance towards clearness of the
                    doctrines concerning the state of man. Many times what is implied in the Old
                    Testament is stated with explicitness. For example, “God created man to be
                    immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity; nevertheless, through
                    envy of the devil, came death into the world, and. they that do hold of his side
                    do find it” (Wisdom ii. 23.) Again, “Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and
                    through her we all die” (Ecclesiasticus XXV. 24). The references given above
                    will suffice to indicate what lines of study may be pursued in the Apocrypha,
                    and what advantages may be expected to be derived from them.</p>
                <p>4. The degree of estimation in which the apocryphal books have been held in the
                    church has varied much according to place and time. As they stood in the
                    Septuagint or Greek Canon, along with the other books, and with no marks of
                    distinction, they were practically employed by the Greek fathers in the same way
                    as the other books; hence Origen, Clement, and others, often cite them as
                    “Scripture,” “divine Scripture,” “inspired,” and the like. On the other hand,
                    teachers connected with Palestine, and familiar with the Hebrew Canon, rigidly
                    exclude all but the books contained there. This view is reflected, for example,
                    in the canon of Melito of Sardis, and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome.
                    Augustine, however, <hi rend="italic">De Doct. Christ,</hi> ii. 8, attaches
                    himself to the other side. Two well-defined views in this way prevailed, to
                    which was added a third, according to which the books, though not to be put in
                    the same rank as the canonical Scriptures of the Hebrew collection, yet were of
                    value for moral uses and to be read in congregations,—and hence they were called
                    “ecclesiastical.” Notwithstanding the decisions of some councils held in Africa,
                    which were in favour of the view of Augustine, these diverse opinions regarding
                    the apocryphal books continued to prevail in the church down through the ages
                    till the great dogmatic era of the Reformation. At that epoch the same three
                    opinions were taken up and congealed into dogmas, which may be considered
                    characteristic of the churches adopting them. Tn 1546 the Council of Trent
                    adopted the Canon of Augustine, declaring “He is also to be anathema who does
                    not receive these entire books, with all their parts, as they have been
                    accustomed to be read in the Catholic. Church, and are found in the ancient
                    editions of the Latin Vulgate, as sacred and canonical.” The whole of the books
                    in question, with the exception of 1st and 2d Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses,
                    were declared canonical at Trent. On the other hand, the Protestants universally
                    adhered to the opinion that only the books in the Hebrew collection are
                    canonical. Already Wycliffe had declared that “whatever book is in the Old
                    Testament besides these twenty-five (Hebrew) shall be set among the Apocrypha,
                    that is without authority of belief.” Yet among the churches of the Reformation
                    a milder and a severer view prevailed regarding the Apocrypha. Both in the
                    German and English translations (Luther’s, 1537; Coverdale’s, 1535, àc.) these
                    books are separated from the others, and set by themselves; but while in some
                    confessions<pb break="no"

                    decided judgment is passed on them, that they are not “to be any otherwise
                    approved or made use of than other human writings,” a milder verdict is
                    expressed regarding them in many other quarters, <hi rend="italic">eg.,</hi> in
                    the “argument” prefixed to them in the Geneva Bible; in the 6th Article of the
                    Church of England, where it is said that “the other books the church doth read
                    for example of life and instruction of manners,” though not to establish
                    doctrine; and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Somewhat bitter controversies have raged over the Apocrypha in recent times. One
                    was carried on in Scotland in 1825 and following years, which had the effect of
                    inducing the British and Foreign Bible Society to employ its funds for the
                    circulation of the canonical Scriptures only. Abundant materials for a history
                    of this controversy may be found in the pages of the <hi rend="italic">Christian
                    Instructor</hi> for the years just named. More recently a similar controversy
                    has been waged in Germany, where Stier and Bleek and Hengstenberg were found on
                    the side of the Apocrypha, and Keerl with others against. See <hi rend="italic"

                    divided into two classes—those books which were actually held as inspired by
                    some portion of the Christian church, and those which were never acknowledged as
                    canonical· Among the first are some of the writings ascribed to the apostolical
                    fathers. The First Epistle of Clement was read in the churches, is quoted in the
                    same manner as Scripture by Irenaeus, and is found in the Codex Alexandrinus.
                    The Pastor of Hermas was also read in the churches, is mentioned as inspired by
                    Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Origen, and is found in the Codex
                    Sinaiticus. Somewhat similar respect was paid to the Epistle of Polycarp and the
                    Epistle of Barnabas. Besides these books there were different gospels in use in
                    the early period of Christianity. The most famous of these was the Gospel
                    according to the Hebrews. Some critics regard it as the earliest gospel of which
                    we know anything. Its relation to our Gospels thus becomes a very important
                    question, the discussion of which, however, must be reserved for the article on
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Gospels</hi> (g.v.) The Ebionites used this gospel. It
                    was written in Aramaic. It goes sometimes by the name of the Gospel of the
                    Nazarenes, or by the Gospel according to the Apostles; and some think that it
                    was also called the Gospel of Peter. This gospel no doubt underwent alterations;
                    and Hilgenfeld, in his <hi rend="italic">Novum Testamentum extra Canonem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Receptum,</hi> gives the fragments of what he considers the
                    earliest form of the Gospel according to the Hebrew’s, then those of the Gospel
                    of the Ebionites, which he considers very late, and then those of the Gospel of
                    Peter, which he thinks occupied an intermediate place. We know very little more
                    of the other gospels and apocryphal books than their names. Eusebius mentions
                    the Acts of Peter, the Preaching of Peter, and the Revelation of Peter; the Acts
                    of Paul, and the Doctrines of the Apostles. Origen mentions also the Gospel
                    according to the Egyptians, the Gospel of Basilides, and the Gospel according to
                    Thomas, and according to Matthias. Jerome, in addition to these, notices the
                    Gospel according to Bartholomew, and the Gospel of Apelles. Marcion also used a
                    special gospel for his sect, but whether it was the Gospel of Luke, entire or
                    mutilated, is keenly debated. And the book of the Prophet Elxai was held in high
                    estimation by some sects. All these works have perished, and criticism can only
                    conjecture, from a few scattered hints and fragments, what was their nature. The
                    other set of apocryphal books consists of works that have come down to us
                    relating to Christ and his apostles, but which were never regarded as inspired
                    by any sect. Some of these had a wide circulation in the Middle Ages, were
                    translated into various languages, and, as might be expected, were subjected to
                    all kinds of interpolations and alterations. Several of them refer to the
                    infancy and boyhood of Jesus; such as the Prot-evangelium of James, the Gospel
                    of Thomas, the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy; and some deal with his death, as
                    the Gesta Pilati or the Gospel of Nicodemus, and the narrative of Joseph of
                    Arimathea. There seems reason to believe that the first form of the
                    Protevangelium of St James and the first form of the Gesta Pilati were written
                    in the second century; but there can be no reasonable doubt that the forms in
                    which we now have them belong to a much later date. There are also apocryphal
                    Acts of Apostles and apocryphal Revelations of Apostles. These seem all to
                    belong to a later date than the earliest of the apocryphal gospels. The
                    fragments of the gospels used by the early church and the sects are given in
                    Hilgenfeld’s <hi rend="italic">Novum Testamentum extra Canonem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Receptum</hi> (Lipsiae, 1866). The extant apocryphal Gospels,
                    Acts, and Revelations have been edited in three separate volumes by Tischendorf,
                    and have been translated by Mr Walker in vol. xvi. of Clark’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ante-Nicene Christian Library.</hi> These works contain references to the
                    extensive literature on the subject. Special mention may be made of Michel
                    Nicolas’s work, <hi rend="italic">Etudes</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">les</hi><hi rend="italic">Evangiles Apocryphes</hi> (Paris, 1866),
                    but almost all works on the Canon contain an account more or less full of the
                    apocryphal books of the New Testament.</p>
