                <p><label type="entry">ARNAUD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henri</hi></label>, the
                    celebrated pastor, military leader, and historian of the Vaudois, was born, in
                    1641, at La Tour, or La Torre, in Piedmont. He is said to have served under
                    William of Orange, and it is probable that he received pecuniary assistance from
                    that prince in his efforts to restore the exiled Vaudois to their native
                    valleys. Owing to the cruelties of Victor Amadeus of Savoy, from two to three
                    thousand of these Vaudois had been forced to take refuge in Switzerland and the
                    states along the banks of the Rhine; and twice they ineffectually attempted to
                    return to their home. But the English Revolution of 1688, and the accession of
                    William of Orange to the throne, encouraged Arnaud to make a grand effort.
                    Concentrating about 900 followers in the great forest of the Pays de Vaud, he
                    remained in concealment for some time; and at last embarked with them on the
                    Lake of Geneva on the night of 16th August 1689. By September 16 they had
                    entered the valley of San Martino, after hard fighting with the French and
                    Savoyard troops that harassed and opposed them. Being now, however, in danger of
                    attack from about 20,000 French and Piedmontese troops, they were obliged to
                    repair to the lofty table-land of the Balsille, which they fortified with such
                    skill as to be able to withstand the fiercest attacks of the enemy, repeatedly
                    renewed through the whole winter. A general assault on the Balsille (2d May
                    1690) by about 22,000 French was an utter failure, resulting in the decimation
                    of the enemy, without the loss of a single man to Arnaud. Not caring to hazard a
                    renewal of the assault the garrison withdrew from thi3 stronghold to Angrona,
                    where, just when all chance of further escape seemed impossible, they learned
                    that hostilities had broken out between France and Piedmont, and that their
                    king, who had persecuted and expelled them, was now ready tc receive them with
                    open arms. Thus ended the “glorieuse rentrée des Vaudois dans leurs vallées,”
                    effected, according to their own account, with a loss of only 30 men, while they
                    made out that the joint losses of the French and Savoyards fell little short of
                    10,000 men. For a while the Vaudois were allowed to remain in peaceful
                    possession of their ancient homes; but when the war of the Spanish Succession
                    broke out, Arnaud and his followers took part in the combination against France,
                    and rendered the allies effectual service. When the war came toa close, the
                    ungrateful king of Piedmont once more joined the French monarch against his own
                    subjects, and complied with the demands of that prince, that the Vaudois should
                    be expelled from some of their valleys. The exiles, amounting in all to about
                    3000, found an asylum in Würtemberg. Arnaud, who had invitations from William
                    III., and might have spent the remainder of his days in ease and honour in
                    England, chose rather to continue the pastor of the exiles in the village of
                    Schönberg, and wrote, in his retirement, the <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi

                    printed in 1710, and dedicated to Queen Anne, and has been twice translated into
                    English. Arnaud died at Schönberg in 1721, and every memorial that he left
                    behind him was long cherished by his followers and their posterity.</p>
