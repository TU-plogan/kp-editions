                    ff.), derived its name. Assuming the occupation by the Amazons to have been
                    typical of what frequently happened during the hostilities of early times, it is
                    easy to understand how the hill came to be associated with the war god (Köhler,
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> 1872, p. 105). To the popular mind the
                    Areopagus was always the “hill of Mars.” But the popular mind required a more
                    definite account of the origin of the name, and to supply this, there took shape
                    the legend of Ares having been here called before a court of the twelve gods to
                    answer for the murder of Halirrhotius (Pausanias, i. 285). This explains at once
                    the origin of the name of the hill and of the court which held its sittings
                    there. Aeschylus, however, gives in the <hi rend="italic">Eumenides</hi> a
                    different origin to the court, declaring it to have been first appointed by
                    Athene to try Orestes for the murder of his mother Clytaemnestra. In later times
                    both legends were dismissed, and the explanation of the name referred to the
                    nature of the cases—cases of murder—tried before the court (Suidas, &amp; v.,
                    *Apειoς πάγος· επει τα <hi rend="italic">φovcκa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >δίκαζα’</hi> ό δε *Apης επι των <hi rend="italic">φόνων).</hi> The four
                    legendary cases of murder tried before this court were those in which Ares,
                    Cephalus, Daedalus, and Orestes appeared as the accused. But the selection of
                    this hill as the site of a criminal court, in the first instance, is to be
                    sought for in the sacred relation in which it stood to the worship of the
                    Erinnyes, or Eumenides, and not in its connection with Mars, for whom it had no
                    sanctity, and between whose worship and that of the Erinnyes K. O. Müller <hi
                    rend="italic">{Eumenides,</hi> p. 178) has not succeeded in proving any
                    community. On the top of the hill towards the east is an artificial plateau
                    accessible from the south by steps cut in the rock. In several places are still
                    to be traced the rock-hewn seats on which the court sat in the open air, so that
                    the judges and the accusers might not be under the same roof with a polluted
                    criminal. The sittings were held by day, not by night, unless the authority of
                    Lucian be accepted <hi rend="italic">{Heηnot.,</hi> 46; <hi rend="italic">De
                    Domo,</hi> 78). Raised upon two unhewn stones (αpγoi λι‰) the accuser and the
                    accused made their pleadings, the stone used by the former being called λι'0oς
                    dvαδεiας, “stone of implacability,” not of “impudentia” as translated by Cicero
                    <hi rend="italic">{De Leg.,</hi> ii. 11), or “impudence,” as given by Dyer <hi
                    rend="italic">{Athens,</hi> p. 451); the other was called <hi rend="italic"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0539-0482"/> Within the boundary of the court stood also an
                    altar to Athene Areia, believed to have been dedicated by Orestes, and blocks of
                    marble (α⅛ovες), on which were inscribed the laws defining the powers of the
                    judges. On another part of the hill stood one of the most revered of Athenian
                    sanctuaries, that of the Erinnyes, containing statues of these three goddesses,
                    but not in the hideous aspect in which they were usually conceived, and also
                    statues of those other deities connected with the lower world, Pluto, Hermes,
                    and Ge. Within the boundary of this temple was the tomb of Oedipus, and very
                    close to the boundary, if not 'rithin it, was the heroön or sanctuary of
                    Hesychus, the founder of the priestly line in whose hands were the rites of the
                    Erinnyes. Near the temple was the Kυλωvειov, a memorial of the pollution of the
                    spot caused by the treacherous slaughter of those who, having failed in the
                    conspiracy of Cylon, had taken refuge there as suppliants (Herod., v. 71;
                    Thucyd., i. 126). Towards the north-east foot of the hill was a temple of Ares
                    containing statues of that god, of Enyo, Aphrodite, and Athene, while outside
                    were statues of Hercules, Apollo, Pindar, and a poet named Caladas. On the
                    north-east side there is a chasm in the rocks with a spring of dark water, which
                    may have been associated with the worship of the Erinnyes.</p>
                <p>The court and council of the Areopagus <hi rend="italic">(ή βουλή ή</hi><hi

                    which distinctly pointed to it as an institution of primitive origin and
                    intrusted with functions of the first importance, was yet in regard to the
                    period of its history before Solon (594 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) so
                    little known that most people in later times had come to believe it to have been
                    created by him (Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Solon,</hi> 19). As proof that the
                    court had not existed before the time of Solon, it was urged that in the
                    legislation of Draco (620 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) there is no mention of
                    the Areopagus, he having referred all such cases as in later times came within
                    the powers of that court to a class of judges called the Ephetae. But there is
                    no reason why “Ephetae” may not have been previous to Draco the title applied to
                    the judges of the court of Areopagus, instead of “Areopagites,” just as it was
                    the title borne even after Solon by the judges of the other four Athenian courts
                    which tried cases of bloodshed, unless we accept the statement of Pollux (viii.
                    18) that the appointment of the Ephetae to all these courts, including the
                    Areopagus, was the work of Draco. For then, these courts having admittedly been
                    in existence before his time, there is no help but to assume that the judges had
                    previously borne other titles, and that in the case of the Areopagus the title
                    used could only have been Areopagites. But it is quite within fair criticism to
                    throw aside this statement of Pollux, as has been done by the most recent writer
                    on this subject (Philippi, <hi rend="italic">Rheinisches</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Museum,</hi> 1874, p. 12), and to assume, with K. O. Muller, that the Ephetae
                    had acted from time immemorial as judges in all the five courts. There would
                    remain for the fame of Draco the organisation of the courts, and possibly the
                    limitation of the number of Ephetae to 51. We must then conceive Solon as having
                    found the Ephetae acting as judges in the Areopagus and in the other four
                    courts. He set himself to alter the constitution of the Areopagus by adding to
                    the Ephetae already in office there the nine Athenian archons on their retiring
                    from public duties, and provided that they had rendered a satisfactory account
                    of their administration. It is probable that from this new source alone a
                    sufficient number of judges was supplied, and that, therefore, the original
                    Ephetae were allowed to die out, though in that case the number of Areopagites
                    could scarcely have been a fixed one (given at 51 by the scholiast to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tl·umenides,</hi> v. 743), considering the liability of an archon
                    to be rejected. The new judges retained their office for life subject to
                    dismissal only by their own body. For the most part they were advanced in years,
                    and necessarily always men of integrity and experience, qualifications which
                    were demanded in the highest degree from a court which, instead of administering
                    strictly defined laws, had to base its verdicts on a careful investigation of
                    the life and circumstances of parties arraigned before it. Its decisions were
                    quoted as models of justice. Its competency was limited to cases of wilful
                    murder (φόνος εκούσιος or εκ 7rp0v0iας), bodily injury with intent to kill
                    (τpaυpa εκ 7rpovoiaς), incendiarism (ττυρκαια), and poisoning (φάρρακα, εάν τις
                    άποκτείντ/ δoυς). Other degrees of homicide were referred, according to their
                    nature, to the other four Athenian courts, viz., accidental homicide (φόνος
                    ακούσιος) to the Palladium, justifiable homicide (φόνος δίκαιος) to the
                    Delphinium; at the Prytaneum was heard the formal indictment of inanimate
                    objects, such as wood or stone, which by falling had caused the loss of life;
                    while before the court of Phreathys at the Piraeus appeared those who having
                    been banished for accidental homicide had during their banishment committed
                    wilful murder. There were, however, cases of a complicated nature in regard to
                    which the records are far from explicit as to the courts to which they were
                    referred. Of this kind was a case in which the actual perpetrator (χeιpι
                    εpγασαpεvoς) was found to have been only a tool in the hands of a third person.
                    It was with the latter that the prosecution had principally to deal, and against
                    him was issued a charge of βovλεvσις, or premeditation of murder. Obviously,
                    such a person was equally guilty whether his victim died or not (Harpocration,
                    <hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi> βovλε√σεως), and therefore equally within the
                    jurisdiction of one and the same court. Still it has been usual to follow
                    Schömann <hi rend="italic">(Grieeh. Alterthumer,</hi> i. p. 449) in drawing this
                    distinction, that when death ensued the case went before the Areopagus, and
                    before the Palladium when the victim survived. But this distinction has been
                    made for the sake of admitting both authorities to be correct, when, on the one
                    hand, Isaeus and Aristotle (as quoted by Harpocration) refer <hi rend="italic"
                    >βουλευσις</hi> to the Palladium, while Dinarchus (see Harpocration) on the
                    other hand refers it to the Areopagus. It would be better to dismiss the
                    authority of Dinarchus altogether, the more so since in a speech of Antiphon,
                    admittedly in a case of βovλεvσις (Choreutae), a form of address is employed, ώ
                    dvδpες (once, ώανδρες δικaστaι), which would not have been proper for the
                    Areopagus, where the form was ω <hi rend="italic">βουλή</hi> (Philippi, <hi
                    rend="italic">Der Areopag,</hi> p. 32). The punishments inflicted by the
                    Areopagus were—(1.) For wilful murder, death, the execution of which was
                    witnessed by the accuser. It is probable that confiscation of the criminal’s
                    property was included in the sentence, but this point is obscure. His property
                    was certainly confiscated when it happened that he escaped before sentence was
                    pronounced. (2.) For injury with intent <hi rend="italic">(τραύμα</hi> ε’κ <hi
                    rend="italic">πpοvοiας)</hi> the sentence was confiscation of property and
                    banishment, but not for life. If the victim of either of these crimes was a <hi
                    rend="italic">μeτοtκος,</hi> or alien, the punishment, it has been supposed, was
                    less severe, but of this there is no real evidence. The proceedings, in cases
                    that came before the Areopagus, began, as did all δiκαι <hi rend="italic"
                    >φοviκal,</hi> with a charge <hi rend="italic">(γραφή)</hi> made before the
                    archon king sitting in his chambers in the agora. It was his business to take
                    down the charge and to make such a preliminary inquiry into the facts as would
                    guide him in sending the case for trial. For this purpose he appointed three
                    separate occasions in three successive months, but whether he was contented to
                    search into the facts alleged by the accuser, or whether he examined also the
                    accused, is a point on which there is no evidence. It is only known in general
                    terms that the inquiry was conducted with great care, and, it is not improbable,
                    in presence of members of the Areopagus, who would thus obtain a mastery of the
                    evidence before the trial took place.</p>

                <p>The accuser was required to prove his relationship to the murdered person as
                    giving him the right to prosecute; he had to take an oath in pledge of his
                    sincerity, and to denounce the accused. A denunciation <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πρόρρησις)</hi> having been publicly made, the accused was regarded as
                    polluted, and durst enter neither temple nor market-place on peril of his life.
                    Some have thought that the practice was to make a formal denunciation three
                    times, first at the grave of the deceased, next in the market-place, and then
                    before the archon as just stated (Schömann, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquitates</hi><hi rend="italic">Jur.</hi><hi rend="italic">Pub.,</hi> p.
                    289), but it is probable that only the last mentioned, if the others were
                    actually made, was regarded as legal. In the fourth month, after determining
                    that the case was to go before the Areopagus, the archon king in his capacity of
                    president of the court laid the case before it. The court sat on the last three
                    days of every month (Pollux, viii. 18). Of the first part of the proceedings
                    (προδικάσιαι) the principal feature was the administration of an oath to the
                    parties and the witnesses; the ceremony consisting in the sacrifice of a wild
                    boar, an ox, or a ram, before which those who took the oath called on the
                    Erinnyes to destroy them and their family if they failed to speak the truth.
                    When the evidence had been gone through (άνάκρισις) there followed the <hi
                    rend="italic">δίκη</hi> proper, consisting of the speeches. Each party was
                    allowed to speak twice, once, it is said, on each of the first two days, the
                    third day being reserved for judgment. They were charged to avoid everything
                    irrelevant to the issue. After the first speech, the accused might choose
                    voluntary exile unless the charge against him were that of the murder of a
                    parent. In exile, beyond the boundaries of the Athenian state, he was entitled
                    to the full protection of law, and if himself murdered could be avenged as if he
                    had then been a true Athenian citizen. Should the trial go its full length, he
                    could only be convicted by a majority of the judges. If the votes were equal he
                    was acquitted, and when acquitted he offered a sacrifice to the Erinnyes and the
                    other deities of the lower world. When it happened that the person entitled to
                    prosecute had missed the regular occasions of making his charge, it was still
                    competent for him to take the summary proceedings of an απαγωγή <hi
                    rend="italic">φόνον,</hi> that is, to lay his case before the Eleven who
                    presided over the prisons, and have the case tried by a Heliastic court. But
                    this could not well be done unless the accused had been caught in the act, or
                    failed to give a reasonable account of himself. When the victim survived he
                    himself was the proper prosecutor; but when in the contrary event the task
                    devolved on his relatives, it was necessary for them to be within the prescribed
                    degree of cousinship <hi rend="italic">(αv(ψc0τηs'),</hi> as may be seen from
                    the formula in Pseudo-Demosthenes <hi rend="italic">(Adv. Macαrtatum,</hi> p.
                    1069, § 57), which again has been strikingly confirmed by the decree (Köhler,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> ii. p. 27), discovered at Athens in 1843, and
                    setting forth part of the laws of Draco in regard to murder. This decree,
                    inscribed on marble and in a very fragmentary condition, bears date 409-8 B.o. A
                    slave having in the eyes of the law no relatives, could not prosecute the
                    murderer of one of his class, but he could appear against the murderer of his
                    master if empowered in writing to do so before the master’s death. The master
                    was the lawful accuser when a slave was murdered, and similarly only the legal
                    patron could appear in the case of a freedman or other who had not the rights of
                    citizenship. The theory of the prosecution being to obtain, as had been the
                    custom from time immemorial, vengeance for the relatives of the deceased, and
                    being therefore more of a religious than political character, it becomes a
                    question whether, in the event of the relatives refusing to prosecute, or of
                    there being no relatives, the state permitted a foul crime to pass unpunished.
                    On this point there is no information.</p>
                <p>. Besides being a court of justice (δικαστήριο^), the Areopagus was also a
                    council (βουλή), empowered to interfere in matters affecting religion and
                    morals, and, previously to the time of Pericles, in the administration of public
                    affairs. With powers of this order honestly exercised, it is not singular that
                    Isocrates <hi rend="italic">(Areopag.,</hi> 39) in his picture of Athens in the
                    happy times gone by, should point to the action of the Areopagus as one of three
                    great sources of this happiness (c∕. Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Solon,</hi> 22;
                    <hi rend="italic">Themisc,</hi> 10; and Böckh, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Staatshaushaltung,</hi> i. p. 208). Nor is it against the view of Isocrates
                    that Pericles and his party should have been opposed to the Areopagites. The
                    mere fact of their being strongly conservative, and of their having the power of
                    opposing, if not with a veto, at least with enormous official influence, his new
                    schemes of administration, would be sufficient excuse. And it appears certain
                    that the scope of the measure proposed by his friend Ephialtes, and carried
                    during the absence of Cimon the conservative leader, was only to withdraw from
                    the Areopagus this power of interference. Its criminal jurisdiction remained as
                    before, though so much would hardly be gathered from the tone of Aeschylus in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Eumenides,</hi> which appeared as a protest, it has
                    usually been thought, at the time. ’Εφιάλτες <hi rend="italic">μόνα</hi>
                    κατελιπ∈ <hi rend="italic">τy</hi> ε£ ’ <hi rend="italic">Apelov</hi> πάγου <hi
                    rend="italic">βουλή τα</hi><hi rend="italic">vτrep</hi> του σώρ,ατος, says
                    Philochorus, while Demosthenes <hi rend="italic">(Adv. Aristocrat.,</hi> p. 644
                    § 66) states that no tyrant, oligarchy or democracy, had ever ventured to
                    withdraw from that court its jurisdiction in high crimes. Only a passage in a
                    speech of Lysias <hi rend="italic">(Eratosth.</hi> 30) really favours the
                    opposite view.</p>
                <p>Among the many other functions which the Areopagites retained after the measure
                    of Ephialtes were—(1.) those pertaining to religion. They appointed the
                    iεpoπoιoι for the temple of the Eumenides, and took care of the sacred olives
                    (p,opiαι), which existed partly in large plantations near the academy, and
                    partly on private lands, such trees being the property of the goddess Athene,
                    against whom it was a crime to injure one of them. The Areopagus could oppose
                    the introduction of new deities or foreign rites, as in the case of St Paul, who
                    had .to appear before it (Acts xvii. 19, /i); but it does not seem that it
                    could, as has been assumed; prohibit such a step if once approved of by a public
                    decree. It saw that no object of public sanctity was violated. (2.) In education
                    and morals little positive is known of its action. It seems to have appointed
                    the masters in the gymnasia, and brought to punishment vagabonds and
                    spendthrifts under the law entitled νόρ,ος αργίας. (3.) Its business was to see
                    that public spaces were not occupied or built on by private persons, as in the
                    case of Timarchus (Aeschines, <hi rend="italic">Adv. Timarch.,</hi> § 80), who
                    had put it to the public assembly whether the deserted Pnyx might not be built
                    on. Many inscribed bases of statues in Athens, though mostly of a comparatively
                    late date, bear witness that the consent of the Areopagus, if not indispensable,
                    was very frequently obtained for the erection of statues. (4.) It protected the
                    standards of weight and measure from falsification. (5.) It exercised an
                    inquisitorial power, partly <hi rend="italic">sua sponte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(αυτή</hi><hi rend="italic">πpoeλoμcvη),</hi> and partly by mandate from the
                    public assembly (του <hi rend="italic">δήμου προστάζοντας</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >αυτf).</hi> In the latter case it merely investigated the facts <hi
                    rend="italic">(ζητησιv πo</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >H,σθac),</hi> and laid them before a Heliastic court. Work of this kind,
                    depending as it did on the public assembly, necessarily varied greatly at
                    different times. From about 350 to 320 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it seems
                    to have been of a very grave character. (6.) The Areopagus reviewed the conduct
                    of magistrates and the administration of the laws, a function which was
                    relegated, probably by the measure of Ephialtes, to the Nomophylaces, who,
                    though they do not become conspicuous till the time of Demetrius of Phaleron
                    (317-307 B.C.), had yet existed doubtless long before.</p>
                <p>If now it is true that the Areopagites as a criminal court <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n541/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0541-0484"/> were created and organised by Solon to supersede
                    the Ephetae in the trial of certain crimes, what is to be said of their origin
                    as a state council <hi rend="italic">(βovλη) 1</hi> Obviously most of their
                    duties as a council were such as must have grown up gradually upon an
                    institution of very high antiquity, such an institution, for example, as the
                    Homeric <hi rend="italic">βουλή γερόντων.</hi> Yet there is no direct evidence
                    of the existence of the Areopagus as a council before the time of Solon. It has
                    therefore been suggested that the Areoρagitic council appointed by Solon took
                    upon itself the duties of a differently constituted council, which also may have
                    held its sittings on the hill of the Areopagus. This superseded council it was
                    first thought by K. O. Müller consisted of Ephetae, who, according to the most
                    recent derivation of the name (∈⅛ι and <hi rend="italic">erης = εrη&lt;s,
                    pετηf),</hi> were the heads of clans. The opinion of Müller has been adopted by
                    Philippi <hi rend="italic">(Der Areopag,</hi> p. 208). With less probability
                    Wecklein <hi rend="italic">(Bericht,</hi><hi rend="italic">d.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Münch.</hi><hi rend="italic">Akad.,</hi> 1873, p. 38, ff.) had
                    suggested the Naucrari. From the time of Solon, except for the change introduced
                    by Ephialtes, the powers of the Areopagus seem to have remained much the same
                    down to the Roman period, its position in point of respect and influence
                    apparently increasing the longer it continued, though clearly it is too much to
                    say as Cicero does <hi rend="italic">(De Nat. Deor.</hi> ii. 29, 7 4) <hi

                    rend="italic">consilio regi Areopagi.</hi> But its constitution had been changed
                    by Plutarch’s time, possibly long before. It was then presided oγer by an <hi

                    side, and was no longer composed of the retiring archons. The principle of
                    election is not known. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> s. <hi rend="smallcaps"
