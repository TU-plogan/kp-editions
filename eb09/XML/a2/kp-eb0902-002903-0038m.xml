                <p><label type="entry">ANGERS</label>, an ancient city of France, capital of the
                    department of Maine-et-Loire, and formerly of the old province of Anjou,
                    situated on the Maine, about 4 miles from its junction with the Loire, and 161
                    miles S.W. of Paris. The streets of the upper and older quarter of the city,
                    which occupies the slope of a rising ground on the left bank of the river, are
                    narrow and often very steep, and the houses have a sombre, although somewhat
                    picturesque appearance, from the quantity of slate that is used in their
                    construction. Many of these buildings, however, have given place to others of a
                    more modern style, particularly near the site of the old ramparts, now occupied
                    by beautiful boulevards, while on the opposite side of the river a new quarter
                    has sprung up, which is regularly and tastefully built. Among the principal
                    buildings in Angers are the castle, situated on a rock commanding the city, once
                    a place of great strength, but now used as a prison, barrack, and powder
                    magazine; the fine cathedral of St Maurice, rebuilt in 1225, and remarkable for
                    its beautiful stained glass windows; the Hôtel Dieu, built by Henry II. of
                    England; and several of the parish churches. Angers is the seat of a bishop, and
                    possesses schools of different grades, various learned societies, a library of
                    about 40,000 volumes, and a gallery containing a good collection of pictures and
                    statues, including some fine works by the sculptor David of Angers. There was
                    once a university in the town, as well as a military college, at which the Earl
                    of Chatham and the Duke of Wellington received part of their education; but the
                    former has been abolished, while the latter has been removed to Saumur. The
                    chief manufactures at Angers are sail-cloths, ropes, linen goods, hosiery,
                    sugar, leather, wax, and oil; there is also a considerable trade in corn, wine,
                    and fruits, and in the neighbourhood there are extensive slate quarries, which
                    give employment to about 3000 workmen. Population, 58,464. Angers is the ancient

                    rend="italic">Andecaυia,</hi> whence the city is said to derive its present
                    name. It was captured by Odoacer in 464 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and by
                    Clovis in 486; it suffered severely from the invasions of the Northmen in 845
                    and the succeeding years, and of the English in the 12th and 15th centuries; the
                    Huguenots took it in 1585, and the Vendean royalists were repulsed near it in
