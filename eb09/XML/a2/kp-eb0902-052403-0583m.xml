                    science, there appear to be three points that call for particular notice, viz.,
                    the conception of number, the representation of numbers either by words or
                    graphically by characters, and the principles and modes of computation.</p>
                <p>1. The primary conceptions of numbers are necessarily of a very crude kind. The
                    child attains the notion slowly by experience, and the ability that even adults
                    have to apprehend the significance of numbers with precision is restricted to an
                    extremely narrow area. This is still more the case among uncivilised races, some
                    of which do not appear to be able to count beyond 3, or 4, or 5, or are at least
                    believed to have no words in their vocabularies that express larger numbers. It
                    is to be remembered that the knowledge that is acquired regarding numbers
                    through experience and culture is not of numbers absolutely or in the abstract,
                    but rests almost entirely on a perception of the relations which numbers bear to
                    each other.</p>
                <p>The power to form a direct and immediate conception of numbers is very limited;
                    but the relative magnitudes of numbers, large as well as small, can be expressed
                    with the utmost accuracy, and so as to .be clearly understood. The system of
                    notation in common use, whereby we express not merely numbers, but parts of
                    numbers, supplies us with means of comparing arithmetically together either the
                    greatest or the minutest magnitudes, to which there is absolutely no limit. The
                    proportion, for instance, that the circumference of a circle bears to the
                    diameter, though it cannot be stated with arithmetical exactness, has been
                    calculated to upwards of 200 decimal places,—a nicety for which the vast
                    dimensions that science discloses in the physical universe furnish no means of
                    comparison whatever. For let it be supposed that a circle were described, with a
                    point on the earth’s surface as centre, so as to extend beyond the most distant
                    star that can be discerned by the most powerful existing telescope, that the
                    radius of the circle were known, and that the circumference were computed from
                    it, it does not appear that an error in the thirtieth decimal place would be of
                    such magnitude that the keenest vision, aided by the most powerful microscope,
                    could detect it.</p>
                <p>In all systems of number, with the exception, perhaps, of the very rudest,
                    numerical conceptions are aided by the introduction, usually at a very early
                    stage, of methods of grouping. In nearly every case the methods adopted connect
                    themselves with the number of the fingers, either of one or, more usually, of
                    the two hands. Having reached 5 or 10, the reckoner proceeds by adding to these
                    the prior numbers; and when a second 5 or 10 is reached, a new word or sign is
                    employed, the significance or derivation of which is generally well marked in
                    the name or form it bears. Similarly when (say) five fives or ten tens are
                    reached, a fresh start is made. These processes of grouping are of great
                    importance, conveying clearer conceptions than could otherwise be obtained of
                    the relative magnitudes of numbers. An additional evidence of the value of the
                    principle is to be found in certain numerical combinations which are not
                    additive, as such combinations mostly are, but subtractive. Thus, if a
                    conception be formed of 10, and again of 20, 19 and even 18 will connect
                    themselves more readily with the latter than with the former, and so we have
                    such forms as <hi rend="italic">duodeviginti</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >undeviginti;</hi> and there is little doubt that similar considerations, in
                    combination with a regard for brevity of expression, have led to the use of the
                    subtractive forms IX., XL., &amp;c.</p>
                <p>2. There are two ways in which numbers are represented, —either in words or by
                    particular characters or symbols. It is with the latter that arithmetic has more
                    especially to do, the numerous important and interesting questions that relate
                    to word-numerals falling rather within the domain of language. It is only in so
                    far as they arise out of the systems of grouping already referred to, suggesting
                    in their formation such processes as addition or multiplication, that these call
                    for any notice here. Dr Tylor <hi rend="italic">{Primitive Culture,</hi> chap,
                    vii.) gives a variety of remarkable collocations of this sort, as well as of
                    descriptive numerals, that are in use among different races and tribes.</p>
                <p>There is also a common use of characters to represent numbers which does not
                    properly belong to this subject. The letters A, B, C, &amp;c., or α, <hi
                    rend="italic">β,</hi> γ, or the like, the order of whose succession is fixed,
                    are often employed to indicate numerical order, either singly or in combination
                    with numerals proper. This is not, however, an arithmetical use of the
                    characters; they are merely <hi rend="italic">ordinals,</hi> and cannot furnish
                    a basis for calculation.</p>
                <p>The origin of the various characters which have been employed to indicate numbers
                    proper, and by means of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n584/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0584-0525"/> which computations can be effected, is in most
                    cases alphabetical. In the Hebrew and Greek notations, for instance, the letters
                    were taken in the main in their alphabetical order, being divided into three
                    groups, of which the first represented units, the second tens, and the third
                    hundreds; and very similar Systeme have been in use among other nations. As the
                    Hebrew alphabet contained no more than twenty-two letters, the numbers from 500
                    to 900 were represented by five final forms, and sometimes by additive
                    combinations with ∏, 400. The following is the usual Hebrew notation, numbers
                    exceeding ten being made up by placing the larger numeral characters first

                <p>The ordinary Greek notation has not merely a general resemblance of structure to
                    the Hebrew, but corresponds to it closely, character for character, up to 80.
                    The Greek alphabet consisting of twenty-four letters, three additional
                    characters were introduced. The first, for 6, occupying the place of 1, is <hi
                    rend="italic">ς-</hi> (named <hi rend="italic">στaυ),</hi> which was afterwards
                    used as a contraction for στ; the other3, for 90 and 900, were named κόππα and
                    σαμπι respectively, and wτitten? or and ft). The notation is thus as follows

                <p>To distinguish the numeral letters an accent was written after the last,—thus, 38
                    was <hi rend="italic">λη,</hi> while thousands were indicated by writing the
                    accent below,—thus <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> δ was 4000. The letter M (for
                    <hi rend="italic">μυpioi)</hi> increased the numeral 10,000 times. Fractions
                    were separated by a space from the integers they were affixed to, and the
                    denominator was written like an index or power in our notation,—thus, <hi
                    rend="italic">μγ θ</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ιa</hi> was 43 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ¾ <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>.</p>
                <p>In addition to this another entirely different notation is found in Greek
                    inscriptions. It more nearly resembles the Roman system, the numeral characters
                    (except the first) being the initials of the numeral names, and being repeated
                    till the number to be signified was expressed. I represents, 1, ∏ (πAτ∈) 5, A
                    (δtκα) 10, Η (cκaτo'v, the aspirate being written as an H) 100, X (χίλιοι) 1000,
                    M (∕ιυpioι) 10,000. Characters enclosed within three lines (forming a ∏) are
                    thereby multiplied by 5. To give an example, in this notation ∣ II ∣ HH ]~∆1
                    ΔΠIII represents 768.</p>
                <p>The Roman system, with which we are still familiar nearly in its completeness,
                    employs the letters of the alphabet, but-is not based upon alphabetical order.
                    Many attempts have been made to account for the symbols, and the complete
                    solution of the problem of their origination is perhaps unattainable. Sir John
                    Leslie, following some writers of the 16th and 17th centuries (see in particular
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cursus</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematicus</hi> of
                    Dechâles, vol. i. 1674, 2d. ed. 1690), advocated the opinion that, one line or
                    stroke being taken to represent the unit, when ten of these were set down, a
                    stroke would be drawn across them in a slanting direction to cancel them, and
                    the unit stroke and cancelling stroke would thus give the form X for 10; that a
                    repetition of this proceeding would give a third stroke when 100 was reached,
                    and the three might take the form C or C; and that, similarly, the combination
                    of four strokes would give M for 1000. This explanation is perhaps too
                    ingenious. It has the merit of accounting for the X (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >crux</hi> of the method), which may have been introduced in some such way. But
                    one does not readily see Iιow the CZ could be formed from the X, or the M from
                    the Q i and it appears far more likely that the signs for 100 and 1000 are
                    merely the initial letters of <hi rend="italic">Centum</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Mille,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> all the more that the very
                    ancient notation noticed above as found in Greek inscriptions has evidently an
                    origin of this kind. In any case V, L» and D appear to be respectively the
                    halves of X, the angular C (C), and the rounded M (co). The ancient forms of D
                    and M, viz., IO and CIO, have ceased to be familiar. By an extension of this
                    style of characters, IOO denoted 5000; CCIOO, 100,000; CCCIOOO, 1,000,000,
                    &amp;c. To represent two, three, &lt;fcc., millions, the CCCIOOO was repeated
                    the required number of times.</p>
                <p>The Roman notation employs fewer characters than the Greek, and makes greater use
                    of combinations. One is repeated up to four; to the new character for five, ones
                    are repeated up to nine; ones are added to the ten character; at fifteen the
                    five enters, and so at twenty-five, &amp;c.; for the tens up to forty the ten is
                    repeated, and so on,—the symbols I, V, X, L, C, D expressing all numbers by
                    regular combinations up to M, a thousand. The subtractive collocations, IV, IX,
                    XL, XC, now the ordinary, were originally alternative forms, as were also the
                    rarer combinations IIX for 8, XIIX for 18, XXC for 80, &lt;tc. To the extent of
                    these subtractive forms, the values of the characters depended on their
                    position, a smaller number being added to a greater when it followed, and
                    subtracted from it when it preceded it. This element of position is, however, an
                    irregular and exceptional one; and, instead of being of such advantage as the
                    local value of the Arabic notation, is rather a hindrance in calculation.</p>
                <p>Far superior to all the ancient systems, and indeed to every other system that
                    exists, is the arithmetical notation that is in common use. The Arabic numerals,
                    aa they are called, are ten in number, nine of them representing the first nine
                    numbers, and the tenth, the cipher or zero, indicating the absence or negation
                    of numerical value. The significance of these figures or digits depends on their
                    relative position, and the great merit of the system is due to this element of
                    local value. Standing singly, the figures denote simply one, two, three,
                    &amp;c.; but in combinations of them every removal towards the left increases
                    the value of the figure ten times. In 5673, for instance, the 3 denotes three,
                    the 7 seven tens (70), the 6 six times ten tens (600), the 5 five times ten
                    hundreds (5000). Should any of the series of tens be wanting, as in nine
                    thousand and forty-eight, where hundreds do not occur, the place is supplied by
                    a cipher, which throws back the digit that expresses thousands into its proper
                    place, thus 9048. It is by this use of the cipher in supplying blanks, and so
                    regulating the places of the significant digits, that the principle of local
                    value is carried out,. See further the sections on notation and numeration
                    below, p. 527.</p>
                <p>The ordinary numerals are called Arabic, and it appears to have been through the
                    Arabians that they were introduced into Europe; but they are now generally
                    acknowledged to be of Indian origin. As may be imagined, they have passed
                    through a great variety of forms, one of the earliest types of them being the
                    <hi rend="italic">Devaηagari,</hi> a species of Sanskrit numerals. In the early
                    Indian treatise of Bhascara and Brahmegupta, translated by Mr Colebrooke (see
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Algebra,</hi> p. 517 of vol. i,), as well as in the
                    still earlier writings of Arya-Bhatta, there are both indications and
                    illustrations of the use of the nine digits and the cipher; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n585/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0585-0526"/> and the system is thus traced back to the 7th,
                    and in all probability to the 5th century of the Christian era. Even then it was
                    evidently no novelty, but is alluded to as holding an established position; and
                    the Hindu writers nowhere lay claim to the invention of it, but constantly
                    assign to it a supernatural origin. The method was known to the Arabians in the
                    9th century; and in the course of the 10th it seems to have come into general
                    use among them, especially in their astronomical writings and tables. It was
                    probably in the following century that the Arabs introduced the notation into
                    Spain; but in regard to this we have no explicit information, and different
                    accounts are given of the earliest instances of the use of the system in Europe.
                    On the one hand, it is alleged that the figures first occur in a translation of
                    Ptolemy, of the date 1136, while others maintain that they were introduced
                    (about 1252) by means of the celebrated astronomical tables published by and
                    named from Alphonso the Wise. That their use was known in Italy at the
                    commencement of the 13th century, appears to be satisfactorily established, for
                    there is no good reason to doubt the genuineness of the MS. writings of Leonardo
                    of Pisa, copies of which have been found bearing the dates 1202 and 1220.
                    Numerous other instances are given of the early use of the nine figures and the
                    cipher, especially by astronomers, and in calendars. The great superiority of
                    this to earlier modes of numerical expression became gradually apparent, and in
                    course of time it came into almost universal use among civilised nations.</p>
                <p>For a time there was, not unnaturally, considerable inexactness or confusion in
                    the employment of the notation. In early writings such combinations are found,
                    for example, as X2 for 12, 301 for 31, &amp;c. In the latter case the law of
                    local value is lost sight of, and the characters 30 are used as equivalent to
                    thirty, irrespective of their position.</p>
                <p>3. Calculation or computation by means of numerical characters is what is
                    ordinarily regarded as the distinctive province of arithmetic, and the worth of
                    a system of notation is to be estimated by the facilities it affords for the
                    operations of reckoning. The methods in common use will be detailed, and the
                    principles on which they depend briefly expounded, in subsequent sections of
                    this article.</p>
                <p>Computation of a comparatively rude kind was often carried on in ancient times,
                    and is practised still in some countries, by what are called palpable
                    methods,—as, for instance, by means of counters, or by balls strung on rods or
                    running in grooves. Of this the abacus of the Romans (used too, but not so
                    generally, among the Greeks), the swan-pan, still in constant use among the
                    Chinese, &amp;c., aro examples. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Abacus,</hi> vol. i.
                    p. 4.)</p>
                <p>The methods that preceded the adoption of the Arabic numerals were all
                    comparatively unwieldy, and very simple processes involved great labour. The
                    notation of the Bomans, in particular, could adapt itself so ill to arithmetical
                    operations, that nearly all their calculations had to be made by the abacus. One
                    of the best and most manageable of the ancient systems is the Greek, though that
                    too is very clumsy, as may be seen from an elementary example.</p>

                <p>The notation employed here extends to hundreds of millions. A scheme proposed by
                    Archimedes, the most distinguished mathematician of antiquity, in his work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">⅛aμμhrη&lt;s, Ar</hi><hi rend="italic">enamus,</hi>
                    goes far beyond this. Taking the limit of the ordinary system, viz., a myriad of
                    myriads, or 100,000,000, as the basis of a new scale, he treats of numbers
                    formed by the continued product of that amount repeated eight times, extending
                    to sixty-four places in our notation. These he divided into what we should call
                    periods, of eight figures each, to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >octades.</hi> He thus appears to have to some extent anticipated the modern
                    method of grouping, though, from the want of knowledge of the principle of local
                    value, the practical advance he made was unimportant. Apollonius of Perga, who
                    flourished a little after the time of Archimedes, took the myriad as the basis
                    of his system, and repeated the sign Mυ for each product of a myriad; thus
                    λδMυ.Mυ.Mυ indicates what we would write as 34,000,000,000,000. But his most
                    important contribution to arithmetical science was his grouping the tens in
                    multiplication, so as to connect large numbers, as far as possible, with those
                    we represent by the nine digits. He thus endeavoured, and with some measure of
                    success, to remedy the defect of the general system arising from the want of
                    apparent connection of such characters as λ and τ, for example, or π and ω, with
                    what he called their bases, γ and <hi rend="italic">η.</hi> It is chiefly in the
                    commentaries of Eutocius on the works of Archimedes and Apollonius that the
                    examples of the ancient Greek arithmetic which we possess are preserved.</p>
                <p>The operations of the Greek arithmetic involving fractions were necessarily very
                    complicated. A simpler system was introduced (by Ptolemy, according to his
                    commentator Theon, but it appears to have existed before his time) in what are
                    known as <hi rend="italic">sexagesimals,</hi> which are precisely analogous to
                    the duodecimals by which we sometimes calculate areas. The division of the
                    circle into 360 degrees arose, no doubt, from 360 approximating the number of
                    days in the year, and containing a large number of divisors. The radius of the
                    circle, or side of the inscribed hexagon, subtended at the centre 60 of these
                    degrees, and from this the degree was again divided into 60 parts called
                    minutes, the minute into 60 seconds, &lt;fcc., just as the foot is divided into
                    12 inches, the inch into 12 seconds, &amp;c., in duodecimals. The sexagesimal
                    system, though applied in the first instance to circular, was also employed in
                    linear, measurements. As an example, the square of <hi rend="italic">λζ</hi> δ
                    v∈, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of 37° 4' 55', will be found to be <hi
                    rend="subscript"> z</hi> ατoε δ <hi rend="italic">ιδ ι κε, i.e.,</hi> 1375° 4'
                    14" 10" ’ 25"". The numerals beyond 60 or £ being dispensed with in this system,
                    the next letter, o, was used to denote zero; and it has been conjectured that
                    this may have been the origin of the form of our cipher.</p>
                <p>The most important step in the progress of modern arithmetic was the introduction
                    of decimal fractions, and the extension of the Arabic notation to the expression
                    of them. The first writer who advocated and exemplified the use of decimals was
                    Simon Stevin de Bruges, better known as Stevinus, in a paper (Zα <hi
                    rend="italic">Disme)</hi> published about 1585; but he employed an awkward
                    notation, and it was only after a considerable period that they assumed the
                    form— entirely consistent with the notation of integers—with which we are
                    familiar. From a form which Lord Napier employs in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rabdologia</hi> (1617), the introduction of the decimal point (as a comma) has
                    been ascribed to him, but apparently without sufficient evidence.</p>
                <p>The following writers on arithmetic may be named, in addition to those already
                    mentioned:—Diophantus, who flourished in or about the 4th century; Maximus
                    Planudes, who died about 1350; Lucas Pacioli (de Burgo, or di Borgo), whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Summa de</hi><hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi> (1494) was the
                    first work on algebra printed, and one of the earliest on arithmetic; Bishop
                    Tonstall, whose <hi rend="italic">De Arte</hi><hi rend="italic">Supputandi</hi>
                    (1522) was the first work on the subject printed in English; <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0586-0527"/> Robert Recorde (died 1558), whose <hi

                    Witte</hi> were arithmetical works of great value; Nicolo Tartaglia (died 1559);
                    Michael Stiefel or Stifelius (1486-1567), said to have been the inventor of the
                    signs + and Peter Ramus (1515-1572); Albert Girard (died 1634); William Oughtred
                    (died 1660); Edward Cocker, whose <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic</hi> (1st ed.
                    1677), a posthumous work, and probably a forgery, is of slight merit, though it
                    passed through many editions; Kästner <hi rend="italic">(Geschichte der

                    far the best history of arithmetic is that of Dr George Peacock, late Dean of
                    Ely, published in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Of recent works on arithmetic there is great abundance, and many of them are of
                    great excellence. They usually contain statements of modes of operation, under
                    the name of “Rules,” with a number of examples under each for practice; and not
                    a few of them give in addition explanations of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rationale</hi> of the methods.</p>
                <p>In the following sections the ordinary processes of arithmetical calculation and
                    their commonest practical uses are briefly explained. The various methods of
                    operation are given with greater or less detail, as has appeared necessary for
                    the exposition of the principles on which the operations depend; and light is in
                    many instances thrown on both processes and principles by illustrative examples.
                    For further examples the reader is referred to the manuals above alluded to. The
                    earlier sections, forming the greater part of the article, are occupied with
                    numbers in the abstract, and the remainder with arithmetic in its practical
                    applications.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Abstract Arithmetic.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Notation</hi> is the name usually given to the expressing of
                    numbers by means of characters or figures.</p>
                <p>The number ten is the basis or <hi rend="italic">radix</hi> of the Arabic system
                    of notation, and every number may be expressed in that notation by combinations
                    of the ten <hi rend="italic">digits,</hi> or numeral figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
                    7, 8, 9, 0, the last (the cipher or <hi rend="italic">zero)</hi> having no value
                    except in combination. When several of these are placed together, every removal
                    towards the left increases the value of a figure ten times. The figure placed
                    furthest to the right has the same significance as when it stands alone, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it represents units, the figure next to it denotes
                    tens, the next hundreds, the next thousands; 8735 is therefore read as eight
                    thousand seven hundred and thirty-five. With more than four figures we should
                    have—still proceeding to the left—tens of thousands; then hundreds of thousands,
                    and then thousands of thousands; but instead of this we use the term millions. A
                    million of millions is a billion,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In France, and by a few English writers, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >thousand</hi> millions is called a billion, a <hi rend="italic">thousand</hi>
                    billions a trillion, &amp;c. The ordinary English usage is at least as
                    convenient, and agrees (which the other does not) with the etymological
                    formation of the words—the billion, trillion, quadrillion, &amp;c., being
                    respectively the second, third, fourth.’ &amp;c powers of a million.</p></note>
                    and a million of billions a trillion. A digit followed by three figures thus
                    expresses thousands; by six figures, millions; by twelve, billions; and so on.
                    Beyond trillions we have—taking the figures in groups of six—quadrillions,
                    quintillions, sextillions, septillions, octillions, nonillions, &lt;fcc. But
                    occasion is very seldom found to employ these terms, and indeed it is difficult
                    to form any distinct or definite idea of even a billion.</p>
                <p>The system of notation in ordinary use is remarkable at once for its simplicity
                    and its completeness. The selection of ten as the basis or radix of the system
                    (whence numbers expressed in this way are said to be in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >denary</hi> scale of notation) is in all probability to be traced to primitive
                    calculations by means of the ten fingers. Ten is well chosen, being neither too
                    large nor too small, but twelve might, in some respects, have been found more
                    convenient. All numbers can be expressed with twelve or any other number as
                    basis, just as with ten.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>With twelve as basis <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >duodenary</hi> scale), the number represented by the figures 8735 would be the
                    sum of 8 × 12 × 12 × 12, 7 × 12 × 12, 3 × 12, and 5, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,e.,</hi> 14,873 in the ordinary or denary scale. To convert 8735 of the
                    denary into the duodenary scale, we find the twelves in it, that is, divide it
                    by 12, the quotient by 12, &amp;c. This gives (using the character <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> for eleven), 507 <hi rend="italic">e</hi>.</p></note></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Numeration</hi> is the art of reading figures employed to
                    express numbers. The following table shows the places of the figures, as already
                    described, up to billions :—</p>

                <p>The figures 8,607,034,740,952, for example, are read thus: —Eight billions, six
                    hundred and seven thousand and thirty-four millions, seven hundred and forty
                    thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two. Ciphers are passed over in reading, their
                    function being to determine the proper position of the significant figures. When
                    the number of figures exceeds four, it is usual to print them off as above in
                    groups of three, by means of commas. At the <hi rend="italic">odd</hi> commas,
                    reckoning from the right hand, we always read thousands; at the <hi
                    rend="italic">even</hi> commas, millions, billions, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Notation</hi> has, in addition to the general meaning
                    already explained, a special signification as the converse of numeration, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is the art of representing by figures numbers that
                    are given expressed in words.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Addition</hi> is the method of finding the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sum</hi> of two or more given numbers, that is, the number to which they amount
                    when taken together.</p>
                <p>Suppose a column, added in the ordinary way, amounts to 34. The 4 is set down
                    under the column, and the 3, representing 30, is added with (or, as usually
                    expressed, “carried to ”) the next column.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Subtraction</hi> is the method of finding the <hi
                    rend="italic">difference</hi> between two given numbers, that is, the number by
                    which the greater number exceeds the less, or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >remainder</hi> after the less is taken from the greater.</p>
                <p>In subtracting, say, 38 from 92, since 8 cannot be taken from 2, we “borrow” from
                    the place of tens, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the 2 is increased by 10, and 8
                    taken from 12 leaves 4. The 10 added (or “borrowed ”) has to be taken away
                    again, and this is done by taking 1 from 9 in the place of tens. But 3 has also
                    to be taken from this 9; so first of all the 1 and 3 are added together, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 1 is “carried” to the 3, and 4 taken from 9 leaves 5,
                    giving 54 as the complete remainder. The “borrowing” process depends on the
                    consideration that when the same amount is added to both numbers their
                    difference is unaltered—it being remembered that <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> in
                    the upper line corresponds to <hi rend="italic">one</hi> a place towards the
                    left in the lower line.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Multiplication</hi> is a method of finding the result
                    produced by adding a given number taken a given number of times. The number to
                    be repeated is called the <hi rend="italic">multiplicand;</hi> the number
                    expressing the times it is taken, the <hi rend="italic">multiplier;</hi> and the
                    result obtained, the <hi rend="italic">product.</hi> The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n587/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0587-0528"/> multiplicand and multiplier are also said to be
                    <hi rend="italic">factors</hi> of the product.</p>
                <p>The multiplicand might be written down the required number of times, and the sum
                    found by addition. But this tedious process is unnecessary when the numbers to
                    be added are all the same We do not then require to pass from figure to figure,
                    as when they are different. In adding six nines, for instance, we do not need to
                    proceed step by step (as with 6 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 6 + 7 = 41), but know the result,
                    54, at once from a table of products which is committed to memory.</p>
                <p>When two numbers are to be multiplied together, either may be taken as the
                    multiplier. For it is evident that the four rows of dots, five in a row, in the
                    margin, are the same as the five rows, four in a row—according as we take the
                    rows horizontally or vertically; that is, 4 times 5 and 5 times 4 amount to the
                    same number.</p>
                <p>The process of multiplication by a single digit—by 8, for instance—is nothing but
                    an abridgement of the operation of writing the multiplicand eight times and
                    adding. When there are more digits than one in the multiplier, we arrange the
                    successive products in the well-known fashion, because the multiplication has to
                    be by 10 times the second digit (counting from the right), 100 times the third,
                    and so on. Thus, in multiplying 92058 by 734, the 2 of the multiplicand is
                    really 2000; the 3 of the multiplier, 30; and the product of these, 6, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 60,000, falls by the ordinary process into its proper
                    place.</p>
                <p>The process of working may sometimes be considerably shortened by multiplying a
                    product already obtained. Thus, to multiply by 568, we may multiply first by 8,
                    and then take 7 times the result, obtaining the product by 56 at once. So with
                    549378, we may begin with 9, and multiply the 9 product by 6 for 54, and the 54
                    product by 7 for 378, observing to arrange the lines correctly, by placing under
                    the right-hand figure of every multiplier the righthand figure of the
                    corresponding product.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Division</hi> is the method of finding how often one given
                    number contains another.</p>
                <p>Of these two numbers, the former is called the <hi rend="italic">dividend,</hi>
                    and the latter the <hi rend="italic">divisor.</hi> The number expressing the
                    times that the first contains the second is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quotient.</hi> When the number of times is not exact, the excess of the
                    dividend over the divisor taken the greatest number of times that the dividend
                    contains it exactly is called the <hi rend="italic">remainder.</hi></p>
                <p>As multiplication is a short method of addition, division (which is the converse
                    of multiplication) is an abridged subtraction. Were we to subtract the divisor
                    from the dividend, subtract it again from the remainder, and continue the
                    process till a remainder less than the divisor were obtained, the number of
                    subtractions would give the required quotient. But this operation is greatly
                    shortened by means of multiplication. Thus, if it is required to find how often
                    9 is contained in 49, remembering that 5 × 9 is 45, and that this is the nearest
                    product not greater than 49, we have at once the quotient 5 and remainder 4.</p>
                <p>In dividing, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 167685 by 287, by the ordinary process
                    of <hi rend="italic">long division,</hi> we find (after, it may be, a trial or
                    two) that 1676 is more than 5 times but less than 6 times 287. The first
                    quotient figure is therefore 5, representing 500; and proceeding in the
                    customary way, we take from the dividend 500 times the divisor, then 80 times,
                    and then 4 times, with 77 over. The dividend, therefore, contains the divisor
                    584 times, with a remainder of 77.</p>
                <p>When the divisor does not exceed 12, the operation is conducted mentally, and the
                    quotient set down at once. This is called <hi rend="italic">short division.</hi>
                    If the divisor is made up of factors not greater than 12, short division may be
                    employed, the factors being taken in succession. When there are two such
                    divisors, the 6)4352^ remainder of the whole division is obtained 8)725—2</p>
                <p>from the partial remainders, by multiplying 90—5</p>
                <p>the second of these by the first divisor, and adding the first to the product.
                    Thus, in the annexed example, division by 48 gives a remainder of 32, for it
                    will be seen that 725 is 5 more than 8 times 90, and 4352 is 2 more than 6 times
                    725. Therefore, 4352 is 2 more than the sum of 48 times 90 and 6 times 5, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it exceeds 48 times 90 by 6 × 5 + 2 = 32, or contains
                    48 90 times and 32 over.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Measures and Multiples of Numbers.—</hi> 8. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >measure</hi> of any number is a number that divides it without a remainder. A
                    <hi rend="italic">multiple</hi> of any number is a number that it divides
                    without a remainder. A <hi rend="italic">common measure,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">common multiple</hi> of several numbers, is a number which is a
                    measure or a multiple of each of them. Thus, 3 is a common measure of 12, 18,
                    and 24; 60 is a common multiple of 6, 10, and 15. A measure of a number is
                    sometimes called a <hi rend="italic">submultiple</hi> of it.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">prime number</hi> is a number which no other, except unity,
                    divides without a remainder; as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, &amp;c. Numbers which
                    are divisible by other numbers without remainder, that is, which can be resolved
                    into factors, are called <hi rend="italic">composite numbers;</hi> as 4, 6, 8,
                    9, 10, &amp;c. Any factors into which a composite number can be divided are
                    called its <hi rend="italic">component parts.</hi> Numbers are said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">prime to each other</hi> when they have no common measure, as 15
                    and 28. The <hi rend="italic">prime factors</hi> of a number are the prime
                    numbers of which it is the continued product. Thus, 2, 3, 7 are the prime
                    factors of 42; 2, 2, 3, 5, of 60.</p>
                <p>9. To find the <hi rend="italic">greatest common measure</hi> of two given
                    numbers, the greater number is divided by the less; the former divisor is then
                    divided by the remainder, and each successive divisor by the remainder obtained
                    in dividing by it, till there is no remainder. The last divisor is the greatest
                    common measure.</p>
                <p>This depends on the two following principles :—(1.) If a number measures any
                    other, it measures every multiple of that other; for obviously, since 7 measures
                    56, it also measures 12 times or 17 times 56; and, (2.) Every number that is a
                    common measure of two others measures also their sum or their difference; for
                    the sum or difference of, say, 13 times 8 and 22 times 8, must, it is evident·,
                    be some multiple of 8.</p>
                <p>Thus, to find the greatest common measure of 475 ar.d 589, dividing 589 by 475,
                    we have the remainder 114; dividing 475 by 114, we have the remainder 19; and
                    114 divided by 19 leaves no remainder. Therefore, 19 is the greatest common
                    measure. For any number that measures 589 and 475 will measure their difference,
                    114, and will, therefore, measure 456, which is a multiple of 114. Also, any
                    common measure of 475 and 456 will measure their difference, 19. Therefore, no
                    number greater than 19 can measure both 589 and 475. Again, 19 will measure
                    both, for it measures 114, and therefore measures 456, a multiple of 114. Hence
                    it measures 475, which is 456 + 19, and also 589, which is 475 + 114. Therefore,
                    19 measures both numbers, and since no greater number does so, it is their
                    greatest common measure.</p>
                <p>In seeking for measures or factors, it will be of advantage to attend to the
                    following properties of numbers. (For the sake of brevity, we use “divisible”
                    here for “divisible without remainder.”)</p>
                <p>(1.) A number is divisible by 2, if the last digit is divisible by 2; by 4, if
                    the last £wo digits are divisible by 4; and by 8, if the last <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> digits are divisible by 8. For, to take the last case, the figures
                    preceding the last <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n588/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0588-0529"/> three are a multiple of 1000, which is a multiple
                    of 8. If, then, the last three figures are divisible by 8, so is the whole
                    number.</p>
                <p>(2.) Similarly, and for precisely similar reasons, a number is divisible by 5, if
                    its last digit is so; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if the number ends with 5 or
                    0; by 25, if it ends with 25 or 75; and by 125, if it ends with 125, 625, 375,
                    or 875.</p>
                <p>(3.) A number is divisible by 9 when the sum of its digits is so divisible. This
                    is a case of the important property that the division of a number by 9 produces
                    the same remainder as the division of the sum of its digits by 9. Taking any
                    number, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 583, we see that it is made up of 58 tens
                    and 3; that is, of 58 nines and 58 and 3. Again, 58 is 5 tens and 8; that is, 5
                    nines and 5 and 8. Thus, 583 is made up of 58 nines, 5 nines, and 5 + 8 + 3;
                    that is, of nines + the sum of its digits. Therefore 583 and 5 + 8 + 3 must give
                    the same remainder when divided by 9.</p>
                <p>A proof of multiplication, by “casting out the nines,” depends on this property.
                    If a number, made up, say, of nines and 7 over, be multiplied by another made up
                    of nines and 5 over, their product must be nines and 35, that is, nines and 8
                    over; and unless this relation holds good, there must be an error in the
                    multiplication.</p>
                <p>(4.) Similarly, a number is divisible by 3, if the sum of its digits is so; for,
                    if every number be made up of nines and the sum of its digits, it must be made
                    of threes and the same sum.</p>
                <p>(5.) A number is divisible by 11, if the sums of its alternate digits are equal,
                    or if they differ by a multiple of 11. Take any number whose alternate digits
                    are equal, or differ by a multiple of 11, as 8294. This is equal to the sum of
                    8000, 200, 90, and 4; that is, of 80 times 99, 80, twice 99, 2, 90, and 4.
                    Leaving out the multiples of 99 (as being multiples of 11), we have 80 + 90 + 2
                    + 4. But as 2 + 4 and a multiple of 11 give 8 + 9, therefore, if 80 + 90 + 2 + 4
                    be divisible by 11, so must 80 + 90 + 8 + 9 be, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> But 88 + 99 is divisible by 11; so, therefore, is 80 + 90 + 2 + 4,
                    and so also 8294.</p>
                <p>If, in finding the greatest common measure by the method described, a divisor
                    occurs containing a factor that evidently does not measure one of the numbers
                    given, that factor may at once be omitted, since it can be no part of the common
                    measure. Thus, in finding the greatest common measure of 59241 and 223014, we
                    get 13950 as a divisor. Now, 50 divides this, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 5 × 5
                    × 2, and neither 5 nor 2 measures the first of the given numbers. We can
                    therefore reduce 13950 to 279 at once, whence we immediately find 93 to be the
                    greatest common measure.</p>
                <p>10. To find the <hi rend="italic">least common multiple</hi> of two given
                    numbers, divide either of the numbers by the greatest common measure of the two,
                    and multiply the other number by the quotient. Thus, the greatest common measure
                    of 30 and 48 is 6. Therefore the least common multiple is 48 X 5 or 30 × 8,
                    t.e., 240. For the product 5 × 6 × 8 is evidently a common multiple of 30 (t.e.,
                    5 × 6) and 48 <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> 6 X 8), and since 8 and 5 are prime
                    to each other, this product must be the least that contains both 5 × 6 and
                    6χ8.</p>
                <p>To find the least common multiple of any given numbers, arrange them in a line,
                    and strike out any of them that measure any of the others; take any number that
                    measures all or part of the remainder, and divide all that it measures by that
                    number, setting down the quotients and the undivided numbers in a second line;
                    proceed with this second line as with the first, and continue this process till
                    a line is obtained of numbers prime to each other. The continued product of the
                    divisors and the numbers in the last line is the least common multiple required.
                    This depends on the principle just demonstrated, that a common factor of two or
                    more numbers needs to be taken but once for the common multiple.</p>
                <p>In finding the least common multiple of 42, 45, 50, 54, 60, 63, 70, 75, and 90,
                    for instance, we may divide in succession by 5, 7, 5, and 6. It is evident that
                    45 may be omitted, since it will measure every multiple of 90. The division by 5
                    is virtually the substitution for 50, 60, 70, 75, and 90, of the product 5 × 10
                    × 12 × 14 × 15 × 18, which is manifestly a common multiple of them. Then 14 and
                    18 are omitted, being contained in 42 and 54. Next we substitute for 42 and 63
                    the product 7x6x9; omit 6 and 9 as being contained in 54; then take 5 × 2 × 3,
                    instead of 10 and 15; omit 2 and 3, as measures of 12; and, lastly, substitute 6
                    × 9 × 2 for 54 and 12. The product of 5, 7, 5, 6, 9, 2, gives 18900 as the least
                    common multiple.</p>
                <p>If the divisors are all prime numbers, the result must be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >least</hi> common multiple; and it is better to avoid using composite numbers
                    as divisors, except when they measure <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the numbers in
                    the line. Had 10, for instance, been taken in the example as the first divisor,
                    7 5 would have remained in the second line, and the result obtained would have
                    been five times too great. It is often found convenient to write the prime
                    factors of the least common multiple, which is in the example
                    2×2×3×3×3×5×5×7.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fractions.—</hi> 11. If unity be divided into any number of
                    equal parts, one or more of these parts is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >fraction.</hi> If, for example, we divide unity into 7 equal parts, and take 5
                    of these, we shall obtain the fraction we speak of as five-sevenths. (This, and
                    what follows, may be familiarly illustrated by taking any object and dividing it
                    in the way described—a straight line, for instance, thus, I I I I I I I I <hi

                    >Decimal Fractions</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Decimals.</hi></p>
                <p>A vulgar fraction is represented by two numbers, called the fcrnzs of the
                    fraction, which are written, the one above and the other below a horizontal
                    line; thus, the fraction already mentioned is written -Ç-· The number under the
                    line indicates the number of equal parts into which unity is divided, and is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">denominator,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Though the word employed to express the
                    denominator <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> the “sevenths” in “five-sevenths ”)
                    agrees in form with the ordinal numeral, this use of it is not ordinal. <hi
                    rend="italic">The seventh day</hi> means the seventh in order of time; but <hi

                    one of seven equal parts into which the day is regarded as divided. Some such
                    distinct name as “fractional numerals” should be given to the words when used in
                    the latter sense. The expressions “first part” and “second part” are never used
                    in the fractional sense. For the latter “half” is used; there is no fractional
                    corresponding to the former, <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅛, however, is called

                    “denomination” (see § 32) of the fraction. The number above the line, indicating
                    the number of those equal parts that the fraction consists of, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">numerator.</hi></p>
                <p>The most usual definition of a fraction is that which is given above. But it may
                    be also defined or regarded as one number divided by another, the numerator
                    being the dividend, and the denominator the divisor. Thus, the fraction 4, which
                    we have interpreted to mean 5 of the 7 parts into which unity is supposed to be
                    divided, may also be regarded as the seventh part of 5 units. For, if each of 5
                    units be divided into 7 equal parts, there will be in all 35 of these parts,
                    each of them equal to the seventh part of unity, and the seventh part of these
                    35 parts is 5 of them. That is, the seventh part of 5 units is the samo as 5
                    seventh parts of unity, or ∣ according to the former definition. It follows from
                    this that, when there is a remainder after division, the quotient is completed
                    by the addition of a fraction, of which the remainder is the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n589/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0589-0530"/> numerator, and the divisor the denominator. For,
                    let it be required to divide 76 by 9. Since 72 divided by 9 gives the quotient
                    8, and 4 divided by 9 gives ⅜, 76 divided by 9 must be 8⅜.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">proper fraction</hi> is one whose numerator is less than its
                    denominator; as -⅛∙, ⅜⅜. An <hi rend="italic">improper fraction</hi> is one
                    whose numerator is not less than its denominator; as ⅜, ⅝. A proper fraction is
                    evidently less, and an improper fraction not less, than unity. A <hi
                    rend="italic">mixed number</hi> is an integer or whole number with a fraction
                    annexed to it; as 8⅜, 5⅛ The integer and fraction here are to be considered as
                    added together. A <hi rend="italic">simple fraction</hi> is a single fraction
                    that has both its terms whole numbers; as ⅜, ⅜. A <hi rend="italic">compound
                    fraction</hi> is a fraction of another fraction, or of a whole or mixed number;
                    as f of ⅜, ⅜ of 10∣. A <hi rend="italic">complex fraction</hi> is one that has a
                    fraction or mixed number for one of its terms or for both; as -⅛, ⅛, ⅛ A
                    fraction is</p>
                <p>4⅜ 4f 5</p>
                <p>said to be <hi rend="italic">in its lowest terms</hi> when the numerator and
                    denominator have no common divisor.</p>
                <p>12. If both terms of a fraction be multiplied, or both divided, by the same
                    number, the value of the fraction will remain unchanged. For, if unity be
                    divided into 7 equal parts, and again into 28 equal parts, it is evident that
                    each of the former parts will be identical with 4 of the latter. 5 of the former
                    will thus be equal to 20 of the latter; that is, y = ⅜⅜∙</p>
                <p>13. We multiply or divide a fraction by any number, if we multiply or divide the
                    numerator by it. For it is evident that four times ⅜ is ⅜, since unity is
                    divided into 9 parts in both cases, and the number of parts taken in the one
                    case is four times the number taken in the other. Conversely, dividing f by 4,
                    we have ⅜.</p>
                <p>To multiply or divide either term of a fraction is the same as to divide or
                    multiply the other. If, for instance, we divide the denominator by 3, we divide
                    unity into one-third of the number of parts, and each of these parts must thus
                    be three times greater than before. The fraction is therefore multiplied by 3.
                    Or otherwise, dividing the denominator of ⅜ by 3, we obtain f∙; and multiplying
                    the numerator by 3, we get ⅜, which (§ 12) is the same as ⅜. Therefore, to
                    divide a fraction, we may multiply the denominator,—a method which must be
                    employed when the divisor is not a measure of the numerator.</p>
                <p>14. To reduce a fraction to its <hi rend="italic">lowest terms,</hi> divide both
                    terms by their greatest common measure. The reason of this is evident from the
                    definitions. The value of the fraction remains unchanged (§ 12). The results of
                    operations in fractions should, with rare exceptions, be expressed in their
                    lowest terms.</p>
                <p>15. To reduce a <hi rend="italic">mixed number</hi> to an <hi rend="italic"
                    >improper fraction,</hi> the integer is multiplied by the denominator of the
                    fraction, and the numerator added to the product. This gives the numerator of
                    the required improper fraction, and the denominator of the given fraction is its
                    denominator. Take, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 4∣. If unity be divided into 8
                    equal parts, 4 units will make 32 of these parts, and the fraction ⅜ contains 5
                    of them; therefore 4∣ = ⅞L Conversely, to reduce an <hi rend="italic">improper
                    fraction</hi> to a <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mixed
                    number,</hi> divide the numerator by the denominator; the quotient is the
                    integer required, and the remainder, if there is one, is the numerator of a
                    fraction of which the given denominator is the denominator. Thus, ~ = 5∣; for,
                    if unity be divided into 7 equal parts, 35 of these parts will be the same as 5
                    units; therefore 38 parts will be 5 units and 3 parts, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi><hi rend="italic">-°7‘</hi></p>
                <p>16. To reduce a <hi rend="italic">compound fraction</hi> to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >simple one,</hi> multiply the numerators together for the numerator of the
                    simple fraction, and the denominators together for its denominator. Thus, of ⅞
                    is equal to ⅜f. For, if we divide unity into 7 equal parts, and each of these
                    again into 4, we shall have for the fraction 4 20 of these parts, ι.e,, 2,o <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> f <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> ∏ity. The fourth part of
                    this is 5 of these parts, and therefore ⅜ is 15 of them, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> ⅜ of ∣ is ⅜f.</p>
                <p>Mixed numbers must be put in the form of improper fractions before the
                    multiplication. The reduction of the result to its lowest terms may be effected
                    by removing before multiplication any factors that are common to the numerators
                    and denominators.</p>
                <p>In such compound expressions as where one number is spoken of as one-fourth
                    greater or less than another, the fourth is always to be taken of that number
                    with which the comparison is made. Thus, 30 is <hi rend="italic">one-fifth</hi>
                    more than 25 <hi rend="italic">li.e.,</hi> ⅜ of 25), but 25 is <hi rend="italic"
                    >one-sixth</hi> less than 30 <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> ⅜ of 30).</p>
                <p>17. In order to compare the values of fractions, or to add or subtract them, it
                    is necessary to reduce them to others of equal value that <hi rend="italic">have
                    the same denominator.</hi> From the definition of a fraction we see at once that
                    4 is greater than ⅛, but we do not readily see whether ⅛ is greater or less than
                    ∣. If, however, we take the equivalents of these fractions, ⅜⅜ and ⅛, unity
                    being now divided into the same number of parts in both cases, we have like
                    quantities to compare, and see that the former fraction is the greater. In
                    practice it is usually the <hi rend="italic">least</hi> common denominator that
                    the fractions are compared by. To find this, we first find the least common
                    multiple of the denominators (§ 10), then divide this by the denominator of each
                    fraction separately, and multiply both terms of that fraction by the
                    quotient.</p>
                <p>Take, <hi rend="italic">e.y.,</hi> the fractions i⅜, ⅜⅞, f⅜, and ∣∣∙ The least
                    common multiple of the denominators is 180, and dividing this by 15, 20, 36, and
                    45, we get 12, 9, 5, and 4. Multiplying both terms of the fractions in
                    succession by these numbers, we have ⅛⅜, ⅜f⅜, ⅜⅜⅞, and ⅜⅜⅜. The value of the
                    fractions has not been altered, and all have now the same denominator, 180,
                    which we must obtain in each case, because we re-multiply the factors into which
                    we resolved it. In practice, indeed, we merely divide 180 by 15, multiply 13 by
                    the 12, and set down 180 under 156 at once.</p>
                <p>18. To <hi rend="italic">add</hi> fractions, reduce them to others having a
                    common denominator, then add the numerators of these, and write the common
                    denominator under the sum. Thus,</p>

                    fractions unity is divided into 120 equal parts, and the fractions are
                    respectively equivalent to 50, 15, and 42 of these parts; therefore the sum of
                    the fractions must be 50 +15 + 42 = 107 of them, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,
                    ⅜⅞⅞.</hi></p>
                <p>Compound fractions must be reduced to simple ones before addition. Mixed numbers
                    <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be brought to improper fractions, and so added; but
                    it is generally preferable to add the whole numbers and the fractions
                    separately, and then add the two results. The operation may often be shortened
                    by first adding any of the given fractions whose denominator is considerably
                    less than that of all the fractions; thus, to add ∣⅞, ⅛ ⅜⅜, ∣-2∙, the sum of the
                    first three may be found first, amounting to 1⅞⅜∙ The addition of ∣4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> to</hi> this gi <hi rend="superscript"> ve</hi> ≡ 2⅜⅞4r∙</p>
                <p>19. To <hi rend="italic">subtract</hi> fractions, reduce them to others having a
                    common denominator, take the difference of the numerators so found, and write
                    the common denominator under it. The principle is precisely the same as in
                    addition.</p>
                <p>Compound fractions must be simplified as in addition. With mixed numbers the
                    subtraction will generally be best effected by treating the fractions
                    separately, borrowing and carrying, if necessary, on the principle explained in
                    § 5. In subtracting 47∣⅜ from 85⅜⅞, for instance, borrowing fff and carrying 1
                    gives 85⅜⅛ - 48f∣4 = 37⅜⅛ or 3747, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n590/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0590-0531"/> 20. To <hi rend="italic">multiply</hi> fractions,
                    multiply the numerators together for the numerator of the product, and the
                    denominators together for the denominator. Thus, in multiplying I by ∣, if we
                    multiply ∣ by 7, we have (§ 13); but our multiplier, ⅞, is the ninth part of 7;
                    we must therefore divide by 9, which gives (§ 13).</p>
                <p>When there are several fractions to be multiplied continuously together, we
                    proceed in the same way. Mixed numbers are reduced to improper fractions, and
                    common factors may be struck out, precisely as in § 16. When an integer has to
                    be multiplied by a fraction, we may convert the integer into a fraction by
                    putting 1 as the denominator; or we may multiply the integer by the numerator of
                    the fraction and divide by the denominator, since to multiply by ⅞ is, as has
                    just been shown, to multiply by 7 and divide by 9. So, to multiply an integer by
                    a mixed number, the common method is to multiply by the integer and the fraction
                    of the latter separately, and add the results. In multiplying mixed numbers like
                    46J and 14⅜ together, instead of using improper fractions, we may take the four
                    products 46×14, -j-×14, 46×⅜, and ⅛ × ⅜, and add them. The amount is 644 + 3⅜ +
                    15⅜ + -⅛ = 662∙⅛.</p>
                <p>21. To <hi rend="italic">divide</hi> fractions, invert the terms of the divisor
                    (ι.e., interchange the positions of the numerator and denominator), and multiply
                    the dividend by the inverted fraction; thus, ⅞÷⅞ = ⅛×τ = ⅜⅜∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> we</hi> divide ⅞ by 7, we have <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> s</hi> (§ 13). But since our divisor, ⅞, is the ninth
                    part of 7, in dividing by 7 we divide by a number nine times too large. The true
                    quotient must therefore be nine times -⅛, ie,, ⅜∣.</p>
                <p>The common method of dividing an integer by a mixed number is a modification of
                    this division. When, in dividing by 37⅛, for instance, we multiply both divisor
                    and dividend by 5, and then divide, we really multiply the dividend by <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ∣- <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi>-. Or the method may be
                    explained on the principle (identical with that of § 12) that the multiplication
                    of the divisor and dividend by the same number does not affect the quotient. As
                    an instance of the division of a mixed number by an integer, let 3982⅜⅜ be
                    divided by 54. The quotient is 73, with remainder 40∣-∣; and to obtain the
                    complete quotient, this remainder must be divided by 54 (see § 11), giving
                    ∙⅛⅜4×⅛= <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 73 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛⅛ is the result of the division.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">complex fraction</hi> is reduced to a <hi rend="italic"

                <p>When one term only is fractional, it will be found convenient to multiply both

                    >Decimals.—</hi> 22. In the ordinary denary notation, a figure in combination
                    with others has only the tenth part of-the value it would have if removed a
                    place towards the left (§1); thus, in 374, the 3 signifies 3 times 100; the 7, 7
                    times 10; the 4, simply 4. By an extension of this notation we obtain a species
                    of fractions that are often of very great use, especially for purposes of
                    comparison. If we mark the place of units by a point put after it, and write
                    other figures after the point, we can denote by the first of these figures
                    One-tenth of the value it would have in the units’ place; by the second,
                    one-hundredth part, and so on. In 374’691, then, the 6 is 6 times ⅛ <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅞ <hi rend="subscript"> ιy</hi>; and the 1, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> rξ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> 7y</hi>. Whence, by giving
                    these fractions a common denominator and adding them, we have 374∙691 = 374 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ‰ These <hi rend="italic">decimal fractions</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">decimals,</hi> therefore, are fractions of which the numerator
                    only is written, the denominator being the continued product of as many tens as
                    there are decimal figures.</p>
                <p>In addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of decimals, the
                    operations are, and from the structure of decimals must be, the same as the like
                    operations with integers. The position of the decimal point in the results is
                    the only thing that needs particular explanation.</p>
                <p>Results, it may be mentioned here, are often expressed by decimals that are not
                    exact, but approximate only, it being held sufficient to give the correct value
                    to some assigned number of decimal places. An amount correct to four decimal
                    places differs from the true amount by less than the ten-thousandth part of
                    unity. See above, p. 524.</p>
                <p>To reduce a decimal to a vulgar fraction, write the decimal as the numerator of
                    the fraction, and set under it for the denominator 1 followed by as many ciphers
                    as there are decimal places. This follows at once from the definition of a
                    decimal.</p>
                <p>To reduce a vulgar fraction to a decimal, annex ciphers to both terms of the
                    fraction—the same number in both cases; divide both terms by the significant
                    figures of the denominator, and then write the numerator as a decimal, pointing
                    off as many decimal places (prefixing ciphers, if necessary) as there are
                    ciphers in the denominator. (See also § 25, <hi rend="italic">infra.}</hi> Thus,
                    <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> ⅞ <hi rend="subscript"> tr</hi><hi

                    values unchanged (§ 12), and from the last the decimal is set down according to
                    the definition.</p>
                <p>It very often happens that in dividing as above we find there must always be a
                    remainder. In this case, however, a remainder we had before may soon recur,
                    giving the same figure or group of figures over and over again in the quotient;
                    thus ⅜⅞ is found to be *47222; <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi><hi

                    shall return to the consideration of these recurring decimals at § 26.</p>
                <p>23. To <hi rend="italic">add</hi> or <hi rend="italic">subtract</hi> decimals,
                    write the numbers under each other, placing units under units, &lt;tc., add or
                    subtract as with integers, and place the decimal point under the points in the
                    given numbers. This follows directly from the definition of decimals.</p>
                <p>24. To <hi rend="italic">multiply</hi> decimals, multiply as with integers, and
                    point off as many decimal places as there are in both factors taken together.
                    Thus, in 37 ’ 64 × <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 082 = 3 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > -</hi> 0S648, the 4 and 2 in the factors are <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜
                    <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> and <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 00</hi>; their product is

                <p>If an approximate product be sufficient, the multiplication may be shortened
                    thus. Let it be required to find the product, say, of 4 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 273 and 6*859 correct to three place3- of decimals. Write the figures of
                    the multiplier in reverse order, with the unit figure 4273 under the third
                    decimal place of the multipli-cand. Begin each multiplication with the 25638
                    figure above the multiplier, adding what has 3418</p>
                <p>to be carried from the right hand figure, and 214</p>

                    >(i.e.,</hi> for 36, 38</p>
                <p>for instance, not 3, but 4); place the first 29-308 figures of each
                    multiplication under each other; then add and point off three decimal places. It
                    will be· seen that every figure of the product falls into its proper place, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the 8 and 7, the 5 and 2, &lt;fcc., each give
                    thousandth parts.</p>
                <p>25. To <hi rend="italic">divide</hi> decimals, divide as with integers, and point
                    off as many decimal places in the quotient as the dividend has more than the
                    divisor. This follows from the dividend being the product of the divisor and
                    quotient. <hi rend="italic">Exs.</hi> 228∙956 ÷ 3∙64 = 62 9; 2∙28956 ÷ 36∙4 =
                    ‘0629; 22895’6 ÷'364 = 62900. In the second example, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n591/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0591-0532"/> dividend having five decimal places and the
                    divisor one, the quotient must have four; a cipher is therefore prefixed to the
                    three figures. In cases like the third example, where the dividend has fewer
                    decimal places than the divisor, the number has to be made up in the former by
                    ciphers, and as far as the end of the ciphers making up that number the quotient
                    must be an integer. The quotient may be pointed at any stage after as many
                    decimal places of the dividend have been made use of as there are in the
                    divisor, the first figure after this being always the first decimal. This is
                    especially to be attended to when the division does not terminate, or when a few
                    figures only are required; thus, 63 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 94 divided by
                    ∙237 to two decimal places gives 269∙79; 10 divided by *264 gives 37’87.</p>
                <p>The method of converting a vulgar fraction into a decimal, given in § 22, is in
                    effect the division of the numerator by the denominator, the result being
                    expressed as a decimal. Thus, <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅞⅛ = 83 ÷ 160 =
                    *51875.</p>
                <p>When the quotient is required to a given number of places only (as three in the
                    example), the operation may be shortened by dropping the last figure of the
                    divisor at each successive multiplication. But this must not be commenced till
                    the figures required in the quotient are fewer than the figures in the divisor,
                    and the carriage from the dropped figure is to be added in each instance.</p>

                <p>26. We have seen that the division by means of which vulgar fractions are
                    converted into decimals (§§ 22, 25) will, in certain cases, always leave a
                    remainder. If the fraction be in its lowest terms, there <hi rend="italic"
                    >must</hi> always be a remainder whenever the denominator contains any other
                    prime number as a factor besides 2 and 5. For in adding ciphers we multiply by
                    tens, and we introduce no other factor. It often happens that we can speedily
                    discover what the decimal must be, so as to be able to set down any number of
                    figures without further actual division. Unless the division terminate, the same
                    figures will recur sooner or later; and the same figures must recur before we
                    use as many ciphers as there are units in the divisor. Supposing the divisor is
                    17, we can only have the numbers from 1 to 16 as remainders; the quotient must
                    therefore repeat itself after all these remainders occur, if not earlier. All do
                    occur in dividing by 17; thus, <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛=∙i
                    176470588235294.</p>
                <p>The fraction <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> ^∙ must
                    always be greater than the decimal *41666...., however far the latter be
                    extended; but we can make the difference as small as we choose. Thus •416666
                    does not differ from ⅛ by the millionth part of a unit. The form of the decimal
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 416 is used to show that the 6 is to be
                    considered as repeated continually; and this being understood, we can say that
                    the decimal is <hi rend="italic">equal</hi></p>
                <p>Decimals of this kind are called <hi rend="italic">Recurring Decimals.</hi> They
                    are sometimes distinguished as <hi rend="italic">Repeating</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Circulating Decimals,</hi> according as one figure or more than
                    one recur; and as <hi rend="italic">Pure</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mixed,</hi>
                    according as the recurring figures stand alone or are preceded by non-recurring
                    decimals. Thus, T48 is a pure circulating decimal; T83 is a mixed repeating
                    one.</p>
                <p>27. To reduce a recurring decimal to a vulgar fraction, subtract the decimal
                    figures that do not recur from the whole decimal; set down the remainder as the
                    numerator of the fraction, and as many nines as there are recurring figures,
                    followed by as many ciphers as there are nonrecurring figures, as the
                    denominator.</p>
                <p>The reason of proceeding in this way will appear if, taking any mixed recurring
                    decimal, we multiply it by as many tens as there are decimal places, and again
                    by as many tens as there are non-recurring decimals, and subtract the second
                    product from the first. Take, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> *79054: 100000 times
                    *79054 = 79054Ό54054054....</p>
                <p>and 100 times ∙79054 = 79Ό54054054....</p>
                <p>therefore 99900 times *79054 = 78975 whence *79054 = ⅞⅞‰≡, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e., ⅜⅛</hi></p>
                <p>In the case of pure recurring decimals, we have no subtraction, and the
                    denominator consists entirely of nines. Thus ∙3 = ⅜ = ⅛ <hi rend="subscript">
                    j</hi> ∙27 = ⅜∣ = ⅛.</p>
                <p>28. In practical arithmetic recurring decimals are little used, except in
                    approximations. They can be added or subtracted readily to any number of places
                    by extending all a place or two beyond what is required. When we have to
                    multiply or divide by recurring decimals, we must convert them into vulgar
                    fractions. They may themselves be multiplied or divided by integers or ordinary
                    decimals, though in this case, too, it is often better to use vulgar fractions,
                    especially when exact results are desired.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Powers and Roots of Numbers.—</hi> 29. When a given number is
                    multiplied by itself, the product multiplied again by the number, and so on, the
                    result obtained is called the second, third, fourth, &amp;c., <hi rend="italic"
                    >power</hi> of the number, according as it is the product of the number repeated
                    two, three, four, &amp;c., times. Thus, 7 × 7 × 7 = 343 is the third power of 7;
                    5×5×5×5 = 625, the fourth power of 5. The term “square” is nearly always used
                    instead of “second power” <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> 81 is the square of 9),
                    and “cube” frequently instead of “third power.” The power to which a number is
                    raised is indicated by a small figure written over the number to the right;
                    thus, 8 <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> is the fifth power of 8.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">square root</hi> of a given number is the number which,
                    when multiplied by itself, produces the given number. And so, in general,
                    whatever <hi rend="italic">power</hi> one number is of another, the same <hi

                    or cube root, of 343; 5 is the fourth root of 625; 2 is the fifth root of 32.
                    The sign <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ∕ (which is really an <hi rend="italic"

                    placed over it to denote other roots. Thus, √100 is the square root of 100;
                    ^∕256, the fourth root of 256.</p>
                <p>30. To extract the <hi rend="italic">square root</hi> of a given number, divide
                    it into periods of two figures, by putting a point over every second figure,
                    commencing with that in the units’ place; set down as the first figure of the
                    root, the largest number whose square does not exceed the first or left-hand
                    period; place the square of this number under the first period, and subtract it
                    from it; to the remainder annex the next period; place before this as a trial
                    divisor twice the root figure; consider how often the former (omitting the
                    right-hand figure) contains the latter, and set down the number that expresses
                    this as the next figure of the root; place also this root-figure to the right of
                    the trial divisor; multiply by it the divisor thus completed; subtract the
                    product from the number formed of the former remainder and the period taken
                    down; add another period to the remainder now found; then double the whole root
                    for a new trial divisor, and proceed as before.</p>

                <p>32. Having explained in the foregoing sections the various operations of
                    arithmetic, we now proceed to consider them in their combinations and practical
                    applications. What has been said up to this point refers to numbers merely as
                    numbers, or numbers in the abstract. Now they are to be regarded as applied to
                    particular things, or representing particular magnitudes. Numbers so regarded
                    are called <hi rend="italic">concrete;</hi> and we now treat of <hi
                    rend="italic">concrete</hi> as distinguished from <hi rend="italic"
                    >abstract</hi> arithmetic. Concrete numbers frequently represent not so much
                    number as quantity. To form a distinct and accurate idea of 5 lb of tea bought
                    for 15s., it is not necessary to think of the tea as divided into five portions,
                    or as paid for with fifteen pieces of money.</p>
                <p>It would be found extremely (indeed intolerably) inconvenient to have to make all
                    payments, great and small, by means of one particular species of coin, or to
                    serve out all quantities of goods, using only one kind of weight or measurement.
                    Various monies, weights, and measures are therefore in customary use, this or
                    that being employed in each particular case according to circumstances. When
                    these measures are of the same kind, differing only in the unit of one of them
                    being so many times the unit of another, they are said to be of different <hi
                    rend="italic">denominations;</hi> as, pounds, shillings, pence; or again, yards,
                    feet, inches.</p>
                <p>In addition and subtraction, the quantities added and subtracted must be either
                    abstract numbers or concrete quantities of the same kind. In multiplication, the
                    multiplicand may be concrete, but the multiplier is regarded in the process as
                    abstract. If 20 men, for example, receive <hi rend="italic">£5</hi> each, the
                    <hi rend="italic">£5</hi> is not multiplied by 20 <hi rend="italic">men,</hi>
                    but taken 20 <hi rend="italic">times,</hi> the number of times merely
                    corresponding to the number of men. In division, when the dividend is concrete,
                    the divisor may be abstract, giving a concrete quotient of the same kind as the
                    dividend, or concrete giving an abstract quotient. Thus, £100 may be divided
                    into 20 parts, giving £5 as quotient, or it may be divided into parts of £5
                    each, giving as quotient the abstract number 20, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    containing £5 20 times. A fraction is strictly abstract, though we often write
                    £| and the like for of £1.</p>

                <p>On these tables we make the following remarks :—-</p>
                <p>I. The guinea is 21 shillings, and the crown 5 shillings. Sales are often made in
                    guineas, though the coin is not now used. Farthings are always written as
                    fractions of a penny. 10∣&lt;Z. ⅛. means tenpence three farthings and
                    seven-eighths of a farthing.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Apothecaries' weight</hi> agrees with this, except that
                    the ounce (℥) is divided into 8 drams (5), and the dram into 3 scruples (3) of
                    20 grains.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n593/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0593-0534"/>
                <p>IV. In measuring cloth, the yard is divided into 4 quarters, the quarter into 4
                    nails of 2¼ inches.</p>
                <p>V. To measure land, the surveyor’s chain of 100 links is used. The chain is 22
                    yards long, and 10 square chains make an acre.</p>
                <p>VII. The gallon and lower denominations are liquid measures; the quart and those
                    above it are for dry goods.</p>
                <p>VIII. The year, strictly speaking, is 365∙24224 days. Every fourth year (leap
                    year) has 366 days.</p>
                <p>34. <hi rend="italic">Reduction</hi> is the method of expressing quantities in a
                    denomination lower or higher than that in which they are given.</p>
                <p>To reduce a higher denomination to a lower, multiply in succession by the numbers
                    which show the times that the unit of each denomination (beginning with that
                    given) contains the unit of the one next below it till the denomination is
                    reached to which the quantity is to be reduced. If quantities in intermediate
                    denominations are given, add each as its denomination is reached.</p>
                <p>To reduce a lower denomination to a higher, divide in succession by the numbers
                    which show the times that the unit of each denomination (beginning with that
                    given) is contained in the unit of the next above it, observing that the
                    remainder after such division is of the denomination of the dividend.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the two processes are combined; thus, in reducing guineas to crowns, we
                    multiply by 21, obtaining shillings, and then divide by 5.</p>
                <p>35. <hi rend="italic">Compound Addition</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Compound
                    Subtraction</hi> are the addition and subtraction of quantities expressed in
                    more than one denomination.</p>
                <p>In Compound Addition, arrange the quantities according to their denominations,
                    each under its proper heading; add the lowest, and reduce the sum by division to
                    the next higher, setting down the remainder, and carrying the quotient; add the
                    others, including carriage, in the same way. Suppose that several sums of money
                    are added, and the farthings amount to 29, that is to 7⅛d., the {d. is set down
                    and the 7d. carried to the pence column, and so in other cases.</p>
                <p>In Compound Subtraction, arrange the quantities as in Compound Addition, placing
                    the greater amount over the other, and subtract, beginning with the lowest
                    denomination. If in any case the lower number exceeds that above it, increase
                    the latter by as many as make one of the next higher denomination, and
                    afterwards add one to that denomination in the lower line. In subtracting, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 1 qr. 25 lb from 3 qr. 17 lb, since 25 cannot be taken
                    from 17, a quarter, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 28 fi&gt;, is added to the 17,
                    making 45; from this 25 is subtracted, leaving 20 δ), and the quarter “borrowed”
                    is taken away again by being added to the 1 qr. The remainder is thus 1 qr. 20
                    ft.</p>
                <p>Fractions of the lowest denomination are to be added or subtracted according to
                    §§ 18, 19; thus, £72, 8s. 3⅛d. - £45, 17s. 6||d. = £26, 10s. 8|d.</p>
                <p>36. <hi rend="italic">Compound Multiplication</hi> is multiplication in which the
                    multiplicand is expressed in more than one denomination.</p>
                <p>When the multiplier does not exceed 12, multiply the different denominations by
                    it, beginning with the lowest, and setting down and carrying as in Compound
                    Addition. When the multiplier consists of several figures, multiply by each
                    separately in the same way, taking them from right to left, and setting the
                    result of each successive multiplication always one place further towards the
                    left in 12 ∕f each denomination, and add the results as thus arranged. 254 10
                    7£= 4 times.</p>
                <p>In the accompanying example 572 13 9∣ = 90 times, the above arrangement puts
                    ^⅞T^S~8⅛ = 94 times, the product by 90 in the place of tens; and the sums to be
                    reduced to higher denominations are 30 farthings, 104 pence, 148 shillings. If
                    the multiplier be a composite number, we may multiply by the factors in
                    succession. When the multiplier consists of two or more figures, the
                    multiplication is often performed by the whole quantity at once.</p>
                <p>37. <hi rend="italic">Compound Division</hi> is division in which either the
                    dividend or both dividend and divisor are expressed in more than one
                    denomination.</p>
                <p>(1.) To find the amount that a given amount contains a given number of times,
                    divide the highest denomination by the given number, reduce the remainder to the
                    next lower denomination, adding the corresponding term of the dividend; divide
                    again, and proceed in the same way with the other denominations. The
                    denominations of the quotient correspond to those of the dividend.</p>
                <p>Let it be required, for instance, to divide £370,16s. l∣d, into 58 equal shares.
                    As 58 shares of £6 each amount to £348, £6 is part of the quotient, and there
                    remains £22, 16s. lfd. Reducing £22,16s. to shillings (456), we find that this
                    gives 58 shares of 7s. each, with 50s. over. Similarly we obtain lOd. and 1
                    farthing, with 29 farthings over, which, since ⅜⅜ = ⅜, is just half a farthing
                    for each of the 58 shares. The quotient then is £6, 7s. 10|d. ∣q.</p>
                <p>(2.) To find the number of times that one given amount contains another, reduce
                    both to the same single denomination, and then divide the one by the other.</p>
                <p>To find, for example, how often 12s. 9∣d. is contained in £171, 13s. 9d., since
                    12s. 9|d. = 615 farthings, and £171, 13s. 9d. = 164820 farthings, the number of
                    times the second amount contains the first must be 164820 ÷ 615, <hi
                    rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> 268. It is to be observed that the quotient here is an
                    abstract number.</p>
                <p>38. In multiplying or dividing by fractions or mixed numbers, we follow the
                    methods explained in §§ 20, 21. As an illustration, we give here the
                    multiplication of £24, 5s. 9∣d. «q. by 62- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅞-,
                    where we may note that in the division by 12 we have to divide 2∣ farthings,
                    giving ™q. × ⅛ = Aq., and that in adding the fraction we have V + A = ⅛ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> r+ <hi rend="superscript"> τ κ</hi> A=2⅓q.</p>

                    proper value of a fraction or a decimal of any denomination, multiply the
                    fraction or the decimal by the numbers in succession that reduce the
                    denomination to lower denominations.</p>
                <p>Thus, to find the value of ⅜⅜ of a pound, it is manifest that this is ⅜⅜ of 20
                    shillings, t.e., ∣⅜ × 20s. = 12 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛8., or 12s. 3|d.;
                    and so in other cases.</p>
                <p>To find the value of a fraction of a quantity consisting of different
                    denominations, we may either first reduce the quantity to one denomination, or
                    we may multiply the compound quantity by the numerator, and divide by the
                    denominator of the fraction; thus, ⅜ of £5, 7s. ll∣d. being the same as the
                    ninth part x&gt;f twice the amount, we may multiply by 2 and divide by 9,
                    obtaining £1, 3s. ll∣d. ⅜q. as the result.</p>
                <p>40. To reduce any amount to the fraction or the decimal of another denomination
                    or amount, reduce both amounts to the same denomination, and write them as the
                    terms of a fraction, the quantity of which the fraction is required being made
                    the denominator. If the decimal is required, convert the vulgar fraction into a
                    decimal.</p>
                <p>Thus, to reduce 13s. l⅜d, to the fraction and also to the decimal of a pound,
                    since a pound contains 480 halfpence, a halfpenny is <hi rend="subscript">

                    reduction, and divide the numerator of the complex fraction so obtained by the
                    denominator. Thus, to find the fraction of £4531. ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi>

                    dividing the former by the latter, the required fraction is found to be ⅛⅛.</p>
                <p>In reducing a compound quantity to a decimal of a higher denomination, it is
                    generally best to proceed by successive divisions, beginning with the lowest
                    denomination, and inserting the others as they occur, as in the accompanying
                    example, where 13 cwt. 8 lb 12 oz. is found to be ∙65390625 of a ton. It is to
                    be noted that the integers here are inserted from the data, and the decimals

                <p>41. <hi rend="italic">Practice</hi> is the name given to a method of calculating
                    pπces from certain rates being <hi rend="italic">aliquot parts</hi> (that is,
                    exact measures) of other rates.</p>
                <p>The basis of this species of calculation is generally <hi rend="italic">£1,</hi>
                    and the given price is broken up into portions, the first of which is an aliquot
                    part of a pound, and each of the others an aliquot part of some one before it.
                    By the method adopted we virtually multiply the different aliquot parts in
                    succession by the number of articles given. The sum of the result is the total
                    price.</p>
                <p>42. <hi rend="italic">Proportion.—</hi> When the first of four quantities is the
                    same multiple or the same fraction of the second that the third is of the
                    fourth, the first is said to have the same <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi> to the
                    second that the third has to the fourth, and the four quantities are said to be
                    <hi rend="italic">proportionals,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">in proportion.</hi>
                    Thus, since 30 is ⅜ of 36, and 50 is ⅛ of 60, the numbers 30, 36, 50, and 60
                    form a proportion.</p>
                <p>The proportion is written 30: 36 = 50 :60, or, more commonly, 30: 36 :: 50: 60.
                    This is read 30 is to 36 as 50 is to 60. It may also be written ⅜⅞ = ⅞⅞.</p>
                <p>The ratio of two numbers is thus equivalent to the fraction that the one is of
                    the other;. and a fraction may therefore be defined as the ratio of the
                    numerator to the denominator.</p>
                <p>Ratio is a mere abstract relation between two numbers, or between two concrete
                    quantities of the same kind. The ratio of 4s. to 6s., or of 48d, to 72d., is not
                    shillings or pence, but the abstract fraction ⅜.</p>
                <p>If two quantities of one kind be proportional to two of another kind, when any
                    three are given, the fourth can be found. If, for instance, we know the value of
                    any quantity of goods, we can determine the value of any other given quantity,
                    or the quantity that has any assigned value, —it being always understood that
                    the rate is the same in both cases; that is, that were the quantity doubled,
                    trebled, halved, &amp;c., so also would the value be, or, in other words, that
                    the quantity is proportional to the value. Questions of this sort occur with
                    very great frequency in practical arithmetic. The three quantities given are
                    usually arranged as the first three terms of a proportion, whence the fourth
                    term is found.</p>
                <p>The rule by which we proceed in such cases of <hi rend="italic">Simple
                    Proportion,</hi> as it is called, has often the name given to it of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rule of Three.</hi> It is as follows:—Of the three quantities
                    given, set that down for the third term which is of the same kind as what is
                    required. Consider whether the amount to be found will be greater or less than
                    this third term; if greater, make the greater of the two remaining quantities
                    the second term, and the other the first term; but if less, put the less term
                    second, and the greater first. Having thus arranged or “stated” the three terms
                    of the proportion, multiply the second and third together, and divide the
                    product by the first.</p>
                <p>The first and second terms must be reduced to the same denomination, and it will
                    often be convenient to reduce the third term to the lowest denomination
                    contained in it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 1. If 54 yards of cloth cost 63s., what will 30 yards
                    cost at the same rate?</p>
                <p>Stating by the rule, we have 54 yards: 30 yards :: 63s., whence the fourth term
                    is <hi rend="subscript"> =</hi> 35 <hi rend="subscript"> s-</hi></p>
                <p>54</p>
                <p>This process is to be explained by the consideration that, since the rate of
                    price is the same for both quantities, the one price must be the same fraction
                    of the other that the one quantity is of the other: that is, = ≈- ,-~-—-—3 , <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> 30 yds. the price required ’</p>
                <p>30 the number of shillings required or - = ——≡ <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> — .
                    Multiplying each of these equal fractions by 63, we have fθ- × 63 = 35, the
                    number of shillings required, as above.</p>
                <p>The first and second terms are to be stated according to the rule, because their
                    ratio is equal to that of the third and fourth, and must therefore be a proper
                    or an improper fraction, according as the other is so. After the proportion is
                    stated, and the terms reduced, any common factor may be removed from the firβt
                    and second terms, or from the first and third; for, as will appear from the
                    working above, this is virtually reducing a fractional expression to lower
                    terms.</p>

                    6d. in the pound. What do his creditors lose?</p>
                <p>Since 14s. 6d. is paid, there is 5s. 6d. loss for every pound of debt, and the
                    question is—If £1 give 5s. 6d. loss, what will £1275 give? The “stating,”
                    therefore, is— £1: £1275 ::5s. 6d., and the result, £350, 12s. 6cL Particular
                    care must be taken, when all the terms are money, as here, that the first and
                    second be of the same kind. In this instance these terms are <hi rend="italic"
                    >debt;</hi> and the third term, <hi rend="italic">loss,</hi> corresponds to the

                    frequently depends on a combination of other ratios. If, for instance, we have
                    to compare the times required for building two walls, one twice the length,
                    twice the height, and twice the thickness of the other, the men employed on the

                    each of these separate conditions implies double the number of days. Each
                    condition gives the ratio 1 :2, and the result must correspond to the <hi

                    £186, 2s. 6d., would lose £2 by exchanging 2 oxen for 11 sheep. What is the
                    price of an ox Î</p>
                <p>The price of 2 oxen being the price of 11 sheep and £2 more, the price of 9 oxen
                    will be (from the ratio 2:9) 49 ⅜ times the price of a sheep and £9 more. Hence
                    from the data, 54∣ times the price of a sheep and £9 more will amount to £186,
                    2s. 6d.; i.e., 54∣ times the price of a sheep is £177, 2s. 6d., and therefore a
                    sheep cost £3, 5s. Also, since the price of 2 oxen is that of 11 sheep and £2
                    more, 2 oxen cost £35, 15s. +£2, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> £37, 15s.;
                    therefore 1 ox cost £18, 17s. 6d.</p>

                    into parts in proportion to given numbers, state and work out the
                    proportions,—As the sum of the given numbers is to each of them in succession,
                    so is the number to be divided to the several parts required.</p>
                <p>If, for example, a bankrupt owes A £580, B £935, C £675, and D £770, and his
                    assets amount to £999, the stating 2960:580: £999 gives £195, 15s. as A’s share,
                    and the others are found similarly.</p>
                <p>Here, too, there may be a compound proportion, as when different sums are
                    invested for different times. The division in those cases must be in proportion
                    to the amounts invested, and also to the time; each amount is therefore to be
                    multiplied by its time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Applications of Proportion.—</hi> 46. In commercial and
                    financial transactions frequent use is made of proportion; and very often, when
                    it is not directly employed, computations are performed according to formulae or
                    rules which rest on this as a basis. Advantage is very generally taken of the
                    convenience of 100 as a standard of reference or comparison, proportional
                    relations being stated as at such and such rates per cent. This occurs
                    continually in the calculation of interest, discount, stock-exchange operations,
                    &amp;c., as well as in the expression of mercantile losses and gains.</p>
                <p>47. <hi rend="italic">Interest</hi> is the allowance given by the borrower to the
                    lender for the use of money lent. It is usually computed at a rate agreed upon
                    of so many pounds for every hundred lent for a year; this is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">rate per cent.</hi> The interest of £564, for instance, for</p>
                <p>3 years 4 months at 3¾ per cent, per annum, is to be found by a compound
                    proportion, the meaning being—If the interest of £100 for 1 year be £3|, what
                    will the interest of £564 be for 3⅛ years? The result (£70, 10s.) may be
                    obtained by the general rule based on this and similar proportions—Multiply the
                    amount lent (called the <hi rend="italic">principal)</hi> by the rate per cent,
                    and by the number of years, and divide the product by 100. When the time is
                    given in days, the fraction of a year is taken that the days amount to.</p>

                <p>Money is laid out at <hi rend="italic">Compound Interest,</hi> when at the end of
                    a year or other assigned period the interest that has accrued is not paid to the
                    lender, but is put to interest along with the amount originally lent. Here the
                    simple interest has to be computed for each successive year or period, and added
                    to the principal or former amount.</p>
                <p>48. <hi rend="italic">Commission</hi> is the allowance paid to an agent for
                    transacting commercial business, and usually bears a fixed proportion or
                    percentage, as may be agreed on, to the amount of value involved in the
                    transactions. <hi rend="italic">Brokerage</hi> is the allowance paid to a broker
                    for buying or selling shares in the public funds, or bargaining otherwise with
                    reference to money investments. <hi rend="italic">Insurance Premiums</hi> are
                    payments in return for which the owner of the property insured is entitled to
                    receive the assured value of it in the event of its being destroyed. In all
                    these the rates are commonly stated at so much per cent., and the computation is
                    similar to that for interest, but simpler, as the element of time does not enter
                    into it.</p>
                <p>49. <hi rend="italic">Discount</hi> is a deduction allowed for a payment being
                    made at a date prior to the time when the full amount is exigible. The <hi
                    rend="italic">true discount</hi> on a money payment due on the expiration of a
                    certain time is the excess of the amount over its <hi rend="italic">present
                    value—</hi> the present value being the sum which, laid out at interest, would
                    in the given time amount to the given sum. Suppose, for instance, it is required
                    to find the true discount on £664 due 10 months hence at <hi rend="italic"
                    >4⅛</hi> per cent. Here the interest of £100, being £4| in 12 months, will in 10
                    months be £3f, ».&lt;?., £100 would amount to £103f in 10 months, and the
                    discount of £103| due 10 months hence is therefore £3^. Hence the stating £103f:
                    £664 ::£3f, which gives as the discount £24. The present value is seen from this
                    to be £640. A banker or merchant, in discounting a bill, charges interest
                    instead of discount, and would in this instance gain the interest of £24, since
                    the £24, the true <hi rend="italic">discount</hi> of £664, is evidently the <hi
                    rend="italic">interest</hi> of £640.</p>
                <p>50. In calculations relating to mercantile <hi rend="italic">Profit and
                    Loss,</hi> which are also effected by proportion, it must be carefully
                    remembered that the percentage of gain or loss is always reckoned on the <hi
                    rend="italic">buying price,</hi> unless the contrary is expressly stated. Thus,
                    let it be required to find the cost of goods that are sold for £448, 17s. 6d. at
                    a loss of 6^ per cent. Since goods that cost £100 are sold for £93|, we have the
                    stating £93|: £448J ::£100, which gives £478, 16s. as the cost price. (a. <hi
