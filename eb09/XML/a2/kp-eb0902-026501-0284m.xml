                <p><label type="entry">ARABIAN PHILOSOPHY</label> owed to Arabia little more than
                    its name and its language. It was a system of Greek thought, expressed in a
                    Semitic tongue, and modified by Oriental influences, called into existence
                    amongst the Moslem people by the patronage of their more liberal princes, and
                    kept alive by the intrepidity and zeal of a small band of thinkers, who stood
                    suspected and disliked in the eyes of their nation. The Arabian philosophers
                    have but a secondary interest in the history of their own lands. Their chief
                    claim to the notice of the historian of speculation comes from their warm
                    reception of Greek philosophy when it had been banished from its original soil,
                    and whilst Western Europe was still too rude and ignorant to be its home. In the
                    annals of philosophy the period from the beginning of the 9th to the close of
                    the 12th century may be styled the “Flight into Egypt.” During these four
                    centuries free thought found a refuge under Mahometan princes until her
                    oppressors were dead. In the course of that exile the traces of Semitic or
                    Mahometan influence gradually faded away; and the last of the line of Saracenic
                    thinkers was a truer exponent of the one philosophy which they all professed to
                    teach than the first. The whole movement was little else than a chapter in the
                    history of Aristotelianism. That system of thought, after passing through the
                    minds of those who saw it in the hazy light of an Orientalised Platonism, and
                    finding many laborious but narrow-purposed cultivators in the monastic schools
                    of heretical Syria, was then brought into contact with the ideas and mental
                    habits of Islam. But those in whom the two currents converged did not belong to
                    the pure Arab race. Of the so-called Arabian philosophers of the East,
                    Al-Farabi, Ibn-Sina, and Al-Ghazâli were natives of Khorassan, Bokhara, and the
                    outlying provinces of north-eastern Persia; whilst Al-Kendi, the earliest of
                    them, sprang from Basra, on the Persian Gulf, on the debatable ground between
                    the Semite and the Aryan. In Spain, again, where Ibn-Badja, Ibn-Tofail, and
                    Ibn-Roshd rivalled or exceeded the fame of the Eastern schools, the Arabians of
                    pure blood were few, and the Moorish ruling class was deeply intersected by
                    Jewish colonies, and even by the natives of Christian Spain. Thus, alike at
                    Baghdad and at Cordova, Arabian philosophy represents the for a time victorious
                    reaction of exotic ideas and of subject races against the theological
                    one-sidedness of Islam, and the illiterate simplicity of the early Saracens.</p>
                <p>Islam had, it is true, a philosophy of its own. There were Schoolmen amongst the
                    believers in the Koran, not less than amongst the Latin Christians. At the very
                    moment when Mahometanism came into contact with the older civilisations of
                    Persia, Babylonia, and Syria, the intellectual habits of the new converts
                    created difficulties with regard to its very basis, and showed themselves a
                    prolific source of diversity in the details of interpretation. The radical
                    questions on which these disputes turned were two. The first dealt with the
                    possibility of ascribing manifold attributes to God—to a Being who was absolute
                    unity. The other referred to the bearing of God’s omnipotence upon the freedom
                    of the human will. Ere the second century of the Hegira, sturdy adherents of the
                    literal truth of the Koran taught a gross anthropomorphism, applying to the
                    Creator the very bodily attributes of his creatures. These were the Sefatites,
                    or partisans of the attributes. Another sect represented Mahomet as the teacher
                    of an unqualified fatalism. Opposed to these narrow-minded exponents stood the
                    comparatively liberal sect of the Motazalites, the Dissidents, who first
                    appeared about 750. As they maintained, on one hand, that man was in some degree
                    a free agent, and on another, elevated the unity of the divine nature far above
                    the diversity of attributes, they came to be styled the partisans of justice and
                    unity. It was with them that the Mussulman theology—the science of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">(Calâin)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> first came into existence.
                    Its professors, the <hi rend="italic">Motecallemin</hi> (known in Hebrew as <hi
                    rend="italic">Medabberim,</hi> and as <hi rend="italic">Loqy,entes</hi> in the
                    Latin versions) may be compared with the scholastic doctors of the Catholic
                    Church. Driven in the first instance to speculation in theology by the needs of
                    their natural reason, they came, in after days, when Greek philosophy had been
                    naturalised in the Caliphate, to adapt its methods and doctrines to the support
                    of their views. They employed a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n285/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0285-0266"/> quasi-philosophical method, by which, according
                    to Mauno-nides they first reflected how things ought to be in order to support,
                    or at least not contradict, their opinions, and then, when their minds were made
                    up with regard to this imaginary system, declared that the world was no
                    otherwise constituted. The dogmas of creation and providence, of divine
                    omnipotence, chiefly exercised them; and they sought to assert for God an
                    immediate action in the making and°the keeping of the world. Space they looked
                    upon as pervaded by atoms possessing no quality or extension, and time was
                    similarly divided into innumerable instants. Each change in the constitution of
                    the atoms is a direct act of the Almighty. When the fire burns, or the water
                    moistens, these terms merely express the habitual connection which our senses
                    perceive between one thing and another. It is not the man that throws a stone
                    who is its real mover: the supreme agent has for the moment created motion. If a
                    living being die, it is because God has created the attribute of death; and the
                    body remains dead, only because that attribute is unceasingly created. Thus, on
                    the one hand, the object called the cause is denied to have any efficient power
                    to produce the so-called effect; and, on the other hand, the regularities or
                    laws of nature are explained to be direct interferences by the Deity. God is the
                    sole cause or agent in the universe: it is He who, directly, or by the mediation
                    of His ministering angels, brings everything to pass. The supposed uniformity
                    and necessity of causation is only an effect of custom, and may be at any moment
                    rescinded. In this way, by a theory which, according to Averroes, involves the
                    negation of science, the Moslem theologians believed that they had exalted God
                    beyond the limits of the metaphysical and scientific conceptions of law, form,
                    and matter; whilst they at the same time stood aloof from the vulgar doctrines,
                    attributing a causality to things. Making the uniformity of nature a mere
                    phantom due to our human customary experience, they deemed they had left a clear
                    ground for the possibility of miracles.</p>
                <p>But at least one point was common to the theological and the philosophical
                    doctrine. Carrying out, it may be, the principles of the Neo-Platonists, they
                    kept the sanctuary of the Deity securely guarded, and interposed between him and
                    his creatures a spiritual order of potent principles, from the Intelligence,
                    which is the first-born image of the great unity, to the Soul and Nature, which
                    come later in the spiritual rank. Of God the philosophers said we could not tell
                    what He is, but only what He is not. The highest point, beyond which strictly
                    philosophical inquirers did not penetrate, was the active intellect,—a sort of
                    soul of the world in Aristotelian garb—the principle which inspires and
                    regulates the development of humanity, and in which lies the goal of perfection
                    for the human spirit. In theological language the active intellect is described
                    as an angel. The inspirations which the prophet receives by angelic messengers
                    are compared with the irradiation of intellectual light, which the philosopher
                    wins by contemplation of truth and increasing purity of life. But while the
                    theologian incessantly postulated the agency of that God, whose nature he deemed
                    beyond the pale of science, the philosopher, following a purely human and
                    natural aim, directed his efforts to the gradual elevation of his part of reason
                    from its unformed state, and to its final union with the controlling intellect
                    which moves and draws to itself the spirits of those who prepare themselves for
                    its influences. The philosophers in their way, like the mystics of Persia (the
                    Su fites) in another, tended towards a theory of the communion of man with the
                    spiritual world, which may be considered a protest against the practical and
                    almost prosaic definiteness of the creed of Mahomet.</p>
                <p>Arabian philosophy, at the outset of its career in the 9th century, was able
                    without difficulty to take possession of those resources for speculative
                    thought, which the Latins had barely achieved at the close of the 12th century
                    by the slow process of rediscovering the Aristotelian logic from the
                    commentaries and versions of Boethius. What the Latins painfully accomplished,
                    amid many senseless disputations and blind gropings after light, owing to their
                    fragmentary and unintelligent acquaintance with ancient philosophy, was already
                    done for the Arabians by the scholars of Syria. In the early centuries of the
                    Christian era, both within and without the ranks of the church, the Platonic
                    tone and method were paramount throughout the East. Their influence was felt in
                    the creeds which formulated the orthodox dogmas in regard to the Trinity and the
                    Incarnation. But in its later days the Neo-Platonist school came more and more
                    to find in Aristotle the best exponent and interpreter of the philosopher whom
                    they thought divine. It was in this spirit that Porphyry, Themistius, and
                    Joannes Philoponus composed their commentaries on the treatises of the
                    Peripatetic system which, modified often unconsciously by the dominant ideas of
                    its expositors, became in the 6th and 7th centuries the philosophy of the
                    Eastern Church. But the instrument which, in the hands of John of Damascus, was
                    made subservient to theological interests, became in,the hands of others a
                    dissolvent of the doctrines which had been reduced to shape under the prevalence
                    of the elder Platonism. Peripatetic studies became the source of heresies; and
                    conversely, the heretical sects prosecuted the study of Aristotle with peculiar
                    zeal. The church of the Nestorians, and that of the Monophysites, in their
                    several schools and monasteries, carried on from the 5th to the 8th century the
                    study of the earlier part of the Organon, with almost the same means, purposes,
                    and results as were found among the Latin schoolmen of the earlier centuries. Up
                    to the time when the religious zeal of the Emperor Zeno put a stop to the
                    Nestorian school at Edessa, this “Athens of Syria” was active in translating and
                    popularising the Aristotelian logic. Their banishment from Edessa in 489 drove
                    the Nestorian scholars to Persia, where the Sassanidae gave them a welcome; and
                    there they continued their labours on the <hi rend="italic">Organon.</hi> A new
                    seminary of logic and theology sprung up at Nisibis, not far from the old
                    locality; and at Gandisapora (orNisabur) in the east of Persia, there arose a
                    medical school, whence Greek medicine, and in its company Greek science and
                    philosophy, ere long spread over the lands of Iran. Meanwhile the Monophysites
                    had followed in the steps of the Nestorians, multiplying Syriac versions of the
                    logical and medical science of the Greeks. Their school at B,esaina is known
                    from the name of Sergius, one of the first of these translators, in the days of
                    Justinian; and from their monasteries at Kinnesrin (Chalcis) issued numerous
                    versions of the introductory treatises of the Aristotelian logic. To the <hi
                    rend="italic">Isagoge</hi> of Porphyry, the <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Herme-neutica</hi> of Aristotle, the labours of· these
                    Syrian schoolmen were confined: these they expounded, translated, epitomised,
                    and made the basis of their compilations; and the few who were bold enough to
                    attempt the <hi rend="italic">Analytics,</hi> seem to have laid down the pen
                    with their task unaccomplished.</p>
                <p>The energy of the Monophysites, however, began to sink with the rise of the
                    Moslem empire; and when philosophy revived amongst them in the 13th century, in
                    the person of Gregorius Barhebraeus (1226-1286), the revival was due to the
                    example and influence of the Arabian thinkers. It was otherwise with the
                    Nestorians. Gaining by means of their professional skill as physicians a high
                    rank in the society of the Moslem world, the Nestorian scholars soon made
                    Baghdad familiar with the knowledge of Greek philosophy and science which they
                    possessed. But the narrow <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n286/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0286-0267"/> limits of the Syrian studies, which added to a
                    scanty knowledge of Aristotle some acquaintance with his Syrian commentators,
                    were soon passed by the curiosity and zeal of the students in the Caliphate.
                    During the 8th and 9th centuries, rough but generally faithful versions of
                    Aristotle’s principal works were made into Syriac, and then from the Syriac into
                    Arabic. The names of some of these translators, such as Johannitius (Honein
                    ibn-Ishak), were heard even in the Latin schools. By the labours of Honein and
                    his family the great body of Greek science, medical, astronomical, and
                    mathematical, became accessible to the Arabspeaking races. But for the next
                    three centuries fresh versions, both of the philosopher and of his commentators,
                    continued to succeed each other.</p>
                <p>To the Arabians Aristotle represented and summed up Greek philosophy, even as
                    Galen became to them the code of Greek medicine. They adopted the doctrine and
                    system which the progress of human affairs had made the intellectual aliment of
                    their Syrian guides. It was a matter of historical necessity, and not an act of
                    deliberate choice. Just as the early poets of Rome, when they tried to
                    naturalise the drama, reproduced the works of Euripides, the popular tragedian
                    of their time, so the Arabians, when the need of scientific culture awoke
                    amongst thém, accepted Aristotle. From first to last Arabian philosophers made
                    no claim to originality; their aim was merely to propagate the truth of
                    Peripateticism as it had been delivered to them. In medicine and astronomy, as
                    well as in philosophy, they entertained an almost superstitious reverence for
                    their Greek teachers. It was with them that the deification of Aristotle began;
                    and from them the belief that in him human intelligence had reached its limit
                    passed to the later schoolmen. The doctrine is fixed: truth has been
                    ascertained: all that is needed is a faithful and skilful interpreter. Hence,
                    their perpetual labour of exposition and illustration: their epitomes and
                    paraphrases of Aristotelian doctrine. The progress amongst the Arabians on this
                    side lies in a closer adherence to their text, a nearer approach to the bare
                    exegesis of their author, and an increasing emancipation from control by the
                    tenets of the popular religion.</p>
                <p>Secular philosophy found its first entrance amongst the Saracens in the days of
                    the early caliphs of the Abbaside dynasty, whose ways and thoughts had been
                    moulded by their residence in Persia amid the influences of an older creed, and
                    of ideas which had in the last resort sprung from the Greeks. The seat of empire
                    had been transferred to Baghdad, on the highway of Oriental commerce; and the
                    distant Khorassan became the favourite province of the caliph. Then was
                    inaugurated the period of Persian supremacy, during which Islam was laid open to
                    the full current of alien ideas and culture. The incitement came, however, not
                    from the people, but from the prince: it was in the light of court favour that
                    the colleges of Baghdad and Nisabur first came to attract students from every
                    quarter, from the valleys of Andalusia, as well as the upland plains of
                    Transoxiana. Al-Ma’nsûr, the second of the Abbasides, encouraged the
                    appropriation of Greek science; but it was Al-Mamûn, the son of Harûn al-Rashid,
                    who deserves in the Mahometan empire the same position of royal founder and
                    benefactor which is held by Charlemagne in the history of the Latin schools. In
                    his reign (813-833) Aristotle was first translated into Arabic. Legend told how
                    Al-Mamûn had been induced to send to the Byzantine emperor for Greek books on
                    philosophy, in consequence of a vision in which a venerable personage, who made
                    himself known as Aristotle, had excited without gratifying the curiosity of the
                    caliph. Orthodox Mussulmans, however, distrusted the course on which their chief
                    had entered, and his philosophical proclivities became one ground for doubting
                    as to bis final salvation.</p>
                <p>In the Eastern provinces the chief names of Arabian philosophy are those known to
                    the Latin schoolmen as Alkindius, Alpharabius, Avicenna, and Algazel, or under
                    forms resembling these, or under other names derived from various parts of their
                    complex Arabic designations. The first of these, Alkindius (Abu Jusuf Jacub
                    ibn-Ishak <hi rend="italic">al-Kencli),</hi> wrote in the reigns of Al-Mamûn and
                    Al-Motassem (813-842). His claims to notice at the present day rest upon a few
                    works on medicine and the astrological astronomy of his age,—the only remnant
                    left of the 200 treatises which he is said to have composed on all the themes of
                    science and philosophy. With him begins that encyclopaedic character—the
                    simultaneous cultivation of the whole field of investigation which is reflected
                    from Aristotle on the Arabian school. Towards the close of the 10th century the
                    presentation of an entire scheme of knowledge, beginning with logic and
                    mathematics, and ascending through the various departments of physical inquiry
                    to the region of religious doctrine, was accomplished by a society which had its
                    chief seat at Basra, the native town of Al-Kendi. This society—the Brothers of
                    Purity or Sincerity—divided into four orders, wrought in the interests of
                    religion no less than of science; and though its attempt to compile an
                    encyclopaedia of existing knowledge may have been premature, it yet contributed
                    to spread abroad a desire for further information. The proposed reconciliation
                    between science and faith was not accomplished, because the compromise coιdd
                    please neither party. The fifty-one treatises of w hich this encyclopaedia
                    consists are interspersed with apologues in true Oriental style, and the idea of
                    goodness, of moral perfection, is as prominent an end in every discourse as it
                    was in the alleged dream of Al-Mamûn. Tho materials of the work come chiefly
                    from Aristotle, but they are conceived in a Platonising spirit, which places as
                    the bond of all things a universal soul of the world with its partial
                    orifragmentary souls. Contemporary with this semireligious and
                    semi-philosophical society lived Alfarabius (Abou-Nasr Mohammed ben-Mohammed
                    ben-Tarkhan <hi rend="italic">al-Farabi}</hi> or Abunasar. From Turkestan, the
                    place of his birth, he passed southward to Baghdad where he studied, and died at
                    Damascus in 950, after living for some time at Aleppo on the invitation of its
                    prince. The legendary accounts of Al-Farabi describe him as a man of vast
                    erudition, the master of seventy languages, and accomplished both in the theory
                    and the practice of the musical art. Of his numerous waitings on all the
                    branches of science only a few remain in Arabic or Hebrew versions, but his
                    paraphrases of Aristotle formed the basis on which Avicenna constructed his
                    system, and his logical treatises produced a permanent effect on the logic of
                    the Latin scholars. He gave the tone and direction to nearly all subsequent
                    speculations among the Arabians. His order and enumeration of the principles of
                    being, his doctrine of the double aspect of intellect, and of the perfect
                    beatitude which consists in the aggregation of noble minds when they are
                    delivered from the separating barriers of individual bodies, present at least in
                    germ the characteristic theory of Averroes. But Al-Farabi w as not alw ays
                    consistent in his views; a certain sobriety checked his speculative flights; and
                    although holding that the true perfection of man is reached in this life by the
                    elevation of the intellectual nature, he came towards the close to think the
                    separate existence of intellect no better than a phantasm and delusion.</p>
                <p>Unquestionably the most illustrious name amongst the Oriental Moslems was
                    Avicenna (980-1037). His fame in Europe rested more upon his medical canon than
                    on his philosophical works; but even in logic and metaphysics his influence on
                    the West was considerable. With him the encyclopaedic tendencies of the school
                    of Baghdad reached their culmination. He was followed by Algazel (Abou-Hamed<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n287/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0287-0268"/> Mohammed ibn-Mohammed al-Ghazalι), whose name was
                    the last that attained a European reputation. Born near Tûs in 1058, he studied
                    there and at Nisabur; and having left his native province of Khorassan at the
                    age of 36, he was appointed to a high educational post at Baghdad. There, as
                    well as at Damascus, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, his lectures attracted crowds of
                    eager listeners. Suddenly he withdrew from active life, assumed the habits of
                    the Sufite mystic, and devoted himself to contemplation of religious truth; and
                    although he was persuaded to resume for a while his duties in the college of
                    Baghdad, he soon returned to seclusion, and passed his last days in a monastery
                    which he had himself founded at Tûs (1111). To Algazel it seemed that the study
                    of secular philosophy had resulted in a general indifference to religion, and
                    that the scepticism which concealed itself under a pretence of piety was
                    destroying the life and purity of the nation. With these views he carried into
                    the fields of philosophy the aims and spirit of the Moslem theologian. In his
                    <hi rend="italic">Tendencies of the Philosophers</hi><hi rend="italic">(Makâcid
                    al-Falâsifa)</hi> he gave a resumé of the contemporary state of the speculative
                    sciences as a preliminary work to his <hi rend="italic">Destruction of the
                    Philosophers</hi><hi rend="italic">(Tehâfot al-Falâsifa),</hi> in which the
                    contradictions and errors of these sciences were pointed out, as well as their
                    divergence from the orthodox faith. This indictment against liberal thought from
                    the stand-point of the theological school was afterwards answered in Spain by
                    Averroes; but in Baghdad it heralded the extinction of the light of philosophy.
                    Moderate and compliant with the popular religion as Alfarabius and Avicenna had
                    always been, as compared with their Spanish successor, they had equally failed
                    to conciliate the popular spirit, and were classed in the same category with the
                    heretic or the member of au immoral sect. The 12 th century exhibits the decay
                    of liberal intellectual activity in the Caliphate, and the gradual ascendency of
                    Turkish races animated with all the intolerance of semi-barbarian proselytes to
                    the Mahometan faith. Philosophy, which had only sprung up when the purely
                    Arabian influences ceased to predominate, camβ to an end when the sceptre of the
                    Moslem world passed away from the dynasty of Persia. Even in 1150 Baghdad had
                    seen a library of philosophical books burned by command of the Caliph
                    Mostandjed; and in 1192 the same place might have witnessed a strange scene, in
                    which the books of a physician were first publicly cursed, and then committed to
                    the flames, while their owner was incarcerated. Thus, while the Latin church
                    showed a marvellous receptivity for ethnic philosophy, and assimilated doctrines
                    which it had at an earlier date declared impious, in Islam the theological
                    system entrenched itself towards the end of the 12th century in the narrow
                    orthodoxy of the Assarites, and reduced the votaries of Greek philosophy to
                    silence.</p>
                <p>The same phenomena were repeated in Spain under the Mahometan rulers of Andalusia
                    and Marocco, with this difference, that the time of philosophical development
                    was shorter, and the heights to which Spanish thinkers soared were greater. The
                    reign of Al-Hakem the Second (961— 976) inaugurated in Andalusia those
                    scientific and philosophical studies which were simultaneously prosecuted by the
                    Society of Basra. From Cairo, Baghdad, Damascus, and Alexandria, books both old
                    and new were procured at any price for the library of the prince; 27 free
                    schools were opened in Cordova for the education of the poor; and intelligent
                    knowledge w as perhaps more widely diffused in Mahometan Spain than in any other
                    part of Europe at that day. The mosques of the city w?re filled with crowds who
                    listened to lectures on science and literature, law and religion. But the future
                    glory thus promised was long postponed. The usurping successor of Hakem found it
                    a politic step to request the most notable doctors of the sacred law to examine
                    the royal library; and every book treating of philosophy, astronomy, and other
                    forbidden topics, waa condemned to the flames. But the spirit of research,
                    fostered by the fusion of races and the social and intellectual competition thus
                    engendered, was not crushed by these proceedings; and for the next century and
                    more the higher minds of Spain found in Damascus and Baghdad the intellectual
                    aliment which they desired. At last, towards the close of the 11th century, the
                    long-pent spiritual energies of i Mahometan Spain burst forth in a brief series
                    of illustrious men. Whilst the native Spaniards were narrowing the limits of the
                    Moorish kingdoms, and w hilst tho generally fanatical dynasty of the Almohades
                    might have been expected to repress speculation, the century preceding the close
                    of Mahometan sway saw philosophy cultivated by Avempace, Abubacer, and Averroes.
                    Even amongst the Almohades there were princes, such as Jusuf (who began his
                    reign in 1163) and Jacûb Almansor (who succeeded in 1184), who welcomed the
                    philosopher at their courts, and treated him as an intellectual compeer. But
                    about 1195 the old distrust of philosophy revived; the philosophers were
                    banished in disgrace; works on philosophical topics were ordered to be
                    confiscated and burned; and the son of Almansor condemned a certain Ben-Habib to
                    death for the crime of philosophising.</p>
                <p>Arabian speculation in Spain was heralded by Avicebron, a name under which the
                    schoolmen conceived an Arab thinker, whereas modem scholars have shown that he
                    was identical wdth Salomon ben-Gebirol, a Jewish sacred poet of no mean order,
                    and still popular in the synagogue. Born at Malaga, and educated at Saragossa,
                    he seems to have written most of his works between 1045 and 1070. His
                    philosophical essay, known as the <hi rend="italic">Fountain of Life</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Fons</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitoe),</hi> although, in a Latin
                    version made about 1150, it acted like a ferment amongst the seething mass of
                    heterodox Christian theology, found no immediate acceptance among his own
                    philosophical compatriots, or amongst the Arabian thinkers who succeeded him.
                    His speculations were drawn from sources other than those which supplied the
                    dominant school of the 12th century in Spain, and found a congenial home amongst
                    those who had drunk deeply from the ideas of Scotus Erigena. The doctrine of
                    Avicebron attributed matter to everything, even to the soul, and to simple
                    substances, and held that ultimately there w as one universal matter. Thus,
                    while intelligible and sensible substances differ in their forms, they are at
                    one in matter. The doctrine became important in the disputes as to the principle
                    of individuation; where Duns Scotus, in opposition to Aquinas, reverted to the
                    position of A vicebron, whom he also resembled in his doctrine of the
                    superiority of the will to the intellect.</p>
                <p>Such questions in the present age would seem to fall strictly within the sphere
                    of logic. But it was the characteristic of the thinkers of the mediaeval period,
                    both Arabian and Christian, to magnify the power of abstract ideas, and to give
                    a deep reality to logical and metaphysical ideas. The earlier schoolmen
                    exaggerated the value of genera and species, till everything else grew faint in
                    comparison; and the Arabian thinkers similarly took in awful earnest the
                    distinction of material and formal. Abstractions were first realised with
                    uncommon distinctness and became almost palpable; and then they were introduced
                    into the world of popular conception. An irresistible attraction drew thinkers
                    of different classes to apply their metaphysical subtleties to the religious
                    ideas of a celestial order of beings, and the results of this application not
                    unnaturally gave rise to heresies.</p>
                <p>The ideas of Avicebron are the one-sided consequences of principles which had an
                    influence, but a secondary one, on the whole Arabian school. They descend in the
                    last <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n288/mode/1up"

                    Alexandrian ideas are presented in the book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Causis,</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Apocryphal Theology</hi>
                    of Aristotle. Both of these works (which passed under a variety of other names)
                    belong to a class of writings of Neo-Platonic tone and contents, which were
                    accredited by their ascription to Pythagoras, Empedocles, Plato, and Aristotle,
                    and circulated amongst the Arabians before the canon of Peripatetic scriptures
                    had been definitively fixed by the school of Baghdad. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theology</hi> known as Aristotle’s did not appear in Latin before 1519, when it
                    was translated from an Arabic manuscript of the 9th century; whereas the <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Causis,</hi> although unknown to the
                    Moslem world, was familiar to the Latins of the 13th century. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Theology</hi> was an exposition of the theory of Plotinus; the <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Causis</hi> was extracted from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Theological Elements</hi> of Proclus; and both works presented the
                    usual Alexandrian system of emanation and hypostases,—the graduated series of
                    externalisations and manifestations of the first cause or absolute unity,
                    firstly, in Intelligence; secondly, in the Soul of the universe; thirdly, in
                    Nature and the region of mutability. These sucessive spheres of being, where the
                    central unity expands into the circumference without losing its simplicity, and
                    the circumference is instinctively led towards its controlling centre, lay at
                    the basis of the conception of the universe held more or less by all the Moslem
                    philosophers. The first of creatures, says Avicenna, is the Intelligence, in
                    which are contained soul and life. The first cause is above all intelligence.
                    The principles exert a causal influence according to their degree of
                    elevation.</p>
                <p>About a generation after Avicebron the rank of Moslem thinkers proper was
                    introduced by Abou-Bekr Mohammed ben-Jahya, surnamed Ibn-Badja, and known to the
                    Latin world as Avempace. He was born at Saragossa, and died comparatively young
                    at Fez in 1138. Besides commenting on various physical treatises of Aristotle’s,
                    he wrote some philosophical essays, notably one on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Republic or</hi><hi rend="italic">Régime</hi><hi rend="italic">of the
                    Solitary.</hi> In its general character, and in several peculiarities, it
                    resembles the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> of Plato. The Solitary of whom
                    Ibn-Badja speaks is the stranger who seeks for a better commonwealth than the
                    common vulgarity of the world,—who, like some rare plant that springs up unsown
                    in a bed of ordinary flowers, would fain regain his native air. Ibn-Badja
                    proposed to trace the steps by which such an one taken alone, rising above his
                    animal nature, might by abstraction and reflection elicit the universal forms of
                    material things from the data of sense, and thus finally apprehend the pure
                    intelligences or speculative forms. As against Algazel, he maintained the right
                    of the intellect to rise by scientific contemplation to the philosophical
                    heaven,—to a union with the ever-active intellect which moves the spheres. The
                    consciousness of this union is the commonwealth of the solitary,--the enduring
                    commonwealth of intellect in which the philosopher abides.</p>
                <p>The same theme was developed by Ibn-Tofail in his philosophical romance, called
                    <hi rend="italic">Hayy ibn-Jakdhan</hi> (the Living, Son of the Waking One),
                    best known by Pococke’s Latin version, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophus</hi><hi rend="italic">Autodidactus.</hi> Ibn-Tofail, the Abubacer
                    of the schoolmen, was born at Guadix in Andalusia, and died at Marocco in 1185.
                    At the court of Jusuf he combined the offices of vizier and physician, and
                    employed his influence to introduce younger students to the notice of the
                    prince. Ibn-Tofail wrote on medicine and astronomy, as well as philosophy, but
                    his romance, which has been translated into Hebrew, Latin, English, and other
                    European languages, is his only extant work. It describes the process by which
                    an isolated truth-seeker d⅛taches himself from his lower passions, and raises
                    himself above the material earth and the orbs of heaven to the forms which are
                    the source of their movement, until he arrives at a union with the supreme
                    intellect. The experiences of the religious mystic are paralleled with the
                    ecstatic vision in which the philosophical hermit sees a world of pure
                    intelligences, where birth and decease are unknown.</p>
                <p>It was this theory which Averroes (1126-1198), the last and most famous of the
                    thinkers of Moslem Spain, carried out to his doctrine of the unity of intellect.
                    The whole doctrine will be discussed under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Averroes</hi>; but its general purport is this. Reproducing, on one hand, the
                    customary psychology of Aristotle as it rises gradually from the mere sense to
                    the understanding, it emphasises, on another hand, the permanent subsistence and
                    action of intellect apart from all materiality and from the individuals who
                    share in the intellectual power. In the active intellect it finds the motive
                    principle, and the full fruition of human reason. Sometimes this intellect is
                    invested with the supremacy of the sphere beneath the moon, and connected with a
                    more universal intelligence through a hierarchy of spiritual principles in the
                    celestial system. Such a mind is the sole actual intellect in which the
                    generations of thinking men live and move. In complete union with it lies their
                    perfect beatitude; and, save as a temporary participant in the blessings of this
                    universal form, the intellectual soul is a nonentity.</p>
                <p>The philosophers thus characterised were in almost every case physicians; and
                    with their medical knowledge they frequently combined studies in mathematics,
                    astronomy, and alchemy. In all these departments they were the pupils of Greeks,
                    whose text they accepted almost as a revelation. Their talent lay in the
                    elaboration of details, and in correcting certain mistakes of their guides; but
                    they never introduced any comprehensive change. Still their conjunct prosecution
                    of physical and metaphysical studies gave them an advantage over their Latin
                    contemporaries, with whom the schools of dialectic grew into exaggerated
                    prominence, whilst few traces were left, as at Salerno, of the medical and
                    scientific pursuits of the ancient world. Their acquaintance with art was
                    another feature in favour of the Arabians. Al-Kendi, Al-Farabi, and Ibn-Badja
                    were musicians of note: Ibn-Tofail and Ben·Gebirol were famous as poets. Their
                    studies in the sacred law and in theology did not unduly dominate their
                    philosophical investigations, and they combined much practical work as
                    physicians and statesmen with an almost incredible industry in appropriating and
                    systematising the wisdom of Greece. But the great educational value of Arabian
                    philosophy for the later schoolmen consisted in its making them acquainted with
                    an entire Aristotle. At the moment when it seemed as if everything had been made
                    that could be made out of the fragments of Aristotle, and the compilations of
                    Capella, Cassiodorus, and .others, and when mysticism and scepticism seemed the
                    only resources left for the mind, the horizon of knowledge λvas suddenly widened
                    by the acquisition of a complete Aristotle. Thus the mistakes inevitable in the
                    isolated study of an imperfect <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi> could not
                    henceforth be made. The real bearing of old questions, and the meaninglessness
                    of many disputes, were seen in the new conception of Aristotelianism given by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics,</hi> and other treatises. The former Realism
                    and Nominalism were lifted into a higher phase by the principle of the uni
                    vernalising action of intellect— <hi rend="italic">(Intellectus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">formis agit universalitatem).</hi> The
                    commentaries of the Arabians in this respect supplied nutriment more readily
                    assimilated by the pupils than the pure text would have been.</p>
                <p>Arabian philosophy, whilst it promoted the exegesis of Aristotle and increased
                    his authority, was not less notable as the source of the separation between
                    theology and philosophy<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n289/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0289-0270"/>. Speculation fell on irreligious paths. In
                    manycases the heretical movement was due less to foreign example than to the
                    indwelling tendencies of the dominant school of Realism. But it is not less
                    certain that the very considerable freedom of the Arabians from theological bias
                    served indirectly to intensify the prevailing protest against Sacerdotalism, and
                    prepared the time when philosophy shook off its ecclesiastical vestments. In the
                    hurry of first terror, the church struck Aristotle with the anathema launched
                    against innovations in philosophy. The provincial council of Paris in 1209,
                    which condemned Amal-ricus and his followers, as well as David of Dinant’s
                    works, forbade the study of Aristotle’s Natural Philosophy, and the
                    Commentaries. In 1215 the same prohibition was repeated, specifying the
                    Metaphysics and Physics, and the Commentaries by the Spaniard Mauritius <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> probably Averroes). Meanwhile Albertus Magnus and
                    Thomas Aquinas, accepting the exegetical services of the Arabians, did their
                    best to controvert the obnoxious doctrine of the Intellect, and to defend the
                    orthodoxy of Aristotle against the unholy glosses of infidels. But it is
                    doubtful whether even they kept as pure from the infection of illegitimate
                    doctrine as they supposed. The tide meanwhile flowed in stronger and stronger.
                    In 1270 Stephen Tempier, bishop of Paris, supported by an assembly of
                    theologians, anathematised thirteen propositions bearing the stamp of Arabian
                    authorship; but in 1277 the same views and others more directly offensive to
                    Christians and theologians had to be censured again. Raymond Lully, in a
                    dialogue with an infidel thinker, broke a lance in support of the orthodox
                    doctrine, and carried on a crusade against the Arabians in every university; and
                    a disciple of Thomas Aquinas drew up a list <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Erroribus philosophorum)</hi> of the several delusions and errors
                    of each of the thinkers from Alkindius to Averroes. Strong in their conviction
                    of the truth of Aristotelianism, the Arabians carried out their logical results
                    in the theological field, and made the distinction of necessary and possible, of
                    form and matter, the basis of conclusions in the most momentous questions. They
                    refused to accept the doctrine of creation because it conflicted with the
                    explanation of forms as the necessary evolution of matter. They denied the
                    particular providence of God, because knowledge in the divine sphere did not
                    descend to singulars. They excluded the Deity from all direct action upon the
                    world, and substituted for a cosmic principle the active intellect,—thus holding
                    a form of Pantheism. But all did not go the same length in their divergence from
                    the popular creed.</p>
                <p>The half-legendary accounts which attribute the introduction of Arabian science
                    to Gerbert, afterwards Pope Sylvester II., to Constantinus Africanus, and to
                    Adelard of Bath, if they have any value, refer mainly to medical science and
                    mathematics. It was not till about the middle of the 12th century that under the
                    patronage of Raymond, archbishop of Seville, a society of translators, with the
                    archdeacon Dominicus Gundisalvi at their head, produced Latin versions of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> of Avicenna and Algazel, of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fons</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitoe</hi> of Avicebron, and of several
                    Aristotelian treatises. The working translators were converted Jews, the best
                    known among them being Joannes Avendeath. With this effort began the chief
                    translating epoch for Arabic Werks. Avicenna’s <hi rend="italic">Canon of
                    Medicine</hi> waβ first translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona <hi
                    rend="italic">(d.</hi> 1187), to whom versions of other medical and astronomical
                    works are due. The movement towards introducing Arabian science and philosophy
                    into Europe, however, culminated under the patronage of the Emperor Frederick
                    II. (1212-1250). Partly from superiority to the narrowness of his age, and
                    partly in the interest of his struggle with the Papacy, this <hi rend="italic"
                    >Malleus</hi><hi rend="italic">ecclesiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Romance</hi> drew
                    to his court those savants whose pursuits were discouraged by the church, and
                    especially students in the forbidden lore of the Arabians. He is said to have
                    pensioned Jews for purposes of translation. One of the scholars to whom
                    Frederick gave a welcome was Michael Scot, the first translator of Averroes.
                    Scot had sojourned at Toledo about 1217, and had accomplished the versions of
                    several astronomical and physical treatises, mainly, if we believe Roger Bacon,
                    by the labours of a Jew named Andrew. But Bacon is apparently hypercritical in
                    his estimate of the translators from the Arabic. Another protégé of Frederick’s
                    was Hermann the German (Alemannus), who, between the years 1243 and 1256,
                    translated amongst other things a paraphrase of Al-Farabi on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhetoric,</hi> and of Averroes on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poetics</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> of Aristotle. Jewish scholars
                    held an honourable place in transmitting the Arabian commentators to the
                    schoolmen. It was amongst them, especially in Maimo-nides, that Aristotelianism
                    found refuge after the light of philosophy was extinguished in Islam; and the
                    Jewish family of the Ben-Tibbon were mainly instrumental in making Averroes
                    known to southern France.</p>
