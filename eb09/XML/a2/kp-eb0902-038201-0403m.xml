                <p><label type="entry">ARCHITECTURE</label> (Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >architectura,</hi> from the Greek αpχιτeκτωv, a master-builder) is the art of
                    building according to principles which are determined, not merely by the ends
                    the edifice is intended to serve, but by considerations of beauty and harmony.
                    It cannot be defined as the art of building simply, or even of building well.
                    The end of building as such is convenience, use, irrespective of appearance; and
                    the employment of materials to this end is regulated by the mechanical
                    principles of the constructive art. The end of architecture as an art, on the
                    other hand, is so to arrange the plan, masses, and enrichments of a structure as
                    to impart to it interest, beauty, grandeur, unity, power. Architecture thus
                    necessitates the possession by the builder of gifts of imagination as well as of
                    technical skill, and in all works of architecture properly so called these
                    elements must exist, and be harmoniously combined. The combination of technical
                    with imaginative features removes architecture from the precise position
                    occupied by painting, sculpture, and music, but does this more in appearance
                    than in reality, since the greatest works of the architect must always be those
                    in which the imagination of the artist is most plainly seen.</p>
                <p>Like the other arts, architecture did not spring into existence at an early
                    period of man’s history. The ideas of symmetry and proportion which are
                    afterwards embodied in material structures could not be evolved until at least a
                    moderate degree of civilisation had been attained, while the efforts of
                    primitive man in the construction of dwellings must have been at first
                    determined solely by his physical wants. Only after these had been provided for,
                    and materials amassed on which his imagination might exercise itself, would he
                    begin to plan and erect structures, possessing not only utility, but also
                    grandeur and beauty. Before proceeding to inquire into the history of
                    architecture, it may be well to enumerate briefly the elements which in
                    combination form the architectural perfection of a building. These elements have
                    been very variously determined by different authorities. Vitruvius, the only
                    ancient writer on the art whose works have come down to us, lays down three
                    qualities as indispensable in a fine building, viz., <hi rend="italic">Firmitas,
                    Utilitas, Venustas,</hi> stability, utility, beauty. In an architectural point
                    of view the last is the principal, though not the sole element; and,
                    accordingly, the theory of architecture is occupied for the most part with
                    aesthetic considerations, or the principles of beauty in designing. Of such
                    principles or qualities the following appear to be the most important: size,
                    proportion, harmony and symmetry, ornament, and colour. All other elements may
                    be reduced under one or other of these heads.</p>
                <p>With regard to the first quality, it is clear that, as the feeling of power is a
                    source of the keenest pleasure, size, or vastness of proportion, will not only
                    excite in the mind of man the feelings of awe with which he regards the sublime
                    in nature, but will impress him with a deep sense of the majesty of human power.
                    It is, therefore, a double source of pleasure. The feelings with which we regard
                    the Pyramids of Egypt, the vast monoliths at Rome, the massive templee of Sicily
                    and the Parthenon, and the huge structures of Stonehenge, sufficiently attest
                    the truth of this principle.</p>
                <p>The qualities in the general disposition of the parts of a building which are
                    calculated to give pleasure to the beholder, are proportion, harmony, and
                    symmetry. To obtain a clear idea of the general plan in order to appreciate
                    these qualities, the best method is to contemplate the building under conditions
                    that prevent the mind from being disturbed by the consideration of the
                    details—at a distance, for instance, or by moonlight, when its outlines may be
                    seen standing boldly out against the sky. Thus the mass of a Gothic cathedral,
                    the proportion of its parts, the outline of tower, nave, choir, and lady-chapel,
                    the deep shadows which show the projection or recess of its various parts, are
                    in themselves beautiful even when there is not fight enough to distinguish
                    mouldings, carvings, or tracery.</p>
                <p>Proportion itself depends essentially upon the employment of mathematical ratios
                    in the dimensions of a building. It is a curious but significant fact that such
                    proportions as those of an exact cube, or of two cubes placed side by side
                    —dimensions increasing by one-half <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> 20 feet high,
                    30 wide, and 45 long)—or the ratios of the base, perpendicular, and hypotenuse
                    of a right-angled triangle <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> 3, 4, 5, or their
                    multiples)—please the eye more than dimensions taken at random. No defect is
                    more glaring or more unpleasant than want of proportion. The Gothic architects
                    appear to have been guided in their designs by proportions based on the
                    equilateral triangle.</p>
                <p>By harmony is meant the general balancing of the several parts of the design. It
                    is proportion applied to the mutual relations of the details. Thus, supported
                    parts should have an adequate ratio to their supports, and the same should be
                    the case with solids and voids. Due attention to proportion and harmony gives
                    the appearance of stability and repose which is indispensable to a really fine
                    building. Symmetry is uniformity in plan, and, when not carried to excess, is
                    undoubtedly effective. But a building too rigorously symmetrical is apt to
                    appear cold and tasteless. Such symmetry of general plan, with diversity of
                    detail, as is presented to us in leaves, animals, and other natural objects, is
                    probably the just medium between the excesses of two opposing schools.</p>
                <p>Next to general beauty or grandeur of form in a building comes architectural
                    ornament. Ornament, of course, may be used to excess, and, as a general rule, it
                    should be confined to the decoration of constructive parts of the fabric; but,
                    on the other hand, a total absence or a paucity of ornament betokens an
                    unpleasing poverty. Ornaments may be divided into two classes—mouldings and the
                    sculptured representation of natural or fanciful objects. Mouldings, no doubt,
                    originated, first, in simply taking off the edge of anything that might be in
                    the way, as the edge of a squaro post, and then sinking the chamfer in hollows
                    of various forms; and thence were developed the systems of mouldings we now find
                    in all styles and periods. Each of these has its own system; and so well are
                    their characteristics understood, that from an examination of them a skilful
                    architect will not only tell the period in which any building has been erected,
                    but will even give an estimate of its probable size, as professors of physiology
                    will construct an animal from the examination of a single bone. Mouldings
                    require to be carefully studied, for nothing offends an educated eye like a
                    confusion of mouldings, such as Roman forms in Greek work, or Early English in
                    that of the Tudor period. The same remark applies to sculptured ornaments. They
                    should be neither too numerous nor too few, and, above all, they should be
                    consistent. The carved ox skulls, for instance, which are appropriate in a
                    temple of Vesta or of Fortune, would be very incongruous on a Christian
                    church.</p>
                <p>Colour must be regarded as a subsidiary element in architecture, and although it
                    seems almost indispensable and has always been extensively employed in
                    interiors, it is doubtful how far external colouring is desirable. Some <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n404/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0404-0383"/> contend that only local colouring, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the colour of the materials, should be admitted; but
                    there seems no reason why any colour should not be used, provided it be employed
                    with discretion and kept subordinate to the form or outline. This subject is of
                    too much importance to be dismissed summarily here, and will be treated in a
                    supplementary notice at the end of this article.</p>
                <p>As has been already pointed out, the origin of the art is to be found in the
                    endeavours of man to provide for his physical wants. A picturesque account of
                    the early stages in its progress is given by Vitruvius. According to him, man in
                    his primitive savage state began to imitate the nests of birds and the lairs of
                    beasts, and constructed arbours with twigs of trees. To these arbours succeeded
                    huts with walls composed of dried turf, strengthened with reeds and branches.
                    From huts to houses the progress is gradual and easy. Other writers have
                    endeavoured to trace three orders of primitive dwellings—the cave, the hut, and
                    the tent—constructed severally by the tribes who devoted themselves to hunting
                    and fishing, to agriculture, and to a pastoral and nomadic life. There can be no
                    doubt that climate and surrounding circumstances affected not only the form of
                    the primitive, buildings but also the materials employed. Thus, where trees
                    abounded, stone was probably a material seldom used, as it entailed a much
                    greater amount of labour than timber; but as stone would neither burn nor rot,
                    it was preferred for all durable purposes. Where wood was plentiful, as in
                    Greece and in Lycia, stone architecture exhibits traces of an original timber
                    construction. The columns were originally posts, and the architraves and
                    triglyphs beams resting on each other. The Lycian tomb in the British Museum
                    furnishes a strong proof that there the art of the carpenter preceded that of
                    the mason, and suggested forms, which became conventional, and from which the
                    latter could not venture to depart. On the other hand, in the plains of Egypt,
                    where building timber is scarce, and where there is abundance of large stone in
                    the mountains, the mason element seems to have prevailed. In such plains as
                    those of Nineveh and Babylon artificial stone was made from lumps of dried or
                    burnt clay. Finally, in vast sandy deserts, where there are neither trees nor
                    stones, the skins of beasts, sewed together and supported by sticks, formed the
                    earliest shelter. This soon grew into the tent, and its form still influences
                    the architecture of the Chinese and the Tartars. Much ingenuity has been
                    expended in the inquiry whether it was timber or stone that first gave birth to
                    the art of <hi rend="italic">architecture;</hi> the probability is, that the
                    hut, the cairn, and the tent, all contributed their share in different
                    countries.</p>
                <p>No traces remain of the steps by which the beautiful temples of Egypt or the
                    magnificent halls of Persia and Assyria were developed from these rude
                    beginnings. The earliest known structures of those countries belong to an age
                    already considerably advanced in civilisation and in the art of construction.
                    And the history of architecture from its earliest specimens in Egypt is not one
                    continuous line of progress. We can indeed show how from these early structures
                    sprang the art of Greece; how that was modified by the Romans; and finally, how
                    the Pointed architecture of the 13th century arose. But the development is not
                    gradual; it proceeds by a series of steps, and one style does not shade
                    imperceptibly into another. No doubt the architects of each country borrowed
                    somewhat (in detail more especially) from the designs of the adjacent countries;
                    but, nevertheless, each country originated forms peculiar to itself, and in all
                    its artistic efforts continued to repeat and elaborate them. So definite are the
                    characteristics of the styles of different nations, that from the mere form,
                    carving, or decoration of any structure, its age and its architects can,
                    usually, be fairly determined.</p>
                <p>PREHISTORIC STRUCTURES.</p>
                <p>The numerous relics of structures left by primeval man have generally little or
                    rio architectural value. The only interesting problem regarding them, the
                    determination of their date and purpose, and of the degree of civilisation which
                    they manifest, falls within the province of archaeology.</p>
                <p>The principal specimens of such prehistoric erections may be classified thus—</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">Monoliths (Maenhir,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Maen,</hi>
                    a stone, <hi rend="italic">hir,</hi> high), or single upright stones (fig. 1).
                    The best example is at Carnac, in Brittany. This huge stone, when perfect, was
                    63 feet high, and 14 feet in diameter at its widest -part. It is rudely shaped
                    to a circular form, and weighs about 260 tons.</p>
                <p>(2.) <hi rend="italic">Cromlechs,</hi> table-stones, generally consisting of one
                    large flat stone supported by others which are upright (fig. 2). The cromlech is
                    also named <hi rend="italic">Dolmen,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Taal,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Daul,</hi> a table, and <hi rend="italic">Maen,</hi> a stone.
                    A good example of the cromlech is the structure known as “Kit’s Coity House,”
                    near Maidstone. Other examples occur in different parts of Great Britain and</p>
                <p>Ireland, and numerous specimens are found in Algeria, in India, in the country
                    east of the Jordan, in Guernsey, and near Saumur, on the Loire.</p>
                <p>(3.) <hi rend="italic">Circles of Stone.—</hi> The most important specimen of
                    these in Britain is Stonehenge (fig. 3). Others are found at Avebury, in
                    Wiltshire (fig. 4); at Stanton Drew, in Somersetshire; at Stennis, in Orkney;
                    and at Callernish, in Lewis; and several have been discovered in the districts
                    around Mount Sinai and Aden. In some circles, as at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0405-0384"/> Stonehenge, as well as separately, are found
                    trilithons (fig. 1), which appear to be a modification of the dolmen.</p>
                <p>(4.) <hi rend="italic">Tumuli.—</hi> These include the <hi rend="italic">heehiυe
                    huts,</hi> so called from their shape, found scattered throughout Cornwall,
                    Wales, and Scotland (fig. 5). Similar, but superior, edifices are to be met with
                    in Ireland; and of these, New Grange, near Drogheda, apparently a burial mound,
                    is the finest specimen (fig. 6). The design of the</p>
                <p>“nurhags” (fig. 7), which are found in great numbers in the island of Sardinia,
                    has greatly puzzled archaeologists. It has been conjectured that they were
                    sepulchres, the dead being exposed on their summits. Of the so-called “Picts’
                    houses” of the Orkney Islands, some are chambered tumuli, while others may be
                    more properly described as underground dwellings (fig. o).</p>
                <p>(5.) <hi rend="italic">Wooden huts,</hi> the submerged remains of which have been
                    recently discovered in the lakes of Switzerland, as well as in Sweden, in Italy,
                    and in Ireland. These erections, which rose on piles just above the surface of
                    the water, present no features of architectural interest.</p>
                <p>Λ specimen of prehistoric sculpture, on stone, taken from ruins in the island of
                    Gozo, in the Mediterranean, is given in fig. 11.</p>
                <p>Prehistoric remains are separated by a wide gulf from those which now fall to be
                    noticed, inasmuch as, whether or not they led, by improvement in their forms, to
                    anything really architectural, no evidence remains of such progress, and they
                    must therefore be regarded as practically dissociated from anything that we have
                    now to describe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Egyptian Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>For the beginnings of the art—its earliest efforts* grand even in their
                    infancy—we must turn to Egypt.</p>
                <p>A short description of the general configuration of the country may be useful
                    here. Its habitable land is a narrow strip a few miles wide, extending from the
                    Nile, on one or both its banks, to the rocks or desert. About 100 miles up the
                    river is Cairo, and close to it Memphis, the old capital of Lower Egypt,
                    Heliopolis, and the great pyramids of Ghizeh, Abooseer, Sakkara, and Dashour;
                    450 miles higher up th© river is the site of the great Thebes, with Karnak and
                    Luxor on the right or eastern bank, and Medinet Haboo on the west. Beyond this
                    in succession are Esne, Edfoo, Elephantina, Syene, and Philae, close to the
                    first cataract. Higher up (in Nubia) are the great caves of Aboosimbel, and at a
                    still greater distance the pyramids of Meroë, or Dankelah. The rock is generally
                    limestone up to Thebes, sandstone and breccia to Syene, where the well-known
                    variety of granite, with hornblende, is found; these with the addition of
                    unburnt brick, are the chief materials used in the construction of the Egyptian
                    architectural monuments. The granite was principally supplied by the quarries at
                    Elephantina and Syene, for which the Nile offered a ready mode of conveyance,
                    although it appears that the obelisks and other enormous blocks were sent by
                    land. Some species were brought down the river from Ethiopia^ but we do not find
                    that the materials were brought from any other foreign country. It may be
                    remarked, too, that in the earliest structures the common <hi rend="italic"
                    >grès</hi> or sandstone ia principally employed. Excepting the obelisks and some
                    few of the propylaea, all the temples at Thebes are of that material. In Lower
                    Egypt, on the contrary, and in the works of later date generally, almost
                    everything is constructed of granite.</p>
                <p>It seems quite certain that Egyptian art is original and not derived from that of
                    India; and it may be concluded <pb break="no"

                    Egypt are the oldest specimens of architecture in the world. The origin of the
                    structures themselves has been matter of some discussion. By several writers it
                    has been thought that the rockcut caves of Upper Egypt were the earliest efforts
                    of architectural design, and furnished models for the enormous piles raised
                    along the banks of the Nile. An examination of these caves, however, will show
                    clearly that the very reverse is the case, and that the carvings of the
                    excavations are imitated from the above-ground buildings.</p>
                <p>The oldest works of the Egyptians, according to Herodotus, were the embankment of
                    the Nile by Menes, the foundation of the city of Memphis, and the commencement
                    of a temple to Vulcan. Next we learn from Manetho, as cited by Eusebius, that
                    Venephes, the fourth king of the first dynasty, built some pyramids at a place
                    called Cocho-men, but this is all we know of them. Eusebius further records that
                    Tosorthus, or Sosorthus, the second king of the third dynasty, found out how to
                    build with polished or smooth stone (και <hi rend="italic">την</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">διa ζeστωv</hi><hi rend="italic">λίθων οικοδομήν</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">evpeτo).</hi></p>
                <p>The next structure of which we have notice is the Great Pyramid, the most
                    gigantic work in the world—one which never has been, and perhaps never will be
                    surpassed. At this time the Egyptians must have reached a proficiency in the
                    mechanical arts of which we can form no conception. They seem to have been able
                    to quarry rocks of the hardest stone, even granite—to transport them to great
                    distances —to raise huge blocks, vast monolith obelisks, that would puzzle our
                    engineers with their best tackle—and, more wonderful still, they appear to have
                    had the power not only of polishing granite, but of carving on that most
                    stubborn material with the utmost facility, large surfaces and even huge statues
                    being covered with hieroglyphics of the most minute kind and of the highest
                    finish. It is impossible to discover how this was done, for though Herodotus
                    (ii. 124, 125) tells us they had iron tools, it was long before the conversion
                    of that metal into steel had been found out; and with all the best modern tools
                    of steel, it is difficult and costly to carve even plain letters in granite.
                    According to the account of Herodotus, the occasion of the erection of this
                    great work was tho caprice of a king, Cheops, who is supposed to be the Suphis
                    of Syncellus, and the Chembes of Diodorus. This king was a tyrant of the very
                    worst kind; he closed all the temples throughout Egypt, forbade every sort of
                    religious observance, and forced all his subjects to labour for him as he
                    pleased. Among other whims, he determined to build this pyramid as a tomb for
                    himself. The stones wero quarried in the Arabian mountains, and none were less
                    than 30 feet long. They were then conveyed by the Nile to a newly-constructed
                    road, three-quarters of a mile long, GO feet broad, and in a cutting of 48 feet.
                    This road, of polished stone, and carved with figures, took ten years to
                    complete. Twenty years were spent in building the pyramid itself.</p>
                <p>The site of this extraordinary structure is at Ghizeh, in the neighbourhood of
                    Cairo. The base was, Herodotus tells us, 8 plethra (about 808 English feet)
                    square, and the height the same. This, however, is not the case, the Greek
                    author having probably measured the sloping edge. The dimensions are variously
                    given by the various persons who have measured it. Μ. Nouet, who was of the
                    French commission in Egypt, and had perhaps the best means of ascertaining the
                    truth, states its base to be a square whose side is 716 French or 768 English
                    feet, and gives the height as 421 French or 452 English feet. The dimensions of
                    the pyramid in its original state, as given by Colonel Vyse, are 764 feet length
                    of base, 720 feet slant side, and 480 feet high. According to Sir Henry James
                    <hi rend="italic">{Notes cn the Great Pyramid,</hi> 1869), the side of the base
                    is 760 feet: while Professor Piazzi Smyth gives this as 763 81, and the height
                    as 486 ’ 2567. The pyramid thus covers upwards of 13 acres, and is about 150
                    feet higher than St Paul’s cathedral. As compared with the largest building in
                    the world, St Peter’s, Rome, the Great Pyramid covers an area which is as 58 to
                    22, or nearly three times as much, and is 50 feet higher. Like almost all the
                    other pyramids, its sides face the cardinal points, and it is entered from the
                    north by a descending passage, which leads to a few small chambers or cells, the
                    largest of which is but 17*7 feet wide. In one of these a solitary sarcophagus
                    was found.</p>
                <p>The pyramid appears to be a solid mass of stone, and is built in regular courses
                    or layers, which vary in thickness from 2 to 5 feet, each receding from the one
                    below it to the number of 202; though even this is variously stated from that
                    number to 2GO, as indeed the height is given by various modern travellers at
                    from 444 to 625 feet. And the ancient writers differ as widely both among
                    themselves and from the moderns. On the top course the area is about 10 English
                    feet square, though it is believed to have been originally two courses higher,
                    which would bring it to the smallest that in regular gradations it could be.
                    This vast erection, on which the labours of 100,000 men were bestowed for twenty
                    years, and which contains 85 millions of cubic feet of stone, must have cost
                    (reckoning quarrying, transport— twice by land and once by river—squaring,
                    hoisting, and setting at 2s. per foot) something like 8⅜ millions of English
                    money.</p>

                <p>A second pyramid, close to the first, was built by the successor of Cheops, whom
                    Herodotus calls Chephren; the inscriptions on the stones, however, give the name
                    Shafra. The side of its base is about 60 feet less than that of the former.
                    About forty years later, Mycerinus, or Men-cheres, built a third; but the side
                    of the base is only about 364 feet, or less than half that of the Great Pyramid.
                    It was, however, entirely faced with polished granite, while the others were of
                    limestone. A statue of King Chephren has recently been found in a temple close
                    adjacent to the pyramids, and now forms one of the most remarkable objects in
                    the museum at Cairo. Canina <hi rend="italic">(Architectura Antica,</hi> part
                    i.) has described altogether twenty large and twenty-seven small pyramids, some
                    not more than 30 feet square. But the researches of Lepsius and others prove
                    that the number is much greater than this, and on the range of cliffs
                    overlooking the Nile, from Abooroash in the north to Illahoon in the south, the
                    number is probably not under 100.</p>
                <p>A great deal of trouble has been taken to discover the principles on which the
                    Egyptians planned these erections. The most reasonable theory is that each side
                    was meant for an equilateral triangle, four of which, laid sloping and brought
                    to a point, would compose the pyramid; but neither the dimensions nor the angles
                    agree with this. It is true that the sides of the three great pyramids have an
                    angle with the horizon of from 51⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> to 52∣ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi> or thereabouts; but those at Abooseer and at Sakkara,
                    as given by Canina, measure 55°, while at Barkal, near Meroë, the angle is no
                    less than 72°. At Dashour the pyramid has a slope about half way up of 53°,
                    which afterwards is flattened to 44°. At Meydoum there is a pyramid in three
                    great steps. If, therefore, the Egyptians had begun to work on the above theory,
                    they departed from it in many notable instances.</p>
                <p>The following seems to have been the manner in which the pyramids were generally
                    constructed. A level platform was cut in the rock, a portion of which was,
                    however, left in the centre above the general level to serve as a sort of core
                    to the pyramid. A deep chamber was then sunk in the rock, with a passage leading
                    from it always on the north side, and usually at an angle of 26° to 28°, to the
                    surface of the ground. It is curious that these passages were almost always of
                    one dimension, viz., 3 ft. 5 in. wide, and 3 ft. 11 in. high. Over the chamber
                    was built a mass of masonry, which was gradually added to at the side and top,
                    according to the power, or the wealth, or the length of life of the founder.
                    Finally, the angles of the stones were cut off to the proper slope, or a casing
                    added, and the pyramid thus completed from the top. Some of the casings were
                    highly finished. Those of the first and second pyramid were of polished stone;
                    that of the third was of polished granite. Occasionally, as in the Great
                    Pyramid, and in the southern one at Dashour, there was a chamber built above the
                    one which was cut in the rock. Their entrances were carefully concealed, and
                    even the doors of the chamber defended by gigantic portcullises of granite, some
                    8 to 10 feet square, weighing 50 to 60 tons, so as to render the security of the
                    chambers as great as possible. Yet every chamber in the chief pyramids, at
                    least, except perhaps “the false one” at Meydoum, has been rifled ages ago, and
                    so the great purpose of their erection utterly set at nought. Most of the
                    sarcophagi which they once contained have also been carried away. One, that of
                    Mycerinus, was lost in its passage to England; but the mummy-case and mummy
                    which it contained are now in the British Museum. The sarcophagus of the Great
                    Pyramid still rests in its chamber. An extra interest belongs to the third
                    pyramid (of Mycerinus) owing to its chamber being ceiled with a pointed arch.
                    But it is not a true arch, the stones being merely strutted against each other,
                    as over the entrance to the Great Pyramid (see fig. 13 <hi rend="italic"
                    >supra),</hi> and the underside cut to the above form. The chamber of a pyramid
                    at Sakkara was lined with blue and white tiles like the Dutch style; and at the
                    false one at Meydoum there is, about two-thirds up, a band about 12 feet wide,
                    left rough all round, and it has been supposed that this may have been left as a
                    ground for decoration. But there is nothing to prove this. Herodotus, however,
                    expressly says that the exterior was richly sculptured, and a model of a pyramid
                    that is to be seen at the Museum of Cairo bears out his statement. The
                    construction of pyramids seems to have ended in Lower Egypt at a very early
                    date, with the old dynasty of Memphis. But some of crude brick, and containing
                    arched chambers, are found at Thebes, and are supposed to be of date about 1200
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Many similar structures, but on a very much
                    smaller scale, were erected in Ethiopia and Meroë down to about 700 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>Many theories have been stated as to the purposes for which these gigantic
                    monuments were erected, but the opinion of Μ. Mariette, the latest, as well as
                    one of the most learned writers, may be taken as correct, viz., that every
                    pyramid was a tomb and the gigantic enclosure of a mummy. It is certain that
                    every pyramid is on the western bank of the Nile, the region of the setting sun,
                    and thus associated by the Egyptians with the regions of death, and that each
                    group of pyramids is the centre of a necropob’s.</p>

                <p>Next to the pyramids in massive grandeur comes the Great Sphinx, and an
                    additional interest has lately been associated with this statue, from the
                    finding of an inscription, which seems to prove that it was sculptured before
                    the time of the builder of the first pyramid. The Egyptian sphinx was quite
                    different from the Greek, which usually had a female head on the body of a
                    winged lion; whereas the Egyptian was wingless, and had usually the head of a
                    man, bearded and capped, and thus represents strength and wisdom. Those with the
                    head of a ram, or crio-sphinxes, are supposed to be dedicated to Amen (Jupiter
                    Ammon); those with the head of a hawk are called hieraco-sphinxes, and are
                    sacred to Ba, or the sun. The</p>
                <p>Great Sphinx at Ghizeh has the body of a lion crouching close to the ground; the
                    height from the floor, or platform on which it lies, to the top of the head is
                    100 feet; the total length is 146 feet; across the shoulders it measures 34
                    feet. The head, from the top to the chin, is 28 feet 6 inches, and is calculated
                    to be 40,000 times the bulk of an ordinary human head. A small temple or
                    sanctuary was built between its paws. With the exception of this, and the paws
                    themselves, which are of masonry, the whole appears to be carved out of the
                    solid rock. Indeed, it may safely be assumed to be solid; for Colonel Vyse
                    drilled a hole 27 feet deep into the shoulder, and found that, so far at least,
                    it was so.</p>
                <p>Another grand memorial of the old dynasty must be mentioned, viz., the Serapeum,
                    near the pyramid of Sakkara, discovered in 1851 by Μ. Mariette, and excavated 30
                    feet deep in the solid rock. It contains the mummies of the sacred bulls, placed
                    in gigantic sarcophagi, 11 feet high, 7 to 8 feet wide, and 13 to 18 feet long,
                    each of which is placed in a chamber. The chambers, forty in number, are
                    excavated on each side of galleries about 12 feet wide, the ceilings being <hi
                    rend="italic">cut</hi> (not <hi rend="italic">built)</hi> to the form of an
                    arch.</p>
                <p>No great distance beyond Sakkara, in the district called the Fayoom, was the
                    famous Labyrinth, an immense mass of buildings mentioned by Herodotus as the
                    palaces built for the twelve kings. From his description of it this appears to
                    have been as great a work and as great a wonder as the pyramids themselves. It
                    was close to Lake Moeris, and contained in the time he wrote 3000 chambers, half
                    above and half below ground, besides immense halls, corridors, courts, gardens,
                    &amp;c. The roofs were wholly of stone, and the walls covered with sculpture. On
                    one side stood a pyramid 40 orgyiae, or about 243 feet high. It appears from the
                    ruins that huge masses of buildings once occupied three sides of an open
                    quadrangle, about 200 yards square in the inside— the two wings being about 300
                    yards long, and the third side about 400, measured on the outside. The pyramid,
                    as stated by the various authorities, occupied the greater part of the fourth
                    side, and measured about 348 feet square. There are a multitude of small
                    chambers in two stories, as described by Herodotus; and Canina supposes there
                    was a third story above these supported on columns—a sort of open gallery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tombs.</hi> —The great reverence paid by the Egyptians to
                    the bodies of their ancestors, and their careful preservation of them by
                    embalmment, necessitated a great number and vast extent of tombs. Some of these,
                    erected long after the building of pyramids had ceased, are built up above
                    ground; others are caves cut in the sides of rocks; others are passages
                    tunnelled under ground to a great extent. The tombs above ground have been for
                    the most part destroyed. But some very interesting ones are found near the Great
                    Pyramid. They are of well-squared stone, in the form of truncated pyramids; the
                    tops are level, and they show no appearance of anything having been built above
                    them. But there must have been a covering of some kind, as pits, leading to
                    sepulchral chambers beneath, are cut down directly from the surface level. The
                    most curious tomb at Ghizeh is known as Campbell’s, of the supposed date of
                    about 660 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is an open excavation, 53 ft. 6 in.
                    deep, 30 ft. by 26 ft. 3 in. on plan, with niches, &lt;tc., leading out of it.
                    In these were found four sarcophagi, one of which, of basalt, is in the British
                    Museum. This excavation is supposed, from some indications left of a springing
                    stone, to have been covered by an arch. If so, this would be the oldest known
                    stone arch of a large size. In fact, it is difficult to imagine any other way in
                    which this large excavation could have been covered. But the special object
                    actually found was a tomb built up in the centre of the excavation, of good
                    masonrv, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n409/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0409-0388"/> covered by three stones as struts, over which was
                    a perfectly formed voussoired arch. This arch was destroyed not long ago by the
                    Egyptian Government, in order to build a mill. Outside the whole excavation was
                    a deep trench 5 ft. 4 in. wide, and 73 feet deep, from which branch out a number
                    of chambers. This excavation was probably finished above with some such
                    truncated pyramid as we have already described.</p>
                <p>Even more interesting are the tombs at Beni Hassan and Thebes. There is little
                    attempt at architectural decoration in these, except the façade and some columns
                    cut in the rock inside; but they are filled with the most interesting paintings,
                    representing even the minutest incidents of private life. A model of one was
                    exhibited in London by Belzoni; and there is a valuable series built up, and
                    painted in fac-simile, in the Vatican at Rome. It appears that as soon as a king
                    succeeded to the throne, the excavation of his tomb commenced, and proceeded
                    year by year till his death. Canina has given plans and sections of several of
                    the royal tombs, extending from 250 to 400 feet direct into the solid rock.
                    Several of these tombs at Beni Hassan have external façades high up in the
                    cliffs, consisting each of two columns <hi rend="italic">in antis,</hi> to which
                    we shall have again to refer when treating of the origin of the Grecian Doric.
                    Others, as at Ghizeh and Sakkara, have their entrances level with or below the
                    ground, and without external decoration; whilst others, as at Thebes, have their
                    entrances high up in the face of the cliffs, and not only without ornament of
                    any kind, but closed up as if for purposes of concealment. But each, no matter
                    of what size or description, had one or more chambers or corridors, in the floor
                    of some one or other of which was sunk a deep pit. Leading out of this pit,
                    again, were other chambers, in one of which was deposited the sarcophagus. When
                    this was done the pit was filled up so as to render the concealment of the place
                    of sepulture as complete as possible. One of the grandest at Thebes is that of a
                    priest, otherwise unknown to fame, which comprises a series of halls, passages,
                    and chambers, at various levels, branching off in one place three different
                    ways. In all, it is 862 feet long, and the part actually excavated occupies an
                    area of 23,000 feet.</p>
                <p>Many of the paintings already alluded to are often simply executed in colour, but
                    others are emphasised by being sculptured also in slight intaglio. This came
                    into use, it would seem, about the 14th century B,c., the earlier work being in
                    relief. The stone was usually prepared for painting by being covered with a very
                    thin fine stucco. Even the fine granites were so covered sometimes, and the
                    woodwork also. Imitations of costly woods, &lt;fcc., are to be found even at
                    this early time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Temples.</hi> —The Egyptian temples range from the time that
                    Thebes became the capital (about 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> down to
                    the time of the Caesars.</p>
                <p>Of all the temples, the most remarkable is perhaps the rock-cut one of
                    Aboosimbel, in Nubia, supposed to have been excavated in the 14th century B.c.
                    The façade was cut in the steep face of a rock, the entrance doorway being
                    flanked by two gigantic statues (66 feet high) on each side. The main feature
                    internally was a grand hall supported by two rows of detached piers, in front of
                    each of which is a statue 17 ft. 8 in. high. Another remarkable temple exists at
                    Ghizeh, built up within a great excavation in the rock; here was found the
                    statue of Chephren before mentioned. The temple is lined with immense blocks of
                    polished granite, as are also the piers, each of these being of one stone about
                    15 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 3 ’ 2 thick. Over this structure there was
                    clearly another, above ground, as extensive remains of fine stonewalling still
                    exist. This singular edifice is without inscription of any kind, and evidently
                    was connected in some way with sepulture, as tomb-chambers lead out of it. The
                    apparently great antiquity of these and other excavations lent countenance to
                    the theory to which we have before alluded, viz., that the origin of Egyptian
                    art is to be found in them. But the evidence before us distinctly shows that all
                    the forms used in the great excavations at Aboosimbel, Thebes, Beni Hassan, and
                    other places, are clearly copied from built buildings. Thus, we have the
                    ceilings arched out of the solid rock, or formed with clear imitations of beams,
                    squared or round, also cut out of the rock, just as square beams or round logs
                    were used in ordinary buildings; and so with the other parts of the
                    excavations.</p>
                <p>The grandest architectural efforts of the Egyptians are shown in their built
                    temples, whose construction ranges from the time at which Thebes became the
                    chief capital (about 2000 B.o.) down to so late even as the time of the Caesars.
                    Sir Gardner Wilkinson, in his <hi rend="italic">Architecture of Ancient
                    Egypt,</hi> gives a very full account of these edifices, and classifies them
                    thus :—1. <hi rend="italic">Sanctuary Temples, or</hi> those with only one
                    single chamber. 2. <hi rend="italic">Peripteral Temples,</hi> or the like, but
                    surrounded with columns. 3. <hi rend="italic">Temples in Antis,</hi> with a
                    portico of two or four columns in front. 4. Those with porticos of <hi
                    rend="italic">many</hi> columns, as Esne, Dendera, &amp;c., and many inner
                    chambers. 5. Those with large <hi rend="italic">courts,</hi> and with <hi
                    rend="italic">pyramidal towers</hi> or propylons in front. The earliest temples
                    were small, consisting of a simple chamber to hold the statue of the deity, with
                    one opening or doorway in front, through which the votary might look, and with
                    an altar for sacrifice. They were sanctuaries into which only priests might
                    enter. The building was surrounded with a wall of brick forming a court or
                    temenos, which was entered by a tall stone gateway or propylon, and was often
                    planted with trees. In process of time these temples were enlarged, and there
                    were added chambers for the priests, and large doorways flanked by towers with
                    sloping sides (Plate VII. fig. 5), and sometimes by a portico or pronaos (fig.
                    2) supported by columns. The vestibule, or court-yard, was surrounded by a
                    colonnade (fig. 4); the propylon was of gigantic proportions, and full of
                    chambers (figs. 1, 4). The sanctuary, <hi rend="italic">adytum,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">σr</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">κo∙i</hi> (fig.
                    4), still contained the idol and its altar. Across the court, and, in fact,
                    sometimes for an immense distance outside, there was a δρό/wç, or avenue of
                    sphinxes, through which processions defiled. At the commencement of this avenue
                    there was frequently an open or hypaethral building, or peristyle of columns,
                    where it is supposed the processions assembled and were marshalled. This
                    building is called a canopy by Sir Gardner Wilkinson.</p>
                <p>The pyramidal form of the propylaea, peculiar to Egyptian temples, may have been
                    suggested by the pyramids, as neither that form nor those adjuncts to a temple
                    appear to have been used before the period at which it is supposed the former
                    were constructed. The grandeur and dignity inherent in that form would indeed
                    hardly be suspected till its appearance in the pyramids themselves; and
                    certainly the impression of its effect must have been strong, to induce men to
                    seek it in a truncated pyramid under a very acute angle, as in the propylaea,
                    relying on the effect of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n412/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0412-0389"/> its outline alone. It was gradually, too, that
                    this tendency was generally applied, for in the earliest Pharaonic structures
                    the vertical outline is most common, except in the propylaea, where they exist;
                    and in the structures of the Ptolemies the inclined outline pervades everything.
                    The larger and more perfect structures do not externally present the appearance
                    of being columned, a boundary wall or peribolus girding the whole, and
                    preventing the view of any part of the interior,—except perhaps the towering
                    magnificence of some inner pylônes; of the lofty tops of an extraordinary avenue
                    of columns, with their superimposed terrace; of the tapering obelisks which
                    occupy, at times, some of the courts; or of a dense mass of structure, which is
                    the body of the temple itself, enclosing the thickly columned halls. The immense
                    magnitude of these edifices may perhaps have made them, in their perfect state,
                    independent of considerations which have weight in architectural composition at
                    the present time, and on which indeed its harmony depends. The various portions
                    of the same temple differ in size and proportion; whence it happens that the
                    cornices of the lower parts abut indefinitely against the walls of the higher,
                    while the latter are not at all in accordance among themselves.</p>
                <p>The structure selected here to exemplify Egyptian architecture, and figured in
                    elevation, plan, and details in Plate VIL, though not ranked among the Pharaonic
                    monuments, is perfectly characteristic of the style and arrangement of Egyptian
                    temples, and is a more regular specimen than any other possessing the national
                    peculiarities. It 13 known as the temple of Apollinopolis Magna, or of Edfoo, in
                    Upper Egypt, on the banks of the Nile, between Thebes and the first cataract. It
                    has recently been cleared out, and its magnificent ruins now stand forth grandly
                    and clearly.</p>
                <p>The plan of the enclosure behind the propylaea is a long paralielogram, the moles
                    or propylaea themselves forming another across one of its ends. The grand
                    entrance to the great court of the temple is by a doorway between the moles, to
                    which there may have been folding gates, for the notches, as for their hinges,
                    are still to be seen. Small chambers, right and left of the entrance, and in the
                    core of the propylaea, were probably for the porters or guards of the temple: a
                    staircase remains on each side, which leads to other chambers at different
                    heights. To furnish these w ith light and air, loop-holes have been cut through
                    the external walls, disfiguring the front of the structure. The grand doorway
                    (fig. 4) is about 51) feet high, and is flanked by two massive towers 110 feet
                    high. The whole façade measures about 250 feet, or about 70 feet longer than
                    that of St Paul’s. The propylon is covered with numerous figures, all of
                    colossal proportions, and some as high as 40 feet. The court is 160 feet by 140,
                    and is surrounded on three sides by columns 32 feet high, forming a covered
                    gallery. The pronaos, or covered portico, measures 110 feet by 44, and consists
                    of three rows of six columns, each 34 feet high, parallel and equidistant,
                    except in the middle, where the intercolumniation is greater, because of the
                    passage through. The front row of columns is closed by a sort of breastwork or
                    dado, extending to nearly half their height, in which moreover they are
                    half-imbedded; and in the central opening a peculiar doorway is formed,
                    consisting of piers, with the lintel and cornice over them cut through, as
                    exhibited in the elevation of the portico. From the pronaos another doorway
                    leads to an atrium or inner vestibule, consisting of three rows of smaller
                    columns, with four in each, distributed as those of the pronaos are. Beyond this
                    vestibule there are sundry close rooms and cells, with passages and staircases
                    which were probably used for storing the sacred utensils. The insulated chamber
                    within the sixth door was most probably the adytum, or shrine of the deity or
                    deities to whom the temple was dedicated. It measures only about 33 feet by 17
                    feet, while the whole edifice within the walls covers about as much ground as St
                    Paul’s, London.</p>
                <p>The longitudinal section of the edifice (fig. 3) shows tho relative heights of
                    the various parts, and the mode of constructing the soffits or ceilings, which
                    are of the same material as the walls and columnar ordinances; that is, in some
                    cases granite, and in others freestone. The elevation of the pronaos (fig. 2)
                    shows also a transverse section of the colonnades and peribolus. It displays
                    most of the general features of Egyptian columnar architecture; the unbroken
                    continuity of outline, the pyramidal tendency of the composition, and the
                    boldness and breadth of every part. The good taste with which the interspaces of
                    the columns are covered may be remarked. Panels standing between the columns
                    would have had a very ill effect, both internally and externally: and if a
                    continued screen had been made, the effect would be still worse, as the columns
                    must then have appeared from the outside absurdly short; but as it is, their
                    height is perfectly obvious, and their form is rendered clear by the contrast of
                    light and shade occasioned by the projection of the panels, which would not
                    exist if they had been detailed between the columns. The lotus ornament at the
                    foot of the panels is particularly simple and elegant; and nothing can be more
                    graceful and effective than the cyma above their cornice, which is singularly
                    enriched with ibis mummy-cases (figs. 6 and 7). The jambs forming a false
                    doorway in the central interspace are a blemish in the composition; they injure
                    it very much by the abruptness of their form, and their want of harmony with
                    anything else in it. The front elevation of the moles or propylaea (fig. 1) with
                    the grand entrance between them, is peculiarly Egyptian; and very little variety
                    is discoverable between the earliest and latest specimens of this species of
                    structure. It is an object that must be seen to be appreciated; simplicity and
                    an inherent impressiveness in the pyramidal tendency are all on which it has to
                    depend for effect, with the exception of its magnitude. The projecting fillet
                    and coving which form a cornice to the structures, though large and bold, appear
                    small and inefficient when compared with thé bulk they crown; and there is
                    nothing particularly striking in tho torus which marks the lateral outline and
                    separates the straight line of the front from the circular of the cornice.
                    Neither are they dependent for their effect on the sculpture, for their
                    appearance is as impressive at a distance, which makes the latter indistinct, as
                    when they are seen near at hand.</p>
                <p>A portion of the portico is given on a larger scale (fig. 5), to show more
                    clearly the forms and arrangement of Egyptian columnar composition. The shaft of
                    the column in this example is perfectly cylindrical. It rests on a square step,
                    or continued stylobate, without the intervention of a plinth or base of any
                    kind; and it has no regular vertical channelling or enrichment, such as fluting,
                    but is marked horizontally with series of grooves, and inscribed with
                    hieroglyphics. The capitals are of different sizes and forms in the same
                    ordinance. In this example the capital, exclusive of its receding abacus, is
                    about one diameter of the column in height. It3 outline is that of the cyma,
                    with a reversed ovolo fillet above, and its enrichment consists principally of
                    lotus flowers. The capital of the column next to this (fig. 2), in the front
                    line, is much taller, differently formed, and ornamented with palm leaves; the
                    third is of the same size and outline as tho first, but differently ornamented;
                    and the corresponding columns on the other side of the centre have capitals
                    corresponding with these, each to its fellow, in the arrangement. Above the
                    capital there is a square block or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n413/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0413-0390"/> receding abacus, which has the effect of a
                    deepening of the entablature, instead of a covering of the columns, when the
                    capitals spread, as in this case. In the earlier Egyptian examples, however, in
                    which the columns are swollen, and diminished in two unequal lengths, the result
                    is different, and the form and size of the abacus appear perfectly consistent.
                    The height of this column and its capital, without the abacus, is six diameters.
                    The entablature consists of an architrave and cornice, there being no equivalent
                    for the frieze of a Greek entablature, unless the coviilg be so considered, in
                    which case the cornice becomes a mere shelf. The architrave, including the
                    torus, is about three-quarters of a diameter in height, which is half that of
                    the whole entablature. The architrave itself is in this example sculptured in
                    low relief, but otherwise plain. The torus, which returns and runs down the
                    angles of the building, is gracefully banded, something like the manner in which
                    the fasces are represented in Roman works. The coving is divided into
                    compartments by vertical flutes, which have been thought to be the origin of
                    triglyphs in a Doric frieze; but these are arranged without reference to the
                    columns, and are in other respects so totally different from them as to give but
                    little probability to the suggestion. The compartments are beautifully enriched
                    with hieroglyphics, except in the centre, where a winged globe is sculptured,
                    surmounting another on the architrave, as shown in the elevation of the pronaos.
                    The ciowning tablet or fillet is quite plain and unornamented. Angular roofs are
                    unknown in ancient Egyptian buildings, and consequently pediments are unknown in
                    its architecture.</p>
                <p>The temple at Edfoo, though its dimensions are considerable, is small when
                    compared with that at Karnak. This covers about 420,000 feet, or five times as
                    much as St Paul’s, London, and more than twice as much as St Peter’s at Rome.
                    The propylon is 370 feet long, or twice as much as that of St Paul’s. The

                    wide, is the most wonderful apartment in the world. It has fourteen rows of
                    columns, nine in each row, and 43 feet high; and two rows, six in each, of the
                    enormous height of 62 ft., 11 ft. 6 in. in diameter, and carrying capitals which
                    measure 22 feet across. This hall (with the two gigantic pylônes) is said to
                    cover 4000 superficial feet more than St Paul’s. Beyond it is the adytum or
                    shrine, a small apartment, measuring only 26 feet by 16 feet.</p>
                <p>In many cases the temples want the peribolus and propylaea, the edifice
                    consisting of no more than the pronaos and the parts beyond it. In others,
                    particularly in those of Thebes, this arrangement is doubled, and there are two
                    pairs of the colossal moles, and another open court or second vestibule
                    intervening between them and the portico. The central line across the courts is
                    formed by a covered avenue of columns, of much larger size than ordinary; and
                    the galleries around are of double rows of columns instead of one row with the
                    walls. The obelisks indicated in the plan and section of Edfoo (Plate VII.),
                    before the propylaea, occupy the situation in which they are generally found,
                    though in this case there are none. Colossal seated figures are sometimes found
                    before the piers of the gateway; and from them, as a base, a long avenue of
                    sphinxes is frequently found ranged like an alley or avenue of trees from a
                    mansion to the park gate, straight or winding, as the case may require.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Statues.</hi> —Connected with the temples, and forming an
                    important part of their decorative features, were gigantic statues and obelisks.
                    The statues are of enormous proportions. The sitting figure of Memnon is about
                    53 feet without the pedestal; and that in the sepulchre of Osy-mandyas (the
                    Memnonium) is nearly 60 feet high. The face of Memnonis 7 feet high, and the ear
                    3 feet 6 inches long, and the shoulders measure nearly 26 feet across.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Obelisks.</hi> —The obelisks of Egypt are generally huge
                    monoliths of red granite or syenite. Their use originated, no doubt, in the
                    custom of setting up stones to commemorate particular events. The Egyptians
                    embellished these stones, first, by working them to a fine face, and afterwards
                    by covering them with carvings. They stand frequently in pairs before the
                    propylon of the temples, as at Karnak and at Philae. After the conquest of Egypt
                    the emperors transported many of these monuments to Rome. At the time the
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Regioniaries</hi> (accounts of each of the wards or
                    <hi rend="italic">Regiones</hi> of Rome) were written, there were six great
                    obelisks, and forty-two small ones at Rome. Of these twelve only are now left,
                    varying in height from over 100 feet to 8⅜ feet. The first, which now stands
                    close to the church of St John Lateran, is 148 Roman palms in height, or a
                    little over 108 English feet, is about 8 feet square at the base, and weighs, as
                    is estimated, nearly 450 tons. It is covered with hieroglyphics, from which we
                    gather it was erected in honour of Thothmes IV. It stood originally before the
                    temple of Amen Ra, and was brought over by Caligula. Each obelisk diminishes
                    equally towards the top—that near the Lateran, ∙253 part of the base; that at St
                    Peter’s, *261; two at Thebes, ’ 3; and the one near S. Maria Maggiore, '307, or
                    nearly one-third. The diminution from the base may therefore be estimated
                    roughly at from one-quarter to one-third.</p>
                <p>The Barberini obelisk is about 7f times as high as the diameter of the base;
                    Cleopatra’s needle, 8∣; the one at St Peter’s 9 times, at Luxor 10 times, at the
                    Lateran 11 times; while two at Thebes, and one in the Piazza Navona at Rome,
                    have an altitude of no less than 12 times the diameter of the base.</p>
                <p>The obelisks have no entasis or swell from top to bottom like a column, but in
                    almost all cases there is a slight convexity on the horizontal, section of each
                    face. The one in the Place de la Concorde at Paris has the peculiarity of being
                    convex on one side, and slightly concave on another.</p>
                <p>In all ancient examples, the small pyramid which covers the obelisk is at least
                    1⅜ times as high as the diameter of the top of the obelisk in which it is
                    placed. In modern examples the pyramidion is almost always too flat, which gives
                    a bad effect. Obelisks appear to have been used in contrast with the long
                    horizontal lines of the temples; so that wo are unable to judge of the effect
                    produced by these gigantic monoliths, when placed in their original positions,
                    for the few examples in Rome, Paris, &amp;c., are isolated and have nothing near
                    them to contrast them with. The enormous labour and care expended upon the
                    Egyptian obelisks may bo judged from the fact, that the largest one at Karnak,
                    which weighs 297 tons, must have been lifted out of the quarry, lowered into a
                    ship, raised out of this into a carriage, transported more than a hundred miles
                    on land, and <pb break="no"

                    height, to its pedestal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Columns.</hi> —In the rock-cut tombs and temples we come to
                    the earliest forms of columnar architecture now existing; and Sir Gardner
                    Wilkinson considers that he can trace the process by which the plain, square,
                    uncarved pier was gradually developed into the ornamental column of the complete
                    Egyptian style. Thus in the case of a plain pier, the first thing was to cut off
                    the angles, making it an octagon; a second cutting produced a 16-sided column.
                    The sides slightly curved formed flutes, and a large slab on the top brought the
                    whole to much the appearance of a rude Doric column.</p>
                <p>Suppose, however, that the pier was painted on each side with the stem and bud or
                    flower of a plant, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the lotus. The figure would be
                    cut in intaglio; the plain spaces between being then cut away, the column would
                    represent 4 or 8 stalks, supporting buds in flower conjoined. These would be
                    united together by sculptured bands, and the whole would form one column of 4 or
                    8 stalks, supporting a capital.</p>
                <p>Sir G. Wilkinson has classed Egyptian columns into eight orders. <hi
                    rend="italic">First,</hi> The <hi rend="italic">square pillar,</hi> or post of
                    stone. This often has a line of hieroglyphics running down it verti cally. <hi
                    rend="italic">Second,</hi> The <hi rend="italic">polygonal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >coïüion,</hi> plain or fluted. This is sometimes painted, or otherwise
                    ornamented with devΓces. <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >bud</hi> capital, or one formed like the bud of the papyrus. Of this there are
                    three varieties. The oldest, from Beni Hassan, is composed of four plants bound
                    together by a sort of necking of fine bands under the buds, the columns coming
                    down straight to the plinth. Then there are columns of eight similar shafts, and
                    these generally turn in at the bottom. After the reign of Amenoph III. simple
                    round shafts came into use. The second variety is composed of similar shafts,
                    capitals, and neckings; but there are similar bands or necking on the bud
                    itself, and a sort of short rods or reeds, descending vertically from the
                    neckings on the sides of the column. The third variety has a single circular
                    shaft, without any indication of the united water plants, but still with bands
                    round the necking, and the capital itself. In these two last varieties the lower
                    part of the shaft is generally ornamented with a sort of sheath or spathe,
                    resembling the lower part of a water plant.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> order the capital is like an <hi
                    rend="italic">inverted bell.</hi> It formerly was called the lotus capital, but
                    in reality it has no resemblance to that flower. The capital is so much undercut
                    that the ornaments on its edge are not visible, except to a spectator who is
                    immediately beneath them.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> order is the <hi rend="italic">palm tree</hi>
                    column, and resembles the head of that tree, with the lower or drooping boughs
                    cut off. The neckings are composed of five bands, but have the peculiarity of a
                    piece hanging down like a knot at the end. These columns are found as early as
                    the time of Amenoph III. In the time of the Ptolemies the shafts came straight
                    down to the plinths, and were not drawn in at the bottom as in the earlier
                    periods.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sixth</hi> order is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isis-headed order,</hi> the capital being formed of one or more heads of that
                    deity, surrounded by a representation of a doorway, or small shrine with an
                    image, and sometimes a votary worshipping placed over it. At Dendera the faces,
                    exclusive of the head-dress, are five feet across. Sometimes the Isis head is
                    formed on a square or polygonal column. Sometimes the head is that of Athor, the
                    Venus of the Egyptians. In this order also are included the capitals at the tomb
                    of Rhamses III. at Thebes, lhese are the heads of cows painted blue and red, and
                    with long reverted horns.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> is called the <hi rend="italic">composite
                    order.</hi> The shafts are generally round, and the capitals, as the name
                    imports, are a mixture of styles. Ihe bell and palms, or the palm and the Isis
                    head, are frequently found in combination. A most curious instance is ranked
                    under this style, of columns of the third order with inverted shafts, and also
                    inverted capitals, taken from Karnak, the work of Thothmes III.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">eighth</hi> order is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Osiride,</hi> from containing statues of the deity Osiris. This order is
                    something like the Persian, or the Caryatides of the Greeks and Romans; but it
                    differs, inasmuch as the figure does not support the entablature, but stands in
                    front of a square pier which discharges that duty. This order is sometimes used
                    in the courts and sometimes in the halls. Grotesque figures of Typhon are found
                    in a building called the Typhonium at Barkal. These, however, partly support the
                    entablature with their odd-shaped caps.</p>

                    selected from those given by Canina and Sir G. Wilkinson, shows at one view the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pilasters.</hi> —These are employed in all ages, though they
                    do not always accord with the order of the columns. For instance, at Thebes the
                    pilasters of the Temple <hi rend="italic">in antis</hi> of Dayr el Medeeneh are
                    of the sixth or Isis-headed order, while the columns between are of the seventh
                    or composite order. They are generally square, and without diminution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Entablatures.</hi> —These are nearly alike in all orders,
                    and may be described as a cornice and architrave without a frieze. The former
                    consists of a fillet or regula, beneath which is what is generally called a
                    large hollow or cavctto; but in reality the upper half is a quarter round, and
                    the lower nearly straight. Under this moulding is a bold torus which separates
                    the cornice from the architraves, and runs down the sloping sides of the angle
                    of the building to the ground. The cornice is generally ornamented with
                    divisional vertical lines, like triglyphs. Between these the cartouches or ovals
                    of the reigning monarch, or other devices, are carved. The centre is generally
                    occupied by the winged globe, or emblem of the Good Daemon. The torus is often
                    ornamented as if strings were bound round a bundle of sticks, like the <hi
                    rend="italic">fasces</hi> of a Roman lictor. On the upper part of the smaller
                    cornices there is often a row like the antefixae of a Greek temple, but their
                    form is peculiar, and is supposed to represent the pots in which the mummies of
                    the sacred cats and ibis were preserved. The architraves are plain, without
                    being broken into fasciae, and are generally covered with hieroglyphics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fortifications.</hi> —Next to the temples, the grandest
                    buildings were perhaps the fortifications. We know that the temples themselves
                    were often used as citadels, few of the towns being fortified. Even Thebes seems
                    not to have been so. Of the actual citadels we have a few remains, as at Dakkeh.
                    But several are shown on the drawings, and bear a curious resemblance to
                    mediaeval works, the ramparts of the walls and towers having battlements<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n415/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0415-0392"/> which overhang like our machicolations, while, in
                    the centre of the enclosure formed by the walls, was generally a high square
                    tower or keep. Of the further details we know little.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Private Dwellings.</hi> —Of these little is known, except
                    from paintings found in the tombs. One noted ruin at Medinet Haboo has, indeed,
                    been supposed to be that of a palace; but one of the latest authorities, Μ.
                    Mariette, throws doubt on this, considering that it was erected partly for
                    defence and partly as a triumphal monument. The ordinary dwellings seem, like
                    the houses in the Labyrinth, to have been in two stories, with an open gallery
                    at the top, supported by columns probably of wood. The larger houses consisted
                    of rooms ranged round three sides, and sometimes four, of a large court-yard
                    planted with trees, and with a tank, and perhaps a fountain, in the middle.
                    There was an entrance porch, on which are hieroglyphics, being, as Sir G.
                    Wilkinson supposes, the name of the inhabitant. Larger houses are supposed to
                    have had two courts—the outer, in which to receive vistors, the inner for the
                    females of the family. Smaller houses, particularly in the country, had a
                    similar court, with granaries and store-rooms below, and living apartments
                    above, like those of the modern Fellah in Egypt, or the small <hi rend="italic"
                    >vigna</hi> houses in Italy. The roofs seem to have been flat, like those of the
                    modern Egyptians; and the houses appear, from a painting found at Thebes, to
                    have been ventilated in the same way as at present, by the contrivance called a
                    <hi rend="italic">mulkuf,</hi> or wind-shaft, over which are two screens, like
                    large square fans back to back, bending forward each way to catch any air that
                    may chance to be stirring, and direct it down the shaft into the house.</p>
                <p>Although we have only ruins to guide us (for no man living has seen an Egyptian
                    temple as it appeared to the old Egyptians), yet we can gather that to the
                    Egyptians we owe the earliest examples of columnar architecture, and at the same
                    time that they had not got beyond the rudiments of it. The stable effect of
                    their massive columns disappears when we notice that scarcely any, except those
                    of very recent date, have the wide-spreading base which we know so well in every
                    other style; that the massiveness of the column is in fact wasted, as the lower
                    part is rounded off and cut away so as to render {th of it simply useless; and
                    that the bold projecting capital carries no weight, and adds nothing to the
                    strength of the stone beam above it, for that beam rests on a small block of
                    stone <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the capital, borrowing no strength whatever
                    from it. It will also have been noticed, that nearly every Egyptian work is
                    rectangular in plan, and that in exceptional cases, as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the buildings at Philae, Kalabsche, and Luxor, no attempt has been
                    made to soften down the harshness of the lines. With the elevation it was the
                    same. The square was never changed into the circle or the octagon. Nearly every
                    form is bounded by the rectangle, and the only varieties found in the grandest
                    of the buildings in Egypt are the slope of the massive pylon and the tapering
                    obelisk. The minaret and the dome, which give such charming variety of outline,
                    and the varied mouldings, without which it now seems to us that no building
                    could be perfect, were unknown to the Egyptians.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One example, apparently, of a cupola occurs
                    in a painting at Ba yr el Bahree (Thebes), but no trace of an actually built
                    cupola exists.</p></note> But of all things, the neglect of the arch is the most
                    curious. Crude brick arches are found at least as early as the 16th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and others have been found of the same date, it is
                    thought, as the pyramids. Yet the Egyptians of later times systematically
                    employed enormous stones for their coverings and lintels, and left the arch
                    unused. We must remember, in justice to the Egyptians, that their efforts in art
                    were fettered, to an extent which we are perhaps unable to appreciate, by the
                    restrictions imposed upon them by conventionalities connected with their
                    religion. That they were so fettered in sculpture at least is abundantly clear
                    from many examples. The freedom which characterises one of their earliest
                    statues, that of King Chephren, the exquisitely bold yet delicately graceful
                    sculptures in the Serapeum and in the tomb of Tih at Sakkara, and other
                    examples, show clearly that the Egyptians had a power for design and execution
                    which only such a cause as that referred to above could have suppressed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jewish Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>The long sojourn of the Jews in Egypt, and the fact that their chief employment
                    there seems to have been the manufacture of bricks, must have made them
                    acquainted with the architecture of that country. On the conquest of Canaan, the
                    Israelites seem to have taken possession of the dwellings of the vanquished
                    people; and we have no record of any important building constructed by the Jews
                    till the days of Solomon. The piety of this prince seems to have induced him to
                    carry out his father’s wishes with regard to the*temple, but at so low an ebb
                    was the art of building that the Jews did not even know how to hew timber
                    properly (1 Kings V. 6). The king therefore applied to Hiram, king of Tyre, with
                    whom he was on friendly terms, and that monarch sent an architect and staff of
                    skilled workmen. Materials were collected for the building, and careful accounts
                    of the whole work are given in the books of Kings and of Chronicles.</p>
                <p>The early temple is described (1 Kings vi. vii.) as a building of stone, roofed
                    and floored with cedar. It appears to have been rectangular, with a single roof,
                    and divided into two parts by a wall. It was 60 cubits<note anchored="true"

                    36 feet, and 55 feet high. In front was a porch the same width as the temple (20
                    cubits), but only 10 cubits in depth.</p>
                <p>Round the house—which, of course, must mean on three sides only, as the porch
                    occupied the front—were the priests’ chambers, in three stories, one over the
                    other, the lowest 5 cubits broad, the middle 6, and the upper 7,—a passage which
                    has puzzled most commentators, but which will be considered presently. On the
                    right side was a winding-stair leading to the upper stories of chambers. The
                    walls of the house, as well as the ceiling, were lined with boards of cedar. The
                    joists of the floor seem also to have been of cedar; but the floor itself was of
                    planks of fir. The cedar was carved with “knops” and open flowers.</p>
                <p>The house was, as has been said above, divided crossways into two parts—the outer
                    temple and the oracle, or Holy of Hohes. The one was 40 cubits long, by 20
                    broad; the other was 20 cubits square. The oracle had doors and door-posts of
                    olive-wood. The temple door-frames were of olive, and the doors of fir, a∏ being
                    hung folding. Both doors were carved with cherubim, palm trees, and open
                    flowers. The entire fabric, even the floors, were gilt —“overlaid with gold.”
                    The account in the Second Book of Chronicles (ch. iii iv. Ac.) is substantially
                    the same, except (a difference easily to be accounted for) that it describes the
                    greater house, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the outer temple, as ceiled with fir
                    tree; and we gather also from the description, that the whole was roofed with
                    tiles of gold: the nails were also of gold, and weighed 50 shekels. At the door
                    of the porch were two columns of bronze, or “pillars of brass,” each IS <pb

                    about 7 feet in diameter. They had capitals (chapiters) also of molten brass,
                    five cubits high, decorated with lily work, chain work, and pomegranates. In
                    front of the porch was the altar, surmounted by a low wall three courses of
                    stones in height. The whole building was enclosed by a walled court, called the
                    inner court, or that of the priests. In front of this was another, called the
                    lower court; and the whole of this area was enclosed by a circumscribed court
                    going round the whole of the other courts and buildings; and this was called the
                    outer court, or that of the Gentiles. It will be noted that in the careful
                    description of the pillars, &lt;fcc., no mention is made either of base or of
                    moulded cornice.</p>
                <p>Canina <hi rend="italic">(Tempio di Gerusalemme,</hi> Rome, fo.) conceives the
                    style of the building to have been Egyptian; that the temple was lighted like
                    the hypostyle halls, by a range of windows over the roofs of the cells or
                    priests’ chambers; that these windows were like those of the clerestory of a
                    church splayed at the bottom and sides; that the walls of the temple itself
                    sloped towards the top on the outside, or, to use the technical language, were
                    built “battering,” while the walls of the priests’ chambers were built
                    perpendicular, and for this reason each story measured a cubit more than the
                    room below. He also supposed that the capitals of the columns, which are
                    described as of lily work, were in fact the lotus (water lily) capital of Egypt.
                    The porch itself he considers to have been like the propylon, containing other
                    chambers like those of Egypt.</p>
                <p>Mr Fergusson’s restoration, as given both in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Architecture</hi> and more at length in Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of
                    the Bible,</hi> is different. He assumes that the plan was somewhat analogous to
                    that of the still existing building known as the palace or temple of Darius at
                    Persepolis, which has a range of chambers on each side. The difficulty as to the
                    upper chamber being wider than the lower he solves in a very satisfactory way,
                    by supposing that there was a set-off in each story on which the flooring just
                    rested, so as not to cut into the walls of temple.</p>
                <p>In the prophecy of Ezekiel (ch. xl. <hi rend="italic">sqqf)</hi> we have a very
                    full and interesting account of what the temple was in his time. The house
                    itself and the oracle do not appear to have been altered, but the old courts
                    seem to have been swept away and succeeded by vast atria, and a mass of halls
                    and chambers.</p>
                <p>In the time of Cyrus the temple was rebuilt, but this second temple was
                    demolished by Herod, who constructed a new one of the same dimensions as that of
                    Solomon. The outer house was 40 cubits long, and the Holy of Holies 20 cubits;
                    but it was nearly double the height of the first temple. The porch also, instead
                    of being the width of the house, 20 cubits, was 100 cubits long and 100 high,
                    crossing the temple in the form of a T, and forming a magnificent façade much
                    longer than that of St Paul’s in London. Round the house were three stories of
                    priests’ chambers. The court had three entrances on each side, which were called
                    respectively the water-gates, the fire-gates, and the oblation-gates. But the
                    peculiar difference between Herod’s temple and the earlier building was that
                    there was, in front of the court last described, another of about the same size,
                    surrounded by a colonnade and chambers, which was the place set apart for the
                    women. These courts were surrounded by an outer court, having a species of
                    cloister on the north, east, and west sides, composed of a double row of
                    columns. On the south side was a similar construction a furlong in length. It
                    consisted of three rows of columns, forming with the outer wall, three
                    aisles—the two outer being 30 feet wide and 50 feet high; the centre being 45
                    feet wide and 100 feet high—no doubt with a species of clerestory. These columns
                    are described to have been so large that it took three men with extended arms to
                    span their circumference. The outer court was elevated six steps above the
                    basement level; the inner courts stood on a sort of plateau, with retaining
                    walls and parapets round it, which was ascended by fourteen steps; this was on
                    the level of the women’s court. Between this and the inner court was a gate
                    called that of Nicanor, in front of which was a semicircular flight of fifteen
                    steps. The temple itself was entered by a flight of twelve steps, so that its
                    floor must have been between 20 and 30 feet above the ground-level of the
                    surrounding city. The whole was built of the most beautiful white marble.</p>
                <p>We read in the First Eook of Kings (vii. 2, 8), that Solomon built “the house of
                    the forest of Lebanon,” “his house where he dwelt,” and “a house for Pharaoh’s
                    daughter.” Some have supposed these to have been three distinct palaces, but
                    Canina considers them as all connected, and as three parts of one large
                    structure. The house of the forest of Lebanon—so called, in all probability,
                    from the cedar of which it was constructed— is described as being 100 cubits
                    long, 50 wide, and 30 high (180 feet by 90 by 54). Its horizontal area was thus
                    very nearly equal to that of Westminster Halt It had four rows of cedar pillars,
                    or, as the Vulgate more correctly renders it, four corridors <hi rend="italic"
                    >(deambulacra}</hi> formed by three rows of cedar columns, fifteen in each, or
                    forty-five in all, with cedar architraves, and covered with cedar. This Canina
                    restores as an Egyptian hall, lighted, as described by Vitruvius, with a portico
                    in front, of 50 cubits by 30. The great hall, he supposes, led on one side to
                    the palace occupied by the king, in which was the hall of judgment and the
                    throne, and on the other side, to the queen’s palace and the women’s apartments,
                    or, as it has been called in later times, the harem. The porticoes and hall seem
                    to have been of cedar, but the houses were “of costly stones” (1 Kings vii.
                    9).</p>
                <p>The excavations recently made, at the expense of tho Palestine Exploration Fund,
                    have disclosed considerable remains of the massive ancient masonry, and of the
                    cisterns, conduits, &amp;c. But, with these exceptions, no part of old Jerusalem
                    appears to be extant. There are, however, some objects, formerly considered to
                    belong to Jewish times, that should be mentioned. There are, first, what are
                    called the tombs of the kings of Judah. These are a number of sepulchral
                    chambers hewn out of the solid rock, and containing sarcophagi They vary from 10
                    to 20 feet square, and are entered, exactly like the tombs of Beni Hassan, by a
                    portico <hi rend="italic">in antis,</hi> about 40 feet wide. There are two
                    columns and two pilasters in front, of Greek Doric character, about 13 feet
                    high. The most curious feature of these is, that a broad band, about 3 feet
                    wide, richly sculptured with foliages, runs down on each side 4 or 5 feet and
                    over the columns horizontally. Above this last, quite independent of the lower
                    construction, is a regular Doric architrave and frieze, of a character between
                    Grecian and Roman; this is ornamented with triglyphs, paterae, and foliage. In
                    front of the portico is a large court-yard, about 100 feet square.</p>
                <p>In the Valley of Jehoshaphat, near Jerusalem, are three extremely curious relics;
                    two stand alone, on platforms excavated from the rock, and the third is scarped
                    into the rock itself. The first is called the tomb of Absalom. It is a square
                    building with a solid wall, in which are engaged Ionic columns, about 13 feet
                    high; over this is a Doric entablature with triglyphs, and an altar, surmounted
                    by a very curious sort of hollow-sided cupola of trumpet-mouth section, and a
                    terminal. The whole, including the flight of steps, is about 60 feet high.</p>
                <p>Another similar building, of about the same size, is commonly<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0417-0394"/> called the tomb of the prophet Zechariah. This is
                    surmounted by a simple pyramidal roof. Beneath it is a handsome doorway leading
                    to a sepulchral chamber. Over the ordinary classic entablature is the regular
                    Egyptian cornice or torus, surmounted by a bold quarter hollow and fillet
                    exactly like those on the propylons of Egypt, which have been already
                    described.</p>
                <p>The third building is entirely rock-cut, and consists of a large façade, about 90
                    feet wide and 100 feet high. This is reported to be the place to which the
                    apostles retired before the siege of Jerusalem. Below is a plain face, about 45
                    feet high, on each side of which are wings with two pilasters, both running up
                    to the top of the building. Between these is a species of portico, about 40 feet
                    wide, with columns and pilasters, of nearly pure Grecian Doric. There are also
                    several other rock-cut tombs or sepulchres scattered about in the neighbourhood
                    of Jerusalem, but none of them possess much architectural interest. One is
                    called the sepulchre of Jehoshaphat.</p>
                <p>From the character of the architecture it is incredible that these buildings can
                    have anything like the age ascribed to them. The Ionic capitals are evidently
                    Roman, and therefore cannot date earlier than the conquests by that people;
                    probably they are of the time of Herod; while the Egyptian cornices show that
                    the traditional ornaments of that people had not been entirely forgotten.
                    Besides this, the general plan of a temple, <hi rend="italic">in antis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> scarped into a rock, so entirely resembles the
                    work at Beni Hassan, that it is impossible to deny that these very interesting
                    remains strongly corroborate the views of Canina, that the architecture of the
                    early temples was at least based on the architecture of the Egyptians.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Indian Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>Considerable light has been recently thrown upon the history of architecture in
                    the East. The traditions as to the extremely remote antiquity of the rock-cut
                    temples, the caves of EUora, and the wonderful pagodas, have disappeared before
                    the searching eye of critical investigation. In the time of Herodotus the
                    Persians had no temples; and even in that of Tacitus, the great Indo-Germanic
                    races “would not confine their gods within walls.” The early religion, which
                    appears in the Vedas, was Brahminism, but in the 6th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the first of the Buddhas seems to have commenced a
                    perversion of the ancient faith. The struggle appears to have gone on for years,
                    till three-quarters of a century after the time of Alexander the Great, about
                    250 years before the Christian era, when a powerful ruler named Asoka, a
                    grandson of Chandragupta, who is supposed to be the Sandracottus of the Greek
                    writers, abjured Brahminism, and made Buddhism the religion of the state.
                    Certain <hi rend="italic">Lots,</hi> or pillars, erected by him, and inscribed
                    with his edicts, are the earliest extant architectural remains of India.</p>
                <p>The Buddhist topes are supposed to have been erected at first to commemorate some
                    event, or to show that the spot was sacred; but after a time they were employed
                    to contain relics, such as the tooth or collar-bone of one of the Buddhas. The
                    relics seem in some cases to bave been preserved in a sort of box or case at the
                    top of the tope, called a <hi rend="italic">tee;</hi> in others, in regular
                    relic chambers. Where there were relics, the place was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >dagoba,</hi> or relic shrine, of which, perhaps, our term pagoda is a
                    corruption. A great number of these topes were built in the form of large
                    towers, others in the form of hemispheres. One of these, the Sanchi tope, is
                    described and figured by Mr Fergusson. The diameter is 106 feet. It has a
                    curious species of gate entrance, and is surrounded by a stone fence. Others are
                    partly cylindrical, and are finished with either a flat circle, or pointed
                    terminals like a dome at the top. A fine example has recently been discovered at
                    Bharhut by General Cunningham.</p>
                <p>Of the next two classes of Buddhist architecture, the temples (Chaityas) and
                    monasteries (Viharas), no <hi rend="italic">built</hi> examples exist in India.
                    They are, in fact, rock-cut caves. At least one thousand temples are
                    known—one-tenth probably Brahminical or Jain, the rest Buddhist They are said to
                    form an uninterrupted series, from the first, in Behar, by the grandson of
                    Asoka, 200 years before Christ, to those at EUora, which, instead of being of an
                    almost diluvian antiquity, as has generally been reported, have been proved to

                    of Indra-dyumna, as late as the 12th century. One of these cave-temples at
                    Karli, near Bombay, presents exactly the features of a Roman basilica, or early
                    Christian church. It has a circular end or apse, and is divided into three
                    aisles by two rows of columns. Others are simple square buildings, with a
                    circular or oval chamber at the end entered by a small door. The monasteries,
                    which exceed the temples in number, seem generally to have been square caves

                <p>by pillars of the natural rock left in their places, and surrounded by a number
                    of small sleeping-places or cells.</p>
                <p>The most wonderful excavations are those at Ellora, near Aurangabad. These are a
                    series of hypogea or caves sunk in the solid rock, extending a distance of 3 or
                    4 miles. Canina has given plans and interior views of six of them. Those called
                    Parasova Rama and Diajannata are simply halls supported on massive piers with
                    level architraves. The piers are richly carved with figures and friezes, and
                    have a sort of cushion capitals, and square abaci, and stand round, forming a
                    kind of atrium. That called Indra has a court open to the sky, in which is a
                    small shrine or temple. In the solid rock are two halls similar to those above
                    described, a larger and smaller. The piers of the Tin Tai are quite plain. In
                    the Viswakarma is a quadrangle, open to the sky and surrounded by pillars. This
                    leads into an atrium with three aisles and an apse, and exactly like a basilican
                    church. The most magnificent of the Ellora caves, and indeed of the native Hindu
                    works, are the chambers and halls called the Kylas, or Kailasa. These are sunk
                    into the rock, and occupy a space of 270 feet deep and 150 feet wide. The roofs
                    are solid rock, supported by pillars, or rest on the walls, or on the divisions
                    of the assemblage of chambers. There is a porch, on each side of which are two
                    columns. This conducts into a hall, supported on 1G such columns, and leading
                    into a sort of adytum. Round this is passage space and five chambers. The whole
                    forms a temple, with its usual appendages, just such a one as would be built on
                    the ground, and round this a wide open space, with a colonnade or cloister
                    encircling the whole. Great part is open to the sky, for the sake of light and
                    air, but the work is entirely cut out of the solid rock.</p>
                <p>The date of the construction of the Kylas is about 1000 A.D.</p>
                <p>The earliest existing work of the Jains seems to be of the 10th century. They
                    were a sect which arose in the endeavour to re-establish Brahminism, and which
                    first seems to have acquired importance about 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    This sect rejects the doctrines of Buddhism, as also the practice of
                    monasticism. The famous temple at Somnauth belongs to them. Mr Fergusson has
                    given a description of that built by Vimala Sah, on Mount Abu, as a type of the
                    ordinary Jain temple. In the centre is a cell in which is a cross-legged figure
                    of one of the twenty-four saints worshipped by this sect; in this case it is
                    that of Parswanath. The cell is always terminated by a pyramidal roof. In front
                    of this is a portico of 48 pillars, disposed much like a cruciform church with a
                    dome at the intersection of the transepts. The whole is surrounded by a species
                    of cloister formed by double rows of columns, and a series of small chambers
                    like the cells of a <hi rend="italic">vihara.</hi> But as the sect abjure
                    monasticism, each cell is used not as a dwelling, but as a kind of small chapel,
                    and contains one of their cross-legged deities. One of the peculiarities of this
                    style is that richly-carved brackets spring from the pillars at about two-thirds
                    of their height, and extend to the architraves, forming a sort of diagonal strut
                    to strengthen and support them.</p>
                <p>The Jains probably adopted the dome at a very early period, and it is doubtful
                    whether the Buddhists ever used this species of construction. “No tope,” Mr
                    Fergusson observes, “has the smallest trace of such a structure, though of
                    domical shape outside, and the design of the rock-cut temples, with the upright
                    supports, the raking struts, and the level architraves, has manifestly been
                    deduced from timber construction.” The Indian dome has no voussoirs radiating
                    from the centre, as in European architecture. The courses are all horizontal;
                    and the domes are therefore necessarily pointed in section, for they would not
                    stand if circular. The Indian dome, however, has this merit, it requires no
                    abutments, and has no lateral thrust. The pressure is entirely vertical; and if
                    the foundation be sound, and the pillars stout enough, there can be no
                    failure.</p>
                <p>The leading idea of the plan of the Jain temple is that of a number of columns
                    arranged in squares. Wherever it was intended to have a dome, pillars were
                    omitted, so as to leave spaces in the form of octagons. By corbelling over the
                    pendentives in level courses the dome was gradually formed. The plan and view of
                    the temple at Sadree <pb break="no"

                    It has the great number of 20 domes, varying from 36 feet to 24 feet in
                    diameter, and supported by 420 columns.</p>
                <p>Like most architectural peoples, the Jains were also fond of tower-building. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Jay a Sthamba,</hi> a tower of victory erected by Khumbo Rana,
                    to commemorate the defeat of Mohammed of Malwa, in 1439, is nine stories high,
                    the two topmost stories being open. The general outline is not unlike that of an
                    Italian campanile, with pilasters at the angles, and an overhanging corbelled
                    top. It is richly ornamented from bottom to apex, and affords a very favourable
                    idea of Indian art.</p>
                <p>Hindu architecture has been divided into that of the Aryan or Sanscrit races of
                    North India, that of the South or of the Tamul races, and that prevalent in the
                    Panjab and Cashmere. Of the first and last we have compara tively little
                    knowledge, but South Hindu work is treated of at great length by Râm Râz,<note

                    700 feet, is from his work on</p>
                <p>Hindu Architecture. The remains of the buildings are numerous, as the Tamul races
                    were perhaps the greatest temple builders in the world; and the whole subject
                    has been so well elucidated by the author last referred to, that its principles
                    may be considered to be clearly ascertained and settled. The great pagoda at
                    Tanjore (fig. 32), by far the grandest temple in India, resting on a base 83
                    feet square, rises in fourteen stories to a height of nearly 200 feet. The
                    interior represented in fig. 33 —a hall in the palace at Madura—illustrates a
                    comparatively recent style.</p>
                <p>The architecture of the north-east is known chiefly from the drawings in Vigne's

                    Martund (fig. 34), reduced from the latter work by Mr Fergusson, shows a
                    cloistered court surrounded by pillars and cells, and entered by a porch. In the
                    middle of this is a temple with a species of <hi rend="italic">naos</hi> and <hi

                    with acute pediments over them shaped very much like Gothic gablets, and
                    containing trefoil arches. A similar feature occurs (fig. 35) at Pandrethan, in
                    a temple built about 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> or 250 years later
                    than Martund. It seems by no means improbable that these pointed domes, <pb

                    affected the architecture of the Saracens.</p>
                <p>Of the style of North India Mr Fergusson gives remarkable, and by no means
                    elegant, examples; as the Black Pagoda at Kannaruc, and temples at Ba-rolli and
                    at Benares. The chief features are a sort of entrance porch, sometimes walled
                    and sometimes carried on pillars, called the nuptial hall, leading into a great
                    pagoda, square in plan, and finishing with a sort of tub-shaped dome. The
                    ornamentation is profuse, so much so as to detract from the greatness of the
                    design. There are no buildings in this style anterior to the Mahometan conquest.
                    The date assigned to the temple of Jugemath is 1198, and to the Black Pagoda,

                <p>The pagoda forms a very prominent feature in the architecture of Further India. A

                <p>Assyria and Babylonia or Chaldea may be shortly defined as the countries watered
                    by the Euphrates and Tigris, lying between Armenia and the Arabian desert, and
                    reaching down to the Persian Gulf.</p>
                <p>The capital, Ninus or Nineveh, was taken by the Medes under Cyaxares, and some
                    200 years after Xenophon passed over its site, then mere mounds of earth. It
                    remained buried until 1845, when Botta and Layard discovered the ruins of the
                    Assyrian cities. The principal remains are those of Khorsabad, 10 miles N.E. of
                    Mosul; of Nimroud, supposed to be the ancient Calah; and of Kouyunjik, in all
                    probability the ancient Nineveh. In these cities are found fragments of several
                    great buildings which seem to have been palace-temples. They were constructed
                    chiefly of sun-dried bricks, and all that remains of them is the lower part of
                    the walls, decorated with sculpture and paintings, portions of the pavements, a
                    few indications of the elevation, and some interesting works connected with the
                    drainage, Ac.</p>
                <p>The structures were built usually on artificial mounds, and approached, it is
                    supposed, by great flights of steps (of which remains composed of black basalt
                    have been found at Khorsabad). They consist of series of halls and chambers of
                    no great size, the largest hall in Sennacherib’s palace at Kouyunjik being only
                    200 feet by 45 feet, whereas Westminster Hall is 268 feet by 68 feet. In their
                    proportions they are utterly unlike Egyptian structures, and they display the
                    striking peculiarity of being elongated beyond anything known in other styles of
                    architecture; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> one of the Kouyunjik halls is 122
                    feet long by 27 wide, another is 218 feet long by 25 wide. The great hall at
                    Nimroud, though 162 feet by 62, was divided lengthwise in the centre by a wall
                    12 feet thick, leaving each side only 25 feet wide. Another peculiarity of these
                    structures is the immense thicknes3 of the walls. Those of the Kouyunjik hall
                    (27 feet wide) were 15 feet thick, and those of Nimroud (32 feet wide) were 26
                    feet thick. It has, indeed, been reckoned by Mr Fergusson, that in some of the
                    palaces the area of the walls is as great as that of the chambers. The reason he
                    suggests for this is that these thick walls supported a double row of columns as
                    a clerestory under the roof, so arranged as to give light and air, while
                    excluding the rays of the sun. He covers the halls with flat roofs, supported on
                    columns, which being of wood have rotted or been burnt. An entirely different
                    theory is that of Μ. Flandin, who studied the subject on the spot. He believes
                    that the halls were vaultçd <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n421/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0421-0398"/> and had small windows at the springing. Μ. Victor
                    Place has found at Khorsabad several vaults, and also terra cotta tubes, through
                    which he believes that the vaults were lighted, just as domes were in Persia in
                    later times. But no vault has been found large enough to span any of the wide
                    Assyrian halls. Of their elevations there are few traces remaining. At Nimroud,
                    what is supposed to be the tomb of Sardanapalus has its lower part, Λvhich is
                    about 20 feet high, of solid masonry, and the rest of burnt bricks. It has
                    slightly projecting piers, but no ornaments or mouldings. At Khorsabad and the
                    S.E. palace of Nimroud there is some attempt at decoration, by rude
                    semi-columns, without capitals or bases, arranged in clusters of seven, side by
                    side, the groups being separated by recesses. A few detached pieces of moulding
                    have been found at Khorsabad, but of the very simplest kind, and we have no
                    vestiges of capital or entablature. Were our knowledge limited to these and a
                    few similar remains, we should have to form but a poor idea of Assyrian art. But
                    the sculptures have revealed to us a degree of refinement which had been
                    previously looked for only in Greece. These sculptures lined the sides of the
                    halls to a height of 10 feet. In them we see columns with both base and capital,
                    and surmounted by entablatures. Sometimes the columns are combined with
                    pilasters, as in the Greek porticos <hi rend="italic">in antis.</hi> In one
                    specimen the columns were carried on the backs of bulls, as is shown by one of
                    the bas-reliefs, and, more conclusively still, by the beautiful small model of a
                    winged bull brought to England By Mr George Smith, which has carved upon its
                    back a base, just as is shown on the slabs.</p>
                <p>In these bas-reliefs we have further—1. The façade of a palace, having at top a
                    grand row of window openings divided by Ionic columns; 2. A small building on
                    the banks of a river, having two columns with bases and a kind of Ionic capital,
                    between two plain pilasters, and with rude indications of a cornice; 3. Another
                    façade of two columns, with bases, and Corinthian capitals, between two
                    pilasters, likewise with capitals. Over these is an entablature, somewhat rudely
                    worked, but clearly showing architrave, frieze, and cornice, and antefixae over.
                    The latest of these slabs must have been carved many years before the earliest
                    date assigned to any known Greek work. In view of these and similar remains the
                    following words of Niebuhr are memorable :—“There is a want in Grecian art which
                    no man living can supply. There is not enough in Egypt to account for the
                    peculiar art and mythology of Greece. But those who live after me will see on
                    the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates the origin of Grecian mythology and
                    art.”</p>
                <p>The plans of all the Assyrian buildings are rectangular, and we know that long
                    ago, as now, the Eastern architects used this outline almost invariably, and
                    upon it reared some of the most lovely and varied forms ever devised. They
                    gather over the angles by graceful curves, and on the basis of an ordinary
                    square hall carry up a minaret or a dome, an octagon or a circle. That this was
                    sometimes done in Assyria is shown by the sculptures. Slabs from Kouyunjik show
                    domes of varied form, and tower-like structures, each rising from a square base.
                    The resemblance between the ancient form of the dome and those still used in the
                    Assyrian villages is very striking. Whether sloping roofs were used is
                    uncertain. Mr Bonomi believes that they were, and a few sculptures seem to
                    support his view. Of the private houses nothing, of course, remains; but they
                    are represented on the slabs as being of several stories in height, the ground
                    floor as usual having only a door and no windows. All have flat roofs, and we
                    gather from one of the bas-reliefs, which represents a town on fire, that these
                    roofs were made, just aβ they now are, with thick layers of earth on strong
                    beams. These roofs are well-nigh fire proof, and the flames are represented as
                    stopped by them, and coming out of the windows. No remains of a window, or, so
                    far as we are aware, of an internal staircase, have been found.</p>
                <p>Of the fortifications we know much more. In the north wall of Nimroud fifty-eight
                    towers have been traced, and at Kouyunjik there are large remains of three
                    walls, the lower part being of stone, and the upper of sun-dried bricks. At
                    Khorsabad there are the remains of a wall, still 40 feet high, built of blocks
                    of stone 3 to 4 feet thick, and the evidences wanting as to the finishing of
                    these is completely supplied by the sculptures, which show an extraordinary
                    resemblance to mediaeval works of the same class. Tier upon tier of walls are
                    represented, enclosing a great tower or keep in the centre. The entrances are
                    great arched gateways flanked by square towers. These and the other towers have
                    overhanging parapets just like the mediaeval machicolations, and are finished at
                    top with battlements, remains of which have been found at Nimroud and Kouyunjik,
                    and at Kaleh Shergat, the supposed capital of Assyria before Nineveh.</p>
                <p>Of temples distinct from the palace we have a few supposed remains, but little is
                    absolutely known as to their general form.</p>
                <p>But in Chaldea there are some enormous masses of ruins, evidently remains of the
                    vast mounds which formed the substructure of their temples. The grandest of all
                    these and the most interesting is the Birs Nimroud, near Babylon, w <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> hich has been identified as the temple of the Seven
                    Spheres at Borsippa. This was reconstructed by Nebuchadnezzar, as appears by a w
                    ell-known inscription. Another example is at Mugeyer, which was 198 feet by 133
                    feet at the base, and is even now 70 feet high, and it is clear that both it and
                    the Birs were built with diminishing stages, presenting a series of grand
                    platforms, decreasing in length as they ascended, and leaving a comparatively
                    small one at top for the temple cell. This has been found, it is supposed, at
                    the Birs Nimroud, of vitrified brick.</p>
                <p>The most interesting parts of the Assyrian edifices are the finishings. The
                    pavements were sometimes of sun-dried bricks, at other times of baked bricks, or
                    of alabaster slabs laid in bitumen. At Khorsabad there was one in a single block
                    13 feet square, and 3 ft 11 in. thick, and at the Nimroud temple there were two
                    slabs, one 19 ft. 6 in. by 12 feet, and the other 21 feet by 16 feet, and 1 ft.
                    1 in. thick, both sides covered with inscriptions. Of ornamental pavements there
                    are admirable examples from Kouyunjik at the British Museum, and from Khorsabad
                    at the Louvre, both covered with delicate carving in alabaster of nearly the
                    same pattern. It is difficult to conceive how such delicate work could have been
                    used as paving, and still retain its beautiful sharpness; for it was not filled
                    in to protect the pattern. Directly above the pavement came the sculptured
                    slabs, which are so numerous that at Kouyunjik alone there are some 2 miles in
                    length of them. They are generally about 10 feet high from the ground, and are
                    carved in alabaster. Many of them show traces of having been decorated with
                    colours. Connected with these sculptures were the great winged animals which
                    stand one on each side of the portals of the palaces. Some of the grandest have
                    the body and legs of a bull, with an enormous pair of wings projecting from the
                    shoulders, high over their backs, and covering the breast. They have human
                    heads, bull’s ears with large ear-rings, and horns, winding from the brows
                    upwards, and encircling a coronet of leaves, bound by a fillet of roses. They
                    stood in pairs on each side of the palace doorways, and it is thought by some
                    that generally there were no doors or lintels, all being open to the roof and
                    enclosed with curtains. But doors were sometimes used, as the places or <pb

                    have been found; and Mr Smith has discovered a doorway with its actual lintel,
                    now in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>Above the sculptured slabs decorations have been found of various kinds. The most
                    lasting seem to have been of baked bricks richly coloured and glazed. At the
                    city gate of Khorsabad blue glazed tiles with yellow reliefs have been found.
                    Victor Place found also that the lower part of the walls near the gate were
                    faced with coloured enamelled bricks, having human figures, lions, &lt;tc.,
                    within an ornamental border. The arch over the gateway was also richly decorated
                    with glazed tiles. Large remains of coloured decoration in plaster have also
                    been found at Nimroud, &amp;c. They were of figures outlined in black on a blue
                    ground, and below the outer coat of plaster more extensive decorations have been
                    found on an earlier coat. They were of various colours on a pale yellow ground.
                    In other cases they had merely a black outline and were uncoloured. Now the
                    difference of age between the several structures is some centuries, and it is
                    curious to find that the earliest art works, viz., those in the N.W. palace, are
                    the best in point of variety of detail and ornament, in severity of style and
                    purity of outline. The later have extreme delicacy and minuteness, truth to
                    nature and vigour of treatment, particularly in the animals, but they want, in
                    the opinion of Mr Layard, the vigour of the old decorations. Of external
                    decorations we have a striking account in the inscription relating to the Birs
                    Nimroud, in which the several stages are described as being coloured as
                    follows:—the lowest, black; the others in succession, orange, red, yellow,
                    green, and blue. This vivid colouring may be explained by a discovery made by Mr
                    Loftus at Warka of a wall which was richly decorated in geometrical patterns by
                    means of small earthenware cones, the wide ends outwards and en amelled in
                    different colours; also by Victor Place’s discovery at Khorsabad of four stages
                    of a temple coloured in succession white, black, red, and blue.</p>
                <p>In the Assyrian and Chaldean buildings little use was made of marble, granite, or
                    stone, the greater part of the edifices being built with bricks,—the lower parts
                    with burnt bricks put together with bitumen, and the rest with crude bricks and
                    slime. Sometimes the walls were faced with burnt bricks. One wall has been found
                    with 10 feet in thickness of burnt brick facing, and 28 feet of crude
                    bricking,</p>
                <p>In Assyrian art generally there is little analogy to that of</p>
                <p>Egypt. There is some slight resemblance in the mouldings and in a few of the
                    ornaments, but in Assyria there are no forests of columns, no grand pylons, no
                    enormous cloistered court, and nothing to equal the gigantic pyramids or tombs
                    of Egypt. The sphinx is superseded by the winged bull, and the slightly cut
                    intaglio by the magnificently sculptured slab. In these early Assyrian
                    structures there is art at a high stage of perfection, but we have no means of
                    discovering the steps by which it was attained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Persian Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>Persia was one of the greatest of ancient nations. <hi rend="italic">A.t</hi> one
                    time it embraced all Upper Asia, and Asia Minor, Phoenicia, Egypt, Thrace, and
                    Macedonia, and though the greatness of its glory has departed, it was still a
                    great living nation even in the 18th century when its king Nadir Shah invaded
                    India. Compared thus with Egypt, Assyria, and Babylonia, long since extinct, it
                    has had a wonderful existence, reaching down from Cyrus to our own time.</p>
                <p>We know little of its early history. It cannot be doubted, that long before the
                    rise of the Persian power, mighty kingdoms existed in these regions, and
                    particularly in the eastern part of Bactria, yet of those kingdoms we have by no
                    means a consistent or chronological history— nothing but a few fragments. It is
                    probable that from dynasties which ruled in Media properly so called,
                    immediately previous to the Persians, the style of architecture may have been in
                    some measure derived, though indeed we know of no remains of earlier date than
                    those which are properly called Persian.</p>
                <p>Of the early times of the empire no authentic remains exist, except those of the
                    tomb of its founder, Cyrus, at Murgab or Pasargadae (east of the head of the
                    Persian Gulf), and some of the walls, &amp;c., of the ancient capital, Ecbatana,
                    in North Media. The former is still in a wonderful state of preservation, but it
                    can scarcely be reckoned amongst Persian edifices, as it is clearly a work
                    designed by some architect from a Greek colony of Asia Minor. The tomb stands on
                    seven bold steps of white marble, the lowest being 43 feet by 37 feet. The tomb
                    itself is 21 feet by 16 ft. 5 in. outside, with bold mouldings to the door; it
                    has a sloping roof of marble, with a pediment at each end, enriched with
                    mouldings. The chamber itself is only 7 feet by 10, the walls being built up
                    with thick blocks of marble. Near the tomb was the famous inscription, “I am
                    Cyrus the king, the Achaemenian,” and though this is now wanting, recent
                    discoveries seem to have disinterred the stone which had borne it, and which had
                    been torn away. Round the tomb outside had evidently been a colonnade of 24
                    columns, fragments of which, with the bases, alone remain. They resemble those
                    commonly used by the Greeks. This singular structure seems to have been unique
                    in Persia. It is evidently the work of a foreigner, although the outline may
                    represent, as is supposed, a temple. The famous walls of Ecbatana, the ancient
                    capital, are said to have been 75 feet broad and 105 high, its stones 9 feet by
                    4 ft. 6 in., and its gateways 100 feet high and 60 wide. The remains, however,
                    show walls only 12 feet wide, stones only 2 feet by 1 ft. 2 in., and a gateway
                    only 12 feet high and 10 feet wide. They deserve particular mention on account
                    of their being among the earliest examples of constructive colouring on a grand
                    scale. The walls are said to have been seven in number, one over the other on
                    the sides of a conical hill, and coloured in succession, white, black, scarlet,
                    blue, orange, silver, and the innermost gilt. From what has been discovered at
                    Warka (see above), it is possible that this gorgeous description may have been
                    founded on fact; and we know that the Easterns in early times were profuse in
                    their employment of glazed coloured bricks.</p>

                <p>Of the domestic structures of the same early time we have no remains, but it
                    would appear that the grander buildings had courts, surrounded by colonnades,
                    somewhat in the Egyptian style, the columns and beams being of wood, coloured,
                    and sometimes gilt, or coated with metal. Above was a sloping roof. We learn
                    particularly from this that the Persian or Median architects were thoroughly
                    well used to a wooden construction.</p>
                <p>Some 50 years after Cyrus, the chief buildings at Persepolis and Susa were
                    constructed; large portions still remain, and form some of the grandest ruins in
                    existence. Of these we have measured drawings worked out by Messrs Texier and
                    Flandin, from which we derive the chief part of our knowledge, although we have
                    very interesting accounts by Sir R. K. Porter, Mr Rich, Mr Morier, Mr Loftus,
                    &amp;c. The existing buildings at Persepolis occupy a remarkable position on an
                    elevated platform (partly, it would seem, artificial) at the foot of a steep
                    rock in the face of which were cut out the tomb chambers of the Persian kings.
                    The platform was 1425 feet on the west side, and 926 feet on the north, about
                    the size of the Horticultural Gardens in London, including the arcades and
                    conservatory. It was raised about 40 feet above the level of the adjoining
                    country, and faced with a wall, built with stones of an immense size. The
                    platform was approached by the grandest flight of steps in the world, each step
                    being 22 feet long. Having scaled these, the stranger would pass through the
                    first building, viz., the Propylaeum of Xerxes, a building whose remains have
                    given rise to several theories as to its original plan and purpose. There remain
                    two grand gateways 24 feet apart, with portions, more or less perfect, between
                    these, of four columns 45 feet high. The gateways had openings of 13 feet, and
                    each of their piers was partly composed of bulls, admirably executed, and
                    strikingly like the Assyrian sculptures at the Louvre from Khorsabad. The human
                    heads of these animals are crowned with coronets of leaves, and from the top of
                    the coronets to the hoofs, the animal measures 19 feet. Nothing further has been
                    discovered which would throw light on the general plan of the building. Mr
                    Fergusson believes that it was enclosed and roofed, and served as a justice
                    hall, or place of assembly at the entrance of the palace. Μ. Flandin’s idea is,
                    that the structure was a mere open portico roofed, but without walls, except
                    perhaps for a few feet in height. Through this structure was the entrance to the
                    grand palace, the Chehil Minar, t.e., hall of 40 columns, an Eastern mode of
                    expressing a great many, as there were really 72. It was approached by a
                    magnificent staircase, each step of which served as a pedestal to a figure (1
                    ft. 9 in. high) in bas-relief, the whole representing a procession, and of great
                    value as giving the varied costumes, &lt;fcc., of the period. The columns of the
                    palace are arranged in four divisions, viz., one of 36 columns in the centre,
                    and three each of 12 columns in two rows, divided from the centre by a space of
                    about 60 feet. Of all these only 10 are standing, but the bases of most remain,
                    and the whole ground is covered with the ruins of the columns that have fallen.
                    Their height varied from 60 feet (including capital and base) in the front
                    division, to 67 ft. 4 in. in the centre one. In these columns there is an
                    advance upon the architecture of Egypt, for they have bases, richly carved, and
                    capitals of a form unknown to our art, before or since. The typical form is that
                    of the double-headed bull with a deep cavity between the heads, evidently
                    intended to hold a beam. There is a quaint grandeur about these columns, from
                    their design and their gigantic size. The capitals of one division, the western,
                    are 7 feet high, and 12 ft. 2 in. wide, whilst the shafts, 54 ft. 10 in. high,
                    are each composed of only four great marble blocks. Unfortunately we have only
                    fragments of these buildings, with no history or tradition to guide us as to
                    their perfect forms. There are no walls, no doorways, and no roofs. Mr Fergusson
                    in his restoration places walls between the several divisions, and thus forms
                    them into one grand, enclosed structure, with a mass of columns in the centre,
                    and three porticoes at the sides. He also believes that there was an upper
                    story, to which, indeed, some Persian writers have alluded. Sir R. K. Porter’s
                    restoration, with that of Messrs Flandin, Coste, and Texier, is quite different.
                    They believe that the four groups of columns were isolated and had no enclosing
                    walls, but were simply screened by curtains; that the centre division had a flat
                    roof with an opening in the centre, protected by an awning, for light and
                    ventilation; that the roof, cornices, and superstructure of all kinds, were of
                    wood, as no fragment of a stone cornice, lintel, or tile has been found. Now it
                    so happens that at Susa there was another great palace, similar, or nearly so,
                    in size and plan to that at Persepolis, and with an inscription showing it to
                    have been built by Artaxerxes Mnemon, son of Xerxes. The height of the columns
                    is unknown, but the capitals and bases correspond closely with those at
                    Persepolis. The capitals have singular volutes under the double bull’s heads,
                    the whole being 28 feet high, the capitals alone being thus as high as the
                    columns and bases together of St Martin’s, London. Mr Loftus examined this
                    structure carefully, and satisfied himself that no walls had ever existed. In
                    addition to this an ancient drain has been found at Persepolis, in the very line
                    which one of the main walls must have occupied. Mr Loftus therefore agrees with
                    Sir R. K. Porter and the others in their restoration. The description in Esther
                    i. 6, has been supposed to refer to this palace. Two other structures at
                    Fersepolis were really enclosed—viz., the palaces of Darius and Xerxes. Each has
                    the four divisions of columns, as at the Chehil Minar and Susa; but the jambs to
                    the doors and other portions of the enclosure still remain.</p>
                <p>These were clearly places for habitation. A still larger enclosed building, the
                    hall of 100 columns, has also left gigantic fragments. The size and arrangement
                    are unknown; but it must have been about 225 feet square, and enclosed by walls,
                    some of the doorways and blank windows of which remain. The excavated tombs of
                    the kings, high up in the face of the mountain, just as described by Diodorus,
                    are the only other important remains of ancient Persia,</p>
                <p>To sum up as to our knowledge of Persian art, the greater part of the remains are
                    columnar, not an edifice is built on the Assyrian plan, and there is little to
                    remind us oi Assyria except the human headed bull. The doors and windows
                    somewhat resemble those of Egypt. They have the same plain architrave, the large
                    roll, cavetto, and fillet at top. But the sides of the portals are straight;
                    there are no massive pylons, and the whole character of the columns, bases, and
                    capitals is utterly unlike any known remains of Egyptian or Assyrian art. By
                    what stages the Persian architects arrived at the singular work at Persepolis
                    and Susa we cannot now judge. All we know is that Persian art was developed
                    contemporaneously with that oi Greece, though with utterly different results.
                    The elegant form of the Greek temples, the curve of the Assyrian arch, would
                    seem to have been unknown to the Persians, who, it appears likely, worked out
                    their latest forms by gradua) <pb break="no"

                    thus originated a style, grand, picturesque, and in its ruins beautiful, but
                    well-nigh isolated in the history of art, there being nothing from which it was
                    quite copied, and nothing which seems quite to have sprung from it.</p>
                <p>The few remains which exist of a later date are separated from the above as
                    widely in architectural forms as in chronology. Neither the Greek Seleucidae nor
                    the Parthian Arsacidae have left any buildings (of importance at least) which
                    can be identified; and the well-known edifices at Serbistan, Firouzabad, and
                    Ctesiphon, are late in the time of the Sassanidae. The two former edifices have
                    domes rising from square bases and lighted by small apertures, as Victor Place
                    suggests was the case at Khorsabad, and each is approached, as was the Khorsabad
                    palace, through a deep vaulted entrance. At Ctesiphon this vault is 115 feet
                    deep, 72 wide, and 85 high. Of the famous palace at Dastageod (Artemita), 60
                    miles north of Ctesiphon, described by the Byzantine writer, Theophanes, no
                    remains are known to exist; but Dr Tristram has discovered at Mashita, in the
                    land of Moab, a palace with its enclosing walls, richly decorated with carving,
                    &lt;fcc., which Mr Ferguson considers to have been built by Chosroes shortly
                    before the Arab invasion. The edifice is minutely described and illustrated in
                    Tristram’s <hi rend="italic">Land of Moab.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Architecture
                    of Asia Minor.</hi></p>
                <p>Little was known of the antiquities of Asia Minor until, in 1838 and 1840, Sir C.
                    Fellows discovered in its northwestern corner eleven ruined and deserted cities.
                    It was reasonable to think that in these we should have the missing link between
                    Assyrian and Greek art. But although a few of the sculptures show traces of
                    Assyrian influence, and though the later structures are very similar to those of
                    Greece, the productions of native art seem quite isolated and peculiar. The most
                    ancient remains are considerably later than such masterpieces of skill as the
                    tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae, and the great works of later times were erected
                    long after the Parthenon.</p>
                <p>The earliest works remaining are singularly like the Etruscan graves so often
                    found in Italy. Perhaps the first of these is the tomb at Tantalais near Smyrna,
                    which has simply a square chamber, ceiled with a pointed arch, formed with
                    oversailing courses, and all covered with a tumulus. Like to it is the tomb of
                    Alyattes, king of Lydia, on the bank of the Hermus, near Sardis. It has also one
                    chamber, 11 feet by 8, and 7 feet high, in the centre of a circular pyramid, not
                    sloping directly from the ground, as in Egypt, but having a high moulded
                    stereobate, at the starting, some f mile round. This structure would create no
                    surprise if found in Tuscany; and still more to increase the resemblance to
                    Etruscan work, it appears to have been surmounted by five stone pillars. Of the
                    tombs which belong to the races between the above and the time when Greek art
                    was introduced or was invented, the rudest are, perhaps, to be found in Caria.
                    They are sarcophagi, and those at Olinda, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> are of
                    enormous size, ranged on each side of the street leading to the city. In the
                    simplest form a cavity was made in a great stone for the body, and a heavy lid
                    put over it, coped, or rising as a pediment in centre. Generally they were plain
                    and oblong in shape. In Lycia, chiefly on the banks of the Xanthus, are found
                    other sepulchres of remarkably singular form. We look in vain for their
                    prototypes, or anything copied from them.. The most simple are cut in the steep
                    rocks which invariably overhang the cities, and are often curiously like
                    Elizabethan windows, with mullions and panels. Some have a Gothic shaped top,
                    which is also peculiar to Lycia, and many are finished with a pediment. Many of
                    them show evident traces of having been copied in stone from wooden originals.
                    For they are shown with joints put together with dovetails and pins, and with
                    cornices like the ends of round trees; not actually so constructed, but all
                    carved out of one solid mass. The designs of these rock-cut tombe were then
                    still further elaborated in the detached monuments. The earlier ones, indeed,
                    are much more simple, and are known as the obelisk tombs, being merely great
                    high blocks of stone or marble, standing on a square base and surmounted by a
                    cornice. They have not the real obelisk form, and have got the name merely on
                    account of their height. In the grander works, the obelisk is surmounted by a
                    sarcophagus of great size, coped with the pointed arch, with mullions and panels
                    as above detailed, and all bearing signs of a wooden origin. Some are of
                    enormous size, the stones weighing 50 to 80 tons. The different parts of the
                    edifice were hollowed out for coffins, a plan of sepulture little known
                    elsewhere.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The following
                    inscription, though belonging to Greek times, shows how this was done :—“In the
                    sarcophagus I buried Barilla my wife; and I wish myself to be put into the
                    sarcophagus, and nobody else. In the first compartment lying under it I wish my
                    second wife and Polychromas my son to be buried; in the other are to be put my
                    other children. Nobody else is to be put either into the sarcophagi’ or the
                    compartments.”</p></note> These singular tombs are found all through Lycia, but
                    a beautiful variety of them, found only at Xanthus, has the ridge stone grooved
                    to receive an ornamental crest, sometimes richly sculptured. These singular
                    structures are separated by a wide interval from the forms of Greek art; but
                    that their design was, to some extent, adopted and used by the Greeks, we have
                    various signal proofs. The Harpy tomb, whose sculptures are in the British
                    Museum, is supposed to have been erected so late even as after the capture of
                    Xanthus by the Persians in 547. It has the chief Lycian peculiarities, a base 6
                    feet high, carrying a square shaft 17 feet high in one block, weighing some 80
                    tons, and surmounted by a cap stone of 15 tons weight. Near the top, on each
                    face, was carved the famous Harpy frieze. Near this was another, known as the
                    Chimaera tomb, having the Gothic headed sarcophagus, and with a sculptured
                    crest. And near to this again, was another of a similar kind, called the Winged
                    Horse tomb. Doubtless these and other works, both in Lycia and Caria, were
                    wrought by Lycian workmen under Greek guidance, but they seem to have made no
                    lasting impression upon the architecture of the Greeks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Grecian Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>Hitherto, we have found that, in each country, the artistic forms used in the
                    earliest periods descended to later times, which embodied to some extent the
                    traditionary forms bequeathed to them. Even the Egyptian pyramids,
                    unarchitectural as they are, were copied down to the 7th or 8th century in
                    Nubia, and the earliest columnar architecture clearly shows itself as simply the
                    beginning of a series of works extending from 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> even to the Caesars. But in Greece the earliest works are entirely
                    separated from the later by an absolute break both in architectural forms and
                    construction. In various parts of Greece and of Italy, specimens of rude walling
                    are found of such remote antiquity, that they are, as by common consent,
                    referred to the fabulous ages, and, for want of a more distinctive term, are
                    called Cyclopean. Now it appears, from the concurring evidence, in the opinion
                    of most antiquaries, that a people who have been called Pelasgi, or sailors,
                    migrated from Asia Minor, or the coast of Syria, at a very early period, and
                    possessed themselves of various countries, some of which were unoccupied, and
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n425/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0425-0402"/> others inhabited by Celtic tribes. Professor
                    Heeren, who affixes dates to the various migrations, expressly says that the
                    Pelasgi were of Asiatic origin. “Their first arrival in the Peloponnesus was
                    under Inachus, about 1800 B.C., and according to their own traditions,” he says,
                    “they made their first appearance in this quarter as uncultivated savages. They
                    must, however, at an early period have made some progress towards civilisation,
                    since the most ancient states, Argos and Sicyon, owed their origin to them; and
                    to them, perhaps with great probability, are attributed the remains of those
                    most ancient monuments generally termed Cyclopie.” He adds, that the Hellenes, a
                    people of Asiatic origin also, expelled the Pelasgi from almost every part of
                    Greece, about 300 years after their first occupation of it; the latter keeping
                    their footing only in Arcadia and in the land of Dodona, whilst some of them
                    migrated to Italy, and others to Crete and various islands. The arrival of the
                    Egyptian and Phoenician colonies in Greece, Professor Heeren thinks, was between
                    1600 and 1400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The most ancient specimen of
                    Cyclopie walling is found at Tiryns, near Mycenae. It is is composed of huge
                    masses of rock roughly hewn and piled up together, with the interstices at the
                    angles filled up by small stones, but without mortar or cement of any kind. The
                    next species is in stones of various sizes also, shaped polygonally, and fitted
                    with nicety one to another, but not laid in courses. Specimens of this are found
                    at Iulis and Delphi, as well as at the places already mentioned, in Greece, and
                    in various parts of Italy, particularly at Cossa, a town of the Volsci This also
                    was constructed without mortar. The mode of building walls, which took the place
                    of that, is not called Cyclopean; it is in parallel courses of rectangular
                    stones, of unequal size, but of the same height. This was, however, often used
                    in combination with the polygonal, as in one very beautiful specimen at Rhamnus.
                    The parallel masonry is common in the Phocian cities, and in some parts of
                    Boeotia and Argolis. To that succeeded the mode most common in, and which was
                    chiefly confined to, Attica. It consists of horizontal courses of masonry, not
                    always of the same height, but composed of rectangular stones.</p>
                <p>The oldest existing structure in Greece of regular form is of far superior
                    construction to the Cyclopean walling, and must be referred to early colonists.
                    It is at Mycenae, and consists of two subt erranean chambers, one much larger
                    than the other. The outer and larger one is circular, and is entered by a huge
                    doorway at the end of a long avenue of colossal walls, built in nearly parallel
                    courses of rect-εngular stones, roughly hewn, however, and laid without mortar.
                    Its external effect is that of an excavation, though the structure of the front
                    is evident; and internally it assumes the form of an immense lime-kiln; its
                    vertical section being of a conical form, with nearly parabolic curves, like a
                    pointed arch. The construction of this edifice was thought to afford clear
                    evidence that the Greeks were acquainted with the properties of the arch; but in
                    the most material point this was destroyed on finding that it consisted of
                    parallel projecting courses of stone in horizontal layers, in the manner called
                    by our workmen battering, or perhaps more correctly, corbelling. It proves,
                    however, that its architect understood the principle of the arch in its
                    horizontal position; for Mr Cockerell discovered, by excavations above it, that
                    the diminishing rings of which the dome is composed were complete in themselves
                    for withstanding outward pressure; the joints of the stones being partly wrought
                    radiating, and partly rendered so by wedges of small stones driven tightly into
                    them behind. The apex is formed, not by a key-stone, for the construction does
                    not admit of that, but by a covering stone, which is merely laid on the course
                    immediately below it. It may be added, that internally the lower projecting
                    angles of the stones are worked off to follow the general outline. Though this
                    is the largest and most perfect, its internal diameter at the base being 48 ft.
                    6 in., and its height from the floor to the covering stone 45 feet, yet edifices
                    exhibiting similar structure are found in many other places in Greece itself, in
                    Egypt, in Sicily, and in Italy. They all, however, tend to prove, that the
                    principle of the construction of the vertical arch was unknown at the time of
                    their erection in all those countries; and their erection is evidently of the
                    most remote antiquity. But neither could the mechanical powers have been unknown
                    to their constructors. In the edifice which we have described, and which is
                    thought by some to be the treasury of Atreus, or the tomb of his son Agamemnon,
                    mentioned by Pausanias as existing among the ruins of Mycenae in his time, the
                    inner lintel of the doorway is 27 feet in length, 16 feet deep, and nearly 4
                    feet thick, weighing, it is computed, upwards of 130 tons; and the lintel of the
                    Gate of the Lions in the Acropolis of the same city, is, from its immense
                    magnitude, also strongly illustrative of the great mechanical skill of the
                    people of those times.</p>
                <p>As no nation has ever equalled the Egyptians in the extent and magnitude of their
                    architectural monuments, neither have the Greeks been surpassed in the exquisite
                    beauty of form and proportion, in the extreme simplicity and perfect harmony,
                    which pervade every part of their structures. Unfortunately these monuments are
                    known to us only by their ruins, for there is not a Grecian building remaining
                    in a perfect state. In Greece proper, at least, this was not so until a
                    comparatively recent date, viz., that of the war between the Venetians and
                    Turks. The Parthenon itself was nearly perfect until that time, when it was
                    shattered by an explosion of gunpowder (1687).</p>
                <p>First in importance in Grecian architecture is the use of the three orders,
                    Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, with the peculiar mouldings, &amp;c., connected
                    with each. The Doric and Ionic columns, rudely drawn, appear on the early
                    Etruscan or Greek vases. They are very slender, with large projecting capitals
                    and with entablatures, which indicate pretty clearly copies from a construction
                    of wood. Buildings, much as these, and all of wood, are described by Sir C.
                    Fellows as still being constructed in Lycia. That columns of wood were used in
                    the ancient temples of Greece we know from such notices as we have, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of an old wooden column which was preserved in the
                    temple of Juno at Olympia, as having been one of those of a former temple. But a
                    doubt is thrown on the theory that in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n432/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0432-0403"/> these light wooden structures we see the origin
                    of the orders, by the earliest stone columns known being the most massive and if
                    we turn to Egypt, the mother of the arts and sciences, we shall find many things
                    in some of the most ancient structures which may have furnished an idea of the
                    Doric arrangements to the fertile imagination of the Greek. Allusion has already
                    been made to the well-known façade at Beni Hassan, on the Nile, as giving us a
                    very likely prototype of the Grecian Doric column.</p>
                <p>Of the triglyph, the most distinguishing part of the Doric entablature, there are
                    many indications in the early works of Upper Egypt; and in the structures of the
                    Ptolemies they are still more evident, though it may be objected that in them
                    the indications were borrowed from the Greeks after the Macedonian conquest. But
                    it must be borne in mind that the Egyptian nation did not change its character,
                    religion, or usages by the change of its governors; and the Egyptians were,
                    through the whole period of their existence as a nation, an originating and not
                    an imitative people; whereas the Greeks seized on a beauty wherever they found
                    one, and made it their own by improving it. To the question, why the Greeks
                    cannot be allowed to have originated that beautiful style of architecture which
                    they brought to the perfection it displays in their works, it may be sufficient
                    to answer, that it would be against the common course of events if it were so.
                    It is remarkable that, in Greece, the earliest specimen of columnar architecture
                    that presents itself displays the chief characteristics which are found in works
                    of periods when learning and civilisation were at their acme in that
                    country.</p>
                <p>It will be convenient to give here at the outset a list of the principal Greek
                    buildings.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Grecian Doric</hi> (Plates VIII., IX., X.)</p>
                <p>Vitruvius gives several accounts of the origin of the Greek Doric order. He
                    states first that “Dorus (the son of Hellenus and of the nymph Orseis), king of
                    Achaia and of all the Peloponnesus, having formerly built a temple to Juno in
                    the ancient city of Argos, this temple was found by chance to be in that manner
                    which we call Doric.” In another place he deduces the arrangements of the order
                    from those of a primitive log hut, settling with the utmost precision what, in
                    the latter, suggested the various parts in the former. But he also tells us that
                    the Doric column was modelled by the Grecian colonists in Asia Minor in the
                    proportions of a human figure, and was made six diameters in height, because a
                    man was found to be 6 times the length of his foot. But this story, even
                    supposing it to be rational, does not coincide with the Greek Doric at all, but,
                    if with anything, with the Boman.</p>
                <p>In the Greek examples, this order may be divided into three parts, stylobate,
                    column, and entablature (Plate VIII. fig. 4). The stylobate is from two-thirds
                    to a whole diameter of the column in height, in three equal courses, which
                    recede gradually the one above from the one below it, and on the floor or upper
                    step the column rests. That graduation, it may be remarked, does not appear to
                    have been made by the ancients to facilitate the access to the floor of the stoa
                    or portico, but on the principle of the spreading footings of a wall, to give
                    both real and apparent firmness to the structure, both of which it does in an
                    eminent degree.</p>
                <p>The column varies in height in dififerent examples, from four diameters, as at
                    Corinth, to six diameters, as at Sunium. Of this the capital, including the
                    necking, is rather less than half a diameter; in those cases in which a necking
                    does not exist, the capital itself occupies nearly the same proportion (Plate
                    VIII. figs. 4 and 9; Plate IX. fig. 4). The shaft diminishes in a slightly
                    curved line, called an entasis, from its base or inferior diameter upwards to
                    the hypotrachelium, where the diameter is from two-thirds to four-fifths of that
                    at the base. It is the inferior diameter that is always intended when the term
                    is used as a measure of proportion. The capital consists of a necking, an
                    echinus or ovolo, and an abacus; the necking is about one-fifth of the height of
                    the capital, and the other two members equally divide the remaining four-fifths;
                    when there is no necking, the ovolo occupies the greater proportion of the whole
                    height. The abacus is a square tablet, whose sides are rather more than the
                    inferior diameter of the column. The corbelling of the ovolo adapts it to both
                    the diminished head of the shaft and the extended abacus, flowing into the one,
                    and forming a bed for the other by means of a graceful cyma-reversa; but its
                    lower part is encircled by three or four rings or annulets, which are variously
                    formed in different examples, and which give the echinus form to the great
                    moulding, although it is, as we have said, part of a cyma-reversa. (Figs. 6 and
                    7 of Plates VIII. and IX.) The shaft· is divided generally into twenty flutes;
                    but there are several examples with sixteen, and there is one with twenty-four.
                    The flutes are sometimes segments of circles, sometimes semi-ellipses, and
                    sometimes eccentric curves (Plate VIIL fig. 12; Plate IX. figs. 8, 14.) They
                    always meet in an arris or edge, and follow the entasis and diminution of the
                    column up through the hypotrachelium to the annulets, under which they finish,
                    sometimes with a straight and sometimes with a curved head. At the base they
                    detail on the pavement or floor of the stylobate. In one example at Segesta the
                    columns are not fluted at all, and in two others, at Cnidus and Delos, the
                    flutes are marked at top and bottom only, but in these examples the columna were
                    possibly not finished.</p>
                <p>The third part of the order, the entablature, ranges in various examples from one
                    diameter and three-quarters to rather more than two diameters in height, of
                    which about four-fifths is nearly equally divided between the architrave and
                    frieze, while the cornice occupies the remaining one-fifth: this is in some
                    cases exactly the distribution of the entablature. (See Plate VIII. fig. 5;
                    Plate IX. fig. 5.) <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n433/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0433-0404"/> The architrave is in one broad face, four-fifths,
                    and sometimes five-sixths of its whole height; and the remaining fifth or sixth
                    is given to a projecting continuous fillet called the taenia, which occupies
                    one-half the space, and a regula or small lintel attached to it, in lengths
                    equal to the breadth of the triglyphs above in the frieze. From the regulae six
                    small cylindrical drops, called guttae, depend. There are examples to the
                    contrary, but it may be taken as a general rule, that the architrave is not in
                    the same vertical line with the upper face of the shaft, or its circumferential
                    line, at the superior diameter, but is projected nearly so much as to impend the
                    line or face of the column at the base. In one example only is the architrave
                    known to be sculptured, viz., at Assos, where it has bas-reliefs of bulls
                    fighting. The frieze, vertically, is plain about six-sevenths of its whole
                    height, and is bounded above by a fascia, slightly projecting from it,which
                    occupies the remaining seventh. Horizontally, however, it is divided into
                    triglyphs and metopes, which regulate the intercolumniations; the former being
                    nearly a semidiameter in width, and the latter (the space interposed between two
                    triglyphs) generally an exact square, its breadth being equal to the whole
                    height of the frieze, including the fascia. This latter breaks round the
                    triglyphs horizontally, and is a little increased in depth on them. These
                    metopes are shown on the vases to be holes between the ends of beams, and that
                    the metopes were, at one time, open, seems to be proved by a passage in
                    Euripides, who lived during the construction of the Parthenon. No example,
                    however, early or late, remains to support this view. Each glyph, of which there
                    are two whole ones and two halves to every tablet, is one-fifth of the width of
                    the whole, and the interglyphs are each one-seventh of the whole tablet or
                    triglyph. The glyphs detail on the taenia of the architrave, but are variously
                    finished above. In some examples they are nearly square-headed, with the angles
                    rounded off; in others the heads are regular curves, from a fiat segment to a
                    semi-ellipse. The semiglyphs are finished above in a manner peculiar to
                    themselves, with a turn or drop; but hardly two examples correspond in that
                    particular. The tablets in which the glyphs are cut are vertical to the face of
                    the architrave, the metopes recede from them like sunk panels; these are often
                    charged with sculptures, and indeed almost appear contrived to receive them. The
                    third and crowning part of the entablature, the cornice, in what may be
                    considered the best examples, projects from the face of the triglyphs and
                    architrave about its own height. Vertically, it is divided into four equal
                    parts, one of which is given to a square projecting fillet at the top, with a
                    small congeries of mouldings, different, and differently proportioned to each
                    other, in various examples. Two other parts are given to the corona, and the
                    remaining fourth to a narrow sunk face below it, with the mutules and their
                    guttae. These latter form the soffit or planceer of the cornice, which is not
                    horizontal or at right angles to the vertical face of the entablature generally,
                    but is cut up inwards at an angle of about 80°. The width of the mutules
                    themselves is regulated by that of the triglyphs over which they are placed, to
                    which it is exactly equal. They are ornamented each with three rows of six small
                    cylinders, similar to those which depend from the regulae under the triglyphs
                    and on the architrave. There is twice the number of mutules that there is of
                    triglyphs, one of the former being placed over every metope also in the manner
                    the examples indicate.</p>
                <p>This completes the Greek Doric order according to the generally received sense of
                    the term; but there are other parts necessary to it. In the front or on the ends
                    of a temple, or over a portico, a pediment is placed (Plate IX. fig. 1). Its
                    intention is to enclose the ends of the roof, but it forms no less a part of the
                    architectural composition. In reason, it should be raised as much as the roof
                    required; but when the span is great that would be unsightly; and reference
                    appears to have been made to the common standard of proportion, as the pediments
                    of most Doric temples are found to be about one diameter and a half in height at
                    the apex of the tympanum, which in a hexastyle arrangement makes an angle at the
                    base of about 14°, and in an octastyle about 12j <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>.
                    The pediment is covered by the cornice, without its mutules, rising from the
                    point of its crowning fillet, so that no part of it is repeated in pro file.
                    Another moulding, however, is superimposed: sometimes this is an ovolo with a
                    fillet over it, and sometimes a cymatium. It varies much in its proportion to
                    the cornice, but in the best examples it is about one-half the depth of the
                    latter without its mutules. Ornaments of various kinds, statues or foliage, are
                    believed to have been placed on the apices and at the feet of pediments as
                    acroteria. Of these, however, we have the remains of one only (a very beautiful
                    one), viz., at Aegina; but indications of the plinths or blocks which may have
                    received them exist, and such things appear represented on ancient coins and
                    medallions. The tympana of pediments are well known as receptacles of ornamental
                    sculpture. On the flank of a Doric temple, the cornice supported a row of
                    ornamented tiles called antefixae. These formed a rich and appropriate ornament,
                    but they rather belonged to the roof than to the columnar arrangement or order.
                    The antefixae covered the ends of the joint-tiles as the pediments did those of
                    the roofs; and corresponding ornaments called stelai rose out of the apices of
                    the jointtiles, forming a highly enriched ridge (see Plate VIII. fig. 1).</p>
                <p>A secondary Doric order arises in the disposition of a Grecian temple, from the
                    columns of the pronaos and the inner part of the external entablature continued
                    and repeated. Of this the frieze is generally without triglyphs, though there
                    may be regulae and guttae on the architrave. The fascia of the frieze is either
                    moulded or enriched on the face; and, instead of a cornice, the beams of the
                    ceiling are laid at equal intervals to support sunk panels or coffers, in which
                    there may be flowers or other enrichments (Plate VIII. fig. 8).</p>
                <p>Propriety in the composition and arrangement of antae is as necessary to the
                    perfection of the Doric order as to that of the columnar ordinance itself,
                    especially if thθ latter be <hi rend="italic">in antis.</hi> Slight projections
                    are made on the end and side faces of a wall, so as to form a species of
                    pilaster, whose front shall be nearly equal to the diameter of the columns to
                    which it is attached, exactly equal indeed to the soffit of the entablature,
                    whose faces have been described as impending the circumferential line of the
                    column at a little above its base. This rests on the stylobate in the same
                    manner as the columns do, with sometimes a small continuous moulding as a base;
                    and its capital is a congeries of mouldings, about the depth of the abacus, with
                    a plain fascia corresponding to the ovolo of the columnar capital. The
                    entablature of the order to which it is attached rests on it, and, continuing
                    along the flank of the building, is received by a similar combination at the
                    other end. These, it may be remarked, were seldom diminished or fluted, an
                    example at Paestum being about the only exception. Being projections from and
                    upon the ends and faces of walls, they could not be diminished without involving
                    an absurdity, and fluting on a straight surface must be productive of monotony,
                    as the flutes can only project a series of equal and parallel shadows. Not so,
                    however, with columns, on whose rotund surface fluting produces a beautiful
                    variety of light and shade in all their gradations, which it could not possess
                    without that enrichment; for on a plain <pb break="no"

                    shadows so dark as in the former case, nor are they so finely diffused over the
                    whole surface in the one as in the other.</p>
                <p>In the Parthenon the antae, as well as the columns, are without bases. In all
                    other examples the base line of the antae is marked by a few small mouldings. In
                    the only example which occurs in the ancient architectural remains of attached
                    Doric columns—that of the pseudo-peripteral temple of Jupiter Olympius at
                    Agrigentum—the stylobate is peculiarly arranged. The upper gradus is grooved,
                    and detailed round the columns and along the walls between them; and a congeries
                    of vertically arranged mouldings and fillets rests on it, and receives the base
                    of the column.</p>
                <p>As before stated, the earliest examples of columns are the heaviest; they are
                    also the most tapering, and there are some other details which help us in
                    identifying the date of a Doric edifice in Greece proper. The hypotrachelium in
                    early examples, as at Corinth, has three grooves; in later, as the Parthenon,
                    only one. The contour also of the chief member, the echinus, varied at different
                    dates. In the earliest it was full and round, as at Corinth, and at Assos (the
                    latter having the greatest curve of any known example); sometimes possibly, as
                    at Segesta, struck with the compass, but almost always part of a conic section
                    (parabola). In later times it became less curved, and in the finest examples
                    almost flat, as in the Propylaeum and Parthenon, but still forming part of a
                    very delicate curve (hyperbola). In one case, at Selinus, where, to an
                    inexperienced eye, the whole temple would appear to be of the same date, the
                    differences alluded to contrast very strongly with each other. In the very late
                    times of Greek work, when art became debased, the coarse round form of earlier
                    work is exhibited, as in the Agora. The width of the abacus in early examples,
                    as Corinth, is as much as two-sevenths the height of the shaft and cap. In later
                    examples it diminishes to one-fifth. And as the column, so the entablature was
                    more massive in the early examples, except in the colonies, where the old
                    proportions continued to a late period. At Paestum the proportion of entablature
                    to column is as 1 to 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4; Aegina, 1 to 2 5 3;
                    Theseum, 1 to 3 nearly.</p>
                <p>Such are the materials of which the Greeks composed those beautiful temples,
                    whose peculiar effect and character arise from their simplicity and harmony.
                    These qualities are visible in the long unbroken lines which bound their forms,
                    and the breadth, boldness, and fitness of every part. The entablature, though
                    massive, is fully upborne by the columns, whose spreading abaci receive it, and
                    transmit the weight downwards by the shafts, which rest on a horizontal and
                    spreading basement,—the magnitude of every part, as before remarked, being
                    determined by the capacity of the sustaining power. Besides graceful and elegant
                    outline, and simple and harmonious forms, these structures exhibit a wonderful
                    variety of light and shade, arising from the judicious contour and arrangement
                    of mouldings, every one of which is rendered expressive. The effect is
                    heightened by the fluting of the columns and the peculiar form of the columnar
                    capital, with its broad square abacus, which projects a deep shadow on the bold
                    ovolo. The play of light aud shade about the insulated columns is strongly
                    modified by the deep shadows on the walls behind them; and in front, where the
                    inner columns appear, the effect is enchanting. For all the higher effects which
                    architecture is capable of producing, a Greek peripteral temple of the Doric
                    order is perhaps unrivalled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Grecian Ionic</hi> (Plate XL)</p>
                <p>Of this beautiful and graceful order it is as difficult to determine the origin
                    as of the Doric. The explanation of Vitruvius is that the Ionian colonists, on
                    building a temple to Diana, wished to find some new manner that was beautiful
                    Following the method which they had pursued with the Doric (proportioning the
                    column according to the dimensions of a man), they imparted to this the delicacy
                    of the female figure—in the first place, by making the diameter of the column
                    one-eighth of its height, then by putting a base to it in twisted cords, like
                    the sandals of a woman, and forming the capital with volutes, like the hair
                    which hangs on both sides of her face. To crown all, he says that they
                    channelled or fluted the column to resemble the folds of female garments, by
                    which it would appear that Vitruvius did not know that the Greeks never executed
                    the Doric order without fluting the columns. “Thus,” he goes on to say, “they
                    invented these two species of columns, imitating in the one the naked simplicity
                    and dignity of a man, and in the other the delicacy and the ornaments of a
                    woman.”</p>
                <p>From the recent discoveries in Assyria, however, there can be no reasonable doubt
                    that the Greek colonists of Ionia at least obtained their idea of the Ionic
                    capital from Nineveh. As to its earliest forms great differences of opinion
                    exist. An extremely plausible theory, originated and ably worked out by Mr
                    Skidmore, suggests that the delicate Ionic curls were copied from the curved
                    ornamental wire-work of the goldsmiths. On the other hand, a recent French
                    author has found in Sicily a rudely carved capital which is little more than a
                    block of stone with the ends rounded off, the curve being continued, and thus
                    forming a volute; and it is very possible that a crude idea like this might have
                    been worked out, with some help from Assyria, into one of the many forms of the
                    Ionic capitals.</p>
                <p>Of this graceful and elegant style we take the proportions and peculiarities from
                    the perfect examples of the Athenian Acropolis. This order may also be
                    considered in three similar parts, stylobate, column, and entablature.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For explanation of terms see
                    Hate IX. figs. 5 to 8, and glossary.</p></note> The stylobate is in three
                    receding equal courses or steps, whose united height is from four-fifths to one
                    diameter. The column, consisting of base, shaft, and capital, is rather more
                    than nine diameters in height; of which the base is two-fifths of a diameter,
                    and the capital, including tho hypotrachelium, is in one case three-fourths, and
                    in the other seven-eighths of a diameter high. As shown in the vases, it is
                    invariably very long and slender, and without bases; but no actual example
                    remains to us without a base. The base consists of a congeries of mouldings
                    extending gradually from a diameter and a third to a diameter and a half, and
                    its height is in three nearly equal parts, two equal fillets separating them.
                    The lowest, a torus, rests on the top of the stylobate or floor of the portico,
                    a fillet divides that from the scotia, a second fillet intervenes between the
                    scotia and a second torus, and a third fillet bases the apophyge or escape of
                    the shaft The upper torus of the base is, in one example, fillet-fluted
                    horizontally; and in the other, the same member is enriched with the guillochos.
                    The shaft diminishes with entasis from its lower or whole diameter to above
                    five-sixths of it immediately under the hypotrachelium. It is fluted with
                    twenty-four flutes and alternating fillets, which follow the diminution and
                    entasis of the column. The flutes in plan are nearly semi-ellipses, and they
                    finish at both ends with the same curve; a fillet is in thickness nearly
                    one-fourth the width of a flute. The difference in the height of the capital is
                    in the length of the necking, which in one case is separated from the head of
                    the shaft by a carved bead, and in the other by a plain fillet. Above the
                    necking, a height of about one-third of a diameter is occupied by a congeries of
                    three spreading or corbelling mouldings—a bead, an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n437/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0437-0406"/> ovolo, and a torus—which are all appropriately
                    carved. On these rests the parallelogramic block, on whose faces are the
                    volutes, and whose ends are concaved into what is technically termed a bolster
                    to connect them. This part is about one-third of a diameter in height, and
                    includes a rectilinear abacus, whose edges are moulded to an ovolo and carved
                    with the egg and tongue ornament. The volutes are three-fifths of a diameter in
                    depth, and extend in front to one diameter and a half; and they are nearly a
                    semi· diameter apart. The volutes and the flowing lines which connect them are
                    represented in figs. 5 and 9, Plate XI. The bolsters are fluted vertically with
                    alternate fillets, on which are carved beads. An ornament composed of the
                    honeysuckle with tendrils encircles the necking of the column It must be
                    remarked, that as the capitals are parallelogramic, and present but two similar
                    fronts, to preserve the appearance of volutes externally on all sides, the
                    capitals of the columns at the external angles of porticoes are differently
                    arranged (compare figs. 15 and 16). The outer volute is bent out at an angle of
                    45°, and volutes are put on the end or side-front of the capital also, the outer
                    one being the other side of the angular volute of the front. To suit the angle
                    internally, the two volutes of the inner face are placed at right angles to each
                    other: this is, however, at best but an awkward expedient, and need not be
                    employed when a portico projects only one intercolumniation. All the Greek
                    volutes are flat on the surface, except ât Bassae, where the volutes are
                    curved.</p>
                <p>The entablature, which is rather more than two diameters in height, is also
                    divided into three parts,—architrave, frieze, and cornice,—which may be
                    proportioned by dividing the whole height into five parts, four of which, as in
                    the Doric, may be again equally divided between the architrave and frieze The
                    cornice, however, in the example referred to, does not occupy one-fifth of the
                    entablature; but if it had a fillet over the upper moulding, which it appears to
                    want, that would be just its proportion. If the architrave (fig. 8) be divided
                    into nine parts, seven of them may be given to three equal fascias, which
                    slightly project the one before the other, the first or lowest, which is
                    vertical to the circumferential line of the inferior diameter, being covered by
                    the second, and the second by the third. The remaining two-ninths form a band of
                    mouldings corbelling a broad fillet, which separates the architrave from the
                    frieze; these mouldings are enriched. The frieze (fig. 7), which doe3 not
                    project quite so much as the lowest fascia of the architrave, is, in the
                    Athenian examples, quite plain; but it may be enriched with foliage, or made the
                    receptacle of sculpture in low relief. In two examples (one at Selinus, and
                    another at Agrigentum) the frieze has the Doric triglyph. The cornice (fig. 6)
                    projects from the face of the frieze rather more than as much as its whole
                    height, and is composed of bed-mouldings, a corona, and crown-mouldings The
                    first are a carved bead and carved cyma-reversa, the former of which only
                    occupies a portion of the height of the cornice, as the planceer is cut up
                    inwards, in the manner represented by dotted lines in the figure, to a
                    sufficient depth for it; the crown mouldings, which consist of a carved ovolo
                    above a carved bead, are rather more than one-fourth of the whole cornice; and
                    the corona occupies the rest of its height, except that small portion given to
                    the bead of the bed-mould. A fillet above the crown-mouldings, as already
                    intimated, is certainly necessary to complete the order and receive the
                    antefixae, as described in the Doric, for the flank of a temple.</p>
                <p>The pediments in the examples of Ionic are flatter than in those of the Doric,
                    the angle made by the covering cornice with the base being, in a hexastyle, less
                    than 14°. A vertical fillet, with a small moulding, equal in depth to the two
                    crown-mouldings of the cornice, covers them in the pediment, in the place of the
                    cyma-recta or ovolo used in the Doric order. The intercolumniation differs in
                    these examples; in the one it is two diameters, and in the other three diameters
                    and one-sixth.</p>
                <p>A much greater variety is found in the composition of the Ionic than of the Doric
                    order. Indeed, the examples of the Athenian Acropolis alone have neckings.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A curious example of the use
                    of the beautiful necking ornament (as at the Erechtheum) occurs in the gigantic
                    monument in Algeria, called the tomb of the Christian Lady, whose date is
                    supposed to be the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is evidently a
                    rude copy of some such original as the above.</p></note> In all the others the
                    shaft runs up to the corbelled mouldings which bed the block of the volutes, and
                    the flutes finish under them. Neither have they a torus in that congeries, but a
                    bead and ovolo alone, the latter projecting inconveniently under the pendent
                    lines that connect the volutes, and thus the capital is not more than half a
                    diameter in height.</p>
                <p>The Asiatic or the truly Ionian examples of this order are far inferior to those
                    above referred to. Their bases are differently, and certainly less elegantly
                    composed. They are without hypotrachelia, as may have been inferred; they want
                    the torus in the capital; and, in most cases, instead of flowing, pendent lines,
                    they have straight lines connecting the volutes. Their entablatures are not so
                    finely proportioned, nor so delicately executed. The coronas want breadth, and
                    the bed-moulds of the cornice are as much too heavy as those of Athens are
                    perhaps too light. Indeed, upon the whole, they have more of the grossness of
                    Roman architecture than of the delicacy and elegance of Grecian, though the
                    Ionian examples are supposed to be the models of those of Athens. In the
                    celebrated temple of Diana at Ephesus the columns present an almost unique
                    example of the lower parts being sculptured Fine specimens of these are now in
                    the British Museum. The only instance known of sculptured columns is at Narga in
                    Nubia.</p>
                <p>The width of the antae of the Ionic order is determined, as in the Doric, by the
                    soffit of the entablature; and it will, of course, be exactly the same as, or
                    rather less than, the inferior diameter of the column. It is slightly raised,
                    too, from the face of the wall at the ends of which it stands. The base of the
                    antae is, in one of the two examples of the Acropolis, a little deeper than that
                    of the column, having a small projecting moulding between the lower torus and
                    the floor; and the lower torus itself is reeded. In the. other example there is
                    no difference in the form and proportion of the antae and columnar bases, but
                    both the tori are fluted horizontally, with beaded fillets between the flutes.
                    The antae cap consists of a congeries of corbelling mouldings, nearly one-third
                    of a diameter in height. It is divided into three nearly equal parts, the lowest
                    of which is composed of a bead and an ovolo; the second of another bead and a
                    cyma-reversa, all carved; and the third of a plain flat cavetto, with a narrow
                    fillet and small crowning cyma-reversa, forming an abacus (fig. 11.) The necking
                    is like that of the capital, and is enriched in the same manner. The cap or
                    cornice thus formed breaks round the projection of the antae, and is continued
                    along the wall under the entablature the whole length of the building, or till
                    it is impeded by some other construction; and the base is continued in like
                    manner. Attached columns have the voluted capital, but their base is that of the
                    antae; and it is detailed round them and along the wall to which they belong, as
                    with the antae. It must be remembered, however, that the attached columns in the
                    triple temple are about one-ninth less in diameter than those which are
                    insulated, though they are similar in other respects, and. have the same
                    entablature.</p>

                <p>The back of the triple temple, between the attached columna, presents one of the
                    only two examples in Greek architecture of windows, the other being that of the
                    temple of the Giants at Agrigentum. These are rather more than twice their width
                    in height, and are narrower at the top than at the bottom. They rest on a broad,
                    bold sill, which is equal in depth to two-sixths of the opening, and are
                    surrounded externally by a congeries of mouldings, which, with a plain fascia,
                    constitute an architrave. This architrave is one-fourth the opening in width; it
                    diminishes with the window, and in the same proportion, and is returned above in
                    two knees, which are made vertical to its extreme point at the base.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Grecian Corinthian</hi> (Plate XII.)</p>
                <p>The traditionary tale Vitruvius relates regarding the invention of the Corinthian
                    capital (about Callimachus and the basket on the grave of the Corinthian
                    virgin), is the only reason for the name it bears. His account of the origin of
                    this third species of columnar composition is even more absurd than what he
                    gives of the other orders. He says that it-was arranged “to represent the
                    delicacy; of a young girl whose age renders her figure more pleasing and more
                    susceptible of ornaments which may enhance her natural beauty.” With much more
                    reason might the Doric be called the Corinthian order <hi rend="italic">;
                    for,</hi> as previously stated, the oldest existing example of that style is at
                    Corinth; whereas there iβ nothing, either in ruins or authentic records, to
                    prove that the latter was ever known in that city. Columns with foliated
                    capitals are not of very early date in Greece; earlier examples exist in Asia
                    Minor, and foliage adorns the capitals of columns in some of the Pharaonic
                    monuments of Egypt. In the Assyrian sculptures, however, the Corinthian capital
                    is clearly shown. The interior of the temple of Apollo Didymaeus, at Miletus in
                    Ionia, exhibits the earliest example of the acanthus leaf arranged round the
                    drum of a capital in a single row, surmounted by the favourite honeysuckle; but
                    that edifice was constructed about a century before Callimachus is understood to
                    have lived. The only perfect columnar example in Greece itself of this species
                    of foliated capital is of later date than, and is a great improvement on, that
                    of Miletus; it is the beautiful little structure called the choragic monument of
                    Lysicrates at Athens. (Plate XII. figs. 1,2,3.) Specimens of square or antse
                    capitals enriched with foliage are lese uncommon in Greece than of circular or
                    columnar capitals; but they are almost invariably found to have belonged to the
                    interior of buildings, and not to have been used externally. In considering
                    Greek architecture, it is necessary to bear in mind that it ceases almost
                    immediately after the subjection of Greece to the Roman power; for though there
                    are many edifices in that country in the style of columnar arrangement of which
                    we are now speaking besides those referred to, they belong to Roman, not to
                    Greek architecture. The earliest of them, perhaps, and certainly the least
                    influenced by Roman taste, is the structure called the tower of the Winds, or of
                    Andronicus Cyrrhestes, at Athens. The Agora, or Doric portico, as it is
                    sometimes designated, in the same city, is a spurious example of Greek Doric,
                    evidently executed under the Roman domination.</p>
                <p>The importance which the Greeks attached to a graduated stylobate, and the
                    necessity of giving it a relevant proportion in a columnar ordinance, are shown
                    in the building above mentioned, which is the only example of this order of
                    Grecian origin remaining to us. Unlike the Doric and Ionic in its application,
                    this order is represented in a small circular structure, resting on a lofty
                    square basement; and yet, like those orders, it has a stylobate in receding
                    courses (sec Plate XII. fig. 3), and in plan, too, corresponding with the
                    arrangement of the columna, and not with that of the substructure,—this
                    furnishing further proof that the stylobate was considered a part of the
                    columnar ordinance. The Corinthian column is ten diameters in height The base is
                    composed of a torus and fillet; a scotia and another similar fillet, rather less
                    than the former; and a second torus or reversed ovolo, on which rests a third
                    fillet basing the apophyge of the shaft. The shaft diminishes with entasis to
                    five-sixths of its diameter at the hypotrachelium, and, like that of the Ionic
                    order, has twenty-four flutes and fillets. The flutes are semi-ellipses, so deep
                    as nearly to approach semicircles, terminating at the head in leaves, to which
                    the fillets are stalks. The fillets are rather more than one-fourth the width of
                    the flutes. The hypotrachelium is a simple channel or groove immediately under
                    the capital. The capital itself is rather more than 1⅜ diameters in height; its
                    core is a perfect cylinder, in bulk rather less than the superior diameter of
                    the shaft. This is banded by a row of water leaves, whose profile is a flat
                    cavetto, one-sixth of the whole height, and another of leaves of the acanthus,
                    with flowered buttons attaching them to the cylinder. The latter have the
                    contour of a cyma-recta, and occupy one-third of the whole capital. Rather more
                    than another third is occupied by calices and tendrils, which latter support a
                    honeysuckle against the middle of the abacus. This member is in plan a square
                    whose angles are cut off at 45°, and whose sides are deeply concaved. In profile
                    it consists of a narrow fillet, an elliptical cavetto or reversed scotia, and
                    another fillet surmounted by a small ovolo, or rather a moulding whose profile
                    is the quadrant of an ellipse. In the entablature (which is 2⅞∙ diameters in
                    height), the architrave is divided, like that of the Ionic order, into three
                    equal fascias, which are not perpendicular, but incline inwards, so that their
                    lower angles are all in the same vertical line; this impends the surface of the
                    shaft about one-third of the height from the base. The frieze is one plain band,
                    slightly inclining inwards like the fascias of the architraves, and slightly
                    projected beyond them. The cornice consists of a deep congeries of bedmouldings,
                    and a corona, with the accustomed small crownmouldings and fillet. As in the
                    Ionic cornice, additional height is given to the bed-moulds by undercutting the
                    planceer. The cornice is surmounted by a cut fascia supporting honeysuckle
                    antefixae, which may indeed be taken as a part of the order, as the solitary
                    example in question presents it.</p>
                <p>Of Corinthian antae we have no examples, nor indeed have we of insulated columns;
                    but as we find in the Ionic examples quoted that the attached columns are less
                    in proportion to the entablature than those which are insulated, we may conclude
                    that it would be the same with this,—thus reducing the entablature to two
                    diameters, the ordin ary average of that part in Greek columnar
                    architecture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Caryatides, or Caryatic Order</hi> (Plate XII.)</p>
                <p>Besides the three species of columnar arrangement enumerated above, the Greeks
                    employed another in which statues of women occupied the place of columns. The
                    origin of this order is furnished by Vitruvius in a story which is as usual
                    totally unsupported by history or analogy. Nevertheless it has fixed the
                    nomenclature, such figures being called Caryatides, and the arrangement the
                    Caryatic order. The use of representations of human and other figures with or
                    instead of columns is, however, common in Egypt and India; and to the former the
                    Greeks were doubtless indebted for the idea, though they appear to have
                    restricted its application to human female figures. Mr Gwilt infers from varioùs
                    facts connected with the worship of Diana Caryatis, “that the statues <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n441/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0441-0408"/> called Caryatides were originally applied to or
                    used about the temples of Diana; and instead of representing captives or persons
                    in a state of ignominy (according to the Vitruvian story), were in fact nothing
                    more than the figures of the virgins who celebrated the worship of that
                    goddess.”</p>
                <p>Of these Caryatides there is but one existing example. It is the third portion of
                    the triple temple in the Athenian Acropolis, and is a projection from the flank
                    of the principal Ionic structure, formed by a stereobatic dado raised on the
                    stylobate and antae-base mouldings, with a sur-base consisting of a carved bead
                    and carved ovolo covered by a broad listel, with a narrow projecting fillet
                    above it. On this rests a square plinth, supporting a draped female figure, on
                    the head of which there is imposed a circular moulded block, with a deep
                    rectangular abacus, two-thirds of whose face is vertical, and the other third is
                    a cavetto fillet, and small cyma-reversa. The stereobate, including the moulded
                    base of the temple, is about three-fourths the height of the statue pillar with
                    its base and capital. The entablature is rather less than two-fifths of the
                    same, but it consists of architrave and cornice alone, between which parts the
                    height is nearly equally divided. Details will be understood by reference to
                    Plate XII. figs. 4, 5, 6. This Caryatidean portico displays very clearly the
                    arrangement of the ceiling, with its coffers or cassoons. Internally the
                    architrave is plain two-thirds of its height'; of the remaining third rather
                    more than one-half is a plain, slightly projected fascia; the other half is
                    occupied by a carved bead and ovolo. In the absence of a frieze the ceiling
                    rests on this, and is divided by carved beads into panels, which are deeply
                    coffered, and diminished by three horizontal moulded fascias.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of Grecian Mouldings and Ornaments.</hi></p>
                <p>Greek architecture is distinguished for nothing more than for the grace and
                    beauty of its mouldings; and it may be remarked of them generally that they are
                    eccentric, and not regular curves. (Plate XIII.) They must be drawn, for they
                    cannot be described or struck; so that though they may be called circular, or
                    elliptical, it is seldom that they are really so, and if they are, it is
                    evidently the result of chance, and not of design. Hence all attempts to give
                    rules for striking mouldings are worse than useless; the hand alone, directed by
                    good taste, can adapt them to their purpose, and give them the spirit and
                    feeling which render them effective and pleasing.</p>
                <p>The leading outline of Greek moulding is the gracefully flowing cyma. This will,
                    indeed, be found to enter into the composition of almost everything that
                    diverges from a right line; and even combinations of mouldings are frequently
                    made with this tendency. It is concave above and convex below, or the reverse;
                    and though a long and but slightly fleeted line appears to connect two
                    quickly-curving ends, it will always be found that the convexity and the
                    concavity are in exactly the same curve, so that if the moulded surface were
                    reversed, and the one made to assume the place, it would also have the
                    appearance, of the other, and the effect would be the same. It is, in fact, the
                    Hogarthian line of beauty; and it is not a little singular that Hogarth, in his
                    well-known <hi rend="italic">Analysis of Beauty,</hi> although he did not know,
                    and indeed could not have known, the contours of Greek architectural mouldings,
                    has given the principle of them, and, under his line of beauty, has described
                    many of the finest Greek forms. The Roman and Italian mouldings were called
                    Greek in his day, and he assumed them to be so; but they evidently do not agree
                    with his theory, whereas, in principle, the now well-known Greek forms do most
                    completely.</p>
                <p>The cyma-recta is generally found to be more upright and less deeply fleeted than
                    the cyma-reversa; it is almost always the profile of enrichments on flat
                    surfaces, of foliage, of the covering moulding of pediments, of the undercut or
                    hooked mouldings in antae caps, the overhanging not affecting the general
                    principle; and it pervades, as we have said, fleeted architectural lines
                    generally, whether horizontal or vertical. The cyma-reversa has all the variety
                    of inflection that its opposite possesses, but the line connecting its two ends
                    is, for the most part, more horizontal, and its curves are deeper. It pervades
                    many architectural combinations, but is most singularly evinced in the
                    composition of the Greek Doric capital, which is a perfect cyma-reversa, with
                    the ends slightly but sharply fleeted, as it flows out of the shaft below, and
                    turns in under the abacus above. This may not be obvious, from the annulets
                    dividing the cyma into an ovolo and a cavetto, but the principle is clear.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The presence of the cyma in
                    the Doric capital was, we believe, first pointed out by Mr T. L. Donaldson, in a
                    supplementary volume to Stuart’s <hi rend="italic">A thcns.</hi></p></note> The
                    cyma is the governing outline in the congeries of mouldings in bases also, as
                    may be noticed in the Ionic and Corinthian examples quoted and referred to.</p>
                <p>An ovolo is but the upper half of a cyma-reversa, even when it is used as a
                    distinct moulding, and unconnected with the waving form. The name expresses its
                    apparent rather than its real tendency; for its contour is not that of an egg in
                    any section, though the ornament which is carved on it, when used as a running
                    moulding, is formed like an egg; and from that the moulding was named.</p>
                <p>The upper torus of a base forms, with the escape or apophyge of the shaft, a
                    perfect cyma, and the scotia and lower torus do the same; so that the torus and
                    scotia are referable to the same principle when in composition, and they are not
                    found together except in the combination referred to.</p>
                <p>The bead is an independent moulding, varying in contour; but it is generally the
                    larger segment of a circle. It is used, however, sometimes to mask the waving
                    form, and sometimes to separate it.</p>
                <p>The cavetto, or simple hollow, is part of a cyma also, as has been shown; but it
                    is also applied independently to obviate a sharp angle, or to take from the
                    formality of a vertical line, as in the abaci of Ionic antae caps. Its form,
                    nevertheless, is not the segment of a circle, for the upper part of a cavetto is
                    the most fleeted, and it falls below almost into a straight line.</p>
                <p>There is a hooked moulding common in Greek architecture, particularly in the
                    Doric antae caps, which is technically called the hawk’s-beak. It is a
                    combination of curves which cannot be described in words; but it has been
                    already referred to in speaking of the cyma-recta, which is brought into its
                    composition. This hawk’s beak is a completely Gothic moulding, and throws a very
                    bold, clear shadow. It is used generally to the antae; and the fact that these
                    were for the most part under the shadow of the peristyle, furnishes good reason
                    for the employment of such a moulding.</p>
                <p>The cyma-recta is never found carved, nor sunk within itself; but it sometimes
                    has the honeysuckle, or some other ornament of the kind, wrought on it in
                    relief, particularly when used as the covering moulding—the cymatium—or a
                    pediment. The enrichment of the cyma-reversa consists of a contrasted repetition
                    of its own contour meeting in a broad point below, and joining by a circular
                    line above, making a sort of tongued or leafed ornament, whose surface is
                    inflected horizontally also. Between the leaves a dart-formed tongue is wrought,
                    extending from the circular flexure above to the bottom of the moulding, whose
                    contour it takes in front alone. As this would not mitre or join well on the
                    angles of the cyma, a honeysuckle is <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0444-0409"/> gracefully introduced in the manner shown in
                    Plate XIII. This enrichment is not wrought in relief on the moulding, but is
                    carved into it, so that the surfaces of the parts of the ornament alone retain
                    the full outline of the cyma. The ovolo is enriched with what is called the egg
                    and dart ornament. This will be best understood by reference to the plate. Its
                    angles also are made with a honeysuckle, and the inflections are made in the
                    moulding itself. The torus is sometimes enriched with the interlaced ornament
                    called the guillochos; this, too, is cut into the moulding itself. We have no
                    Greek example of an enriched scotia, and from its form and position, which, to
                    be effective, must be below the eye, it hardly seems susceptible of ornament
                    which could operate beneficially. The bead is carved in spheres or slightly
                    prolate spheroids, with two thin rings or buttons, dilated at their axes, placed
                    vertically between them. A cavetto is not enriched at all, nor is the hawk’s
                    beak, except by painting, which does not appear to have been an uncommon mode of
                    enriching mouldings among the Greeks; that is, the ornament was painted on the
                    moulded surface instead of being carved into it. Fascias are also found enriched
                    by painted running ornaments, such as the fret or meander, the honeysuckle, and
                    the lotus. Sometimes plain colour was given to a member, to heighten the effect
                    it was intended to produce. Ornaments were also painted and gilt on the coffered
                    panels of ceilings.</p>
                <p>The few examples which exist of sculptured ornament on straight surfaces exhibit
                    varieties of nearly the same combinations as those last mentioned,—the
                    honeysuckle, with the lotus, and sometimes a variety of itself, on scrolls,
                    either throwing out tendrils, or plain. This is found on the necking of the
                    Ionic columns of the Athenian Acropolis, and on those of their antae, continuing
                    along under the congeries of mouldings, as previously described. The varieties
                    of foliage used in the enrichments of Greek architecture are few, and will be
                    found generally exemplified in the Corinthian capital of the choragic monument
                    of Lysicratee, and in the rich acroteral pedestal or stem of the same edifice,
                    than which we possess no more elaborate specimen of foliated enrichment of the
                    Greek school. There exist many specimens of architectural ornament on vases and
                    fragments, in marble and terra-cotta, in which human figures, both male and
                    female, are composed, with a greater variety of foliage than is generally found
                    in Greek architectural works; and many of the beautiful marble and bronze
                    utensils discovered in Herculaneum and Pompeii have enrichments obviously of
                    Greek origin, from which, as well as from the specimens of ornament on positive
                    architectural monuments, we may judge of their productions generally, as well as
                    acquire or imbibe something of the fine taste which originated them. It will be
                    remarked at once that Greek ornamentation is quite conventional, and that the
                    plain scroll forms its main feature. The leaf-work is clasped round it, and
                    helps to fill up the surface, and pleasingly vary the outline, but the scroll is
                    prominent throughout. Then there is a peculiarity in the mode of carving the
                    ornamentation. The scroll is not rounded off, as in the Roman, like the branch
                    of a tree, but stands squarely and sharply out from the surface, so as to throw
                    a well-defined sharp shadow. So with the foliage, whose leaves also, in place of
                    having the rounded section used by the Romans, are cut sharply either with a
                    square or triangular section, giving again a strong contrast of light and
                    shade.</p>
                <p>It may be inferred from some existing edifices, particularly the choragic
                    monuments, that the Doric columnar style was not used by the Greeks except for
                    the temples of the gods and some of their accessories. But whether this arose—if
                    the feeling really did exist—from the sanctity of its character, in consequence
                    of that appropriation, or from the difficulty of moulding it to general
                    purposes, cannot be determined. It is very certain, however, that the few
                    structures which do exist of Greek origin, not of a religious character, are
                    either Ionic or Corinthian, or a mixture of one of them with some of the
                    features of the Doric; and in all Greece and the Grecian colonies, except Ionia,
                    there are very few examples of religious edifices not of the Doric order, and
                    none which are of the Corinthian.</p>
                <p>Like the architecture of Egypt, that of Greece is known to us principally by
                    means of its sacred monuments, and from them is deduced almost all we know of
                    its principles. The Doric temples of the Greeks are uniform in plan, and differ
                    only in arrangement and proportion, according to their size; for every part
                    depends on the same modulus. It has been said that if the dimensions of a single
                    column, and the proportion the entablature should bear to it, were given to two
                    individuals acquainted with the style, with directions to compose a hexastyle
                    peripteral temple, or one of any other description, they would produce designs
                    exactly similar in size, arrangement, features, and general proportions,
                    differing only, if at all, in the relative proportions of minor parts, and
                    slightly, perhaps, in the contour of some of the mouldings. This can only be the
                    case with the Doric, and it arises from the intercolumniation being determined
                    by the arrangement of the frieze with triglyphs and metopes; the frieze bearing
                    a certain proportion in the entablature to the diameter of the column, and so
                    on, in such a manner that the most perfect harmony is preserved between all the
                    parts. Thus (Plate IX. fig. 1) the column is so many of its diameters in height;
                    it diminishes gradually from the base upwards, with a slightly convexed tendency
                    or swelling downwards; and is superimposed by a capital proportioned to it, and
                    coming within its height. The entablature is so many diameters high also, and is
                    divided, according to slightly varying proportions, into three parts
                    —architrave, frieze, and cornice. A triglyph bearing a certain proportion to the
                    diameter of the column is drawn immediately over its centre; the metope is then
                    set off equal to the height of the frieze; another triglyph is drawn, which
                    hangs over the void; then a metope as before; and a second triglyph, the centre
                    of which is the central line for another column; and so on to the number
                    required, which, in a front, will be four, six, eight, or teη columns, as the
                    case may be, the temple being tetrastyle, hexastyle, octastyle, or decastyle;
                    and on the flanks twice the number of those on the front and one more, counting
                    the columns at the angles both ways. Thus, if the rules be strictly followed, a
                    hexastyle temple will have thirteen columns on each flank, an octastyle
                    seventeen, and so on. It must be observed, however, that to ease the columns at
                    the angles, they are not placed so that the triglyph over them shall impend
                    their centre as the others, but are set in towards the next columns, so far that
                    a line let fall from the outer edge of the triglyph will touch the
                    circumferential line of the column at the base, or at its greatest diameter. It
                    has been generally thought that the object in this disposition was to bring the
                    triglyph to the extreme angle, to obviate the necessity of a half-metope there;
                    and many imitators have puzzled themselves to no avail to effect it without
                    contracting the intercolumniation or elongating the first metope; though it is
                    perfectly obvious that the intention of the Greek architects was to ease the
                    columns in those important situations of a part of their burden, and for no such
                    purpose as Vitnιvius and his disciples have thought. Indeed, this has been a
                    problem to the whole school, which their master proposed, and which they have
                    settled only by putting a half-metope beyond the outer triglyph, thus preserving
                    the intercolumniation equal» but <pb break="no"

                    stable than the Greek architects judiciously thought they should be. Besides
                    contracting the intercolumniation, the Greeks also made the comer columns a
                    little larger than the rest, thus counteracting in every way the danger that
                    might accrue to them, or to the structure through them, from their exposed and
                    partly unconnected situation. The graduated pyramidal stylobate on which the
                    structure rests also bears a certain proportion to the standard which is measure
                    of all the rest; and so every part is determined by the capacity of the
                    sustaining power.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We
                    cannot discover that the elevation of the pediment depended so immediately on

                    be about one diameter and a half in height.</p></note> Though the Doric order
                    thus possesses, as it were, a self-proportioning power, which will secure
                    harmony in its composition under any circumstances, yet skill and taste in the

                    arrangement <hi rend="italic">in antis</hi> is not common in Greek architecture,
                    though there are examples of it, generally of the Doric order. The inner
                    porticoes, or pronaoi, of peripteral temples are, for the most part, placed <hi
                    rend="italic">in antis,</hi> as may be seen by reference to the examples in
                    which columns stand between the antae. The Ionic temples of Athens are the
                    principal examples of the simple prostyle. They may be called apteral, if it be
                    necessary to distinguish them from peripteral, as the latter are prostylar; but
                    the former term alone is sufficient. Neither does Greek architecture present
                    more than one example, and that is at Athens also, of an amphiprostyle, except
                    in the same peripteral structures, which are also amphiprostylar. Almost all the
                    Doric temples are peripteral, and being peripteral, they are, as a matter of
                    course, amphiprostylar, as has been just remarked <hi rend="italic">; so</hi>
                    that the former term alone is used in describing an edifice of that kind, with
                    the numeral which expresses the number of columns in each of its prostyles.
                    There are but two known examples of Greek antiquity of a pseudo-peripteral
                    structure—the gigantic fane of Jupiter Olympius at Agrigentum, and the
                    nine-columned edifice at Paestum. The former is not even prostyle, for the
                    columns on its fronts are attached, as well as those on its flanks. The dipteral
                    arrangement is found at Selinus, in an octastyle temple; and in some cases the
                    porticoes of peripteral temples have a pseudo-dipteral projection, though no
                    perfect example of the pseudo-dipteral exists.</p>
                <p>The Doric order was never used by the Greeks in mere prostyles; consequently
                    there is no Doric temple of the tetrastyle arrangement, for it is incompatible
                    with the peri pteral, the tetrastyle examples which do exist being all Ionic.
                    Athens itself, containing a Doric tetraprostyle, may seem to contradict this;
                    but in speaking of Greek architecture, we exclude all the examples, even in
                    Greece itself, which were executed under the Roman dominion, for they bear the
                    Roman impress; and among these is the portico referred to. With very few
                    exceptions, all the Doric temples of the Greeks are hexastyle. Their queen,
                    however, the unmatched Parthenon, is octastyle; and the pseudo-peripteral fane
                    of Jupiter Olympius at Agrigentum, just referred to, presents the singular
                    arrangement, heptastyle. The misshapen monument called the Basilica, at Paestum,
                    the Thersites of its style, has a front of nine columns, or an enneastyle
                    arrangement. The temples of Jupiter Olympius at Athens, and of Apollo at
                    Branchidae, had each a front of ten columns.</p>
                <p>It may be here remarked in support of the opinion we have given as to the
                    authority of Vitruvius, that, according to him, peripteral temples have on each
                    flank twice the number of intercolumniations they have in front,— thus giving to
                    a hexastyle eleven, to an octastyle fifteen columns, and so on,—whereas in the
                    Greek temples this is never the case, for they always h ave more. The best
                    examples have two, some have only one, but many have three, and in one instance
                    there are four, more intercolumniations in flank than in front. The famous
                    temple at Ephesus, recently disinterred by Mr Wood, has seven intercolumniations
                    in front, and nineteen on the flanks. Again, he limits the internal hypaethral
                    arrangement to those structures which are externally decastyle and dipteral,
                    though an example, he says, existed in Greece of an octastyle hypae-thros, and
                    that was a Roman structure. Now the Parthenon is an octastyle hypaethros; but
                    all the other hypaethral temples, both in Greece and her colonies, are
                    hexastyles, except, perhaps, the octastyle-dipteral at Selinus, and there is no
                    evidence that the Greeks ever constructed a decastyledipteral temple, except
                    that of Apollo Didymaeus at Branchidae.</p>
                <p>A Greek temple, whose columnar arrangement is simply <hi rend="italic">in
                    antis,</hi> whether distyle or tetrastyle, consists of pronaos and naos or
                    cella. A tetraprostyle may have behind it a pronaos and naos. An amphiprostyle
                    has, in addition to the preceding, a posticum, but is not understood to have a
                    second entrance. The porticoes of a peripteral temple are distinguished as the
                    porticus and posticum, and the lateral ambulatories are incorrectly called
                    peristyles. It may, indeed, be here suggested, that as the admixture of Latin
                    with Greek terms in the description of a Grecian edifice cannot be approved of,
                    it would, perhaps, be better to apply the term <hi rend="italic">stoa</hi> to
                    the colonnaded platform or ambitus altogether, and distinguish the various parts
                    of it by the addition of English adjectives <hi rend="italic">; or</hi> the
                    common term portico would be quite as well with front, back, and side, or
                    lateral, prefixed, as the case may be. Within the back and front stoas or
                    porticoes, then, a peripteral temple has similar arrangements <hi rend="italic"
                    >in antis,</hi> which are relatively termed the pronaos and opisthodomus, with
                    an entrance only from the former; unless there should exist, as there does in
                    the Parthenon, a room or chamber within the opisthodomus, supposed to be the
                    treasury, in which case a door opens into it from the latter. Besides these, a
                    Greek temple consists only of a cell in those which are cleithral, and of a
                    naos, which is divided into nave and aisles, to use modern ecclesiastical terms,
                    in an hypaethral temple.</p>
                <p>In comparing the Greek temple with the Egyptian, a marked difference at once
                    appears. The cella is the nucleus of both. But whereas the Egyptian was almost
                    hidden within a series of chambers for the priests, and surrounded by enormous
                    enclosed courts, the Greek was made the one prominent object, and the subject of
                    the highest efforts of art.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n446/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0446-0411"/>
                <p>Nothing was allowed to interfere with it or to abate its predominance. The tympan
                    was the place in which the highest efforts of the sculptor were placed, the
                    purest example of it being at the Parthenon. At Aegina the figures were entirely
                    detached. Above the pediment at the top, and at the sides, were some very
                    beautiful ornaments—the acroteria. These were in so prominent a position, and so
                    delicately carved, that very few remains of them are left to us. The roofs were
                    covered with thin slabs, or tiles, of marble, and the ends of the ribs, which
                    covered their joints, were ornamented with antefixae, forming a graceful finish
                    to the flanks. These were mostly of marble, but at Aegina they were of
                    terra-cotta. Further, in order to discharge the water from the gutters, were
                    lions’ heads, the original of our gurgoyles. The gutters themselves were made on
                    the top member of the cornice. It is singular that we have no accurate
                    description of the interior of a temple, nor any information as to how it was
                    ceiled or lighted. We know that the cella had often a row of columns round it
                    internally, and that upon this row was a second, as at the temples of Ceres at
                    Eleusis, Minerva at Tegea, Neptune at Paestum, and Jupiter at Aegina. At the
                    temple of the Giants at Agrigentum a row of figures took the place of the upper
                    columns. We may fairly suppose, then, that the first row supported a gallery
                    much as in our Triforia. But as to the roof there is more dif-culty. The span
                    would be too great for flat marble beams, and would have a very poor and
                    depressing effect. To obviate this difficulty Mr Fawkener suggests that the
                    ceilings were arched, and a medal which shows the temple of Juno at Samos
                    certainly appears to favour this theory. But another difficulty remains, viz.,
                    as to the light, for there were no windows; and the only light, therefore, if no
                    other access for it were made, would have been through the doorway itself,
                    deeply buried behind a massive portico. Vitruvius alludes to this in his third
                    book, where he describes a hypaethral temple as being “<hi rend="italic"
                    >sine</hi><hi rend="italic">tecto</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sub</hi><hi rend="italic">divo."</hi> But he states himself that this
                    arrangement was rare, and if the cella was really in any case open to the sky,
                    one can scarcely imagine how the delicate statues of ivory and gold could have
                    been protected from the weather. At Bassae some remains of roof tiles have been
                    found, the centre part of which were open, and might thus have formed small
                    openings for light. But the difficulty as to the statues remains. Mr Fergusson’s
                    solution of the problem is very ingenious, and so satisfactory that it seems to
                    require only some reference to his arrangement in any of the old sculptures or
                    writers to make it generally received. He supposes that the inner columns
                    supported a sort of clerestory, formed by a channel on each side along the roof.
                    This would give an excellent light, and the statues could easily be protected.
                    This theory does not fulfil Vitruvius’s description “<hi rend="italic"
                    >sine</hi><hi rend="italic">tecto,</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi> but he is
                    generally so inaccurate in his references to Greek work that this objection does
                    not seem to be very formidable.</p>
                <p>According to the rules of Vitruvius, all temples should face east and west, and
                    the door should be to the west; but in reality the doors in Ionia, Attica, and
                    Sicily were to the east. The temple at Bassae faces north and south, but it has
                    a side door also. The temple was usually approached by a flight of steps, of an
                    uneven number, so that the worshipper might place his right foot on the first
                    step, and again on the temple floor. The ceilings of the porticoes and
                    colonnades were formed by great beams of marble, and the spaces of the
                    intercolumns were thus limited. Th13 appears to be the reason for the closed
                    colonnade of the temple of the Giants at Agrigentum, as the spaces between the
                    columns, if open, as usual, would have been too wide to be spanned by a flat
                    beam.</p>
                <p>The only pure Greek architectural works besides temples that remain to us, and of
                    which we have certain information, are propylaea, choragic monuments, and
                    theatres. The propylaeum, or propylaea, as applied to the Acropolis of Athens,
                    is the entrance or gateway through the wall of the peribolus. It consists of a
                    Doric hexaprostyle portico internally, with a very singular arrangement of its
                    columns, the central intercolumniation being ditriglyph. This was done,
                    probably, to allow a certain procession to pass, which would have been
                    incommoded by a narrower space. Within the portico there is a deep recess,
                    similar to the pronaos in a temple, but without columns <hi rend="italic">in
                    antis</hi>; a wall pierced with five doorways, corresponding to the
                    intercolumnia-tions of the portico, close to the entrance; and beyond it is a
                    vestibule, divided into three parts by two rows of three Ionic columns, and
                    forming an outer portico, fronted externally by a hexaprostyle exactly similar
                    to that on the outside. Right and left of it, and setting out about one
                    intercolumniation of the portico from its end columns, at right angles, are two
                    small triastyle porticoes <hi rend="italic">in antis,</hi> with chambers behind
                    them. These have been called temples, but most probably they were nothing more
                    than porters’ lodges or guard-houses. The whole structure, though extremely
                    elegant and possessing many beauties, is not a good architectural composition:
                    the unequal intercolumniation detracts from its simplicity and harmony. The use
                    of Ionic columns in a Doric ordinance is equally objectionable; and their
                    elevation from the floor of the portico on insulated pedestals is even worse,
                    though their intention is obvious; and without raising them, the ceiling might
                    have been too low, or they must have been made taller. The uneven style of the
                    small temples or lodges is not pleasing, even though they be taken as flank and
                    not as front compositions; and, moreover, their entablature abuts indefinitely
                    against the walls of the larger structure, both internally and externally, to
                    the total destruction of the harmony of the general composition. Indeed, the
                    unequal heights of the entablature of the greater ordinance involves a fault
                    which would require more than all the beauties of detail and harmony of
                    proportion to countervail, if it were not impossible to embrace them in one
                    view.</p>
                <p>The choragic monument of Lysicrates (or Lantern of Demosthenes), at Athens (Plate
                    XII.), is a small structure, consisting of an elegant quadrangular basement or
                    podium, which is more than two-fifths of the whole height, surmounted by a
                    cyclostyle of six Corinthian columns, attached to, and projecting rather more
                    than one-half from a wall which perfects the cylinder up to the top of their
                    shafts, where it forms a stand for tripods the height of the capital. A
                    characteristic entablature rests on the columns, and receives a tholus or dome,
                    which is richly ornamented, and terminates in a foliated and heliced acroterium.
                    To this Stuart has added dolphins as supporters, and has placed on the summit a
                    tripod, which was the prize in the choragic festival; thus completing, perhaps,
                    the most beautiful composition in its style ever executed. In Vitruvian
                    language, the arrangement of this edifice would be called monopteral; but it is
                    more correctly cyclostylar, or, perhaps, because of the wall or core, it may be
                    termed a pseudo or attached cyclostyle. The basement of this monument is
                    eminently bold and simple, admirably proportioned to the rest of the structure,
                    and harmonising perfectly with it. The columnar ordinance is the only perfect
                    specimen of the style in existence of pure Greek origin. It has never been
                    surpassed, and is, perhaps, unequalled. The most exquisite harmony reigns
                    throughout its composition; it is simple without being poor, and rich without
                    being meretricious.</p>
                <p>Totally different in style and arrangement, and far inferior in merit, is the
                    choragic monument of Thrasyllus.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n447/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0447-0412"/>
                <p>It bears, however, the impress of the Grecian mind. This composition is merely a
                    front to a cave, consisting of three pilasters, proportioned and moulded like
                    Doric antae, and supporting an entablature similar in style, but too shallow to
                    harmonise with them. Above the entablature there is an attic or parapet, divided
                    into three compartments horizontally. The two external form tablets, with a
                    cornice or impost on them; and the central is composed of three receding
                    courses, on the summit of which is seated a draped human figure, whether male or
                    female, in its mutilated state, is not determinable. The entablature has laurel
                    wreaths instead of triglyphs in the frieze, and it would appear as if the
                    absence of the triglyph had deranged the whole composition. The two outer
                    pilasters are of good proportion, and the architrave is well proportioned to
                    them; but the frieze and cornice are both too narrow, and the spaces between the
                    pilasters, equivalent to intercolumnia-tions, are too wide. The third pilaster,
                    itself inharmonious, is absurdly narrow, and, standing immediately under the
                    statue, evidently to support it, its meagreness is the more obvious and
                    striking. In spite of all this, the general outline of the structure is simple
                    and pleasing; the detail is elegant, and the execution spirited and effective.
                    This little monument is, however, a proof that the Greeks were not at all times
                    so excellent in architectural compositions as in the self-composing Doric
                    temples, and in the choragic monument of Lysicrates; and to this evidence may be
                    added that of the triple temple in the Acropolis of Athens, already
                    described.</p>
                <p>In concluding this notice as to temples, we must now allude to one example, very
                    beautiful in itself, but an exception to all rules—the Erechtheum at Athens. It
                    consists of an Ionic hexaprostyle in front (Plate XI. fig. 1), resting on a
                    bold, continuous, and well-proportioned stylobate, and forming the entrance to a
                    parallelogramic cella, but, from all that has yet been discovered, without a
                    pronaos <hi rend="italic">in antis.</hi> The back front consists of four
                    columns, like those of the portico, attached <hi rend="italic">in antis;</hi>
                    and the flanks are broad and bold, crowned by the well-proportioned and chaste
                    entablature, with the enriched congeries of mouldings and running ornament of
                    the antae under it. In the absence of a pronaos to give depth to the portico,
                    the composition was defective, but otherwise simple and harmonious. It was
                    enlarged by the attachment of a tetraprostyle to one of its sides, Ionic
                    certainly, like that in front, but different both in manner and in size;
                    beautiful in itself, but a blot on the main building, with which it harmonises
                    in no one particular, for the apex of its pediment only reaches to the cornice
                    of the other. In a similar situation, against the other side, is attached a
                    similar arrangement of Caryatides, a tetraprostyle of female figures raised on a
                    lofty basement, and yet not reaching to the entablature of the main building
                    —according in no one particular either with it or with the portico on the other
                    side, and altogether forming one of the most heterogeneous compositions to be
                    found in ancient art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tombs.</hi> —These, the grandest structures next to the
                    temples in Egypt, present little worthy of notice in Greece proper; but in the
                    colonies there are several of considerable importance. The grandest are in Caria
                    and Lycia, to some of which, constructed much after the ancient outlines of the
                    Lycian, Ac., reference has already been made. The most singular of the pure
                    Greek tombs are cut in the face of the solid rock, not in the forms of the
                    ancient rock-cut tombs, but much resembling those of the temple.</p>
                <p>The rock-cut tombs, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> at Telmissus (Lycia),
                    usually have a portico of columns <hi rend="italic">in antis,</hi> with one or
                    more chambers behind. In one example these are about 12 feet by 9 feet, and 6
                    feet high.</p>
                <p>Most of the columns are Ionic, few being Doric. In one case, the whole tomb,
                    which is 18 feet 6 inches deep, has been quite detached, the whole excavation
                    being 26 feet deep from the face of the rock. Many of these tombs present
                    curious examples of wooden details imitated in stone, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the doors are often exactly like those of wood, the panels, nails,
                    knockers, &amp;c.,being copied in stone.</p>
                <p>Of a totally different class is a tomb at Cnidus, in Caria, discovered by Mr C.
                    T. Newton. It consists of a square, low basement resting on four steps, and
                    carrying four engaged Doric columns, with a cornice over the whole, being about
                    31 feet square on the basement. Above the cornice are gradini, forming a sort of
                    pyramid of steps, having at the summit a lion, now in the British Museum.
                    “Inside was a beehiveshaped chamber, with vaulting similar to that of the
                    treasury of Atreus at Mycene, and with eleven smaller cells radiating from its
                    circumference” (Newton). Its supposed date is about 396 B. c.</p>
                <p>More beautiful in detail is the tomb known as the Trophy, discovered by Sir C.
                    Fellows, at Xanthus. It consists of a peristyle of fourteen Ionic columns,
                    standing on a high basement about 33 feet by 22, which has, to all appearance,
                    no access to it. In the centre, behind the columns, is a cella apparently solid
                    also. The date usually given to this is about 540. But the edifice seems to be
                    somewhat too refined in detail for this time, and another date assigned to it,
                    viz., about 385, appears to be more likely. This would be about half-way, in
                    point of time, between the Erechtheum and the temple at Priene.</p>
                <p>More curious, though less elegant, is another tomb at Mylasa, in Caria, which has
                    a high, square basement with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n448/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0448-0413"/> a chamber in it. Over this, on each face, are two
                    columns <hi rend="italic">in antis,</hi> with entablature, the space between the
                    columns being quite clear. Over the cornice are placed great stone beams,
                    anglewise; on these, others, again, crosswise; so that the bearing is rapidly
                    diminished, and a rough sort of dome formed, resembling those so often found in
                    India. But of all Greek tombs the grandest was that of Mausolus, at
                    Halicarnassus, in Caria, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, which
                    has given its name to all succeeding great tombs. Its date is about 352 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> Mausolus having died in 353. It was erect until the
                    10th century. Since then it has been so utterly ruined that there was doubt as
                    to its actual site. This was indicated by Professor Donaldson; and in 1857, Mr
                    Newton discovered the actual remains. “It consisted of a lofty basement, on
                    which stood an oblong Ionic edifice surrounded by thirty-six Ionic columns, and
                    surmounted by a pyramid of twenty-four steps. The whole structure, 140 feet in
                    height, was crowned by a chariot group in white marble, on which, probably,
                    stood Mausolus himself” (Newton). The size of the basement was 114 feet by 92. A
                    considerable number of the fragments are now in the British Museum. The name of
                    the architect was Pythius, and the sculpture, with which the edifice was richly
                    adorned, was executed by four celebrated sculptors, of whom we may especially
                    particularise Scopas, as he was also the architect of the celebrated temple of
                    Tegea.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theatres.</hi> —The Greek theatre deserves a short notice.
                    It was entirely different from ours, having neither pit, boxes, nor roof, except
                    the usual velarium, as a protection from the sun. Its plan was somewhat more
                    than a semicircle, having seats cut out of the side of some hill convenient for
                    the purpose. Round the top was a colonnade, and at the back of the stage was the
                    scena. This and the colonnade combined in an artistic way, must have formed a
                    very effective composition. At first the theatres were of wood; the first of
                    stone, at Athens, having been built, it is said, about the middle of the 4th
                    century. Vitruvius makes some very singular statements as to the acoustic
                    details of the theatres, but they have not been verified, and are not, in fact,
                    quite understood. The theatres at Argos and Ephesus were 450 and 600 feet in
                    diameter respectively, whereas Covent Garden Theatre, London, including the
                    corridors, is only 100 feet.</p>
                <p>HotτsES, &lt;fcc.—No remains exist of the domestic structures of the Greeks. It
                    may be taken for granted that the houses were less extensive than those of the
                    Romans, as they were a poorer and less luxurious people; but the exquisite
                    beauty of form and decoration, which pervades every article of Greek origin,
                    whether coin, medallion, vase, implement of war or husbandry, or even the
                    meanest article of domestic or personal use, is evidence of the fine taste with
                    which their mansions must have been furnished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fortifications.</hi> —We have large remains of
                    fortifications in Lycia, though few in Greece proper. They are not so
                    picturesque as the mediaeval, nor, we may say, as the Assyrian. They were
                    massively built of masonry, with square towers at intervals, furnished sometimes
                    with a pediment, sometimes with battlements. The doors and windows on the upper
                    floor are still found at Alinda, in Caria. The Greek shield was often sculptured
                    as hung on the walls. A bas-relief from Pinara, in Lycia, gives a complete
                    sketch of the walls, with circular-topped battle-mente, a postern gate, and
                    various openings, all squareheaded; and a door is shown panelled, like our
                    doors.</p>
                <p>In the construction of their edifices the Greeks seldom, if ever, had recourse to
                    foreign materials—the stone used in their temples being almost invariably from
                    the nearest convenient quarries which supplied it of sufficiently good quality.
                    The structures of Athens are built of marble, from the quarries of Pentelicus,
                    and those of Agrigentum, of a fossil conglomerate which the place itself
                    furnished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Résumé.</hi> —Taking now a rapid view of what we owe to the
                    Greeks as architects, we may assume that the invention of columnar architecture
                    is due to the Assyrians; but how far this had advanced before the Greeks began
                    to practise it, we cannot as yet exactly determine. There is no doubt, however,
                    that it owed to the Greeks the greater part of its beautiful and delicate
                    details. Some of the finest examples of these are to be found at Athens in the
                    Theseum, Parthenon, Propylaea, and Erechtheum, ranging in date from 469 to 409
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Not only do we find there the most beautiful
                    mouldings and other ornaments, but the most refined methods of obviating the
                    minute defects in outline supposed to be caused by optical illusion. The lines
                    of the shafts, for instance, in place of being perfectly straight, were slightly
                    expanded between the base and necking, so as to form a very delicate curve
                    (entasis). The apparent depression of the top of the cornice, supposed to be
                    caused by the extra weight in the centre of the pediment, was obviated by
                    curving the cornice so that the centre part was the highest. The steps were
                    curved in a similar way. Then the whole of the columns of the peristyle sloped
                    towards the centre. The architrave and frieze in the Parthenon followed the same
                    slope of about 1 in 80, but its boldly overhanging cornice and antefixae sloped
                    forwards about 1 in 100.</p>
                <p>We owe also to the Greeks one new form in art—the pediment. It is not found in
                    Egypt; some slight suggestions as to its use may, perhaps, be found in the
                    sculptures of Assyria, but in Greece it forms the crowning feature of every
                    temple; and simple as the invention may seem, it led the way to a succession of
                    others, which resulted in the grand gables of our Gothic architecture.</p>
                <p>The details of the Grecian temples were heightened by colour and gold. Of the
                    former, Dr Faraday detected many traces on the sculptures of the British Museum;
                    and clear indications of it have been found in many of the ruins both in Greece
                    proper and in the colonies. In fact, colour, or tinting of some kind, seems to
                    have been absolutely requisite in order to relieve the monotonous and dazzling
                    effect of new white marble. A striking example of this occurred recently when
                    the palace of the king was built at Athens. The newly-worked marble had much the
                    appearance of a smooth stucco or brilliant whitewash. But this would serve (and
                    doubtless did serve in ancient times) as an admirably delicate base for
                    decorative work in colour and gold.</p>
                <p>What the effect was of a Greek temple, in all its glory, we can no more judge
                    than we can in the case of one of ancient Egypt. For there is not one that is
                    not a mere wreck; and even the most ambitious of modern copies, the Walhalla,
                    wants the exquisitely delicate material out of which the Parthenon was wrought,
                    and the sculpture which no modern Phidias was living to supply. But in Greece
                    proper there was but this one type, viz., that of the pedimented temple with its
                    colonnade. There was no arch, as in Assyria, to span an opening too wide for a
                    stone beam; no dome to vary the outline by its bold and graceful form; no curved
                    outline, as at Mycenae, to vary that of the rectangle.</p>
                <p>The form adopted by the Greeks was worked out in a manner which leaves all others
                    of ancient art, wrought in the same likeness, far behind; and the details which
                    adorned that form charm the eye with their exquisitely chaste beauty. But in our
                    admiration of them we must not forget that numerous other forms, beautiful in
                    themselves, and familiar in their beauty to the Assyrians and Pelasgi, as they
                    are to us, were unknown to, or neglected by, the Greeks.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Etruscan Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>Little of the history of Etruria is as yet known, for accounts of Roman
                    historians are not to be relied on, and the Etruscan language is as yet unread.
                    Our acquaintance with its architecture, too, is very meagre, for the
                    comparatively few remains show us simply the forms used by the Etruscans in
                    their tombs; and even these have been as yet imperfectly explored, owing to the
                    nature of the climate, and the desolation of those parts of the country in which
                    they are chiefly found. Little was, in fact, known of them at all until the
                    careful descriptions of Sig. Canina and Mr Dennis appeared, from whose works the
                    principal ascertained facts are derived. The sites of the Etruscan towns are
                    nearly all on or near a line, curving slightly from the sea, extending from
                    Fiesole, near Florence, through Arretium, Cortona, Volsinii, and Falerii, to
                    Rome. The only sites of much importance near the sea were Cossa and Tar quinii.
                    The towns were generally planted on the tops of high hills, as if for the
                    purpose of defence. Much of the town-walling remains in various places, as at
                    Fiesole, Cortona, Cossa, and Volterra, and furnishes grand examples both of the
                    polygonal and of the squared masonry, which has been described as belonging to
                    the early period of Greek architecture.</p>
                <p>The tombs were of two classes, the first being nearly of the same external form
                    as that described at ∙Tantalais, viz., with a massive stereobate, circular in
                    plan, having one or more chambers in the centre of it, and above it a tumulus of
                    earth. Of these, hundreds of specimens of various sizes remain. At Volci there
                    was one 240 feet in diameter. The grandest of all is, perhaps, that at Cervetri,
                    drawn by Canina, and known as the Regulini Galeassi. The chambers here, and in
                    other instances, are ceiled with oversailing courses of stone, cut into an
                    arched form as at Mycenae. A completely voussoired arch exists over a tomb
                    chamber, known as the Grotto of Pythagoras, at Cortona, but the date of this is
                    very doubtful. In these tombs have been found some of the beautiful specimens of
                    jewellery which adorn the museums of Europe. The mouldings used are very few and
                    simple, but of a section which is quite peculiar to Etruria. They occur in two
                    places only, viz., as a base, and as a capping to the basement. In none of the
                    tombs of the kind above described are found any of the paintings which form so
                    characteristic a feature in the second and better known class of tombs, viz.,
                    those cut in the face of the rock in the vicinity of most of the Etruscan towns.
                    The apparent entrances to these tombs are by doorways of a peculiar form, and
                    often placed very high up the rock But these are false, and merely carved in it,
                    the real entrance being often 40 to 50 feet below. This leads into one or more
                    chambers, which are mostly square, but in some few instances are circular, as at
                    Chiusi, where there is one 25 feet in diameter, supported by a pillar in the
                    centre. Whatever their shape, they are cut out of the solid rock; and,
                    apparently, bore some resemblance to the house which the occupant of the tomb
                    had inhabited during life. None of the chambers are domed or vaulted, all the
                    ceilings being cut in the shape of flat beams or sloping rafters supported by
                    pillars,—another instance of the construction of built edifices being copied in
                    rock-cut caves. One of these, at Cervetri, is given in D Agincourt’s work. There
                    is another chamber at Tarquinii, 50 feet square, supported by four pillars, each
                    6 to 7 feet square.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the chambers were fitted up depended on the mode of burial.
                    Cremation was sometimes used, and then, as at Veii, Sutri, and Toscanella, we
                    find niches for urns. But usually there was a bench cut in the rock round the
                    sides of the chambers, and on them were ranged the sarcophagi, of which
                    specimens are so well known in most of the museums of Europe. In some instances,
                    which seem of a late date, the bodies were placed in recesses.</p>
                <p>The paintings which decorated the chambers were very peculiar, being of the same
                    character, and with figures of divinities, &amp;c., of the same well-known
                    attenuated forms as are found in the earlier vases. The colouring is as peculiar
                    as the drawing, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> at Veii there is a horse depicted
                    with a red neck, yellow mane and tail, one leg yellow spotted with red, and the
                    rest of the horse black. At Tarquinii is another horse with blue mane and hoofs,
                    white tail, and all the rest red. All these paintings were executed, much as
                    were those of the Greeks and Egyptians, on a very thin coating of fine stucco
                    over the rock. In the later tombs domestic scenes appear to have taken the place
                    of the allegorical ones formerly used.</p>
                <p>One of the best examples, though of very late (Roman) date, is a tomb at
                    Cervetri. The chamber was supported on two pillars. In each side of it were
                    recesses, 2 feet in height, each having a bed, with cushion for the head,
                    tassels, &amp;c., all sculptured and painted. The sides and pillars were
                    decorated with painting and sculpture, representing the helmets, shields,
                    swords, and other accoutrements of the officer whose tomb it was. But there were
                    also depicted in the same way the personal ornaments of his wife, her mirrors,
                    jewellery, &amp;c. Her slippers are marked on the floor, and by the side of the
                    recess near, is carved her husband’s walking-stick. Even the kitchen utensils
                    appear in effigy, so as to give the whole fittings of the house of a Roman
                    officer.</p>
                <p>Another class of funeral monument is described to us by some writers, the most
                    noted example being that of the great King Porsena, but the descriptions are too
                    vague to allow of even this being restored with certainty. It is said to have
                    had three ranges of pillars, the lowest one 150 feet high and 75 feet square,
                    standing on a basement 300 feet square. There were five sets of these pillars,
                    viz., one at each angle and one in the centre, and they are said to have been
                    enriched with bronze ornamental work ’at the top of each division. This class of
                    tomb was probably somewhat like one of late date, near Rome, which has been
                    known by various names (the tomb of the Horatii and Curiatii, of Aruns, of
                    Pompey, &lt;fcc.), and if there were two ranges of pillars above, all tied in
                    with metal rings at the point of junction, it would agree tolerably well with
                    what we read of Porsena’s tomb.</p>
                <p>Of Etruscan temples no remains exist, and the accounts of them are so conflicting
                    that any restoration of them must be very uncertain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Roman Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>We have taken it for granted that the Greeks were ignorant or neglectful of the
                    properties of the arch. If the great sewer at Rome, called the Cloaca Maxima,
                    belongs to the time of Tarquinius Priscus, it must be conceded that the
                    properties of the arch were known, and the arch constructed in that city. But it
                    is contended that the Cloaca Maxima, as it now exists, is a work of much more
                    recent date, and that it may have succeeded the sewer constructed by the first
                    Tarquinius, who was, moreover, himself a Greek. It is, however, now certain that
                    the construction of the arch was known to the Egyptians, and used by them at a
                    very early date, although, for some reason which we do not quite understand,
                    they neglected it in their greatest works. That it was known to and made great
                    use of by the Assyrians is also certain. Whoever it was that invented it, and at
                    whatever date, the Romans made extensive practical use of it, and by its means
                    they succeeded in doing what their predecessors in civilisation had never
                    effected. It enabled <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0452-0415"/> them to carry secure and permanent roads across
                    wide and rapid rivers, and to make a comparatively fragile material, such as
                    brick, more extensively useful than the finest marble was in the hands of the
                    Greeks. To the Greeks, however, the Romans were indebted for their knowledge of
                    the more polished forms of columnar architecture. Before the conquest of Greece
                    the structures of Rome appear to have been rude and inelegant, and from that
                    time the existing style of architecture either gave place to the superior merit
                    and beauty of what the Romans found in that country, or was combined with it,
                    though frequently the combination tended to destroy the beauty of both.</p>
                <p>In the transference of Greek columnar architecture to Rome, a great change was
                    effected independently of those combinations, for the Romans could not
                    appreciate the simple grandeur and dignified beauty of the Doric, as it existed
                    in Greece. They appear to have moulded it on what we suppose their own Tuscan to
                    have been; and the result was the mean and characterless ordinance exemplified
                    in the lowest story of the theatre of Marcellus at Rome, and in the temple at
                    Cora, between 30 and 40 miles south of that city. Not less inferior to the
                    Athenian examples of the Ionic order, than the Doric of Cora is to the Doric of
                    Athens, are the mean and tasteless deteriorations of them in the Roman temples
                    of Fortuna Virilis and Concord. It was different, however, with the foliated
                    Corinthian, which became to the Romans what the Doric had been to the
                    Greeks—their national style. But though they borrowed the style, they did not
                    copy the Greek examples. In Rome the Corinthian order assumed a new and not less
                    beautiful form and character, and was varied to a wonderful extent, but without
                    losing its original and distinctive features. The temple of Vesta, at Tivoli,
                    differs from that commonly, but erroneously, named the temple of Jupiter Stator,
                    in Rome, as much as the latter does from the choragic monument of Lysicrates at
                    Athens; all three are among the most beautiful examples of the Corinthian order
                    in existence,—if indeed they are not pre-eminently so,— and yet they do not
                    possess a single proportion in common. It must be confessed, moreover, that if
                    the Romans had not good taste enough to admire the Doric and Ionic models of
                    Greece, they had too much to be fond of their own; for they seldom used them.
                    Both at home and abroad, in all their conquests and colonies, wherever they
                    built, they employed the Corinthian order. Corinthian edifices were raised in
                    Iberia and in Gaul, in Istria and in Greece, in Syria and in Egypt; and to the
                    present day, Nismes, Pola, Athens, Palmyra, and the banks of the Nile, alike
                    attest the fondness of the Romans for that peculiar style. We cannot agree with
                    the generally received opinion, that Greek architects were employed by the
                    Romans after the connection between the two countries took .place; for the
                    difference between the Greek and Roman styles of architecture is not merely in
                    the preference given to one over another peculiar mode of columnar arrangement
                    and composition, but a different taste pervades even the details though the
                    mouldings are the same; they differ more in spirit and character than do those
                    of Greece and Egypt, which certainly would not have been the case if Roman
                    architecture had been the work of Greek architects. Indeed, were it not for
                    historical evidence, which cannot absolutely be refuted, an examination and
                    comparison of the architectural monuments of the two countries would lead an
                    architect to the conclusion, that the Corinthian order had its origin in Italy,
                    and that the almost solitary perfect example of it in Greece was the result of
                    an accidental communication with that country, modified by Greek taste; or that
                    the foliated style was common to both, without either being indebted to the
                    other for it. If, however, Greek architects were employed by the Romans, they
                    must have made their taste and mode of design conform to those of their
                    conquerors much more readily than we can imagine they would as the civilised
                    slaves of barbarian masters; and it cannot be disputed that the Roman
                    architecture is a style essentially distinct from the Greek. This is apparent
                    from the fact that many of the minor works of sculpture in connection with
                    architecture, such as candelabra, vases, and various articles of household
                    furniture, discovered at the villa of Adrian, near Tivoli, and at Herculaneum
                    and Pompeii, are fashioned and ornamented in the Greek style, while others are
                    as decidedly Roman in those particulars,—rendering it evident that such things
                    were either imported from Greece, or that Greek artists and artisans were
                    employed in Italy, who retained their own national taste and modes of design. It
                    is probable that both the architects and the artists, natives of Rome, modified
                    their own less elegant productions by reference to Greek models; but that the
                    Romans derived their architecture entirely from the Greeks, may certainly be
                    disputed.</p>
                <p>Much of the extent and magnificence of the architectural works of the Romans is
                    attributable to their knowledge and use of the arch, which enabled them to
                    utilise inferior materials. Almost all their structures were of brick—
                    aqueducts, palaces, villas, baths, and temples. Of the present remains, only a
                    few columns and their entablatures are of marble or granite, and two or three
                    buildings are of Travertine stone,— all the rest are brick. The Colosseum, the
                    mausoleum of Adrian, the tunnel sewer, the temple of Fortuna Virilis, and the
                    ancient bridges on the Tiber, are of Travertine stone; the remaining columns of
                    the more splendid temples, the internal columns, and their accessories, of the
                    Pantheon, the exterior of the imperial arches, and the cenotaph columns of
                    Trajan and of Antonine, are of marble; but the Imperial Mount of the Palatine,
                    which holds the ruins of the palace of the Caesars, is one mass of brick; the
                    Pantheon, except its portico and internal columns, &amp;c., is of brick; the
                    temples of Peace, of Venus and Rome, and of Minerva Medica, are of brick; and
                    so, for the most part, were the walls of others, though they may have been faced
                    with marble or freestone. The baths of Titus, of Caracalla, and Diocletian, are
                    of brick; the city walls are of brick; so are the extensive remains of the
                    splendid villa of Adrian, and those of the villa of Maecenas at Tivoli; the
                    palaces of the Roman emperors and patricians at Baiae and in other parts of
                    Italy; and so, it may be said, are the remains of Herculaneum and Pompeii, for
                    the houses in these cities are generally built of alternate double courses of
                    brick and courses of stone or lava. In most cases, at Rome and in the provinces,
                    stucco formed the surface which received the decorations. From the above
                    enumeration, it will appear how much more variously the Romans built than any of
                    their predecessors. In Egypt we find no indications of edifices of real utility
                    or convenience, nothing but temples and tombs,—and in Greece there is but a
                    small addition to this list; but in Rome are found specimens of almost every
                    variety of structure that men in civilised communities require.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Roman Corinthian.</hi></p>
                <p>Like the Greek orders the Roman Corinthian may be said to consist of three
                    parts,—stybolate, column, and entablature; but, unlike them, the stylobate is
                    much loftier, and is not graduated, except for the purposes of access before a
                    portico. Its usual height is not exactly determinable, in consequence of the
                    ruined state of most of the best examples; but it may be taken at from two and a
                    half to three diameters. In the triumphal arches the height of the stylobate
                    sometimes amounts to four, and even to five diameters. It is variously arranged,
                    moreover, having, in the shallower examples, simply a conecries of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0453-0416"/> mouldings to form its base, with, perhaps, a
                    narrow square member under it, a plain dado, and a covering cornice or coping,
                    on the back of which the columns rest. In the loftier examples a single and
                    sometimes a double plinth comes under the base mouldings; and a blocking course
                    rests upon the coping, to receive the bases of the columns. This last is only
                    necessary when the height of the stylobate is such as to take the columnar base
                    above the human eye, when the coping cornice would intercept it if a blocking
                    course did not intervene.</p>
                <p>The column (Plate XIV.) consists of base, shaft, and capital, and varies in
                    height from nine and a half to ten diameters. The base has, ordinarily, in
                    addition to the diminishing congeries of mouldings which follows the circular
                    form of the shafts, a square member or plinth, whose edges are vertical; with
                    this the whole height of the base is about half diameter. The rest of this part
                    of the column is variously composed, but it generally consists of two plain tori
                    and a scotia, with fillets intervening, as in Greek examples of this order, but
                    differently proportioned and projected, aβ the examples indicate. Sometimes the
                    scotia is divided into two parts by two beads, with fillets, as in the Jupiter
                    Stator example, in which also a bead is placed between the upper torus and the
                    fillet of the apophyge. The spread of the base varies from a diameter and
                    one-third to a diameter and four-ninths. In the best Roman examples, as well as
                    in the Greek, the shaft diminishes with entasis; the average diminution is
                    one-eighth of a diameter. The shaft was always fluted when the material of which
                    it was composed did not oppose itself &gt; for the Romans often used granites,
                    and sometimes an onion-like marble, called therefore <hi rend="italic"
                    >cipollino</hi>, for the shafts of columns; the former of which could not be
                    easily wrought and polished in flutes, and the latter would scale away if it
                    were cut into narrow fillets. Like the Greek Corinthian and Ionic orders, the
                    Roman Corinthian has twenty-four fillets and flutes. The flutes are generally
                    semicircles, and they terminate at both ends, for the most part with that
                    contour. Dividing the space for a fillet and a flute into five parts, four are
                    given to the latter, and one to the former. The hypotrachelium is a plain torus,
                    about half the size of the upper torus of the base, or half the width of a
                    flute, as these nearly correspond; it rests on a fillet above the cavetto at the
                    head of the shaft.</p>
                <p>The ordinary height of the capital is a diameter and one-eighth; but there is a
                    very fine example, in which it barely exceeds a diameter, and another in which
                    it is not quite so much. It is composed of two rows or bands of acanthus leaves,
                    each row consisting of eight leaves ranged side by side, but not in contact; of
                    helices and tendrils trussed with foliage; and an abacus, whose faces are
                    moulded and variously enriched. The lower row of acanthus leaves is two-sevenths
                    the whole height of the capital; the upper row is two-thirds the height of the
                    lower above it, and its leaves rest on the hypotrachelium below, in the spaces
                    left between the others. They are placed regularly, too, under the helices and
                    tendrils above, which support the angles, and are under the middle of each side
                    of the abacus. The construction and arrangement of the next compartment above
                    must be gathered from the examples, for a competent idea cannot be conveyed in
                    words. The abacus is one-seventh of the height of the capital; in plan it is a
                    square whose angles are cut off, and whose sides are concaved in segments of a
                    circle, under an angle at the centre of from 55° to 60°. Its vertical face is
                    generally a flat cavetto, with a fillet and carved ovolo corbelling over at an
                    angle of about l ’ 25°. The cavetto is sometimes enriched with trailing foliage,
                    and a rosette or flower of some kind overhangs the tendrils from the middle of
                    each side of the abacus.</p>
                <p>Every example of this order differs so much from others in the form, proportion,
                    and distribution of the various parts of its capital particularly, that it
                    cannot be described in general terms like the Greek Doric and Ionic. The example
                    referred to in the definition is that of the so-called Jupiter Stator, the most
                    elegant, perhaps, of all the Roman specimens (Plate XIV. ex. 1).</p>
                <p>The entablature varies in different examples from one diameter and seven-eighths
                    to more than two diameters and a half in height. Perhaps the best proportioned
                    are those of the portico of the Partheon (Plate XIV. ex. 4) and of the temple of
                    Antoninus and Faustina (Plate XIV. ex. 3), the former being rather more than two
                    diameters and a quarter, and the latter rather less than that ratio. The
                    entablature of the Jupiter Stator example is more than two diameters and a half
                    in height, of which the cornice alone occupies one-sixth more than a full
                    diameter, leaving to the frieze and architrave somewhat less than one diameter
                    and a half between them. In this latter particular it nearly agrees with the
                    other two quoted examples, so that the great difference in the general height is
                    in the cornice almost alone, the cornices of the others being about a sixth
                    less, instead of as much more, than a diameter in height. The Roman Corinthian
                    entablature may be taken, then, at two diameters and a quarter in height. Rather
                    more than three-fifths of this is nearly equally divided between the architrave
                    and frieze, the advantage, if any, being given to the former; the cornice, of
                    course, takes the remaining two-fifths, or thereabouts. The architrave is
                    divided into three unequal fasciae and a small congeries of mouldings,
                    separating it from the frieze. The first fascia is one-fifth the whole height;
                    one-third of what remains is given to the second, and the remainder is divided
                    between the third fascia and the band of mouldings,—two-thirds to the former,
                    and one to the latter. A bead, sometimes plain and sometimes carved, taken from
                    the second fascia, which is itself enriched in the Jupiter Stator example, marks
                    its projection over the first; and a small cyma-reversa, carved or plain as the
                    bead may be, taken from the third fascia, marks its projection over the second.
                    The band consists of a bead, a cyma-reversa, carved or plain according to the
                    general character of the ordinance, and a fillet. In non-accordance with the
                    practice of the Greeks, the face of the lowest or first fascia of the
                    architrave, in the Roman Corinthian, impends the face of the column at the top
                    of the shaft, cr at its smallest diameter; and every face inclines inwards from
                    its lowest face up. The whole projection of the architrave, that of the covering
                    fillet of the band, is nearly equal to the height of the first fascia. The
                    frieze impends the lowest angle of the architrave. Its face is either
                    perpendicular, or it slightly inclines inwards, like the fasciae of that part of
                    the entablature: in some cases it is quite plain, and in others is enriched with
                    a foliated composition, or with sculptures in low or half relief. The cornice
                    consists of a deep bedmould, variously proportioned to the corona; but it may be
                    taken generally, when it has modillions, at three-fifths, and when it has none,
                    at one-half of the whole height. It is composed of a bead, an ovolo or
                    cyma-reversa, and a fillet, a plain vertical member, sometimes dentilled,
                    another bead, and a cyma-reversa, with fillet or ovolo, as the lower may <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> be; this is surmounted, when modillions are used, by
                    another plain member, with a small carved cyma-reversa above it. On this the
                    modillions are placed, and the cyma breaks round them. They are about as wide as
                    the member from which they project, and are about two thicknesses apart. In form
                    they are horizontal trusses or consoles, with a wavy profile, finishing at one
                    end in a large, and at the other in a small volute; and under each there is
                    generally placed a raffled or acanthus leaf. In proportion<pb break="no"

                    one-third of its height may be given to the modillion member, and the other
                    two-thirds divided nearly equally, but increasing upwards into three parts, one
                    for the lowest mouldings, one for the plain or dentil member, and the third, and
                    rather largest portion, for the mouldings under the modillion member. The
                    mouldings of this part of the cornice are carved or left plain, according to the
                    character of the ordinance; and its greatest projection, except the modillions
                    themselves, that of the modillion member, is about equal to half its height. The
                    upper part of the cornice —the corona, with its crownmouldings—consists of the
                    vertical member called the corona, which is two-fifths the whole height;—this,
                    in the examples of the temples of Jupiter Stator and Antoninus and Faustina, is
                    enriched with vertical flutes;—a narrow fillet, an ovolo, and a wider fillet,
                    occupy one-third of the rest, the other two-thirds being given to cyma-recta,
                    with a covering fillet which crowns the whole. Its extreme projection is nearly
                    equal to the whole height of the cornice</p>
                <p>The ordinance of the temple of Vesta, or of the sibyl, at Tivoli (Plate XIV. ex.
                    2), whose entablature is the very low one mentioned, is not generally in
                    accordance with .the scale we have given, and it must be referred to for its own
                    peculiar proportions.</p>
                <p>Pediments with the Roman Corinthian order are found to be steeper than they were
                    made by the Greeks, varying in inclination from 18° to 25°; but they are formed
                    by the cornice of the entablature in the same manner. Antefixae do not appear to
                    have been used on flank cornices as in Greek ordinances, in which the cymatium
                    is confined to pediments; but in Roman works it is continued over the horizontal
                    or flank cornice, as we have described; and frequently it is enriched with
                    lions’ heads, which were at the first introduced as waterspouts. The planceer or
                    soffit of the corona is, in the Jupiter Stator example, coffered between the
                    .modillions, and in every coffer there is a flower. The soffit of the
                    entablature in this order is generally panelled and enriched with foliated or
                    other ornament. The intercolumniation is not the same in any two examples. In
                    the temple of Vesta, in Rome, it hardly exceeds a diameter and a quarter; in the
                    Jupiter Stator example it is a fraction less than one diameter and a half, in
                    that of Antoninus and Faustina, nearly a diameter and three quarters; in the
                    portico at Assisi, rather more than that ratio; in the portico of the Pantheon,
                    almost two diameters; and in the Tivoli example, a fraction more than that
                    proportion.</p>
                <p>The antae of the Roman Corinthian order are generally parallel; but pilasters are
                    mostly diminished and fluted as the columns. Of two of the existing examples of
                    antae, in one—that of the temple of Mars Ultor—they are plain, to fluted
                    columns; and in the other—that of the Pantheon portico—they are fluted, to plain
                    columns. The capitals and bases are transcripts of those of the columns, fitted
                    to the square forms.</p>
                <p>Ceilings of porticoes are formed, as in the Greek style, by the frieze returning
                    in beams from the internal architrave to the wall or front of the structure,
                    supporting coffers more or less enriched with foliage or flowers. This, however,
                    could only have been effected when the projection was not more than one, or at
                    the most two, intercolumnia-tions, if stone was used; and it is only in such
                    that examples exist. Porticoes ordinarily must have had arched ceilings, as that
                    of the Pantheon has, or the beams must have been of wood; in the latter case the
                    compartments of the ceiling would probably be larger. How it was arranged in the
                    former we cannot tell, as the arches only remain, and they may not be of the
                    date of the rest of the portico.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Roman Composite.</hi></p>
                <p>The ancient examples of what is called the Composite order (Plate XV. ex. 2) do
                    not differ so much from the ordinary examples of thé Corinthian as the latter do
                    among themselves, except in the peculiar conformation of the capital of the
                    column. In other respects, indeed, its arrangement and general proportions are
                    exactly those of the Corinthian. The Composite was used in triumphal arches,
                    and, in the best ages of Roman architecture, in them alone. The difference in
                    the capital consists in the enlargement of the volutes to nearly one-fourth the
                    whole height of the capital, and in the connection of their stems horizontally
                    under the abacus, giving the appearance of a distorted Ionic capital. The
                    central tendrils of the Corin-thiän are omitted, and the drum of the capital is
                    girded under the stem of the volutes by an ovolo and bead, as in the Ionic.
                    Acanthus leaves, in two rows, fill up the whole height from the hypotrachelium
                    to the bottom of the volutes, and are consequently higher than in the Corinthian
                    capital: this difference is given to the upper row. Besides this Composite,
                    however, the Romans made many others, the arrangements and proportions of the
                    ordinances being generally those of the Corinthian order, and the capitals
                    corresponding also in general form, though in themselves differently composed.
                    In these' animals of different species, the human figure, armour, a variety of
                    foliage, and other peculiarities are found. Shafts of columns also are sometimes
                    corded or cabled instead of being fluted: those of tho internal ordinance of the
                    Pantheon are cabled to one-third their height, and the flutes of the antae of
                    that ordinance are flat, eccentric curves. There are fragments of others
                    existing, in which the fillets between the flutes are beaded; some in which they
                    are wider than usual, and grooved; others, again, whose whole surface is wrought
                    with foliage in various ways; and it would be no less absurd to arrange all
                    these in different orders, than to make a distorted and hybrid capital the
                    ground-work of an order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Roman Ionic.</hi></p>
                <p>The only existing example of Ionic in Rome, in which the columns are insulated,
                    is in the temple of Fortuna Virilis (Plate XV. ex. 3; Plate XVI. fig. 12), for
                    the temple of Concord is too barbarous to deserve consideration. Its stylobate,
                    like that of the Roman Corinthian, is lofty and not graduated, having a moulded
                    base and cornice or surbase. In the column the base consists of a plinth, two
                    tori, a scotia, and two fillets; the shaft has twenty fillets and flutes, and
                    diminishes one-tenth of a diameter; the capital is two-fifths of a diameter in
                    height; the volutes, however, dip a little lower, being themselves about that
                    depth without the abacus; the corbelling for the volutes is formed by a bead and
                    large ovolo,—the latter being carved. A straight band connects the generating
                    lines of the volutes, whose ends are bolstered and enriched with foliage; and a
                    square abacus, moulded on the edges, covers the-whole. In the entablature the
                    architrave is unequally divided into three fasciae and a band consisting of a
                    cyma-reversa and fillet; the lowest angle impends the upper face of the shaft of
                    the column. The frieze is in the same vertical line, and is covered with a
                    fillet which receives the cornice; it is also enriched with a composition of
                    figures and foliage. The cornice consists of a bed-mould, two-fifths of its
                    height, and a corona with crown-mouldings. The cymatium is enriched with
                    acanthus leaves and lions’ heads, and the mouldings of the bed-mould and
                    architrave band are carved. The soffit of the corona is hollowed out in a wide
                    groove, whose internal angles are rounded off in a cavetto, but without ornament
                    of any kind, forming indeed a mere throating. Like the angular capitals of the
                    Greek·</p>

                <p>Ionic, the external volute of this is turned out and repeated on the flank:
                    either that or the abuse of it in the Composite capital gave rise to distortions
                    of this order, in which all the volutes of the capital are angular, and
                    consequently all its four faces are alike. In. other respects, however, it does
                    not differ generally from the ordinary Roman examples of Ionic, The temple of
                    Fortuna Virilis is pseudo-peripteral, and consequently has neither antae nor
                    pilasters, nor do ancient examples exist of either.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Roman Dome.</hi></p>
                <p>The Roman Doric is even a ruder imitation of the Grecian original than the mean
                    and tasteless deterioration of the voluted Ionic is of the graceful Athenian
                    examples. The specimen of it which is considered preferable to the others is
                    that of the theatre of Marcellus, in Rome (Plate XV. ex. 4). The column is
                    nearly 8 diameters in height: it consists of shaft and capital only. The shaft
                    is quite plain, except fillets above and below, with escape and cavetto; and it
                    diminishes one-fifth of its diameter. The arrangement of the capital, composed
                    of a torus, the necking, and three deep fillets, with a semitorus, surmounted by
                    the abacus, is shown in Plate XV. ex. 4. The corona and crown-mouldings of the
                    cornice being destroyed, the whole height of the entablature cannot be correctly
                    ascertained; but 'from analogy it may be taken, with the bed-mould, part of
                    which exists, at about two-thirds of a diameter, making, with the architrave and
                    frieze, an entablature nearly 2 diameters high. Of this the architrave is
                    exactly half a diameter. Three-tenths of its depth are unequally occupied by the
                    taenia, regula, and guttae, the last of which are six in number, and truncated
                    semicones in form. The rest of the surface of the architrave is plain and
                    vertical, impending a point rather within the superior diameter of the column. A
                    fascia, one-eighth of its own height, bands the frieze above the triglyphs; the
                    rest of its surface is plain vertically, but horizontally it is divided into
                    triglyphs, half a diameter in width, and placed over the centres of the.
                    columns. The space between the triglyphs is equal to the height of the frieze
                    without its plat-band or fascia, making in effect perfectly square metopes. All
                    that can be traced of the cornice is a small cyma-reversa, immediately over the
                    frieze, and a square member with dentils on it. In the example, the cornice is
                    completed from that of the Doric of the Colosseum.</p>
                <p>The temple at Cora presents a singular specimen of the Doric order, evidently the
                    result of an examination of some Greek examples, but moulded to the Roman
                    proportions and to Roman taste. The columns are enormously tall, but the shafts
                    are partly fluted and partly chamfered for fluting, like the Greek. The capital
                    is ridiculously shallow, but the abacus is plain, and the echinus of a somewhat
                    Hellenic, form. The entablature is very little more than a diameter and
                    one-third in height, and the architrave of it is shallower even than the
                    capital; but the frieze and cornice are tolerably well proportioned, though the
                    triglyphs in the former are meagre, narrow slips, and the latter is covered by a
                    deep widely-projecting cavetto, that would be injurious to even a better
                    composition. Instead of regular mutules with guttae, the whole of the planceer
                    of the cornice is studded with the latter; but, like the Greek, the triglyph
                    over the angular column extends to the angle of the architrave, which does not
                    appear to have been the practice of the Romans; yet the reason for this does not
                    appear to have been understood, for the external intercolumniations are the same
                    as the others.</p>
                <p>As far as we have the means of judging, the Romans made the antae of their Doric
                    similar to the columns, only that they were, of course, square instead of round;
                    though, indeed, an attached column appears to have been generally preferred.</p>
                <p>It is, however, to be remembered, that these two orders, the Ionic and Doric of
                    the Roman school, ought hardly to be considered as belonging to the architecture
                    of the Romans. They are merely coarse and vulgar adaptations of the Greek
                    originals, of which we now possess records of the finest examples. Yet their
                    meanness and tastelessness, when compared with the Grecian models, more
                    strikingly evince the superiority of the latter, and show to what extent the
                    architects of the Italian school must have been blinded by their system, when
                    they fancied such wretched examples to be beautiful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roman Mouldings and Ornament</hi> (Plate XIII.)</p>
                <p>The mouldings used in Roman architectural works are the same as the Grecian in
                    general form, but they vaιy materially from them in contour. The Roman
                    cyma-recta is projected much more than the Greek, with a deeper flexure. The
                    ovolo is represented in the Roman style by a moulding whose outline is nearly
                    the convex quadrant of a circle, or a quarter round, and sometimes it is nearly
                    that of the quadrant of an ellipse. The Roman torus is either a semicircle or a
                    semi-ellipse; and the bead is a torus, except in its application, and in being
                    smaller, and generally projected rather more than half the figure whose form it
                    bears. The cavetto, in Roman architecture, is nearly a regular curve, being
                    sometimes the concave quadrant of a circle, or the reverse of an ovolo, and
                    sometimes a smaller segment. A Roman scotia is more deeply cut, and is
                    consequently less delicate than the same member in a Greek congeries: its form
                    frequently approaches that of a concave semi-ellipse.</p>
                <p>The enrichments of Roman mouldings are, for the most part, similar to those of
                    the Greek, but lese delicate and graceful both in design and drawing. Those of
                    the cyma and ovolo are particularly referred to, but the Romans used others
                    besides. Raffled leaveβ form a favourite enrichment in the architecture of the
                    Romans; indeed these are hardly less frequent in their works than the
                    honeysuckle is in those of the Greeks. Mouldings were enriched with them; and a
                    raffled leaf masks the angles of carved cymas and ovolos in the former, as a
                    honeysuckle does in the latter. Nevertheless, the honeysuckle and lotus are both
                    found in Roman enrichments, particularly the latter, and perhaps even more than
                    in Greek. It is not uncommon to find examples of Roman architecture completely
                    overdone with ornament,—every moulding carved, and every straight surface,
                    whether vertical or horizontal, sculptured with foliage or with historical or
                    characteristic subjects in relief.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Particular Roman Structures.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Temples.</hi> —Whatever forms were adopted from the Greeks by the Romans were
                    rapidly altered by the latter. The temples, for example, were, no doubt,
                    constructed, in the main, after the Greek model. But we find three-quarter
                    columns used in the flanks, as at the temple of Fortuna Virilis at Rome and at
                    Nismes, in place of the open peristyle or the plain flat wall. These
                    three-quarter columns were, it is true, used at the rear of the Erechtheum and
                    at the temple of the Giants at Agrigentum. But these were quite exceptions.
                    Then, in the portico of the Pantheon (Plate XVI. fig. 4) the Romans availed
                    themselves of the properties of the arch to effect an immense change in the
                    internal design and appearance.</p>
                <p>From the forest of columns, as at the Parthenon, all placed at equal distances,
                    or nearly so, the Romans boldly removed four rows (two in centre and one at.
                    each side, as at the Pantheon, Plate XVI. fig. 5), arched over the space thus
                    left, and so obtained a picturesque effect quite unknown<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0460-0419"/> to the Greeks. Then the ends were rounded off
                    into apses, and the same was done at the temple of Venus and Rome. In each of
                    the above cases the exterior still conformed almost entirely to the outlines of
                    the Greeks. But we now come to the circular edifices, as the temple of Minerva
                    Medica, 110 feet in diameter, and the Pantheon, 139. As to the age of these and
                    their purpose there is some doubt; but there can be none as to the temples of
                    Vesta at Tivoli and Rome, which have an external peristyle of columns, and thus
                    present an entirely new form. Whether these temples were finished with domes or
                    not is doubtful. In any case the exterior would probably have shown merely a
                    sloping roof, as has been common enough in Italy down to late times.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theatres.</hi> —The best remaining specimens of Roman
                    theatres are those of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Like those of the Greeks, they
                    rest on the side of a hill, but instead of being hewn out of the hill they are
                    built on it. Others in a more or less ruined state remain in Italy, F rance,
                    Sicily, &lt;fcc,, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> at Rome, Verona, Pola, Taormina,
                    and Arles. At first they were of wood, and one by Aemilius Scaurus, 58 B.C., is
                    said to have held 80,000 spectators. That they were copied mainly from the
                    Greeks there can be no doubt. In fact, one built by Pompey is expressly stated
                    to have been copied from another at Mytilene, and their general form is very
                    similar to that of the Greek theatre. But the Roman theatre received a greater
                    degree of architectural decoration than the Greek. Of this the theatre of
                    Marcellus, in Rome, is an example; for though otherwise destroyed, its external
                    wall remains and presents columnar ordinances, with intervening arches in
                    stories, according to the practice of the Roman school.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amphitheatres.</hi> —These are altogether Roman in general
                    design. The first is said to have been built by Julius Caesar, and others were
                    afterwards built by Caligula and Nero. The first of stone is said to have been
                    the Colosseum, built by Vespasian and Titus, and so called from the Colossus of
                    Nero which stood near. It was injured and then restored under Severus and
                    Decius, in whose time it is probable that the upper row was added. As to the
                    awning, we know that the main portion at least of the audience was protected
                    from the fierce rays of the sun by a strong velarium. This was supported on the
                    outside by heavy masts, which passed through holes still existing in the top
                    cornice, and stepped down on to the corbels, which show so conspicuously in the
                    top order. Recent excavations have disclosed the original arena, about 20 feet
                    below the present level of the ground. Evidence has also been obtained that the
                    arena was sometimes a movable platform. To obtain an approximate idea of the
                    size of this enormous structure, we must remember that the Albert Hall (the
                    largest diameter of which is 276 feet) could have been placed in the arena alone
                    of the Colosseum, the exterior of which measures 622 feet by 528 (Plate XVI.
                    fig. 1). Other amphitheatres of great size were constructed in the various towns
                    of the empire. Amongst them we may mention that at. Verona, 500 feet by 404, and
                    Nismes (still used for public shows), 434 by 340. Extensive remains of another,
                    376 feet by 220, have been discovered recently at El-Djemm, in Tunis. (See <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tombs.</hi> —-Some very grand .examples of tombs of circular
                    forms remain, as well as many others of great beauty. It must be remembered that
                    with the Romans both burial and cremation were used. The columbaria (vaults
                    lined with small recesses for the urns, which contained the ashes of the dead)
                    present the most ordinary specimens of architectural forms adapted to cremation.
                    The sarcophagus, of which that of the Scipios is the best known example,
                    presente the ordinary form used in connection with burial.</p>
                <p>But when the family of the deceased was rich or distinguished, the ashes or the
                    sarcophagi were enclosed in buildings of the most magnificent kind. The tomb of
                    Cecilia Metella, so well known to all by Byron’s beautiful lines in <hi
                    rend="italic">Childe Harold,</hi> commencing—</p>
                <p>“There is a stem round toweι∙ of other days,” is a bold tower 90 feet in diameter
                    and 62 feet high, so solidly built as to contain only a chamber 19 feet in
                    diameter. Much grander was the mausoleum of Augustus, which has perished. Of the
                    mausoleum of Hadrian the skeleton only remains. But it shows that the base was
                    170 feet square, supporting a circular edifice 115 feet in diameter. It would
                    seem that this mass, now formed into the castle of St Angelo, and showing the
                    naked brickwork, had, in its glory, two ranges of marble columns and probably a
                    domed roof. From its position on the banks of the Tiber, near the bridge, it
                    must have formed one of the grandest architectural .compositions of the
                    Romans.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Singular enough,
                    mausoleums, though they have been destroyed in Greece and Rome, have been
                    preserved in Africa. There we have a singular structure, the Medricen, in
                    Algeria, 180 feet in diameter, with a row of engaged columns of a rude Doric
                    type as a stereobate, and on these a series of gradini. The whole outline
                    greatly resembles that of the circular Etruscan-built tombs already described.
                    Much grander and more ornate is the Konbr, also in Algeria, which is of the same
                    form, but 200 feet in diameter, and 108 feet high to the platform at top. The
                    order is a curious imitation of the Erechtheum Ionic. The Medricen has not been
                    entered, at least, in modern times. The Koubr has a singular arched passage,
                    entered from below the ground-level, and winding all round to a chamber in the
                    centre. The rest is solid.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">Forums.</hi> —At first
                    these great buildings were used for merchants, and were open spaces with
                    porticoes, shops, counting-houses, &amp;c., all round. The best example existing
                    is, perhaps, that of the Forum of Pompeii. In later times these erections
                    expanded into grand architectural ranges of porticoes, with statues, &amp;c.
                    Leading out of them, in various positions, were temples, law courts, theatres,
                    Ac. It was in Trajan’s Forum that his famous column was erected.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqueducts</hi> show little of the skill of the
                    architect, but they are very picturesque as they stretch along the Campagna and
                    other places. Across a valley, at Tarragona, one rises to a height of 100 feet,
                    and another, the Pont du Gard, at Nismes, to 180. But they do not reach the
                    level of true architectural beauty, and derive their chief value from their
                    immense length and size. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqueduct,</hi> pp. 219-221 of
                    the present volume.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Triumphal Arch</hi> is peculiarly Roman, and it is in
                    this form that the arch appears to have been most boldly used as an external
                    feature. The arch is, in fact, the form to which all other parts of the
                    structure are mere decorative adjuncts. The principal examples are the arches of
                    Titus. Severus, Janus, and Constantine at Rome, and that of Trajan at
                    Ancona.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dwellings.</hi> —The still extensive remains of the villa of
                    Hadrian, near Tivoli, bespeak its original magnificence. Everything appears to
                    have been directed to internal splendour and effect alone; and, indeed, all
                    collateral evidence tends to the conclusion, that the exterior of Roman palaces
                    and mansions was not heeded, being merely plain brick walls. This is the case at
                    Pompeii, and the ruins of mansions in various parts of Italy, from that of
                    Sallust on the Benacus or Lago di Garda, to those of other Roman nobles on the
                    shores of the Bay of Baiae, present no indications whatever that their exteriors
                    were subjected to architectural decoration. The palace of Diocletian at
                    Spalatro, and the splendid remains of Baalbec and Palmyra, some of which,
                    perhaps, belonged to secular structures, offer evidence to the contrary of this,
                    if they are correctly restored in the works which treat of them. Notwithstanding

                    villa of Hadrian, though in themselves classical and elegant, are small, and
                    have a general air of littleness, especially when compared with the apartments
                    to which they belong,—not that the apartments are generally large, but they are
                    for the most part lofty. The ceilings appear to have been formed by vaulting;
                    there are no indications of windows, and none of stairs of any magnitude—so that
                    the rooms must have been nearly, if not quite, open at one end to admit light
                    and air; and the probability is that there were seldom apartments above the
                    ground floor, though it is likely enough that terraces formed on the vaulted
                    roofs were used for the purposes of recreation and pleasure. Of the floors,
                    which were of .mosaic, several are preserved entire in the museum of the
                    Vatican; where also are deposited many fine specimens of ornamental sculpture in
                    vases and candelabra, besides busts, statues, and groups in bronze, marble,
                    porphyry, and granite, of various styles, remains of the noble collection
                    Hadrian made during his progress through his extensive dominions, which have
                    been found among the ruins of the villa.</p>
                <p>In Pompeii we may see the domestic as well as public architecture of ancient
                    Rome, although it must be remembered that Pompeii was a Greek colony, and that
                    it was destroyed, as early as 79 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> We have,
                    therefore, probably to expect more Greek character than would be met with
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The streets of Pompeü are very narrow, their average width being not more than 12
                    or 15 feet; frequently they are not more than 8 feet wide, and very few in any
                    part exceed 20. The principal excavated street in the city, that leading from
                    the Forum to the gate towards Herculaneum, and the street of the tombs, is, at
                    the widest, 23 feet 6 inches, including two footways, each 5 feet wide. The
                    streets are all paved with lava, and almost all have side pavement3 or footways,
                    which, however, are for the most part so narrow, that, with few exceptions, two
                    persons cannot pass on them. That the cars or carriages of the inhabitants could
                    not pass each other in most of the streets, is proved by the wheel-ruts which
                    have been worn on the stones, and the recesses made here and there for the
                    purpose of passing. They are lined on both sides with small cells,, which served
                    for shops of various kinds; and they are strikingly like the ordinary shops in
                    towns in the south of Italy and in Sicily at the present time (Plate XVII. fig.
                    1). They resemble these, too, in this respect, that there appear in very few
                    cases to be accommodations in connection with the shops for the occupiers and
                    their families, who must have lived elsewhere, as modern Italian shopkeepers
                    very commonly do. They present no architectural decoration whatever; the fronts
                    are merely plain stuccoed brick wall3 <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> with a large
                    square opening in each, part of which is the door, and part the window, for
                    lighting the place and showing the goods.</p>
                <p>Whenever-a private house or gentleman’s mansion was situated in a good place for
                    business (like the ground floor of many modern Italian noblemen’s palaces), the
                    street-front, or fronts, were entirely occupied with shops, a comparatively
                    narrow entrance to the house being preserved in a convenient part between some
                    two of them (Plate XVII. fig. 3). The door to this is sometimes quite plain, but
                    at times is decorated with pilasters. When the site permitted such an
                    arrangement, the entrance door being open, a passerby could look completely
                    through the house to the garden, or, in the absence of a garden, to the extreme
                    boundarywall, on which was painted a landscape or other picture. An arrangement,
                    it may be observed, not unlike this, is common in some of the Italian cities at
                    the present day; but the mansions being now built in stories, and the upper
                    stories alone being occupied by the families, a merely pleasing effect is
                    produced; whilst in the former, persons crossing from one apartment to another
                    were exposed to view, and domestic privacy thus completely invaded, to produce a
                    pretty picture. Inside the entrance passage, which may be from 10 to 12 feet in
                    depth, there is a space, the atrium, generally square, or nearly s∏ on which
                    different rooms open, that vary in size from 10 feet square to 10 feet by 12, or
                    even 12 feet square; they have doorways only, and were probably used as
                    sleeping-chambers by the male servants of the family. In the centre of this
                    court there is a sunk basin or reservoir for receiving the rain, called the
                    impluvium, rendering it likely that this was roofed over, with a well-hole to
                    admit light and air, and allow the rain to drop from the roof into the
                    reservoir. Connected with this outer court was the kitchen and its accessories.
                    If the site allowed the second court to be placed beyond the first in the same
                    direction from the entrance, the communication was by a wide opening not unlike
                    folding doors between rooms in modern houses, generally with a space
                    intervening, which was variously occupied; or a mere passage led from one to the
                    other. The second or inner court is generally much larger than the first, and is
                    for the most part a parallelogram, but variously proportioned. It forms a
                    tetrastoön, being open in the middle and arranged with a peristyle of columns,
                    colonnading a covered walk all round. On this the best and most finished
                    apartments open; but they are of such various sizes, and are so variously
                    arranged, that it is not easy to determine more than that they included the
                    refectory, the library, and sleeping-rooms. Some of them, indeed, are such as
                    must have been useless except for the last purpose; these, perhaps, were the
                    apartments of the female branches of a family, at least in most cases. Some
                    houses, however, have a nest of small cells in an inner corner or secluded
                    recess, which may have been the gynaeceum; but that is far from being common.
                    Exhedrae or recesses, open in front to the atrium, are common, and are often
                    painted with more care and elegance than any other part of the house; but
                    generally the walls are everywhere painted—in the more common places flat, with
                    a slight degree of ornament, perhaps, and in the best rooms, with arabesques and
                    pictures in compartments. The architectural decorations are mostly painted; the
                    ornaments are not unfrequently elegant, but the architecture itself of the
                    mansions is bad in almost every sense. The rooms being windowless, would, when
                    covered, be necessarily dark; the doors are arranged without any regard to
                    uniformity, either in size or situation. The street-fronts of those houses
                    which, not being in a good business situation, were not occupied with shops,
                    were not merely unadorned, but were actually deformed by loop-holes, to light
                    some passage or inner closet which had no door on one of the courts. (Plate
                    XVII. fig. 8.) The columns of the second courts are generally in the worst style
                    possible: those which have foliated capitals, and may be considered compositions
                    of the Corinthian order, are the best; but the imitations of Doric and Ionic are
                    both mean and ugly. From the uses to which they were put, and the wideness of
                    their intercolumniations, together with the fact that none of them have been
                    found in Pompeii, it is probable that the entablatures were of wood, and were
                    consequently burnt at thé time of the destruction of the city, and broken up by
                    the inhabitants, almost all of whom certainly escaped, and who, it is very
                    evident, returned, when the fiery shower and the conflagration had ceased, to
                    remove whatever they could find of their property undestroyed; for it must be
                    remembered that the roofs and ceilings all over the city are entirely gone, and
                    the uncovered and broken walls remain, from 8 to 10 feet only in height.
                    Everything, indeed, clearly demonstrates that great exertions were used <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0464-0421"/> to recover whatever was valuable; and it is very
                    probable, moreover, that the place was constantly resorted to by
                    treasure-seekers for perhaps centuries after the calamity occurred. It may also
                    be remarked that the loftier edifices, which would have been unburied by the
                    ashes, had been thrown down by an earthquake about sixteen years before the
                    volcanic shower fell, and, therefore, were the more easily covered. Other
                    showers must have fallen since that which destroyed the city, to produce the
                    complete filling up of every part and the general level throughout. Hence we are
                    still uninformed as to the structure and disposition of the roofs and ceilings
                    of the houses of the ancients. The doors, too, of whatever materials they were
                    composed, are entirely gone: there remain, however, here and there
                    indications—and even charred fragments—of wooden door-posts, but they belong to
                    outer or street doors, leaving it probable that a matting of some kind,
                    suspended from the lintel, formed the usual doors to rooms. It is, in fact,
                    supposed that curtains answered the purposes of doors to the interiors. In these
                    particulars, unfortunately, Herculaneum affords but little assistance, as the
                    mode of its destruction was similar to that of Pompeii, though, upon the whole,
                    Herculaneum is more likely to furnish information on these particulars than its
                    sister in misfortune. Although it has been ascertained that the Romans
                    understood the manufacture of glass, it must not be supposed that they were
                    accustomed to apply it as freely as we do to exclude the weather and transmit
                    light. It was, however, soιħetimes used; one wooden frame with four small
                    squares of glass has been found; another brass frame with the glass movable; and
                    one piece of glass of considerable size was found in one of the walls of a bath.
                    The floors of the houses of Pompeii and Herculaneum are all of mosaic work,
                    coarser and simpler in the less important parts, and finer and more ornate in
                    the more finished apartments: the ornaments are borders, dots, frets,
                    labyrinths, flowers, and sometimes figures. In this, too, the superior
                    advantages the moderns enjoy are evident. The ancients did not understand how to
                    construct w ooden floors, or, at least, they did not apply timber to that use. A
                    few rude and narrow staircases are found in Pompeii, which, it is very probable,
                    were to afford access to the terraces or flat roofs, for they are not common,
                    and no portion of an upper story remains in any part. Sufficient remains have,
                    however, been found to show that the upper stories often overhung the lower
                    front, as in mediaeval houses; the fronts being made of woodwork, supported on a
                    prolongation of the floor joists. In one part of the city the houses on one side
                    of the street are on a declivity: there a commodious flight of stairs is fouud
                    to lead from the atrium in front to another lower court and rooms, not under the
                    houses but behind them; for we do not find an under-ground story in the Pompeian
                    houses. On the shores of the Bay of Baiae, and at Cicero’s Formian Villa on the
                    Gulf of Gaeta, however, there are crypts or arched chambers under the level of
                    the mansions, the sites requiring substructions; but it may be questioned
                    whether even these were used as parts of the house, and as we use cellars, for
                    they present no indications of stairs, and have no regular means of
                    intercommunication.</p>
                <p>Numerous remains of Roman houses are found in all the colonies, and notices of
                    many in England will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Archoeoloyia,</hi> and
                    other archaeological publications. They are not of sufficient importance to be
                    quoted here, but they serve to show that the Romans carried with them into other
                    lands the same habits, and even practised the same mode of construction which
                    they adopted at home. One very remarkable exception exists, viz., in the Hauran
                    in Syria. The edifices there were first, we believe, noticed by Humboldt. They
                    have siuce been described in detail by Mr Cyril Graham and others, and have been
                    admirably illustrated by Count Vogue. The country was conquered by the Romans at
                    the end of the 1st century A.D., and the houses, &lt;tc., seem to range in date
                    from that time, or, perhaps, earlier, to the end of the 4th. They are contained
                    within stone walls, forming small towns, and so numerous that sixty of these
                    walled cities have been counted, all now desolate, but in many cases remaining
                    almost perfect even to the doors, shutters, and paving of streets. The remains
                    are chiefly of houses whose walls are of basalt. The rooms are 12 to 20 or 25
                    feet square, with strong, arched ribs thrown across, supporting a ceiling of
                    thick slabs of basalt. Some of these are as much as 18 by 12 feet, and 6 inches
                    thick. The doors and shutters are of the same material, often panelled as though
                    of wood. A specimen of these, and also some of the carvings, are in the British
                    Museum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Basilicas.</hi> —We have left these to the last, as they are
                    more intimately connected than any other ancient architectural forms with those
                    of the Christians. They seem to have been at first much the same class of
                    building as our Royal Exchange, both as regards use and plan; open in the
                    centre, with porticoes round. Then all was roofed over, and a sort of triforium
                    or gallery formed over the porticoes. At one end was a recess, often circular
                    and parted off from the rest by a screen of columns. This, with the space in
                    front of it, formed the Tribunal. In Trajan’s, there seems to have been an apse
                    at each end. Remains are found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, Treves, &lt;fcc. A
                    complete exception to the ordinary form is found in tho Basilica of Maxentius
                    (formerly known as the temple of Peace) at Rome.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Résumé.—</hi> Roman architecture, as we know it, dates only
                    from about the Christian era, and the rapidity with which it spread from that
                    time is something marvellous. Through nearly the whole extent of the Roman
                    empire, through Italy, Asia Minor, Sicily, Britain, France, Syria, Africa,—with
                    one great exception, Egypt,—all was Roman in mouldings, ornaments, details, the
                    very style of carving and the construction. No matter what the country or the
                    architect, all seem to have lost their nationality when the Roman came, and to
                    have adopted implicitly his system of design and decoration. It has been seen
                    that he copied the orders and much of the leading forms of his buildings from
                    the Greeks. But he speedily added others. The apse and the circle on plan were
                    his; so were the dome and the arch in elevation; and thus he enlarged at once
                    the whole range of the architect’s powers, and whilst utterly disregarding the
                    delicate refinements of the Greeks, secured a freedom of design which resulted
                    at length in our Pointed architecture.</p>
                <p>But great as the advance was, it seems to have been arrested just when
                    opportunities were offered, on the grandest scale, for bringing about the
                    noblest results. The Roman architect seems to have been unable to reach the
                    highest effort of art, viz., to bring the whole of any grand edifice into one
                    splendid mass, to concentrate the detailed parts into one grand whole. But in
                    reflecting on what the Roman did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> do, we must not
                    forget that we owe to him some of the grandest forms to which we too are now
                    accustomed.</p>
                <p>We now come to a complete change in the structures which we have to describe.
                    Henceforth we shall find no Forum, no public bath, theatre, temple, or house.
                    All these forms disappear, and for nearly 700 years, until the time when the
                    Norman castle arose, well-nigh every building of architectural merit was in some
                    way or other ecclesiastical. But with our Christian faith there arose forms of
                    beauty utterly unknown to the Pagan, which culminated in the glories of Lincoln
                    and Canterbury.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pointed Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>In those countries which received the Christian religion from Rome, but which did
                    not contain such mines of architectural material in temples, amphitheatres, and
                    palaces, as Italy did, and, indeed, in the remoter parts of Italy itself, which
                    did not contain them as Rome did, churches were constructed in imitation of
                    those of the metropolis of the Christian world. These being the work of a
                    semi-barbarous and unpolished people, were of necessity comparatively rude, and
                    from them arose the Gothic architecture of the Middle Ages,—not from any
                    previously existing style of architecture among the northern nations who overran
                    Italy and subverted the Roman power, the rude Celtic monuments being the only
                    specimens of architecture they possessed. The transitional style of architecture
                    referred to will be found in what are called the Saxon and Norman buildings of
                    England, and to a greater or less extent in all parts of Europe in which the
                    Romans had been masters, and particularly in those which adhered to the Roman
                    communion in the great division of the churches. The general forms and modes of
                    arrangement peculiar to Roman architecture may be traced throughout; in some
                    specimens they are more and in others less obvious, but the leading features are
                    the same. This is more evident in Italy than elsewhere. In the early Roman
                    basilicas and churches, some of which are of the age of Constantine, and which
                    were constructed in the Roman style, the first divergencies occur · in those
                    which are later they are still greater, and distance of time and place appears
                    still to have increased them, till what may be called a new style was formed,
                    having peculiarities of its own, but even more clearly deducible from its origin
                    than Roman is from Greek or Greek from Egyptian. The variation in the
                    development from the parent stock is great, but in all cases there is more or
                    less evidence of the descent. It must be noted, however, that there was one
                    important modification of Roman art, and this was the Roman art modified by
                    contact with the East, and known commonly as Byzantine. Its influence was felt
                    first and most strongly in St Mark’s, Venice, a building which is entirely
                    Byzantine in style as opposed to Romanesque. From Venice it was copied in
                    Périgueux in the church of St Front, and this copy influenced the style of a
                    vast number of buildings in the south-west of France. St Mark’s, again, had a
                    great influence on the Lombard works of Northern Italy, and these were the
                    originals from which Germany, by way of the valley of the Rhine, derived all its
                    mediaeval buildings. To the greater part of France and to England the stream of
                    art was much more purely Romanesque, being the result of knowledge of genuine
                    Roman art, with little, if any, influence from the East, In Spain we see the
                    direct influence of the Romans, the direct influence of the Arab, and the
                    indirect Byzantine influence of the south-west of France, all materially
                    affecting the development of the national architecture. As might be expected,
                    this style was not the same in all the countries which practised it; it was
                    derived, in them all, from the same source, as we have shown, but was materially
                    influenced by the habits, manners, and state of civilisation of the various
                    nations, and much, too, by their means of communication with Rome. This, in
                    strictness, may be called Gothic architecture, as it was partly induced by the
                    Gothic invasions of Italy, and was invariably practised by the nations to whom
                    that term may with propriety be applied. It arose in the 4th century, and was
                    subverted in the 12th by the invention or introduction of the pointed arch,
                    which marks a new era, and was destined to give birth to a new style in
                    architecture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> Where, when, and with whom the pointed form
                    originated has been more discussed and disputed than the discovery of the
                    properties of the arch itself. Some havo contended that it was suggested by the
                    intersections of semicircular arches, as they were employed in Ornamenting the
                    fronts of edifices in the preceding style; some, that groined arches of the same
                    form gave the idea; others have referred it to the interlacing of the branches
                    of trees when planted in parallel rows,—to an imitation of wickerwork,—to a
                    figure used on conventual seals,—to the principle of the pyramid,—to Noah’s
                    ark,—to chance. Such a mass of conflicting opinions, almost all supported by
                    some show of reason, and more or less by evidence, may be called a proof of the
                    impossibility of determining the question. There is one striking fact, however,
                    which has been overlooked by many of the theorists in the discussion of the
                    question; it is, that the pointed arch made its appearance almost at the same
                    moment of time in all the civilised countries of Europe. This is proved by the
                    controversies of those who claim its invention for their respective nations; for
                    none of them can produce genuine specimens of it before a certain period, to
                    which they can all reach. Now, if it had been invented in any of the European
                    nations, that one would certainly have been able to show specimens of it of a
                    date considerably anterior to <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of the others; for
                    though it might by chance have been soon communicated to any one of them, the
                    improbability is great that it would, immediately have reached them all, and
                    have been at once adopted by all, .to the subversion of their previously
                    practised forms of construction. The infrequent and imperfect modes of
                    communication between the different countries of Europe at the period referred
                    to, furnish another reason why it is not probable that a discovery of the kind
                    should travel rapidly from one to another. Considering these things, and
                    particularly the fact of the almost simultaneous introduction of the pointed
                    arch to the various nations of Europe, as it appears by their monuments
                    immediately after the first Crusade, in which they all bore a part, connected
                    with existing evidence that it was commonly used in the East at and anterior to
                    that period, the most rational and satisfactory theory seems to be that a
                    knowledge of it was acquired by the Crusaders in the Holy Land, and brought home
                    to their respective countries by them. In Europe there are found rude approaches
                    to the pointed form in some of the earlier. Gothic structures; but we believe it
                    may be safely asserted that nothing can be indicated of a date beyond that of
                    the first Crusade, approaching the simple but perfect lancet arch, which, it is
                    not denied, came into use immediately after that period; whereas tolerably
                    well-authenticated examples of it are found in the East, of sufficient antiquity
                    to induce the opinion that it was at that time imported thence. It is, moreover,
                    indisputable that the Saracenic or Mahometan nations, who were never known in
                    those times to adopt any European custom or invention of any kind, do use, and
                    have used, the pointed arch. It was very extensively employed in various parts
                    of Asia, and nowhere in more sumptuous edifices or with greater effect than in
                    the structures erected by the Mahometan conquerors of India. With what nation of
                    the East, and in what manner, the pointed arch originated, are problems equally
                    difficult to solve. We have not been able to discover that the properties of the
                    arch were known to the Egyptians or to the Greeks, and there is no evidence to
                    show that they were known to the Persians or to the Indians of ancient times;
                    but structures are found in the countries of those nations in which chambers are
                    domed, and apertures covered with a pointed arch, produced, however, by
                    gathering or corbelling over, and not by arched structure. It is not improbable,
                    therefore, that, such things existing, when the properties of the arch
                    bo-came<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n466/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0466-0423"/> known, that form would be repeated upon it, and
                    the result would be the lancet arch,—the prototype, the germ of the style. The
                    pointed arch, on its introduction into Europe, was not accompanied by any of its
                    ordinary accessories in after-time,—its light clustered pillars, its mullions,
                    foliations or featherings, and graceful tracery. These developments resulted
                    from its adoption; so that whether the arch itself was invented in Europe or
                    imported from the East, to the European nations must be assigned the credit of
                    developing the beautiful style of architecture whose distinguishing feature it
                    is.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding further with this subject, it is necessary to determine by what
                    name this style is to be designated. There have been only too many arguments and
                    discussions on the name which is most appropriate to the style. By common
                    consent the word Gothic is used all over Europe to designate it, and it now
                    hardly matters whether or not there was originally good reason for the use of
                    such a term. One of the first in England to use the term was Sir Henry Wotton.
                    It was continued by Evelyn, who applied it more directly; and the authority of
                    Sir Christopher Wren finally .settled its application. But they used the term as
                    one of reproach for what they thought a savage and uncivilised sort of art,
                    though it was in vain that, by the use of a bad name, they attempted to deny the
                    merit of that which was after all the only nationally developed style of their
                    own country as well as of the whole of Northern Europe. In the last century,
                    through the influence and enthusiasm of Horace Walpole, and afterwards of John
                    Carter, an eminent artist and architect, a better taste was formed, and this led
                    to the appreciation of that which is, indeed, the English national style. Many
                    attempts were made to explode the totally irrelevant appellation of “Gothic”
                    which had been applied to the style, but without effect. Some writers have
                    called it Italian, others German, others Norman or French, others British, and
                    many have contended for the exclusive term English. To this last the Society of
                    Antiquaries lent its influence, but with equal inefficiency, for the term Gothic
                    still prevails. Mr Britton, than whom perhaps no man possessed a greater right
                    to affix an appellation to the pointed arch style, from the splendid services he
                    has done it in the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Cathedral and
                    Architectural Antiquities,</hi> wished to introduce a term which is not at all
                    unlikely to succeed, as it is equally appropriate and independent of national
                    feeling and hypothetic origin. He called it Christian architecture, and in this
                    he was followed by the younger Pugin and many others. This, as a generic term,
                    would admit each nation possessing specimens of it to distinguish its own
                    species or style; and as the varieties of Hellenic architecture are known by the
                    names of the tribes or nations who are presumed to have originated them,—Dorian,
                    Ionian, and Corinthian,—so might Christian architecture be English or British,
                    German, French, &lt;fcc., for each has its peculiarities. These species would
                    again individually admit of classification, according to the changes each
                    underwent in the course -of its career. One objection, however, has been taken
                    to Mr Britton’s distinctive appellation. It is, that “Christian” applies as well
                    to what may also properly be called the Gothic style—that which arose on the
                    extinction of Roman architecture, and was subverted by the introduction of the
                    pointed arch, and which, indeed, owed its diffusion and progress, if not its
                    origin, to the Christian religion. We are therefore still left to seek a
                    suitable appellation; and in the absence of a better, are inclined to use the
                    term Pointed, which is not only distinctive, but descriptive; it has, too, the
                    merit of being general, so that it may mark the genus, while the national
                    species and their varieties maybe distinguished by their peculiarities as
                    before.</p>
                <p>The pointed arch was a graft on the Romanesque, Lombard, and Byzantine
                    architecture of Europe, just as tho circular arch of the Romans had been on the
                    columnar ordinances of the Greeks; but with a widely different result. The
                    amalgamation in the latter case destroyed tho beauty of both the stock and the
                    scion; while in the former t. ’ e stock lent itself to the modifying influence
                    of its parasitical nursling, gradually gave up its heavy, dull, and cheerless
                    forms, and was eventually lost in its beautiful offspring, as the unlovely
                    caterpillar is in the gay and graceful butterfly.</p>
                <p>We all know that architecture has had its origin in religious feelings and
                    observances—that its noblest monuments among the pagan nations of antiquity were
                    temples to the gods— -whilst the rude nations of the north in tho Middle Ages
                    devoted their energies, after their conversion to Christianity, to the
                    construction of suitable edifices for the worship of the Almighty; and we find,
                    again, that the most extensive and most splendid structures raised by the same
                    people, when the light of learning had begun to shine upon them, and a new and
                    more beautiful style of architecture had been developed, were dedicated to tho
                    same purpose. In addition, however, many, hardly les3 magnificent, and not less
                    beautiful, were raised for the purposes of education, and became the nurseries
                    of scienco and literature. Kings and nobles also employed architecture in the
                    composition, arrangement, and decoration of their palaces and castles; and
                    though for domestic purposes its aid was not so largely required, it was equally
                    used. The remains which have come down to us from the earlier portion of the
                    Middle Ages are comparatively small, but there is ample evidence to show that
                    the style was universal in its application, and so full of life and vigour that
                    every implement, every piece of furniture, and every detail of dress or
                    ornament, was governed then, just as in the best period of classic art, by the
                    rules of art which were observed in the largest and stateliest of the public
                    buildings of the time.</p>
                <p>When the practice of building houses in stories commenced cannot be correctly
                    ascertained, though it was usual among the Romans, as we know by the example of
                    Pompeii, and it appears to have been usual during the Middle Ages. We
                    frequently, indeed, find an apparent equivalent for the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >story</hi> used by the ancient writers, both sacred and profane; but it must be
                    remarked that none of the ancient remains, whether of public or private
                    Structures, afford evidence that it was a common practice even among the Romans
                    to build more than one story above the ground floor; and it was less likely to
                    be common among the Eastern nations, with whom the practice is not very general,
                    even at the present day. Indeed, with-put considerable proficiency in the art of
                    construction, it is hardly practicable to erect buildings in stories with such
                    slight materials as were used by the Romans in some of their domestic edifices.
                    We find, however, in tho oldest existing works of the Middle Ages, and
                    particularly in some of the secular structures of Venice, a degree of
                    intelligence evinced in this respect far surpassing anything found in ancient
                    remains. Possibly the skill was principally acquired in that city from the
                    necessity of making artificial foundations, which consequently required a
                    superstructure not unnecessarily cumbrous; and again, to make slight walls
                    sufficiently strong, they must be skilfully bonded in themselves, and bound
                    together, which could only be done by means of a material possessing
                    considerable length and great fibrous tenacity—whence arose framed floors of
                    timber. These, by their strength, their obvious utility and convenience, added
                    to the want of space which existed in a thriving and populous community on a
                    very restricted spot of dry land, superinduced, in the second <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n467/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0467-0424"/> place, the building of additional stories, which
                    would soon be imitated in other places. But in whatever manner the improvement
                    took place, the fact that it was made is certain; and we find it applied in all
                    the works of the European nations, both ecclesiastical and civil, from the 9th
                    and 10th centuries downwards. The combination of masonry and carpentry in
                    building tended greatly to the advancement of both; for, it being required at
                    times to make them act independently of each other, additional science and art
                    were necessary, as the proportions must be retained that were given to similar
                    works in which they co-operated. To this is to be traced the skill displayed in
                    the vaulted roofs and ceilings, in the towers and lofty spires, of some of our
                    Pointed cathedrals for the one, and such splendid examples of construction as
                    the roof of Westminster Hall for the other. On this point Sir William Chambers,
                    who was certainly no depreciator of the merits of the Romans in architecture,
                    says; “In the constructive part of architecture the ancients do not seem to have
                    been great proficients” (Gwilt’s <hi rend="italic">Chambers’s Civ. Arch.,</hi>
                    p. 128); then having referred many of what he calls the “deformities observable
                    in Grecian buildings” to want of skill in construction, he continues, “neither
                    were the Romans much more skilful; the precepts of Vitruvius and Pliny on that
                    subject are imperfect, sometimes erroneous, and the strength or duration of
                    their structures is more owing to the quantity and goodness of their materials
                    than to any great art in putting them together. It is not, therefore, from any
                    of the ancient works that much information can be obtained in that branch of the
                    art. To those usually called Gothic architects we are indebted for the first
                    considerable improvement in construction. There is a lightness in their works,
                    an art and boldness in their execution, to which the ancients never arrived, and
                    which the moderns comprehend and imitate with difficulty. England contains many
                    magnificent specimens of this species of architecture, equally admirable for the
                    art with which they are built, the taste and ingenuity with which they are
                    composed.” To this Mr Gwilt, in his edition of Sir William’s work, adds, with
                    much truth, in a note, “There is more constructive skill shown in Salisbury, and
                    others of our cathedrals, than in all the works of the ancients put
                    together.”</p>
                <p>Pointed architecture took root and grew with almost equal vigour, though under
                    different conditions, in almost every part of Europe. But the honour of having
                    developed the style to the very highest perfection must undoubtedly be adjudged
                    to France, or rather to the small portion of the country, including Paris, which
                    formed the old He de France. In Germany there was much less natural development.
                    For a long period after the Lombard style had been perfected on the Rhine no
                    variation of moment was adopted, until German architects attempted at Cologne to
                    outvie and rival the magnificence of Amiens. In Spain the architects of some of
                    the finest buildings were Frenchmen, and the style can hardly be said to have
                    been developed there at all. In England, on the contrary, though our earliest
                    Pointed buildings were undoubtedly to a great extent French in their origin, the
                    developments of the art were soon entirely national, and were but little
                    modified even by the influence of the foreign religious orders, which (as at
                    Fountains Abbey) had so much power over many of our ecclesiastical foundations.
                    From England the style was carried by Englishmen to Scotland,—a poor country,
                    with no style of its own, and no cultivation such as is necessary to produce an
                    order of architects, and to Ireland, where the English architects followed the
                    footsteps of the invading armies; and finally, if we may trust the evidence of
                    the stones themselves, to the coast of Norway, where the cathedral of Trondhjem
                    is as unmistakably English in much of its style and detail as any English
                    cathedral. In England the development of the style is plainly marked, and its
                    advances are easily traceable. We find in various portions of the same edifice,
                    according to the period of its construction, exemplifications of the-style, from
                    the ingrafting of the simple lancet arch on the Norman piers in the time of
                    Henry II., to the highly enriched groinings and ramified traceries of the age of
                    Henry VII.; but the changes are so gradual, and are so finely blended, that the
                    one in advance appears naturally to result from that which comes before it.
                    Although the nations of the Continent never borrowed from us, but were
                    themselves originators, it is very clear that after the first we did not borrow;
                    for our structures bear the strongest possible marks of originality, as the
                    gradual advances can be traced from one feature to another in a way which is
                    quite peculiar to this country. This, however, will be explained more in detail
                    further on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Pointed Architecture of Europe generally.</hi></p>
                <p>There are so many local and national varieties of this style that it is quite
                    impossible to dismiss it with au account of its features in one district or
                    country only. To do this would be to give an entirely wrong and inadequate
                    conception of the subject. It must be treated generally under the heads of the
                    several countries in which it has flourished most—as England, France, Germany,
                    and Spain. It must certainly not be forgotten in talking of Italy. And in most
                    of these countries it might properly be subdivided according to the local
                    varieties caused either by changes in the political geography, or by physical
                    conditions which so largely affect the details and variations of style in
                    architecture. For the origin of all these developments of the style we must go
                    back to Rome. It is not only that in the Roman states we see the origin of
                    Romanesque architecture gradually developed out of the Roman buildings. The same
                    process was going on at the same time all over Europe wherever the Roman empire
                    extended. We have only to look at the Roman occupation of the south of France,
                    as evidenced by the still magnificent remains of theatres and tombs at Arles, of
                    the amphitheatre at Nismes, of the theatre at Orange, or the aqueduct of Pont de
                    Gard; or at the similar works on the coast of Spain, at Tarragona, or in its
                    very centre at Segovia; or at the basilica, gateway, and theatre at Treves; or
                    in our own country at the remains of Roman buildings in various directions, of
                    which Silchester is surpassed in interest by none;—we have only to look at all
                    these in order to see that, erected as they were in countries which at the time
                    were little better than barbarous, they must of necessity have prepared men all
                    over Europe for the same sort of development. The Romans had shown them the use
                    of the arch, the column, and the vault; the conversion to Christianity gave them
                    a great want to satisfy; and finally, the revulsion of feeling when the supposed
                    mystical year of our Lord 1000, with all its apprehended accompanying dangers,
                    had passed in safety, gave such an impetus to buildings for religious purposes
                    as the world had never before seen. It was a time for development, therefore,
                    and nearly everywhere the development proceeded from the same premisses. Roman
                    art, pure and simple, was the general foundation of all Romanesque building, and
                    it was only slightly modified in certain districts by the introduction of the
                    Byzantine influence from Constantinople to Venice, and thence in some degree to
                    some other cities and towns, or, as in Pisan buildings, and in those of the
                    south of Italy and south of Spain, by the Greek and Arab influence which was so
                    great down to the end of the 13th century. An examination of .the earliest
                    European churches—such, for instance, as San Clemente and San Lorenzo at
                    Rome—will show how entirely they were constructed on Roman models. From them we
                    go in Italy to Ravenna or Toscanella, to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0468-0425"/> San Miniato at Florence, to the cathedral of
                    Torcello, to San Zenone, Verona, and San Michele, Pavia, and see how gradually
                    but surely the plan and details were being developed into what soon became a new
                    style; and from these examples we may follow the stream of art from the south to
                    the centre of France, and thence to this country and Germany. Or looking at
                    other developments in Italy, we may in the same way trace a succession of
                    circular buildings, in which the connection and sequence is clear, leading us as
                    it does from the Pantheon, and other circular Roman temples, through the old
                    cathedral of Brescia and the grand church of San Vitale, Ravenna, to the
                    cathedral at Aachen, and so to our own circular churches, and to many of those
                    which, like the Marien Kirche, Treves, though not really circular in appearance,
                    are yet so planned as to fall properly within the same class.</p>
                <p>The course of progress of European art was to a great extent first of all
                    geographical and political. For, in addition to the influence exercised by
                    conquest or the political connection of one district with another, it is
                    remarkable how much particular styles are limited by geographical divisions and
                    boundaries, by the courses of rivers, the occurrence of convenient building
                    materials, and other such secondary causes. And with so many causes for
                    variations of style in existence, it will be quite necessary, in order to give
                    any intelligible account of the whole course of Gothic architecture, even in the
                    shortest compass, to treat separately each of the great national divisions. We
                    will take England first, only premising that, following strict order, we ought
                    to have begun with Italy, were it not that, in spite of the origin of all
                    northern art having to be looked for there, as soon as it came to be a question
                    of development, almost all the life and vigour of architecture in the Middle
                    Ages is to be seen north and not south of the Alps; and whatever was borrowed,
                    in the first instance, from Italy was paid back again with interest afterwards.
                    And in taking England first, we have the advantage of speaking of a national
                    art, of which every educated Englishman knows some of the examples, so as to be
                    more able to follow the course of our argument than would be the case were all
                    the examples of its application foreign and unknown to him.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">English Gothic Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of the development of Gothic architecture is, perhaps, more easily
                    read on the buildings themselves here than it is in any other part of Europe.
                    The Roman buildings in England were never of very great importance, and were not
                    always standing as evidences of the existence of an. older style, which might be
                    looked back and up to with respect and admiration, even where they did not
                    harmonise with popular customs. Such art, nevertheless, as did exist in this
                    country before the 11th century, was, no doubt, derived from Roman examples
                    existing in the country, and copied in a rude and unskilful fashion by native
                    workmen. The existing Roman remains show that there was quite enough
                    architectural and decorative art introduced into the country by the Romans to
                    have formed a school of masons, sculptors, and builders, if the civilisation of
                    the people had been sufficient to make them desire it. Such a school can hardly
                    be said to have been formed if we look at the few and comparatively rude remains
                    of buildings certainly erected before the Norman Conquest. In such work as the
                    beautiful archway recently discovered in Britford church, Wilts, where carving
                    of stone-work is joined with brick or tile and stone in a very elegant fashion,
                    we see the immediate effect of cultured Roman influence and example. At a later
                    date, in such fine works as the steeple of Earl’s Parton, Northants, we see only
                    the rude grandeur of comparatively uncivilised workmen cognizant only at a
                    distance of good Roman work. In upwards of a hundred churches, dispersed in
                    various parts of England, fragments more or less complete of these early
                    buildings, erected before the Norman Conquest, still remain. They are numerous
                    enough to enable us to classify their features in a general way, and they agree
                    in certain definite points of difference from the architecture which prevailed
                    after the Norman Conquest. It is probable that a considerable proportion of
                    these buildings were erected after the year 1000, when we recollect the
                    influence which the expected end of the world had in discouraging building
                    shortly before that date, and how enormous the zeal for building was as soon as
                    it was safely passed. The leading features of the buildings erected before the
                    Conquest are as follows :—(a.) Quoins at angles alternately long and short, the
                    difference being so marked as to be seen on the most casual inspection; (δ.)
                    Arrangement of wall faces into panels by means of vertical strips or pilasters
                    of stone; (c.) Arches built not only in semicircular form, but frequently (and
                    especially for arcading) with straight sides; <hi rend="italic">(d.)</hi> Rude
                    balusters, generally bulging outwards in the centre, used to divide openings of
                    more than one di vison (as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> belfry windows); (e.)
                    Introduction of rudely moulded, chamfered, or plain square abaci at the
                    springings of arches; (∕.) Towers, in several cases of some importance, adorned
                    with arcading, formed by pilasters and round or straight sided arches. These
                    features are all represented in illuminated MSS. of the same period, and are not
                    seen in works executed after about the date of the Conquest. It is this fact
                    that makes the year 1066 a convenient year for dealing with as the assumed
                    commencement of a new epoch. But in fixing this date, we must remember that,
                    though the Conquest of William would account satisfactorily for the changed
                    style of building which is universally seen after this time, there can be no
                    doubt that Edward the Confessor’s Norman education led naturally to the
                    introduction of many Norman features into English work. The considerable remains
                    of that king’s foundation at Westminster Abbey afford good evidence of the fact,
                    that the so-called Saxon style had been abandoned by the workmen employed by·
                    him, and that the way was being prepared for the adoption of all the Norman
                    architectural features even before the imposition of the Norman rule.</p>
                <p>The succeeding periods of English architecture have been generally divided upon
                    similar systems, the main dispute among antiquaries and architects being as to
                    the nomenclature of the various styles which followed each other in a regular
                    course of development, rather than as to the exact period of change. Between the
                    complete styles there is always a period of transition, during which the
                    features of the styles were not so well marked, and during which the progress of
                    the art was by no means uniformly rapid in all parts of the country. The
                    following chronological table gives the main divisions :—</p>

                <p>Even after this period many buildings were erected in a debased imitation of
                    Gothic, but their features do not admit of their being çlassified with the same
                    precision as those which obtained from about the year 1066 to 1546. For that
                    period of just 500 years so regular was the development, that it is not too much
                    to say that a well-informed architect or antiquary ought always-to be able to
                    give, within ten or at most twenty years, the date of any, however small a
                    portion of mediaeval architecture, with almost absolute certainty of being
                    correct when his judgment can be tested by documentary evidence. With this
                    preface we will now describe, in as concise a manner as possible, the features
                    of the various divisions given in the foregoing table.</p>
                <p>The characteristics of the Norman stylé are, no doubt, generally known. The works
                    executed during this period were on so colossal a scale, and so many of them are
                    still perfect, that every opportunity is afforded for studying them in all parts
                    of England. It may be observed, too, that there is less variety in the character
                    of the style in different dioceses or counties than there is in the case of
                    subsequent works. The earlier works, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Walkelyn’s
                    transepts at Winchester Cathedral, are comparatively simple and rude. The arches
                    are unmoulded, the capitals are of the simplest form of cushion capital; and
                    grand and solemn as the work is, it cannot, for refinement and beauty of detail,
                    be compared to the later Norman work in which, instead of minute directions
                    being given to the workmen, they were encouraged to develop their own taste and
                    ingenuity in the decorative sculpture with which they so elaborately covered
                    their architectural mouldings But still, the principles of construction, and of
                    the decoration of it, were identical throughout the whole period. The
                    ground-plan of most Norman churches was cruciform, with a central tower, the
                    east end being very frequently apsidal. The aisles were divided from the naves
                    by columns of vast size, sometimes circular, sometimes octagonal, and sometimes
                    simply clustered. The arches were for the most part semicircular, save towards
                    the end of the period when the pointed arch was often used where much strength
                    was required, though the round arch was still used everywhere for ornament. The
                    windows in small buildings were mere narrow slits in the wall, probably not
                    meant to receive glazing, and opening out with a wide splay on the inside; in
                    larger buildings they were much more important features, being of large size and
                    adorned with columns, with capitals and bases both inside and outside. The
                    treatment of mouldings was accurate and scientific. As large arches are
                    naturally constructed with a series of orders or layers of stones, the masons
                    wrought each of these with a separate moulding, so as to define them well, and
                    provided capitals whose upper surface was ingeniously planned, even where it
                    fitted a circular column below, so as to fit exactly the several orders of the
                    arch. This is one only out of many features which prove how skilful the Norman
                    architects were. All their best works are in no sense haphazard works of art,
                    but carefully ordered and arranged with almost classic attention to regularity.
                    The masonry is at the same time unusually beautiful and well executed. There is
                    probably not a finer piece of masonry in England than the late Norman central
                    tower of Winchester Cathedral,—the stones being all uniformly wrought, close
                    jointed, and regularly coursed. The doorways are the great glory of many of
                    these buildings. Sometimes the mouldings are continuous round jamb and arch (as
                    in the well-known examples at Malmesbury Abbey and at Iffley), but more usually
                    they are adorned with a series of columns, sometimes carved or diapered, and
                    carrying on their capitals a grand succession of enriched arch mouldings. These
                    doorways do not occur only in large and important churches, but are to be seen
                    also in out-of-the-way country churches in all parts, even the most remote, of
                    England. The walls were often arcaded with single or intersecting arches,
                    treated in the most elaborate manner. They were usually of so great a thickness
                    that no buttresses were required, even where, as in the aisles of large
                    churches, stone vaulted roofs rested against them. The Norman buttress, wherever
                    introduced, is consequently only a slight development of a pilaster, used for
                    the purpose of defining the divisions or panels of an elevation, and not
                    introduced for the sake of giving support to the wall. The walls are frequently
                    enriched with moulded or carved string-cornices, and with a cornice supported on
                    corbels under the eaves of the roof, and in the best works are entirely of
                    wrought stone, and built in regular courses. The roofs which surmounted the
                    walls were usually of steep pitch, showing the whole of the cross framing of the
                    timbers used in them; and sometimes, as in the case of Peterborough Cathedral,
                    boarded on the under side so as to form a flat or slightly canted ceiling, which
                    was then decorated with colour. At Adel, near Leeds, are remains of a
                    richly-moulded Norman roof, in which every pair of rafters seems to have been
                    furnished with a tie-beam. But it need hardly be said that not many wooden roofs
                    of this period exist; and the stone roofs which, as time wore on, were more and
                    more often erected, were not only more permanent in their character, but, no
                    doubt, played the most important part in the gradual development of the style
                    and the introduction of the pointed arch. The succession of vaults was the same
                    here and on the Continent. First of all the plain barrel vault, then one formed
                    by the intersection of two such vaults at right angles; and finally, this vault
                    with well-defined arches between the bays, and mouldings or ribs under the
                    angles of the intersecting vaults. It was impossible for men to go on long
                    forming such vaults as these without realising, not only that a pointed arch
                    might be built, but, at the same time, that its form enabled a builder to
                    overcome many practical difficulties in the formation of vaults, which could
                    only be got over otherwise, and then badly, by the expedient of stilting the
                    round arch. The Norman vaults were seldom applied to any but the aisles of
                    churches at no great height from the ground. They were very heavy, and exerted
                    more thrust on the wall than the later Gothic vaults, and the Norman masons
                    shrank consequently from venturing to put them on their lofty clerestories.</p>
                <p>It was in the next period—that of the transition to Pointed—that the science of
                    vaulting received a great impetus, whilst the whole architectural construction
                    at the same time tended to assume more graceful and elegant lines. In so general
                    a view of the case as this, it is impossible to do more here than point to
                    salient examples which illustrate generally the progress of the art. Just as the
                    cathedrals of-Peterborough, Durham, Norwich, and Ely illustrate, on the grandest
                    scale, the features of the best Norman art in England, the eastern part of
                    Canterbury illustrates the whole period of the transition from that to Pointed,
                    and is consequently one of the most valuable buildings that we have for the
                    purpose of study, as well as one of almost unrivalled beauty and magnificence.
                    Professor Willis has made this church classical ground to the archaeologist who,
                    under his guidance, and with the advantage of the description of the work
                    written by the monk Gervase, who saw it in process of building, examines its
                    many curious evidences of gradual development. Gervase himself describes the
                    changed mode of workmanship and design, as he chronicles the difference between
                    the new work and that older Romanesque choir which had before his time been
                    called “the glorious choir of Conrad.” He s <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi>
                    ys,—“The pillars of the old and new work are alike in form and thickness, but
                    different in length; for the new <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n470/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0470-0427"/> pillars were elongated by almost twelve feet. In
                    the old capitals the work was plain, in the new ones exquisite in sculpture.
                    There the arches and everything else was plain or sculptured with an axe and not
                    with a chisel, but here almost throughout is appropriate sculpture. No marble
                    columns were there, but here are innumerable ones. There, in the circuit around
                    the choir, the vaults were plain, but here they are arch-ribbed and have
                    key-stones.” “There was a ceiling of wood decorated with excellent painting, but
                    here is a vault beautifully constructed of stone and light tufa. There was a
                    single triforium, but here are two in the choir, and a third in the aisle of the
                    church,” &amp;c. This great work was begun under a French architect, William of
                    Sens, in the year 1175; he was killed by injuries received in a fall from tho
                    scaffolding in 1179,∙ and was succeeded by his assistant, William the
                    Englishman; and to these two men is due the credit of the design as we now see
                    it. One of the most noteworthy points in its history is the obvious and simple
                    mode of accounting for the French character and state of much of the work, which
                    it presents; and looking at it, no one can be surprised at the enormous
                    development which immediately took place throughout the country. The change from
                    heavy piers, with carving rather elaborate than beautiful, to delicate columns
                    carrying on exquisite capitals lofty and graceful pointed arches and vaults, was
                    so great that it was impossible not to prefer it to the stately but
                    comparatively rude work which it supplanted; and so the tide of change having
                    set in, further improvements were soon desired. Mouldings became much more
                    delicate and subtle in their contour. Groining was then more tastefully planned
                    and disposed, windows and doorways were made far more graceful, whilst the
                    system of construction was largely improved upon. Instead of thick, massive
                    walls without buttresses, the walls were reduced in thickness, and the material
                    saved was transferred to the buttress, where it could most effectually fulfil
                    its office of supporting the vaults and walls above. From buttresses conceived
                    in this view the transition to flying buttresses was easy; then to stiffen
                    these, pinnacles were added. And in the same way one lancet window led the way
                    to groups of lancets; and these in their turn, by combinations with pierced
                    circular windows, to completely developed traceries.</p>
                <p>The First Pointed, Lancet, or Early English style to which the transitional work
                    thus led up, may fairly be considered to be a purely English variety of Gothic.
                    It is more consistently graceful and delicate in its details, as well as in its
                    general character, than any foreign work of the same period. There was no longer
                    any observable foreign influence brought to bear as there had been at
                    Canterbury. Intelligent artists all over the country were rapid in seizing the
                    best features of executed works, and carrying them farther with as little delay
                    as possible. There were various centres from which distinct local varieties of
                    style were sent out. If we compare York (transepts), Lincoln, and Salisbury
                    Cathedrals, we shall find that, though there are certain general similarities of
                    treatment, the distinct mark of the one presiding individual architect or artist
                    is found in each. Compared to the architect of York Minster, the one who built
                    Salisbury was altogether inferior. This feature of local varieties in style, the
                    result of the influence of individuals, is from this period one of the most
                    noteworthy features in English art; and generally one man influenced the work in
                    his own diocese or district, and no further. Throughout the period before
                    us—1189 to 1272—the developments were all in the same direction as during the
                    previous time of transition. The tendency was always to greater lightness and
                    elegance; skilful combinations were much thought of; and, towards the end of the
                    period, thero was even too great a display sometimes of tho cleverness of the
                    artist. But with work so really beautiful as it all was, and so uniformly good
                    in the smallest nearly as much as in the largest building, it is ungracious, if
                    not conceited, to affect to criticise the spirit in which the artist worked. The
                    use of delicate shafts of polished marble (obtained in great part from the Isle
                    of Purbeck) for doorways, windows, and arcades, is one of the distinguishing
                    features of the style at this time. Generally they are treated with great
                    beauty, but there were structural inconveniences about them which soon began to
                    be felt. The columns were of necessity set out of their. natural bed, and so
                    began very soon to decay. It was necessary also to combine them together in
                    groups, and to trust to the capitals, bands, and bases holding them together;
                    and such construction not only looks dangerously slight, but is so. A radical
                    defect also in engaged marble shafts is that, though they seem to be intended to
                    do all the work and carry all the weight, they do in point of fact, wherever it
                    can be contrived, carry no weight at all; and it was, no doubt, when and as this
                    was discovered, that the mediaeval builders gradually lost their liking for
                    them, and returned to safer, if less brilliant, construction in stone, with
                    piers formed with mouldings instead of shafts detached from the wall.</p>
                <p>The characteristic elegance of the general architectural design was carried out
                    in all the details. The mouldings were delicately rounded and alternated with
                    hollows so drawn as to give here delicate and there most forcible effects of
                    light and shade. Thus the dark line produced by marble in a pier was continued
                    by means of a dark shadow in the arch; and without considerable knowledge of the
                    science of moulding, it is impossible to do justice to this part of the English
                    Early Pointed work, which has never been surpassed, if, indeed, it has ever been
                    equalled at any period elsewhere. The groined roofs were still simple in design,
                    but a ridge rib was often added to the necessary transverse and diagonal ribs of
                    the previous period. This gave a certain hardness of line to the vault; it was
                    the first step to the more elaborate and later systems of vaulting, and was soon
                    followed by the introduction of other ribs on the surface of the vaulting cells.
                    Few works are more admirable than some of the towers and spires of this period,
                    but space will not allow of mention even of many of its best features. Probably
                    the greatest excellence ever attained in English art was reached in this period
                    by the architects of the great Yorkshire abbeys. No buildings in Europe surpass
                    them in purity of general design, excellence of construction, beauty of detail,
                    or suitability for their purposes. And it is a misfortune of the gravest kind
                    for future generations, that their ruined condition forbids the possibility of
                    our descendants appreciating as we can these consummate works of the most golden
                    period of English art.</p>
                <p>The transition from the simplest Early Pointed to a more advanced style can be
                    seen as well in Westminster Abbey as anywhere. Here traceries began to take the
                    place of simple lancet openings, and led to that system of window tracery which
                    was, in fact, the distinguishing feature of the succeeding style. When the
                    invention of tracery was complete, everything in Gothic architecture rapidly
                    changed. The art of masonry and stone-cutting was rapidly developed. Moulded
                    stones, from being made continuous round the intricate combinations of window
                    traceries, came naturally to be used much more largely than before in place of
                    simple bearing shafts. So columns came to be formed of clusters of mouldings;
                    and, in the case of groined buildings, each moulding of the shaft was developed
                    into more mouldings above the capital, or even frequently carried on to the
                    vault without any capital at all. Traceries were first of all commenced by
                    merely piercing geometrical patterns or circles through th? thickness of the
                    walls. Then these patterns were combined under one enclosing arch; and then,
                    when <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n471/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0471-0428"/> this sort of tracery had reached perfection, it
                    was found possible to vary it indefinitely by making use of double curves (or
                    ogee lines); and then, when these had been used for a short time, flowing lines,
                    wandering gracefully over the space to be filled, and sometimes drawn by hand,
                    supplanted the more formal outlines of the earlier work. The difference was
                    great between an opening which was made (as the earlier examples were) with a
                    sole view to the opening for glass, and one which was the accidental result only
                    of the pretty lines and curves made by regarding the monial of the window, and
                    not the light, as the thing to be considered. The tendency of the modification
                    was to make men think lines of more importance than masses; and’, whether
                    consciously or not, this was just what happened: not only window traceries but
                    mouldings, carvings, and every other feature, were entirely changed in
                    character. The soft gradations of the early mouldings were given up for
                    combinations of more hardly defined and thinner lines of light and shade, and,
                    in harmony with this change, a crisp and sharp imitation of natural foliage was
                    devised, which supplanted the rich and round forms of the earlier sculpture. The
                    whole practice of art was becoming more scholarly, perhaps, but at the same time
                    it was more -conscious, and the cleverness of the architect was almost as often
                    suggested as the noble character of his work. Merton College chapel, Oxford, the
                    nave of York Minster, the choir of Selby, the whole of Exeter Cathedral, are a
                    few among the many examples of this period of which this country can boast, and
                    it will be seen that the change in character which is evident between the
                    earliest and latest Middle Pointed works is enough to justify those who would
                    again subdivide the nomenclature. The difficulty is that, where progress was so
                    constant, it will be necessary, in order to be exact, to subdivide each century
                    five or more times in order to be really definite.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of Edward the Third’s reign, the last great change was made. The
                    first example of this is seen in the western end of the nave of Winchester,
                    followed soon after by William of Wykeham’s magnificent (if somewhat cold)
                    reconstruction of the rest of the nave. It may fairly be held that the moving
                    cause for the change w as a sense of disgust at the vagaries into which the
                    votaries of curvilinear window traceries had been led. There was something weak
                    and effeminate about their work, and Edyngton and Wykeham, when they built the
                    nave of Winchester, were evidently endeavouring to return to a simpler and more
                    dignified style of building. The first thing they found to amend was the
                    exuberant tracery which was ruining architecture. They did not return to earlier
                    forms, but they corrected this exuberance by introducing vigorous, straight,
                    vertical, and horizontal lines. These, combined with subarcuation, gave their
                    work at first a vigour which had latterly been wanting; and no one can look at
                    Wykeham’s great work without feeling that he succeeded in his effort to impress
                    a sense of vigour and manliness on thé whole of it. Unfortunately, the love of
                    display and of the exhibition of skill which was so strong before was in no
                    degree lessened, and the change in style did nothing permanently to check it.
                    The fondness for straight in place of flowing lines was more and more developed.
                    Doorways and arches were enclosed within well-defined square outlines, walls
                    were divided by panelling into rectangular divisions; vertical lines were
                    emphasised by the addition of pinnacles, and buttresses used more for ornament
                    than strength, whilst horizontal lines were multiplied in string-courses,
                    parapets, and transomes to windows. Groined roofs, which in the 14th century had
                    been enriched by the multiplication of surface ribs, were now most elaborately
                    enriched by cross ribs subdividing the simple spaces naturally produced by the
                    intersection of necessary ribs into qmall panels; these, again, were filled in
                    with tracery, and finally, the key-stones were formed into pendants, and the
                    branching ribs so radiated as to produce the really beautiful and very English
                    variety of groining called fan-tracery. The amount of skill shown in the
                    construction of these vaults was very great, and most of them have proved their
                    authors’ science by the perfect way in which they have endured to the present
                    time. In other respects the architects of the 15th century were very successful.
                    Few things can be seen more beautiful than the steeples of Gloucester Cathedral,
                    or of St Mary’s, Taunton. The open timber roofs, as for instance that of St
                    Peter, Mancroft, Norwich, are superb. And, finally, they left us a large number
                    of enormous parish churches all over the country, full of interesting furniture
                    and decoration, and also a store of interesting examples of domestic
                    architecture which are still the ornaments, and are associated with all the most
                    interesting historical localities, of the country.</p>
                <p>After the middle of the 16th century the practice of Gothic architecture
                    practically died out, though traces of its influence, especially in rural
                    districts, were hardly lost until the end of the 17th century. Good, sound,
                    solid, and simple forms, well constructed by men who respected themselves and
                    their work, and did not build only for the passing hour, were still popular and
                    general, so that the vernacular architecture to a late period was often good and
                    never absolutely uninteresting. But it presents none of. the characteristics of
                    a school, and cannot be treated of here.</p>
                <p>The history of the development of Gothic architecture in England has been gone
                    into at rather greater length than will be desirable in the case of other
                    national developments. And this for two reasons: the examples which illustrate
                    it are more generally known; and as the developments in other countries north of
                    the Alps went through very nearly the same course of change at the same time,
                    much has been said which need not be repeated in treating of them.</p>
                <p>A few words will suffice for the necessary notice of the progress of Gothic
                    architecture in Scotland and Ireland. In point of fact, most of what was done in
                    the best period— that is, during the 13th and 14th centuries—was done by English
                    artists, and is in no way more distinct in character than their work was in
                    different dioceses or counties. The Gothic of Lincolnshire, of the eastern
                    counties, of Kent and, Sussex, of Somersetshire and South Wales, of Devon and
                    Cornwall, and of Yorkshire, were distinct varieties of style full of local
                    peculiarities. In the case of Scotland, the best buildings which remain did not
                    grow up in the same way by the efforts of local architects, but appear to have
                    been the work of architects brought for the purpose from England, north of the
                    Humber. There is a broad distinction between English art north and south of the
                    Humber; and though it is easy to point to evidences of similarity between Scotch
                    buildings and those north of the Humber, it is not possible to show the same
                    connection with any buildings to the south of it. The evidences of general
                    similarity are to be seen everywhere; it will suffice to mention one or two
                    examples of particular similarity. The beautiful 13th century transept of Hexham
                    Abbey church has some of its most marked features repeated in the also very
                    beautiful transept of Pluscardine Abbey near Elgin. The architect of Lanercost
                    in Cumberland was certainly responsible also for Dryburgh Abbey, either as
                    actual architect, or as having inspired the architect. The buildings generally
                    have, on both sides of the border, the same details, the same general
                    disposition of plan, the same traceries; and there is nothing to indicate that
                    those to the north of the border are not English. In truth, until the end of the
                    14th century the two styles are identical. Then Scotch art became more national,
                    because it separated itself from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n478/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0478-0429"/> English, and, borrowing some of its inspiration
                    from abroad, developed in a certainly picturesque and interesting line. Melrose
                    Abbey is one of the most national, as it certainly is one of the most charming,
                    of Scotch buildings; but its influence does not seem to have been extensive, and
                    it must be classed as a variety of the latest English Middle Pointed, executed
                    by Scotchmen who knew something of English work, and as much of French (if not
                    of Iberian) art, but who were determined to leave the mark of their own hands
                    and minds on their buildings. The other most remarkable late ecclesiastical
                    building is the famous chapel at Rosslyn; but the art of this is in no sense
                    whatever Scotch, and we must look again, probably, to Portugal as the country of
                    whose art it is an example. Scotland has been unfortunate, in that
                    ecclesiastical changes have involved the disuse and ruin of so many of her
                    ecclesiastical buildings. But still enough remains to make the country a most
                    interesting field of study in regard especially to the art of the 13th century.
                    Glasgow, St Andrews, Kirkwall, Dunblane, and Elgin Cathedrals, and the Abbeys of
                    Pluscardine, Sweetheart, Kelso, Dryburgh, Jedburgh, Holyrood, Dundrennan, and
                    Melrose, afford a series as beautiful as any that can be named elsewhere, though
                    most of them are on a moderate scale in their dimensions.</p>
                <p>The domestic remains in Scotland are far more numerous, and full of picturesque
                    beauty and magnificence. They are a distinctly national class of buildings of
                    great solidity, and a great deal was sacrificed by their builders to the genius
                    of the picturesque. They can only be classed with the latest Gothic buildings of
                    other countries, but the mode of design shown in them lasted much later than the
                    late Gothic style did in England. The vast height to which their walls were
                    carried, the picturesque use made of circular towers, the freedom with which
                    buildings were planned at various angles of contact to each other, and the
                    general simplicity of the ordinary face of the walling, are all distinct
                    features in them, and make them more worthy of admiration than most works of the
                    corresponding period in England.</p>
                <p>In Ireland the progress of Gothic was very similar to that which we have seen in
                    Scotland: but here may be seen art carried in the train of an invading army to
                    the advantage of the country conquered, just as in England a similar benefit had
                    been conferred by the Normans. Strongbow’s invasion may be‘said to have beeii
                    the introduction to Ireland of Gothic art. He went from South Wales to the south
                    of Ireland. The art in his time in South Wales was to a great extent the
                    development of the monks of Glastonbury. Their influence is visible plainly not
                    only over their own district, but equally at Llandaff and at St David’s. It was
                    a very English influence. The Norman art of Canterbury hardly reached or touched
                    them in a very direct way; and their art was taken directly and unmodified to
                    Ireland. Among the buildings erected by the English in Ireland, Kilkenny
                    Cathedral and the two 13th century cathedrals of Dublin— Christ Church and St
                    Patrick’s—are the most remarkable, but there are many others. Their style is
                    most plainly that of the Englishmen who followed Strongbow, with no concession
                    to, or consideration of, previous Irish forms of art. That these forms deserved
                    respect cannot be doubted by those who have examined the existing remains.
                    Cormac’s chapel, which still·stands uninjured by the side of the ruined English
                    cathedral on the rock of Cashel, is one of the most interesting relics left. It
                    is a much decorated Romanesque chapel, of two stages in height, groined in
                    stone, and covered with an ingeniously and admirably constructed, lofty stone
                    roof. For ever is a long time, but few buildings have ever been built which seem
                    more likely to defy eternally the ordinary wear and tear of time than this. It
                    is still perfect; and where beautiful design and perfect construction are
                    combined as they are here, the highest excellence of which architecture is
                    capable has been achieved. The round towers of Ireland are well-known and
                    remarkable erections, but they can hardly be said to have any architectural
                    character. I n a mastery of the finer kind of decorative work few workmen have
                    ever equalled the Irish; none have surpassed them. Their ornaments in metal-work
                    and in illuminated MSS. are truly exquisite and marvellous in their ingenuity.
                    But in masonry, the only works in which the same mastery is shown are the
                    beautiful memorial or churchyard crosses which are so well known and so
                    characteristic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gothic Architecture in France.</hi></p>
                <p>The remarks which have already been made as to the variation in style visible in
                    various parts of the same country, apply with more force, perhaps, in what we
                    now call France than to any other part of Europe. For the purposes of complete
                    study it would be necessary to keep entirely distinct from each other in the
                    mind the following important divisions :— (1.) Provence and Auvergne; (2.)
                    Aquitaine; (3.) Burgundy; (4.) Anjou and Poitou; (5.) Brittany; (6.)*Noπnandy;
                    (7.) the lie de France and Picardy; (8.) Champagne; and, finally, (9.) the
                    eastern border-land (neither quite German nor quite French in its character),
                    the meeting-point of the two very different developments of French and German
                    art. Speaking generally, it' is safe to say that Gothic architecture was never
                    brought to its highest perfection in any portion of the south of France.
                    Aquitaine, Auvergne, and Provence were too wedded to classic traditions to excel
                    in an art which seems to have required for its perfection no sort of looking
                    back to such a past. Hence there is no Gothic work in the south for which it is
                    possible to feel the same admiration and enthusiasm as must be felt by every
                    artist in presence of the great works of the north. In Anjou this is less the
                    case; but even there the art is extremely inferior to that which is seen in
                    Normandy and the He de France. Brittany may be dismissed from consideration, as
                    being, like our own Cornwall, so provincial and so cut off from neighbours, that
                    its art could not fail to be very local, and without much influence outside its
                    own borders. The interest felt by the student of the history of the art need
                    not, however, be less in the south than in the north. The Romanesque churches of
                    Aquitaine and the south had immense influence. The church of St Front at
                    Périgueux was built by a Venetian colony, in imitation (as far as its plan and
                    section) of St Mark’s at Venice. Its plan, a simple Greek cross, covered with
                    four cupolas, is as essentially Venetian and Byzantine as it was possible to be;
                    and the Venetian church was essentially Byzantine as opposed to Romanesque. This
                    Byzantine or Venetian example spread far and wide over the great province of
                    Aquitaine, and beyond its limits. A long series of churches might be named in
                    all of which the domical character of the roofing is remarkable; and it need
                    hardly be said that such a system of roofing cannot be adopted without a great
                    influence on the form of the ground-plan. Sometimes these domes were treated, as
                    at Loches, like great cones; and nearly always one of the objects of their
                    constructors was to finish them with masonry, inside and out, in what might be
                    held to be an indestructible manner. At the same time that these churches were
                    rising, we see that in the valley of the Rhone churches were being built,
                    strictly Romanesque in style, founded on the Roman traditions developed from the
                    basilica, and without any evidence whatever of Byzantine influence. Ere long
                    each of these two schools reacted on the other, and the result is seen in the
                    extraordinarily interesting churches of the Puy de Dome and of Auvergne, where
                    the Romanesque plan is adopted, with the addition of domical vaults at the
                    crossings, and domically roofed chapels round the domical apses. But in these
                    examples the plan is not that of the Greek, but distinctly that of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n479/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0479-0430"/> the Latin cr0s3. The architects of Aquitaine,
                    again, influenced those of Poitou and Anjou. The church at Fontevrault, for
                    instance, has a nave covered with a series of domes, but is of the long form of
                    the Latin cross; and the churches of the Gothic period along the banks of the
                    Loire, as at Saumur and elsewhere, have domical vaults entirely unlike the
                    Gothic vaults which were being constructed at the same time to the north of
                    them. So, too, the cathedral at Angers, where the domes are carried on pointed
                    arches, and date from the 13th century. And it is not a little strange,
                    considering the connection which existed between this part of France and England
                    for so considerable a period, that absolutely no architectural influence should
                    be traceable of one upon the other. In plan, in detail, and, above all, in
                    systems of vaulting, the English and the Angevine schools are as distinct and as
                    unlike each other as they well could be. The mode of roofing adopted by the
                    Romanesque architects of France was generally quite different from the Byzantine
                    plans just referred to. Their .favourite mode was to cover the nave with a
                    waggon vault, and to support this by a quadrant vault over the aisles, which
                    gave, in fact, a continuous flying buttress along the whole length of the vault.
                    These vaults were covered with flat stone roofs; there was no timber in their
                    construction, and they have generally been preserved perfect to the present day.
                    In all these churches the distinguishing feature is the plan of the eastern arm
                    of the cross, a circular-ended apse with an aisle round it, and small apsidal
                    chapels at intervals projecting beyond the aisle. What the exact origin of this
                    beautiful termination was it is difficult to say certainly. But it is obvious
                    that such a plan at that of the temple of Minerva Medica at Rome—a decagon
                    surrounded by apsidal recesses—led naturally to that of the Christian church of
                    San Vitale, Ravenna, and this to the almost similarly planned termination of the
                    great abbey church at Cluny in Burguηdy. But in whatever way these early <hi
                    rend="italic">chevets</hi> (as the French term them) grew up, there is no doubt
                    that they contained the germ of the magnificent <hi rend="italic">cheυets</hi>
                    of the complete Gothic churches of the north of France. A point to be noticed,
                    in comparing these buildings with those in England, is the much greater
                    frequency of stone vaults all over France from the first. The wooden roof to the
                    nave, so common in England, was very rare in France; and the variety of early
                    stone roofs was much greater there than here. As has been seen, the earliest
                    forms were the waggon vault and the dome; the formér constructed on aisled
                    churches, the latter upon aisleless buildings. One of the earliest examples of a
                    quadripartite vault (ι.e., one formed by the intersection of two barrel vaults
                    at right angles to each other), is that over the nave of the grand abbey of
                    Vézelay in Burgundy. This was erected in the middle of the 12th century; it was
                    a hazardous experiment, and though it still stands, .the wonder of all who see
                    it for its magnificent size and architectural character, its construction was
                    not satisfactory, and the thrust of its vault3 had to be met by the erection of
                    rude flying buttresses soon after its foundation. But the covering of so vast a
                    building with such a vault was an achievement sure to be imitated, and it is
                    easy to see how the influence of such an example could be felt all over the
                    country at the time that the pointed arch was coming into use, with all its
                    convenient aids for the construction of such vast vaults. At Vézelay there is no
                    triforium; the space against which the roof of the aisles abuts is a plain wall,
                    and the example of many Romanesque churches, in which the double aisles of Roman
                    buildings <hi rend="italic">(β.g.,</hi> St Agnese) were imitated, soon suggested
                    the introduction of the triforium gallery between the arcades and the
                    clerestory; whilst the necessity for light in northern climates developed of
                    necessity the lofty clerestory. Here, therefore, the French architects found
                    themselves in possession of all the elements of design, out of which they
                    developed their magnificent Gothic works. There were difficulties, however, with
                    their ground-plans, which were hardly ever, quite surmounted; but as English
                    architects were wedded to the square east end, Frenchmen were devoted to the
                    apsidal. And it was in the planning of the apse, with its surrounding aisles and
                    chapels, that all their ingenuity and science were displayed. A simple apse is
                    easy enough of construction, but directly it ' is surrounded by an aisle or
                    aisles, with chapels again beyond them, the difficulties are great. The bays of
                    the circular aisle, instead of being’square, are very much wider on one side
                    than the other, and it is most difficult to fit the vaulting to the unequal
                    space. In order to get over this various plans were tried. At Notre Dame, Paris,
                    the vaulting bays were all triangular on plan, so that the points of support
                    might be twice as many on the outside line of the circle as on the inside. But
                    this was rather an unsightly contrivance, and was not often repeated, though at
                    Bourges there is something of the same sort. . At Le Mans the aisle vaulting
                    bays are alternately triangular and square; and this is, perhaps, the best
                    arrangement of all, as the latter are true and square, and none of the lines of
                    the vault are twisted or distorted in the slightest degree. The arrangement of
                    the chapels round the apse was equally varied. Usually they are too crowded in
                    effect; and, perhaps, the most beautiful plan is that of Rouen Cathedral, where
                    there are only three chapels with unoccupied bays between, affording much
                    greater relief and variety of lighting than the commoner plan which provided a
                    chapel to every bay.</p>
                <p>Space will not admit of carrying this point farther, but it has been necessary to
                    say thus much, because the. planning and design of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cheνet</hi> is the great glory of the French mediaeval school. When the same
                    thing was attempted, as by us at Westminster, or by the Germans at Cologne, it
                    was evidently a copy, and usually an inferior copy, of French work. No English
                    works led up to Westminster Abbey, and no German works to the cathedral at
                    Cologne. When once the Gothic style was well established, the zeal with which
                    the work of building was pursued in France was almost incredibly great. A series
                    of churches exists there within short distances of each other, so superb in all
                    their features, that it is impossible to contest their superiority to any
                    corresponding group of buildings. The old Domaine Royale is that in which French
                    art is seen in its perfection. Notre Dame, Paris, is a monument second to
                    nothing in the world; but for completeness in all its parts it would be better
                    to cite the cathedral of Chartres, a short description of which must suffice as
                    an explanation of what French art at its zenith was. The plan has a nave with
                    aisles, transepts with aisles on each side, a choir with two aisles all round
                    it, and chapels beyond them. There are two immense steeples at the west end, two
                    towers to each transept, and two towers at the junction of the choir with its
                    apse. The doorways are triple at the west end, whilst to each transept is a vast
                    triple porch in front of the three doorways. The whole of these doorways are
                    covered with sculpture, much of it refined, spirited, and interesting in the
                    highest degree. You enter and find the interior surpassing even the exterior.
                    The order of the c&lt;51umns and arches, and of all the details, is so noble and
                    simple that no fault can be found with it. The whole is admirably executed; and,
                    finally, every window throughout its vast interior is full of the richest glass
                    coeval with the fabric. This is a French cathedral at its best, but Amiens and
                    Bourges, and Rheims and Laon, and Caen, Troyes, Le Mans, and a host of other
                    churches, might be named only inferior to this. As compared with English
                    churches of the same class, there are striking differences. The French
                    architects aimed at greater height, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n480/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0480-0431"/> greater size, but much less effect of length.
                    Their roofs were so lofty that it was almost impossible for them to build
                    steeples which should have the sort of effect that ours have. The turret on
                    Amiens Cathedral is nearly as lofty as Salisbury spire, but is only a turret;
                    and so throughout. Few French churches afford the exquisite complete views of
                    the exterior which English churches do; but, on the other hand, their interiors
                    are more majestic, and man feels himself smaller and more insignificant in them
                    than in ours. The palm must certainly be given to them above all others.</p>
                <p>* Later French architecture ran a very similar course to that which has been
                    already described in England. The 13th century was that in which it was seen at
                    its best. In the 14th the same sort of change took place as elsewhere; the art
                    was beautiful, but it wa3 too much an evidence of skilfulness and adroitness. It
                    was harder and colder also than English work of the same age; and when it fell,
                    it did so before the inroads of a taste for what has been called Flamboyant
                    architecture,—a gay and meretricious style which trusted to ornament for all its
                    effect, and, in spite of many beauties, had none of the sturdy magnificence of
                    much of our English Perpendicular style.</p>
                <p>There is no country richer in examples of architecture than France. It has been
                    seen how infinitely varied they are in the different provinces; but the student
                    who wishes to understand what it was possible for a country to do in the way of
                    creating monuments of its grandeur, would find in almost every part of the
                    country, at every turn and in great profusion, works of the rarest interest and
                    beauty. The 19th century may be the consummation of all, but the evidences of
                    its existence to posterity will not be one-tenth in number of those which such a
                    reign as that of Philip Augustus has left us, whilst none of them will come up
                    to the high standard which in his time was invariably reached.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gothic Architecture in Germany.</hi></p>
                <p>It is impossible to say so much in praise of the German examples of Pointed
                    architecture as has been said of both French and English. The history of the
                    development of the art is very different, but in many respects very curious. We
                    have first certain absolutely Roman works, such as those at Treves; then others,
                    of which the convent at Lorsch is a conspicuous example, which are in the truest
                    sense Romanesque, i.e., works directly founded on the Roman buildings of the
                    country. Then comes a great group of churches, of which those in Cologne and the
                    Rhineland are the best known examples, which are evidently founded on the
                    Lombard churches of the north of Italy. The earlier of these churches date from
                    the beginning of the 12th century, and the same style is continued on with but
                    little serious alteration down to the end of the 13th century, when the strange
                    spectacle is seen of a style which is completely Romanesque in its general
                    character being suddenly supplanted by a style which in no way grew out of it,
                    but which was rather an imitation of a foreign style, and which is distinguished
                    by the perfect and complete form which it at once assumed. This style, the
                    complete Gothic of Germany, in its turn retained its sway much longer than the
                    corresponding styles elsewhere, and was finally supplanted by a very national
                    German style, answering in point of date to our own late Third Pointed and to
                    French Flamboyant. The question naturally arises, whether these styles, which
                    are so wanting in evidence of natural growth, are to be looked at as sudden
                    German inventions, or whether they are not illustrations of the conservative
                    character of a people not fond of change, resisting it as long as possible, and
                    at last, when obliged to take it at all, compelled to accept it in the most
                    decided form. In illustration of what has been said, the following dates will be
                    useful :—St Gereon, Cologne, was begun in 1200, and vaulted in <hi rend="italic"
                    >1227;</hi> St Cunibert, also in Cologne, was building from 1205 to 1248;
                    Naumburg Cathedral has a nave of 1200; Limburg is but little later; Gelnhausen
                    was begun in 1250, and Munster-Maifeld about the same time. All these churches
                    are of such a character, that if we were to see them in France we should, no
                    doubt, put them down as works of the end of the 12th century, and should look
                    for another class to fill up the gap between that time and the commencement of
                    the cathedral at Cologne in 1270. In short, transitional works are as rare in
                    Germany as they are common in England and France. There is comparatively little
                    evidence of natural growth, and a very practical refutation, therefore, of the
                    claim which has been advanced by some German writers on behalf of their country,
                    for the honour of being the real mother and inventor of northern Gothic.</p>
                <p>The ground-plans of German Gothic churches have a character of their own. The
                    apsidal termination of the east end is usual, though not quite universal; but it
                    is to be noted that German apses are very rarely surrounded by aisles and
                    chapels. Cologne Cathedral, which is the grandest exception to the rule, was
                    notoriously inspired by, and in a way copied from, Amiens, and St Godehard at
                    Hildesheim, Magdeburg Cathedral, and the Marien-Kirche, Lübeck, are inferior to
                    French examples of the same ages. The German churches were either simply
                    apsidal, or parallel triapsidal, or transverse triapsidal; and the main
                    difference between early and late examples is that the former were circular, the
                    latter polygonal in outline. Another feature peculiar to Germany is that of
                    double choirs, t'.e., churches with apses both at the east and west ends.
                    Examples of thir are seen in Laach, Bamberg, Naumburg; in St Sebaldus Nuremberg;
                    and in Augsburg Cathedral. Even when the ground-plan shows a disposition of
                    aisles and chapels like the French <hi rend="italic">chevet</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> y</hi> the design is treated very differently, the whole being
                    generally covered in by one vast roof, instead of a series of roofs, and the
                    aisles being of the same height as the choir. This class of building is very
                    striking internally, owing to the vast height of the piers and arches; there is
                    no triforium or clerestory, and the windows are extravagantly lengthened out.
                    Still the examples of this kind of design—St Stephen, Vienna; Münster; the
                    Wiesen-Kirche, Soest; St Laurence, Nuremberg; and Munich Cathedral, among a host
                    of others—are very grand. The details of the earlier churches are evidently
                    borrowed from the north of Italy. The walls are arcaded, and almost always
                    finished under the eaves with open galleries, which were the beautiful
                    substitutes of the Lombard architects for the classic cornice. The steeples of
                    the same period are very peculiar. They are either square or octangular in plan,
                    arcaded or pierced with windows regularly all over their face, and roofed with
                    gables, or with spires rising out of the gables. The early groining was very
                    simple, but always more or less domical in section. The windows were plain and
                    rude, and the mouldings very simple and unskilful. In the interior the most
                    marked feature of these churches is the great height of the triforium, which is
                    still generally in use as a gallery, and is groined in the same way as the
                    aisle. On the exterior the peculiarity of the plan and the large number of
                    generally rather small, though lofty, steeples of picturesque outline are the
                    most striking peculiarities.</p>
                <p>The German Complete Gothic is essentially national in its complete character. It
                    has a similarity to English and French Middle Pointed, but no more than this. It
                    has many and obvious defects. From the first there is conspicuous in it that
                    love of lines, and that de⅞ire to play with geometrical figures, which in time
                    degenerated into work more full of conceit and triviality than that of any <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n481/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0481-0432"/> school of mediaeval artists. These conceits are
                    worked out most elaborately in the traceries of windows and panelling. The
                    finest early examples are in the cathedral at Minden; a little later, perhaps,
                    the best series is in the cloister of Constance Cathedral; and of the latest
                    description the examples are innumerable. But it is worth observing that they
                    rarely at any time have any ogee lines. They are severely geometrical and
                    regular in their form, and quite unlike our own late Middle Pointed, or the
                    French Flamboyant. In sculpture the Germans did not shine. They, like the
                    English, did not introduce it with profusion, though they were very prone to the
                    representations of effigies of the deceased as monuments.</p>
                <p>In one or two respects, however, Germany is still possessed of a wealth of
                    mediaeval examples, such as is hardly to be paralleled in Europe. The vast
                    collection of brick buildings, for instance, is unequalled. If a line be drawn
                    &lt;lue east and west, and passing through. Berlin, the whole of the plain lying
                    to the north, and extending from Russia to Holland, is destitute of stone, and
                    the mediaeval architects, who always availed themselves of the material which
                    was most natural in the district, built all over this vast extent of country
                    almost entirely in brick. The examples of-their works in this humble material
                    are not at all confined to ecclesiastical works; houses, castles, town-halls,
                    town walls, and gateways, are so plentiful and so invariably picturesque and
                    striking in their character, that it is impossible to pass a harsh verdict on
                    the architects who left behind them such extraordinary examples of their skill
                    and fertility of resource. Then, again, in regard to the furniture which before
                    the period of the Renaissance of art and the Reformation of religion filled the
                    ancient buildings, the Germans have more than any other people been happily
                    conservative. There are still churches in Germany in which it may be said that
                    nothing has been changed since Luther’s day except the use of the buildings. St
                    Katharine’s at Lübeck is turned into a museum, but is full of its old furniture.
                    The choir of Halberstadt is unused, but everything, even to the hangings on the
                    walls, remains as of old. In Nuremberg all the altars are preserved, and decked
                    with altar-cloths and’candles, though they are never used; and when so much
                    toleration as to these externals has been shown, and so little desire for change
                    exists, it may well be imagined that the opportunities for the study of the
                    works of German Gothic architects in their completeness are unusually plentiful.
                    During the last few years a vast number of books have been published on the
                    subject of their national antiquities by German writers, and the amount of
                    detailed information on the subject, which may be obtained by those who care for
                    the study, is unbounded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gothic Architecture in Spain.</hi></p>
                <p>That which strikes the architectural student most forcibly in Spain is the
                    concurrent existence of two schools of art during the best part of the Gothic
                    period. The Moors invaded Spain in 711 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and were
                    not finally expelled from Granada until 1492 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    During the whole of this period they were engaged, with more or less success, in
                    contests for superiority with the Christian natives. In those portions of the
                    country which they held longest, and with the firmest hand, they enforced their
                    own customs and taste in art almost to the exclusion of all Gothic work. Where
                    their rule was not permanent their artistic influence was still felt, and even
                    beyond what were ever the boundaries of their dominion, there are still to be
                    seen in Gothic buildings some traces of acquaintance with Arabic art not seen
                    elsewhere in Europe, with the exception, perhaps, of the southern part of the
                    Italian peninsula, and there differing much in its development, The mosque of
                    Cordova in the 9th c ntury, the Alcazar and Giralda at Seville in the 13th, the
                    Court of Lions in the Alhambra in the 14th, several houses in Toledo in the 15th
                    century, are examples of what the Moors were building during the period of the
                    Middle Ages in which the best Gothic buildings were being erected. Some portions
                    of Spain were never conquered by the Moors. These were the greater part of
                    Aragon, Navarre, tho Asturias, Biscay, and the northern portion of Galicia.
                    Toledo was retaken by the Christians in 1085 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi></p>
                <p>Tarragona in 1089, Saragossa in 1118, Lérida in 1149, Valencia in 1239, and
                    Seville in 1248. In the districts occupied by the Moors Gothic architecture had
                    no natural growth, whilst even in those which were not held by them the arts of
                    war were of necessity so much more thought of than those of peace, that the
                    services of foreign architects were made use of to an extent unequalled in any
                    other part of Europe.</p>
                <p>Of early Christian buildings, erected probably from the 8th to the 11th
                    centuries, there is every reason to believe that some remains still exist. The
                    most interesting of these is Sta Maria de Naranco, near Oviedo, a building whose
                    details are founded on Roman, but ' whose plan has all that adaptation to
                    special requirements which is so distinct a mark of mediaeval work. The
                    buildings which come next in point of date to these are all evidently derived
                    from, or erected by the architects of those which were at the time being built
                    in the south of France. These churches are uniform in plan, with central
                    lanterns and three eastern apses. The nave has usually a waggon or barrel vault,
                    supported by quadrant vaults in the aisles, and the steeples are frequently
                    polygonal in plan. If these churches are compared with examples like that of the
                    cathedral at Carcassonne on the other side of the Pyrenees, their identity in
                    style will at once be seen. A still more remarkable evidence of similarity has
                    been pointed out between the church of St Semin, Toulouse, and the cathedral of
                    Santiago. The plan, proportions, and general design of the two churches are
                    identical. Here we see a noble groundplan, consisting of nave with aisles,
                    transepts, central lantern, and <hi rend="italic">chevet,</hi> consisting of an
                    apsidal choir, with a surrounding aisle and chapels opening into it at
                    intervals. This example is the more remarkable, inasmuch as the early Spanish
                    architects very rarely built a regular <hi rend="italic">cheνet,</hi> and almost
                    always preferred the simpler plan of apsidal chapels on either side of the
                    choir. And its magnificent scale and perfect preservation to the present day
                    combine to make it one of the most interesting architectural relics in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Among the more remarkable buildings of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th
                    century are San Isidoro, Leon; San Vicente, Avila; several churches in Segovia;
                    and the old cathedral at Lérida. They are much more uniform in character than
                    are the churches of the same period in the various provinces of France, and the
                    developments in style, where they are seen at all, seldom have much appearance
                    of being natural local developments. This, indeed, is the most marked feature of
                    Spanish architecture in all periods of its history. In such a country it might
                    have been expected that many interesting local developments would have been
                    seen; but of these there are but one or two that deserve notice. One of them is
                    illustrated admirably in the cnurch of St Millan, Segovia, where beyond the
                    aisles of the nave are open cloisters or aisles arcaded on the outside, and
                    opening by doors into the aisles of the nave. It would be difficult to devise a
                    more charming arrangement for buildings in a hot country, whilst at the same
                    time the architectural effect is in the highest degree beautiful. The
                    universality of the central tower and lantern has been already mentioned. This
                    was often polygonal, and its use led to the erection of some lanterns or domes
                    of almost unique beauty and interest. The old cathedral at Salamanca<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n482/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0482-0433"/>, the church at Toro, and the cathedral of Zamora,
                    all deserve most careful study on this score. Their lanterns are almost too
                    lofty in proportion to be properly called domes, and yet their treatment inside
                    and outside suggests a very beautiful form of raised dome. They are carried on
                    pointed arches, and are circular in plan internally, and octagonal on the
                    exterior, the angles of the octagon being filled with large turrets, which add
                    much to the beauty of the design, and greatly also to its strength. Between the
                    supporting arches and the vault there are, at Salamanca, two tiers of arcades
                    continued all round the lantern, the lower one pierced with four, and the upper
                    with twelve lights, and the vault or dome is decorated with ribs radiating from
                    the centre. On the exterior the effect is rather that of a low steeple covered
                    with a stone roof with spherical sides than of a dome, but the design is so
                    novel and so suggestive, that it is well worth detailed description. Nothing can
                    be more happy than the way in which the light is admitted, whilst it is also to
                    be noted that the whole work is of stone, and that there is nothing in the
                    design but what is essentially permanent and monumental in construction. The
                    only other Spanish development is the introduction, to a very moderate extent,
                    of features derived from the practice of the Moorish architects. This is,
                    however, much less seen than might have been expected, and is usually confined
                    to some small feature of detail, such, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as the
                    carving of a boss, or the filling in of small tracery in circular windows, where
                    it would in no way clash with the generally Christian character of the art.</p>
                <p>The debateable period of transition which is usually so interesting is very
                    sterile in Spain. A good model once adopted from the French was adhered to with
                    but little modification, and it was not till the 13th century style was well
                    established in France and England that any introduction of its features is seen
                    here; and then, again, it is the work of foreign architects imported for the
                    work and occasion, bringing with them a fully developed style to which nothing
                    whatever in Spain itself led up by a natural or evident development. The three
                    great Spanish churches of this period are the cathedrals of Toledo, Leon, and
                    Burgos. Those of Siguënza, Lérida, and Tarragona, fine as they are, illustrate
                    the art of the 12th rather than of the 13th century, but these three great
                    churches are perfect Early Pointed works, and most complete in all their parts.
                    The cathedral of Toledo is one of the most nobly designed churches in Europe. In
                    dimensions it is surpassed only by the cathedrals of Milan and Seville, whilst
                    in beauty of plan it leaves both those great churches far behind. The <hi
                    rend="italic">chevet,</hi> in which two broad aisles are carried round the apse
                    with chapels alternately square and apsidal opening out of them, is perhaps the
                    most perfect of all the schemes we know. It is as if the French <hi
                    rend="italic">chevets,</hi> all of which were more or less tentative in their
                    plan, had culminated in this grand work to which they had led the way. The
                    architectural detail of this great church is generally on a par with the beauty
                    and grandeur of its plan, but is perhaps surpassed by the somewhat later church
                    at Leon. Here we have a church built by architects, whose sole idea was the
                    erection of a building with as few and small points of support as possible, and
                    with the largest possible amount of window opening. It was the work of men whose
                    art had been formed in a country where as much sun and light as possible were
                    necessary, and is quite unsuited for such a country as Spain. Nevertheless it is
                    a building of rare beauty and delicacy of design. Burgos, better known than
                    either of the others, is inferior in scale and interest, and its character has
                    been much altered by added works more or less Rococo in character, so that it is
                    only by analysis and investigation that the 13th century church is still seen
                    under and behind the more modern excrescences.</p>
                <p>The next period is again marked by work which seems to be that of foreigners. The
                    fully developed Middle Pointed or Geometrical Gothic is indeed very uniform all
                    over Europe. Here, however, its efforts were neither grand in scale nor
                    interesting. Some of the church furniture, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    choir screens at Toledo, and some of the cloisters, are among the best features.
                    The work is all correct, tame, and academical, and has none of the dignity,
                    power, and interest which marked the earlier Spanish buildings. Towards the end
                    of the 14th century the work of Spanish architects becomes infinitely more
                    interesting. The country was free from trouble with the Moors; it was rich and
                    prosperous, and certainly its buildings at this period were so numerous, so
                    grand, and so original, that they cannot be too much praised. Moreover, they
                    were carefully designed to suit the requirements of the climate, and also with a
                    sole view to the accommodation conveniently of enormous congregations, all
                    within sight of the preacher or the altar. This last development seems to have
                    been very much the work of a great architect of Majorca, Jayme Fabre by name.
                    The grandest works of his school are still to bo seen in Catalonia. Their
                    churches are so vast in their dimensions that the largest French and English
                    buildings seem to be small by comparison, and being invariably covered with
                    stone vaults, they cannot be compared to the great wooden-roofed churches of the
                    preaching orders in Italy and elsewhere, in which the only approach is made to
                    their magnificent dimensions. The cathedral of Gerona is the most remarkable
                    example. Here the choir is planned like the French <hi rend="italic">chevet</hi>
                    with an aisle and chapels round it, and opens with three lofty arches into the
                    east wall of a nave which measures no less than 73 feet in the clear, and is
                    covered with a stone vaulted ceiling. In Barcelona there are several churches of
                    very similar description; at Manresa another, but with aisles to its nave; and
                    at Palma in Majorca one of the same plan as the last, but of even much larger
                    dimensions. Perhaps there is no effort of any local school of architects more
                    worthy of study and respect than this Catalonian work of the 14th and 15th
                    centuries. Such a happy combination of noble design and proportions with
                    entirely practical objects places its author among the very greatest architects
                    of any time. It is one thing to develop patiently step by step from the work of
                    one’s fathers in art, quite another to strike out an entirely new form by a new
                    combination of the old elements. In comparison with the works just mentioned the
                    other great Spanish churches of the 15th century are uninteresting. But still
                    their scale is grand, and though their detail is over-elaborated and not
                    beautiful, it is impossible to deny the superb effect of the interior of such
                    churches as those of Seville, Segovia, and Salamanca (new cathedral). They are
                    very similar in their character, their columns are formed by the prolongation of
                    the reedy mouldings of the arches, their window traceries are poorly designed,
                    and their roofs are covered with a complex multitude of lieme ribs. Yet the
                    scale is fine, the admission of light, generally high up and in sparing
                    quantity, is artistic, and much of the furniture is either picturesque or
                    interesting. The <hi rend="italic">tout ensemble</hi> is generally very
                    striking, even where the architectural purist is apt to grumble at the
                    shortcomings of most of the detail. *</p>
                <p>The remarks which have been made so far have been confined to the fabrics of the
                    churches of Spain. It would be easy to add largely to them by reference to the
                    furniture which still so often adorns them, unaltered even if uncared for; to
                    the monuments of the mighty dead, in which Spain is a worthy rival of our own
                    country; to the sculpture which frequently adorns the doorways and screens; and
                    to the cloisters, chapter houses, and other dependent buildings, which add so
                    much charm in every way to them. Besides <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n483/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0483-0434"/> this, there are very numerous castles, often
                    planned on the grandest scale, and some, if not very many, interesting remains
                    of domestic houses and palaces; and most of these, being to some extent
                    flavoured by the neighbourhood of Moorish architects, have more character of
                    their own than has been accorded to the churches. Finally, there are
                    considerable tracts of country in which brick was the only material used; and it
                    is curious that this is almost always more or less Moorish in the character of
                    its detail The Moors were great brickmakers. Their elaborate reticulated
                    enrichments were easily executed in it, and the example set by them was, of
                    course, more likely to be followed by Spaniards than that of the nearest French
                    brick building district in the region of Toulouse. The brick towers are often
                    very picturesque; several are to be seen at Toledo, others at Saragossa, and,
                    perhaps the most graceful of all, in the old city of Tarazona in Aragon, where
                    the proportions are extremely lofty, the face of the walls everywhere adorned
                    with sunk panels, arcading, or ornamental brickwork, and at the base there is a
                    bold battered slope which gives a great air of strength and stability to the
                    whole. On the whole, it must be concluded that the mediaeval architecture of
                    Spain is of less interest than that of most other countries, because its
                    development was hardly over a national one. The architects were imported at one
                    time from France, at another from the Low Countries, and they brought with them
                    all their own local fashions, and carried them into execution in the strictest
                    manner; and it was not till the end of the 14th century, and even then only in
                    Catalonia, that any buildings which could be called really Spanish in their
                    character was erected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gothic Architecture in Italy.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of the development of Gothic architecture in Italy brings out, more
                    clearly than anywhere else, of course, the gradual transition from simple Roman
                    work to Romanesque and Byzantine, and thence, finally, to Gothic. But the first
                    portion of the history is, perhaps, the most important, since, owing to various
                    causes, the Gothic architecture of Italy never achieved the same brilliant
                    effects which marked its career in other parts of Europe. Something there was in
                    the climate, something in the constant knowledge of grand works of classic
                    times, and finally, something in the Eastern influence which was so marked in
                    Venice, and in the Greek as well as Moorish or Arab influence which equally
                    affected the whole southern half of the peninsula.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt whatever that the first buildings used for Christian
                    worship in Italy were in no way whatever more suited for its functions than they
                    were for the Pagan rites which had preceded them. The form of architecture used
                    was the Roman art of the day; and to a considerable extent Roman buildings, and
                    particularly basilicas, were converted, from the time of Constantine, into
                    Christian churches. The early Christian policy was not unfrequently one which
                    softened off the transition from the old worship to the new. And when the bishop
                    took his seat in the centre of the apse, with his clergy on either side, and the
                    Christian altar was placed in front of the apse, very much in the position of
                    that which had been used for the Pagan sacrifice, the whole change required to
                    convert the basilica into the church had been made. The basilica was usually a
                    long nave with one or more aisles on either side. These aisles were frequently
                    double in height, a second row or order of columns being placed above the first.
                    At one end was a tribune sometimes square, but usually apsidal in plan, round
                    which a series of steps led to seats formed against the wall. The central seat
                    was that of the principal officer, the others those of his assessors, and the
                    altar stood in front of the tribune. The central nave was either open to the
                    sky, or covered with a wooden roof or with a vaulted ceiling. The basilica at
                    Pompeii, still so perfect as to be quite intelligible, has a single aisle on
                    each side, and a square-ended tribune, and was probably not covered over the
                    centre. This, however, like all the early buildings in Pompeii, is rather Greek
                    than Roman in its character. If we compart such buildings as this and the
                    basilica of Trajan at Rome with the earliest existing churches built on the
                    basilican type, we shall see how very slight the difference was for some
                    hundreds of years. There is still the long unbroken nave with an apsidal head.
                    Over the aisles are sometimes, as in St Agnese and St Lorenzo in Rome, second
                    aisles or galleries opening to the nave. And the principal alteration or
                    adaptation is one entirely of church furniture and screens, ambons and altars
                    under baldachins, which, as if with a scrupulous regard to the old basilican
                    arrangement, are planned independently altogether of the structure, being
                    emphatically nothing but furniture. If we examine San Clemente in its present
                    condition, we shall find a choir having no constructional peculiarities, but
                    formed entirely by low screens built on the floor of the church, with a
                    passage-way between them and the columns, and with ambons or pulpits projecting
                    from their sides. In front of the church was an enclosed court-yard or atrium,
                    from which access was gained to the church. The arrangements of San Clemente are
                    probably not so old as they were once supposed to be. One, if not two, older
                    churches exist beneath it; but, nevertheless, there is every reason for
                    believing that the arrangements now visible are those at latest of the 9th
                    century. The ancient basilica of St Peter was on the same sort of plan, with the
                    addition of a cross nave or transept between the nave and its aisles and the
                    apse, an arrangement which is still to be seen in the famous church of St Paul,
                    without the walls, and in the basilica at Aquileia. At St Paul’s the altar
                    stands on the west side of the transept, the bishop’s seat is separated from it
                    by the transept, and the whole arrangement is unmeaning and unsatisfactory, but
                    it is probably not old. The number of early churches on the basilican plan is
                    very great, and they are of all sizes. The charming church of Sta Maria in
                    Cosmedin, Rome, is a quite small building, but graceful in its general
                    proportions, and interesting to the architect, like most of the early Roman
                    churches, for the beautiful inlaid work, the Opus Alexandrinum, of its screens,
                    pavements, and pulpits. Out of Rome, also, there are many examples of the same
                    type, but space does not permit the mention here of any but those of Ravenna.
                    The two most remarkable of these are St Apollinare in Classe, two or three miles
                    out of the city, a forlorn and deserted building, and St Apollinare Nuovo,
                    within the walls, a church whose mosaic decorations, being nearly perfect, give
                    an admirable impression of the sumptuous character which the early church knew
                    how to give and loved to give to its temples. Here, however, none of those old
                    ritual arrangements remain, which give so much interest to the basilicas of
                    Rome, Torcello, Toscanella, and Aquileia. The decoration of St Apollinare Nuovo
                    is mainly on the space of wall between the arches opening to the aisles and the
                    clerestory. It is a mosaic picture of an almost endless procession of white-clad
                    saints on a golden ground. - Few things in the whole realm of Christian art are
                    more beautiful or more touching. The other St Apollinare, in Classe, has lost
                    almost all its old decorations, and is merely painted in bad taste and in modern
                    times. The Roman love of circular recesses or circular plans was very great. In
                    the baths of Caracalla, for instanc e, we have them at every turn. The Pantheon
                    is a vast circular building, with recesses in its walls (now used as chapels)
                    alternately square and apsidal in plan; and in the temple of Minerva Medica
                    these apsidal projections round the building are even more distinctly <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n484/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0484-0435"/> marked. This last example paved the way for the
                    similarly planned church of San Vitale at Ravenna, which even now, overlaid as
                    it is with meretricious decoration, affords us most interesting evidence of the
                    way in which the constructional arrangements of Pagan Rome were copied and
                    utilised by the Christians. But, usually, there was little to admire in the way
                    in which this was done. The architect built up his church with fragments of
                    classic columns, unequal in size or height, married to the wrong capitals and
                    bases, and altogether as rudely put together as was possible. And so little
                    development was there that, in the nave of the basilica of Aquileia, we have
                    this done absolutely in the same way so late as the 14th century, the only
                    difference being that in it the classic columns carry pointed arches and a
                    clerestory of Gothic windows.</p>
                <p>From these simple imitations of Roman buildings let us go to the 12th century
                    church of St Ambrogio at Milan, and we shall see how much had by that time been
                    done in the way of modification. The whole building is, of course, round arched.
                    It has a western atrium or courtyard, and it has a nave and aisles, with an
                    eastern apse to its nave. At first sight no alteration seems to have been made,
                    but on further examination it will be found that the columns are alternately
                    piers and clusters (at St Agnese every third column was made into a pier), that
                    the arch orders have a proper connection with the plans of the columns, and that
                    the church is vaulted. Let us now go back for an instant to the introduction of
                    Byzantine plan and details in the church of St Mark at Venice. Here we have
                    brought back again to Italy the product of the developed skill of the succession
                    of artists, who, after constructing the mighty vaults of the Roman buildings,
                    had removed to Constantinople with the empire, and had there grafted their
                    knowledge on the art and practice of the East. It was there that they began to
                    build domes, erected not on circular, but on square bases, the angles being
                    supported on what are technically called pendentives. So fond of this
                    construction were they that their buildings became almost always combinations of
                    domes, instead of the simple nave, ended with a semi-dome, of the Roman
                    architects of the day. This Byzantine style was developed with a skill and
                    delicacy to which the decaying art of Rome was at the time quite a stranger, and
                    it is less wonderful that so beautiful a church as St Mark should have had some
                    influence, than that it should have had so little. But it is to the example of
                    this and other Eastern churches, no doubt, that we owe the raised central
                    lantern or dome which became a feature of so many churches from this time
                    forward. A parallel may well be drawn here between two well-known and typical
                    examples. These are the churches of San Zenone, A erona, and of San Michele,
                    Pavia. In the former we still see the great simple and uniform plan of the
                    wooden roofed basilican church, adorned with much that is Byzantine in feeling
                    and character, but still emphatically a Romanesque building. In San Michele, on
                    the contrary, we see a building which, if it owed something to Rome (as it did),
                    owed at least as much to the East Its plan was the distinctly cruciform plan,
                    with a central lantern, not the Roman makeshift of a long nave with an Eastern
                    transept, whilst, its whole space being covered with vaulted roofs, instead of
                    the Roman wooden ceiling to the nave, marks it as belonging to a different
                    class. Besides this, the whole building is subdivided and constructed in so
                    scientific a way as to show that its architect was in the path of a development
                    leading far away from simple Roman theories of construction and plan. Here one
                    of the most observable features is the fine open gallery under the external
                    eaves of the roof, a device repeated constantly in the Lombard buildings, and
                    transferred from them, with much else, to the valley of the Rhine, where it is
                    the great feature of most of the 11th and 12 th centuιy churche3, and of some
                    even of the 13th century.</p>
                <p>It is impossible here to make any lengthened reference to the buildings of Italy
                    south of Rome. It must suffice to say that Rome herself seems to have had no
                    influence on them during this early period. Their designs and decorations are
                    full of a character which speaks of contact at times with Greece, at other times
                    with the southern coast of the Mediterranean. Their walls are arcaded, and then
                    adorned with square and circular panels, the details of which afford ample
                    evidences of their origin. The arcades are sometimes, as at Foggia, of
                    horse-shoe shape, and the extremely elaborate carving of foliage with which they
                    are adorned is quite Byzantine in character. A comparison of the west fronts of
                    Foggia or Troja, with the arcading of the church at Ani, in Armenia, will show
                    much more similarity than with any Roman work; whilst the front of Sta Maria,
                    Ancona, is planned in just the same fashion as that of the cathedral at Zara in
                    Dalmatia. The one great North Italian church in which there was an attempt· to
                    fuse these two fashions of design is the cathedral at Pisa, where all the walls
                    are arcaded and panelled, the mouldings mainly copied from the ancient forms,
                    and the whole trust of the architect put, very much as it was in the South
                    Italian and Byzantine works, in covering the walls with decoration. But these
                    churches did nothing by way of paving the way for Italian Gothic, and need not
                    therefore be further referred to.</p>
                <p>Italy is poorer than any other country in examples of the transition from round
                    arched to pointed arched buildings. The use of the pointed arch was accepted at
                    last as a necessity, and cannot be said ever to have been welcomed. The first
                    buildings in which it is seen worked out fully in detail are those of Nicola
                    Pisano, and but few examples exist of good Gothic work earlier than his time.
                    The elaborately arcaded and sculptured west front of Ferrara Cathedral is a
                    screen to an early building. The cathedral and other churchee at Genoa are
                    certainly exquisite works, but they appear to owe their internal design rather
                    to the influence of (perhaps) Sicilian taste than North Italian, and the
                    exquisite beauty of the west front owes a good deal, at any rate, to French
                    influence, softened, refined, and decorated by the extreme taste of an Italian
                    architect. The feature which most marks all Italian Gothic is the indifference
                    to the true use of the pointed arch. Everywhere arches were constructed which
                    could not have stood for a day had they not been held together by iron rods.
                    There was none of that sense of the unities of art which made a northerner so
                    jealous to maintain the proper relations of all parts of his structure. In
                    Nicola Pisano’s works the arch mould rarely fits the capital on which it rests.
                    The proportions of buttresses to the apparent work to be done by them are bad
                    and clumsy. The window traceries look like bad copies of some northern tracery,
                    only once seen in a hurry by an indifferent workman. There is no life, or
                    development, or progress in the work. If we look at the ground-plans of Italian
                    Gothic churches, we shall find nothing whatever to delight us. The columns are
                    widely spaced, so as to diminish the number of vaulting bays, and to make the
                    proportions of the oblong aisle vaulting bay very ungainly. Clustered shafts are
                    almost unknown, the columns being plain cylinders with poorly sculptured
                    capitals. There are no triforium galleries, and the clerestory is generally very
                    insignificant. In short, a comparison of the best Gothic works in Italy with the
                    most moderate French or English work would show at once how vast its inferiority
                    must be allowed to be. Still there were beauties which ought not to be forgotten
                    or passed over. Such were the beautiful cloisters, whose arcades are carried on
                    delicate coupled shafts. Of these the first examples are in Rome, but they <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n485/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0485-0436"/> are to be seen all over Italy. Such, again, were
                    the porches and monuments, of which some of the best are in Verona, of almost
                    unsurpassed elegance; such the campaniles, both those of Rome, divided by a
                    number of string-courses into a number of stages, and those of the North, where
                    there are hardly any horizontal divisions, and the whole effort is to give an
                    unbroken vertical effect; or that unequalled campanile, the glory of Florence,
                    of Giotto, of art, the tower of the cathedral at Florence, where one sees in
                    ordered proportion, accurately adjusted, line upon line, and stage upon stage,
                    perhaps the most carefully wrought out work in all Europe. The Italian
                    architects were before all others devoted to the display of colour in their
                    works. St Mark’s had led the way in this, but, throughout the peninsula, the
                    bountiful plenty of nature in the provision of materials was only seconded by
                    the zeal of the artist, and on this point a few notes may be added at the
                    conclusion of this summary. They were also distinguished for their use of brick.
                    Just as in parts of Germany, France, Spain, and England, there were large
                    districts in which no stone could be had without the greatest labour and
                    trouble; and here the reality and readiness which always marked the mediaeval
                    workman led to his at once availing himself of the natural material, and making
                    a feature of his brickwork. This is a subject which, however, cannot well be
                    treated save at the same time as other developments of brick building in other
                    districts similarly situated. ’ In conclusion, it must be said that the Gothic
                    of Italy has no such grand works to show as more northern countries have. The
                    buildings were seldom thoroughly beautiful as complete works of architecture.
                    Allowance has to be made at every tum for some incompleteness or awkwardness of
                    plan, design, or construction. There is no attempt to emulate the beauties of
                    the best French plans. Milan Cathedral, magnificent as its scale and material
                    make it, is clumsy and awkward both in plan and section, though its vast size
                    makes it impressive internally. San Francesco, Assisi, is only a moderately good
                    early German Gothic church, converted into splendour by its painted decorations.
                    At Orvieto a splendid west front is put, without any proper adjustment, against
                    a church whose merit is mainly that it is large and in parts beautifully
                    coloured. The later Pisan buildings are far finer, the altered baptistery
                    especially being a magnificent work, though words can hardly describe the
                    architectural defects of such work as that of the Campo Santo, where, again, it
                    is the painter, not the architect, who has worked such wonders. The finest
                    Gothic interiors are of the class of which the Frari at Venice and Sta Anastasia
                    at Verona are examples. They are simple vaulted cruciform churches, with aisles
                    and chapels on the east side of the transepts. But even in these the designs of
                    the various parts in detail are poor and meagre, and only redeemed from failure
                    by the picturesque monuments built against their walls, by the work of the
                    painter, and by their furniture. In fine, Gothic art was never really understood
                    in Italy, and, consequently, never reached to perfection.</p>
                <p>If the architecture of Italy never fell away so much from the more classic style
                    of imperial Rome as that of the northern nations did, neither did the Italian
                    ever possess that more than equivalent, whose splendid course we have been
                    describing. Whilst the Pointed style was almost exclusively known and practised
                    in Northern Europe, the Italians were but slowly improving in their Gothic
                    style; and the improvement was more evinced in their secular than in their
                    ecclesiastical structures. Florence, Bologna, Vicenza, Udine, Genoa, and, above
                    all, Venice, contain palaces and mansions of the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th
                    centuries, which for simplicity, utility, and beauty far excel most of those in
                    the same and other places of the three following centuries. The contemporary
                    churches do not exhibit the same degree of improvement in style that is
                    conspicuous in these domestic works, for there are no works in Europe more
                    worthy of study and admiration than the Ducal Palace at Venice, and some of the
                    older works of the same class, and even of earlier date. The town-halls of
                    Perugia, Piacenza, and Siena, and many houses in these cities, and at Corneto,
                    Amalfi, Asti, Orvieto, and Lucca, the fountains of Perugia and Viterbo, and the
                    monuments at Bologna, Verona, and Arezzo, may be named as evidence of the
                    interest which the national art affords to the architectural student even in
                    Italy, as late as the end of the 14th century; but after this it gradually gave
                    way to, though in some instances its influence may be traced even when it had
                    been overborne by, the new style.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Modern Italian School of Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>The opening of the Italian school of architecture on the resuscitated dogmas of
                    Vitruvius was coincident with the gradual decay of the Pointed style.
                    Fortunately, however, its effects were a full century in reaching England, and
                    during that period many most elegant structures were erected, and many of those
                    of earlier date which had been commenced before or during the wars of the Roses,
                    and left unfinished, were completed. The first indication we have of the
                    presence of the <hi rend="italic">Cinquecentist</hi> in England, is in the tomb
                    of Henry VII., which was executed by Tor-regiano, an Italian artist, who, it
                    would appear, was obliged to have some respect to the style of the edifice in
                    which his work was to rest; but his preconceived ideas of propriety and beauty
                    were too strong to allow him to omit the characteristics of his school, and the
                    result is a strange mixture of the two. From that time the Pointed style rapidly
                    deteriorated, being overbome by the taste of the Renaissance. On the Continent
                    the latter was already predominant, for, during the whole of the 15 th century,
                    the current had been setting from Italy over every part of Europe which received
                    its religion from Rome, and this country was only the last to be overwhelmed by
                    it.</p>
                <p>The first step taken towards the revolution of architecture was by Filippo
                    Brunelleschi, a Florentine architect, who was employed to finish the cathedral
                    of his native city early in the 15th century; a work which had been commenced
                    more than a century before on the design of Arnolfo, a Florentine also, but
                    which still required the cupola when its completion was intrusted to
                    Brunelleschi. The edifice is in the Italian Gothic style, which his affectation
                    of superior taste and talent induced him to attempt to supersede, so as to bring
                    the world back to the classic style of ancient Rome. The construction of the
                    cupola gained him great reputation and the confidence of the public, which he
                    employed to advance his favourite scheme. To use the words of an Italian writer
                    on the subject, “On the example of so wise and skilled a man, other architects
                    afterwards devoted themselves to free architecture from the monstrosities
                    introduced by barbarism and excessive licence, and to restore it to its
                    primitive simplicity and dignity.” But to what did they have recourse to effect
                    this? Did they examine and study the remains of antiquity in Greece and Rome, in
                    Italy and elsewhere? No! they referred to the writings of an obscure Latin
                    author, who professed to give the principles and practice of architecture among
                    the Greeks and Romans, but paid no more attention to the existing architectural
                    works of those nations than if they had never been, although one could hardly
                    walk the streets of any of the old cities in the south of Italy without seeing
                    Roman edifices, whilst Rome and its vicinity was, as it still is, full of them.
                    All the use, however, that these self-called “restorers” of architecture made of
                    the works of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n488/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0488-0437"/> ancients, was to use them as Lay-figures, or
                    framework, to model on, according to the proportions and directions given by
                    Vitruvius; and the effect was formality and mannerism in those who adhered to
                    the dogmas of the school, and wild grotesqueness in those who allowed themselves
                    to wander from them, whilst simplicity, and its consequence good taste, were
                    effectually banished from the works of them alL</p>
                <p>It may be necessary to remark here that the works of Vitruvius are of value
                    mainly as records of the architectural practice and the opinions and
                    acquirements of an architect of a distant age. His fables about the origin of
                    building, the invention of the orders, and the arrangements which grew out of
                    certain modes of construction, prove his total ignorance not only of the
                    architectural works of the more ancient Eastern nations, but of those of Greece
                    itself, which he professes to describe. His classical taste, in consequence of
                    his knowledge of antiquity, 13 vaunted by Perrault, one of his commentators, and
                    given by him as a reason why Vitruvius was not much employed by the whimsical
                    Romans, who loved variety, to which he would not administer. But the extent to
                    which his knowledge of antiquity, that is, of the works of the Greeks, extended,
                    may be readily determined by comparing the designs of Greek structures, made by
                    Perrault and 0ther3, according to the directions of Vitruvius, with the Greek
                    structures themselves as they exist even at the present time. Not a single
                    example of Greek architecture will bear out any of the rules which Vitn1viu3
                    lays down, professedly on its authority; and not an existing edifice, or
                    fragment of an edifice, is in form or proportion in perfect accordance with any
                    law of that author, nor indeed are they generally in harmony with the principles
                    he enunciates.</p>
                <p>The adoption of the Vitruvian laws by the Italian architects of the 15th century
                    led to the formation of the so-called “Five Orders.’’ In speaking of the course
                    of Greek and Roman architecture, mention has been made of the Doric, Ionic, and
                    Corinthian styles. Vitruvius describes, in addition to these, another, which he
                    calls Tuscan—possibly a style of columnar arrangement peculiar to Italy, and
                    most likely of Etrurian origin; but, in the absence of delineations, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cinquecentists</hi> could only apply the proportions he laid down
                    for it to what appeared to approximate them in the ancient remains; and hence
                    arose a fourth, or “the Tuscan Order.” It is, however, a mere modification of
                    the Roman debasement of the Doric, and may be considered, in its present foιm,
                    as of purely modem Italian origin. The same “Revivers,” on looking among the
                    ruins of ancient Rome for the forms of their Vitruvian orders, found specimens
                    of a foliated ordinance, which the bad taste of the Romans had compounded of the
                    foliated and voluted styles of the Greeks. This was seized upon as a fifth
                    style, subjected to certain rules and proportions, and called “the Composite
                    Order.” The very poor Roman specimens of Doric and Ionic fitted themselves
                    without much difficulty to the Vitruvian laws; but the examples Rome afforded of
                    the Corinthian were less tractable, and being as various in detail as they are
                    generally beautiful, they were all passed over, and their places supplied by a
                    mere changeling—an epitome of the Vitruvian theory. Thus we have the “Five
                    Orders” of the Italo-Vitruvian school, viz. :— <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> the
                    Tuscan, of which there is no recognised example of antiquity, but which owes its
                    form to the descriptions of Vitruvius and the fancies of the revivers; <hi
                    rend="italic">second,</hi> the Doric, a poor and tasteless arrangement of the
                    general features of the style on a Roman model; <hi rend="italic">third,</hi>
                    the Ionic, which is almost as great a debasement of the Grecian originals, and
                    was produced in the same manner as the last-mentioned; <hi rend="italic"
                    >fourth,</hi> the Corinthian, a something totally unlike the ancient examples of
                    both Greece and Rome in beauty and spirit; and, <hi rend="italic">fifth,</hi>
                    the Composite, an inelegant variety of the Corinthian, or a hybrid mixture of
                    the horned or angular-ionic volutes, with a deep necking of the foliage of the
                    preceding order. The first to publish this system was Leon Battista Alberti, a
                    pupil of Brunelleschi. He has been followed by many others, the most
                    distinguished of whom are Palladio, "Vignola, Scamozzi, Serlio, and De Lorme,
                    architects, and Barbaro, a Venetian prelate, and an esteemed translator of, and
                    commentator on, Vitruvius. None of these, it must be understood, agreed with any
                    other of them, but each took his own view of the meaning of their common
                    preceptor; and yet none of their productions evince the slightest approach to
                    the elegance of form and beauty of proportion which distinguish the classic
                    models of the columnar architecture of antiquity. Palladio and Serlio were the
                    first to publish delineations and admeasurements of the Roman architectural
                    remains in Italy; but the total absence of verisimilitude to the originals, and,
                    in many cases, the absolute misrepresentations, in both works, prove how
                    incompetent the authors were to appreciate their merits; and the exaggeration of
                    their defects proves with equal clearness the general bad taste of the school in
                    which they are masters. The worst qualities of the Roman school of architecture
                    were embraced and perpetuated by the Cinquecento artists. The inharmonious and
                    unpleasing combinations which arose out of the collocation of arches with
                    columnar ordinances became the characteristics of the Italian; unequal
                    intercolumnia-tions, broken entablatures and stylobates, enter alike into the
                    productions of the best and of the worst of the Cinquecento architects. The
                    style of this school is marked, too, by the constant attachment of columns and
                    their accessories to the fronts or elevations of buildings; by the infrequency
                    of their use in insulated (their natural) positions to form porticoes and
                    colonnades; by the thinness or want of breadth in the smaller members of their
                    entablatures, and the bad proportions of the larger parts, into which they are
                    divided; by the general want of that degree of enrichment which fluting imparts
                    to columns; by the too great projection of pilasters, and the inconsistent
                    practice of diminishing, and sometimes fluting them; by the use of circular and
                    twisted pediments, and the habit 01 making breaks in them to suit the broken
                    ordinance they may crown; and by various other inconsistencies and deformities,
                    which will be rendered more evident when we come to treat of the style in
                    detail. The merit of the Italian school consists in the adaptation and
                    collocation of the prolate hemispheroidal cupola, which appears to have grown
                    out of its opposite in the Roman works during the Gothic ages, as we find it in
                    the early cathedrals; though it is highly probable that the idea was brought
                    from the East, in the forms exhibited by the cupolas of St Mark’s at Venice, and
                    of Pisa Cathedral· A very imposing style of palatial architecture also was
                    practised by many of the Italian architects. It consists of the use of a grand
                    crowning cornice, running in one unbroken line, unsuπnounted by an attic or
                    anything of the kind, superimposing a broad, lofty, and generally
                    well-proportioned front, made into graceful compartments, but not storied, by
                    massive blocking courses or otherwise. Not unfrequently, however, the faults of
                    the school interfere to injure a composition of this kind; for, to produce
                    variety in the decorations of the windows, some of them have been made like
                    doors, with distyle arrangements of columns, surmounted by alternations of
                    circular and angular pediments, and sometimes with all the vagaries which deform
                    the front of an Italian church. It is indeed the ecclesiastical architecture of
                    the school in which its faults are most rife and its merits most rare. An
                    Italian Renaissance church possesses nothing of the stern simplicity and
                    imposing grandeur of an Egyptian sacred structure—nothing of the harmonious
                    beauty and classic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n489/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0489-0438"/> dignity of a Grecian fane—nothing of the ornate
                    and attractive elegance of a Roman temple—and nothing truly of the glittering
                    grace and captivating harmony of a Pointed cathedral. No other style of
                    architecture presents so great a contrast, in any two species of its
                    productions, as the Italian does, in one of its ordinary church fronts, with the
                    front of a nobleman’s mansion or palazzo, in the manner already referred to; and
                    in no city of Italy is the contrast so strong, by the egregiousness of the
                    examples it contains of both, as Rome. The stately portico is hardly known in
                    Italian architecture; and in the rare cases in which insulated columns are
                    found, they are for the most part so meagre in themselves, and so widely set,
                    according to the Vitruvian laws, that the effect produced by them is poor and
                    wretched in the extreme. This applies most particularly to Italy itself: in some
                    other countries, and especially in this, those architects who have been of the
                    Italian school have generally preferred the proportions and arrangements which
                    they found in the Roman examples of antiquity, to those laid down by their
                    Italian masters. Still, Italian church architecture of this period availed
                    itself largely of the cupola,— certainly its redeeming feature; and the
                    architects of Italy must have full credit for the use they have made of it, both
                    internally and externally. Perhaps no two edifices display more, and in a
                    greater degree, both the merits and defects of the school which produced them,
                    than the Farnese palace and the basilica of St Peter in Rome. The principal
                    front of the former edifice is noble in its proportions, but frittered in its
                    details. It has an immense crowning cornice, whose general effect is certainly
                    grand; but the mouldings are too much projected, and its vertical parts want the
                    breadth which the blocking courses possess. The lowest of its three tiers of
                    windows is characterised by extreme simplicity and good taste in almost every
                    particular; but the other two are crowded with sins against both those
                    qualities, in the dressings of the windows. The cortile and back front, though
                    veιy differently arranged from the front and from each other, are filled with
                    contrarieties, and the same may be said of the structure throughout. The front
                    of St Peter’s is not more distinguished by its magnitude than by its littleness
                    and deformity. It contains the materials of a noble octaprostyle, and consists
                    of an attached tetrastyle. It is divided into three unequal stories, within the
                    height of the columns, whose entablature is surmounted by a windowed attic. In
                    length it is frittered into a multitude of compartments, between which not the
                    slightest harmony is maintained, while tawdriness and poverty are the
                    distinguishing characteristics of its detail. A total absence of everything
                    which produces grandeur and beauty in architecture, marks, indeed, the whole of
                    the exterior of the edifice, except the cupola, than which, if its bad
                    connection with the building out of which it grows is overlooked, architecture
                    seldom produced a more magnificent object. Internally, the structure is open to
                    similar praise and similar dispraise. Gorgeousness in matter and meanness in
                    manner characterise the interior of St Peter’s, except the sublime concave which
                    is formed by its redeeming feature without. It must be said also that, probably,
                    no building was ever erected in which the eye is so successfully deceived as to
                    the actual dimensions. Its architect raised enormous walls, arches, and vaults,
                    but gave every one the impression that they were on a very moderate scale. The
                    tawdry and inappropriate sculptured decorations of the Renaissance school can
                    nowhere be criticised with more advantage than in St Peter’s. It is not too much
                    to say that, throughout the interior, there is scarcely an ornament which is not
                    offensive; whilst not one of them has the slightest natural connection with, or
                    use in, a sacred building. Perhaps sculpture never reached so profound a bathos
                    as in the hideous cherubs which are stuck, like petrified acrobats, against all
                    the piers of St Peter’s; and when we hear of such a building being treated as a
                    model for our guidance in the completion of St Paul’s, we are driven devoutly to
                    hope that St Paul’s may never in that sense be completed at all. Few people ever
                    seem to trouble themselves to look at any part of St Peter’s except the entrance
                    front and the dome. If they would examine the rest of the exterior they would
                    find it to be a building without one other redeeming feature, or a single grace
                    of outline or detail, and so absolutely unscientific in its constructional
                    arrangements as to be beneath contempt as a complete work of architecture.</p>
                <p>The Cinquecento architects of Italy were extreme mannerists; but besides the
                    manner of the school, each had his own peculiarities; so that there exists in
                    their works what may almost be called monotonous variety. Brunelleschi’s designs
                    are distinguished by a degree of simplicity and comparative good taste, which
                    causes regret that he had not referred more to the remains of antiquity in
                    Italy, and sought out those of Greece, and attended less to the dogmas of
                    Vitruvius; for then his works would have been more elegant and the school he
                    founded would have done him much more honour. The works of Bramante possess a
                    more classical character than those of any other architect of the school.
                    Bramante’s design for St Peter’s was preferred by Pope Julius IL to a great many
                    others by the most celebrated men of the time. He it was who suggested the
                    cupola; but, unfortunately, after his death men of lese taste and ability were
                    allowed to alter the design, and the edifice is very different from what it
                    would have been had Bramante been adhered to. This we judge from his w0rk3
                    generally, and not from any positive knowledge of the design, which indeed does
                    not exist. The elder Sangallo was far inferior to his contemporary and rival
                    Bramante, and his works are full of the faults of the school. Michel Angelo
                    Buonarroti was a man of great genius, but of coarse taste in architecture; and
                    to him may be attributed many of the coarser qualities of the Italian style. His
                    principal works are the buildings of the Capitol and the College della Sapienza
                    in Rome, and the Laurentian Library at Florence; and these are all distinguished
                    for their singular want of architectural beauty and propriety in every
                    particular. Raffaelle, too, had a very bad style in architecture, and so indeed
                    had almost all the painters after Giotto, who professed to be architects also.
                    They generally carried to extremes all the faults of the school. Sansovino and
                    Sanmicheli were men of considerable talent; their works display more originality
                    and less servility than those of most of their contemporaries. Peruzzi was less
                    employed than many who had not half his merit; his productions are with reason
                    considered among the most classical of the Italian school. Vignola had a more
                    correct taste than perhaps any other Italian architect of the 16th century; his
                    works are indeed distinguishable by their superiority in harmony of composition
                    and in general beauty of detail. Palladio very much affected the study of the
                    antique, but his works do not indicate any appreciation of its beauties. He
                    appears to have been very well qualified by nature for an architect, but spoiled
                    by education. He did not look at the remains of antiquity with his own eyes, but
                    with those of Vitruvius and Alberti, and he seems to have been too much
                    influenced by the admired works of some of his predecessors. Palladio made
                    greater use of insulated columns than the Italian architects generally, but his
                    ordinances are deficient in every quality that produces beauty; his porticoes
                    may be Vitruvian, but they certainly are not classic; and all his works show
                    that he studied the Colosseum, the theatre of Marcellus, and the triumphal
                    arches, more than the columns of Jupiter Stator and Mars Ultor, the temple of
                    Antoninus and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0496-0439"/> Faustina, the Pantheon, the portico at Assisi,
                    and the other classic models, which he drew, but clearly did not appreciate. His
                    columns upon columns, his attached and clustered columns, his stilted post-like
                    columns, his broken entablatures, his numberless pilasters, straggling and
                    unequal intercolumniations, inappropriate and inelegant ornaments, circular
                    pediments, and the like, are blemishes too numerous and too great to be passed
                    over because of occasional elegance of proportion and beauty of detail. Scamozzi
                    did not improve on the style of his master, which, however, he very much
                    affected. Indeed, the term <hi rend="italic">Palladian</hi> was long used as
                    synonymous with beautiful and excellent architecture, so that it cannot be
                    wondered at that Palladio’s pupils and successors should have imitated him; nor
                    is it surprising that they did not surpass, or even equal him, for they were
                    taught to look to his works as the <hi rend="italic">ηe plus ultra</hi> of
                    excellence. Giacomo della Porta, a contemporary of Palladio, followed Michel
                    Angelo in several of his works, and imbibed much of his manner, on which ho
                    certainly improved; but still his own is far from being good. Della Porta was
                    much employed in Rome; and it fell to him, in conjunction with Domenico Fontana,
                    to put the cupola on St Peter’s. Fontana’s style of architecture is not
                    particularly distinguished for its good or bad qualities: he obtained more
                    reputation as an engineer than as an architect, having been engaged in removing
                    and setting up most of the obelisks which give so much interest to the
                    architectural scenery of Rome. The Lunghi, father, son, and grandson, the
                    Rainaldi, Maderno, Borromini, Bernini, Carlo Fontana, Fuga, Van vitelli, and
                    many others in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, carried the
                    peculiarities of the Italian school to the greatest extremes. Of those
                    enumerated, Bernini was perhaps the least offensive, and Borromini the most
                    extravagant; but throughout that period, except in extreme cases, individual
                    manner is less distinguishable, and that of the school more strongly marked.</p>
                <p>It may be gathered from the preceding remarks, that the secular architecture of
                    the Italian school is generally preferable to the ecclesiastical, and that the
                    architects of the 15th and 16th centuries were generally superior to those who
                    followed them. In Italy tho school has not yet ceased to exist, nor indeed has
                    its style ceased to be studied. Designs are still made by the students of the
                    various academies in the manner of the Cinquecento, and on the models with which
                    the country abounds. The precepts of Vitruvius are yet inculcated, and the men
                    whose names have just been mentioned are looked up to as masters of architecture
                    in the country which contains the Roman Pantheon and the Greek temple of Neptune
                    at Paestum, and has access to the more exquisite works of Greece herself.</p>
                <p>As has been already stated, Italian architecture, though professedly a revival of
                    the classical styles of Greece and Rome, was formed without reference to the
                    existing specimens of either, but on the dogmas of an obscure Roman author, and
                    the glosses of the “revivers” on his text. Vitruvius described four classes or
                    orders of columnar composition; and on the principles which governed him in
                    subjecting to fixed laws all the varieties with which he appears to have been
                    acquainted, they formed a fifth, of a medley of two of his, thus completing the
                    Italian orders of architecture. Tho school which was founded on the Vitruvian
                    theories has systematised everything to an absurd extent, and laid down laws for
                    collocating and proportioning all the matter it furnishes for architectural
                    composition and decoration. It teaches that columns are modelled from the human
                    figure; that the Tuscan column is like a sturdy labourer—a rustic; the Doric is
                    somewhat trimmer though equally masculine—a gentleman, perhaps; the Ionic is a
                    sedate matron; tho Corinthian a lascivious courtesan; and the Composite an
                    amalgam of the last two! In a composition which admits any two or more of them,
                    the rustic must take the lowest place; on his head stands the stately Doric, who
                    in his turn bears the comely matron, on whose head is placed the wanton, and the
                    wanton again Î3 made to support the lady of doubtful character! Without
                    commenting on this, wo proceed at once to point out the general features of the
                    Italian style, premising only, that according to the practice of the school
                    everything is confined to an exclusive use and appropriation; such columns may
                    be fluted, and such must not; such a moulding may be used here, but not there;
                    and so on. The proportions and arrangements of an order, of any part of one, or
                    of anything that may come within an architectural composition, are fixed and
                    unchangeable, whatever may be the purpose or situation for which it is required;
                    whether, for instance, an order be attached or insulated, the column must have
                    exactly the same number of modules and minutes in height. It is true that the
                    masters of the school are not agreed among themselves as to those things in
                    which they are not' bound by Vitruvius; but every one not the less contends for
                    the principle, each, of course, prescribing his own doctrine as orthodox and
                    final on these unsettled points.</p>
                <p>Mouldings are considered by these authorities as constituent parts of an order,
                    and are limited to eight in number, strangely enough including the fillet. They
                    are the cyma-recta, the cyma-reversa (or ogive or ogee), tho ovolo, the torus,
                    the astragal or bead, the cavetto, the scotia, and the fillet. They are gathered
                    from the Roman remains, but reduced to regular lines or curves, which unlike all
                    good artistic work may be drawn with a rule or struck with a pair of compasses.
                    By their arrangement according to certain proportions, with flat surfaces,
                    modil-lions, and dentils, a profile is formed; no two conjoined mouldings may be
                    enriched, but their ornaments, as well as the modillions and dentils, must be
                    disposed so as to fall regularly under one another, and, when columns occur,
                    above the middle of them.</p>
                <p>An order is said to be composed of two principal parts, the column and the
                    entablature; these are divided into base, shaft, and capital in the one, and
                    architrave, frieze, and cornice in the other, and are variously subdivided in
                    the different orders. The Tuscan column must be mado seven diameters in height,
                    the Doric eight, the Tonic nine, and the Corinthian and Composite ten. The
                    height of tho entablature, according to some authorities, should be one-fourth
                    the height of the column, and, according to others, two of its diameters. The
                    parts of the entablature of all but the Doric may be divided into ten equal
                    parts, four of which are given to the cornice, three to the frieze, and three to
                    the architrave; and in the Doric, the entablaturo being divided into eight
                    parts, three must be given to tho cornice, three to the frieze, and tho
                    remaining two to the architrave. For the minor divisions a diameter of the
                    column is made into a scale of sixty minutes, by which they are arranged; but
                    this is obviously irrelevant if tho whole height of the entablature is
                    determined by the height of the column, and not by its diameter; in this case,
                    therefore, they must be proportioned from the general divisions already
                    ascertained. Columns must be diminished, according to Vitruvius, more or less as
                    their altitude is less or greater,—those of about fifteen feet high being made
                    one-sixth less at their superior than at their inferior diameter, while that
                    proportion is lessened gradually, so that columns fifty feet high shall be
                    diminished one-eighth only. On this subject, however, many of his disciples
                    controvert the authority of their master; and somo of them have fixed the
                    diminution at one-sixth of a diameter for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0497-0440"/> columns of all sizes in all the orders. The
                    entasis of columns is disputed also, some authorities making it consist in
                    preserving the cylinder perfect one-quarter or one-third the height of the shaft
                    from below, diminishing thence in a right line to the top; while others,
                    following Vitruvius, make the column increase in bulk in a curved line from the
                    base to three-sevenths of its height, and then diminish in the same manner for
                    the remaining four-sevenths, thus making the greatest diameter near the
                    middle.</p>
                <p>It being difficult to determine among the masters of the Italo-Vitruvian school
                    whose designs of the various orders are to be preferred, we have selected those
                    of Palladio, certainly not for any superior merit they possess, but because ho
                    is more generally esteemed than any other, and because he the most strictly
                    adhered to the precepts of Vitruvius, as far as he could understand them. It
                    should be remarked however, that although Palladio recommended fluting all but
                    the shaft of the Tuscan column, he very seldom fluted columns in his own
                    practice; and indeed it was the custom of the Italian school not to flute,
                    whatever their doctrine may be to the contrary; for fluted columns in Italian
                    architecture are exceptions to the general practice. Swelled or pillowed friezes
                    are not peculiar to Palladio; they are more or less common to the works of most
                    of the masters of the same school. Prostyles being almost unknown in Italian
                    architecture, antae are not often required; but when they are, the meanest
                    succedaneum imaginable is recurred to. Of this Palladio’s "Villa Capra near
                    Vicenza and Lord Burlington’s Palladian villa at Chiswick afford striking
                    examples. Pilasters, however, are very common, so common, indeed, that they may
                    be called pro-columns, as they are often used as an apology for applying an
                    entablature. They are described as differing from columns in their plan only,
                    the latter being round, and the former square; for they are composed with bases
                    and capitals, are made to support entablatures according to the order to which
                    they belong, and are fluted and diminished with or without entasis, just as
                    columns of the same style would be. When they are fluted, the flutes are limited
                    to seven in number on the face, which, it is said, makes them nearly correspond
                    with the flutes of columns; and their projection must be one-eighth of their
                    diameter or width when the returns are not fluted; but if they are, a fillet
                    must come against the wall. Pedestals are not considered by the Italo-Vitruvian
                    school as belonging to the orders, but they may be employed with them all, and
                    have bases and surbases or cornices to correspond with the order with which they
                    may be associated. The dado of a pedestal must be a square whose side shall be
                    equal to that of the plinth of the column or pilaster which rests on it, or a
                    parallelogram a sixth or even a fourth of a diameter taller. The
                    intercolumniations of columns are called pycnostyle, systyle, eustyle, diastyle,
                    and araeostvle, and are strictly adhered to in Italian architecture when columns
                    are insulated, which is not very often; when they are attached, the interspaces
                    are not limited, except when a peculiar arrangement called araeostyle is
                    adopted. This consists of two systyle intercolumniations, the column that should
                    stand in the mid-distance between two others being placed within half a diameter
                    of one of them, making, in fact, coupled columns or pilasters. It is applied to
                    insulated columns as well as to those which are attached. Following Vitruvius,
                    the Italian school makes the central intercolumniation of a portico wider than
                    any of the others. The height of arched openings, in arcades or elsewhere, is
                    generally about twice their width; if, however, they are arranged with a
                    columnar ordinance, having columns against the piers, they are made to partake
                    of the order to which the columns belong, being lower in proportion to their
                    width with the Tuscan than with the Doric, and so on; and the piers are allowed
                    to vary in the same manner, from two-fifths to one-half of the opening. With
                    columnar arrangements, moulded imposts and archivolts are used; the former being
                    made rather more than a semi-diameter of the engaged columns in height, and the
                    latter exactly that proportion. Variously moulded keystones are used, too,
                    projecting so that they give an appear ance of support to the superimposed
                    entablature. Smaller columns with their entablature are sometimes made to do the
                    duty of imposts, and sometimes single columns are similarly applied; at other
                    times, columns in couples are allowed to stand for piers to carry arches. In
                    plain arcades the masonry is generally rusticated, without any other projection
                    than a plain blocking course for an impost, and a blocking course or cornice
                    crowning the ordinance. Niches and other recesses are at times introduced in the
                    plain piers, which are in that case considerably wider than usual, or in the
                    spandrels over wide piers. Very considerable variety is allowed in these
                    combinations. Doors and windows, whether arched or square, follow nearly the
                    same proportions, being made, in rustic stories, generally rather less than
                    twice their width in height, and in others either exactly of that proportion, or
                    an eighth or a tenth more. If they have columned or pilastered frontispieces,
                    these are sometimes pedimented; and, except in rustic stories, whether with or
                    without columns, a plain or moulded lining called an architrave is applied to
                    the head and sides of a door or window. This architrave is made from one-sixth
                    to one-eighth the width of the opening it bounds, and it rests on a blocking
                    course or other sill, as the case may be. In the absence of columns or pilasters
                    in the frontispiece, their place is frequently supplied by consols or trusses of
                    various form and arrangement, backed out by a narrow pilaster, which may be
                    considered as the return of the frieze of the entablature, and which supports
                    the cornice. It is not uncommon for the architrave lining to project knees at
                    the upper angles, and this is sometimes done even with consols and their
                    pilasters. With columned frontispieces to gateways, doors, and windows, arose
                    the custom, so frequent in Italian architecture, of rusticating columns, by
                    making them alternately square and cylindrical, according to the heights of the
                    courses of rustic masonry to which they are generally attached, and with which
                    they are less offensive than in other collocations. The practice of the
                    Cinquecento school of piling columns on columns with their accessories is
                    warranted by the doctrine of its master; but his precepts not being practicable,
                    recourse has been had to the inferior works of the Romans, which present
                    examples of it. The difficulty of preserving anything like a rational
                    arrangement is acknowledged on all hands to be great, if not insurmountable; for
                    if the first or lowest order be at an intercolumniation fitting its proportions,
                    the second or next above it, though diminished ever so little, is already
                    deranged, for it has the same distance from column to column that the inferior
                    order has whilst the columns themselves are smaller in diameter, and their
                    entablature consequently shallower. This derangement must, of course, increase
                    with every succeeding ordinance, rendering it indeed impossible to make such a
                    composition consistent. The most approved practice in arranging order above
                    order appears to be, that the upper column shall take for its diameter the
                    superior diameter of the one below it; that when the columns are detached their
                    axes shall be in the same perpendicular line; but when attached or engaged, the
                    plinth of the pedestal of the upper shall impend the top of the shaft of the
                    lower column. The most rational mode, however, for diminishing, if reason can be
                    applied to such compositions, is to carry the diminution through, the outlines
                    of the columns of the lowest order being drawn up in the same direction, and so
                    the columns of every story would take up their place and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n498/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0498-0441"/> be diminished in regular gradation. When columns
                    are attached, or pilasters are used, in Italian architecture, the almost
                    invariable custom is to break the entablature over every column or pilaster, or
                    over every two when they are in couples. Because of the great length of the
                    intercolum-niation, this would appear to have been done at first; but it has
                    frequently been done by some of the most distinguished practitioners of the
                    school, even without that excuse, so that it may be held as approved by them. A
                    basement is either a low stereobate or a lofty story, according as it is
                    intended to support a single ordinance the whole height of the main body of the
                    structure, or indeed the lowest of two or more orders; or as it occupies the
                    ground story of a building, and supports an ordinance, or the appearance of one,
                    above. In either case much is necessarily left to the discretion of the
                    architect; but in the latter the height of the order it is to support is the
                    generally prescribed height of the basement. A basement may be rusticated or
                    plain; if it be low, and is not arranged like a continued pedestal, it must have
                    neither cornice nor blocking course; but if lofty, a deep bold blocking course
                    is indispensable. An attic may vary in height from one-quarter to one-third the
                    height of the order it surmounts; attics are arranged with a base, dado, and
                    coping cornice, like pedestals, and generally have pilasters broken over the
                    columns below. The rule for the form, composition, and application of pediments
                    in Italian architecture, if it may be gathered from the practice of the school,
                    appears to be to set good taste at defiance in them all. We find pediments of
                    every shape, composed of cornices, busts, scrolls, festoons, and what not, and
                    applied in every situation, and even one within another, to the number of three
                    or four, and each of these of different form and various composition. The
                    proportion laid down for the height of a pediment is from one-fourth to
                    one-fifth the length of its base, or the cornice on which it is to rest.
                    Balustrades are used in various situations, but their most common application is
                    in attics, or as parapets on the summits of buildings, before windows, in
                    otherwise close continued stereobates, to flank flights of steps, to front
                    terraces, or to flank bridges. Their shapes and proportions are even more
                    diversified than their application; that of most frequent use is shaped like an
                    Italian Doric column, compressed to a dwarfish height, and consequently swollen
                    in the shaft to an inordinate bulk in the lower part, and having its capital, to
                    the hypotrachelium, reversed to form a base to receive its grotesque form. The
                    base and coping comice of a balustrade are those of an ordinary attic, or of a
                    pedestal whose dado may be pierced into balusters. The general external
                    proportions of an edifice, when they are not determined by single columnar
                    ordinances, appear to be unsettled. The grand front of the Farnese Palace in
                    Rome is in two squares, its length being twice its height; the length of each
                    front of Vignola’s celebrated pentagonal palace of Caprarola is two and a
                    quarter times its height above the bastions. In Palladio’s works we find the
                    proportions of fronts to vary so considerably as to make it evident that he did
                    not consider himself bound by any rule on that point. In some cases we find the
                    length to be one and a sixth times the height, in others one and a fourth, one
                    and a half, two, two and a sixth, and even three and a sixth; and elevations by
                    other masters of the school are found to vary to the same extent. The
                    proportions of rooms, again, range from a cube to the ratio of one to two,
                    though it is preferred that the height should be a sixth, or even a fifth, less
                    than a side when the plan is a square; but the sesquialteral form, with the
                    height equal to the breadth, and the length one-half more, is considered the
                    most perfect proportion for a room. There is considerable variety and beauty in
                    the foliate and other enrichments of an architectural character in many
                    structures in Italy, but very little ornament enters into the columnar
                    composition of Italian architecture. Friezes, instead of being sculptured, are
                    swollen; the shafts of columns, it has been already remarked, are very seldom
                    fluted, and their capitals are generally poor in the extreme; mouldings are
                    indeed sometimes carved, but not often; rustic masonry, ill-formed festoons, and
                    gouty balustrades, for the most part supply the place of chaste and classic
                    enrichment. This refers more particularly to the more <hi rend="italic"
                    >classic</hi> works of the school; in many of the earlier structures of Italy,
                    and especially on monuments of various kinds, we find what may be called a
                    graceful profusion of ornament, of the most tasteful and elegant kind; few
                    carved mouldings, however, and very few well-profiled cornices, are to be met
                    with in Italian compositions of any kind. In many of the later architectural
                    works of that country we find again a profusion of ornament of the most
                    tasteless and inelegant description, chiefly in the gross and vulgar style,
                    which is distinguished as that of Louis XIV. of France.</p>
                <p>In the 15th century such was the reverence of men for the revived works of
                    ancient literature and science, that the pretence of the Italians, that they had
                    restored ancient classical architecture on the precepts of an architect of the
                    Augustan age, was sufficient to open the way for them all over civilised Europe.
                    In the course of that and the following century Italian architecture was adopted
                    and Italian architects employed in France, Spain, Germany, Great Britain, and
                    their respective dependencies; and now, in the 19th century, Vitruvius and
                    Palladio are as predominant on the shores of the Baltic as on those of the
                    Mediterranean; though in England and in some parts of the Continent their
                    influence is considerably diminished since the time of Inigo Jones and Claude
                    Perrault. It has been already remarked, too, that the Cinquecento was later in
                    gaining a footing in Britain than on the Continent, in consequence of the love
                    of the beautiful national style of architecture, which our ancestors do not
                    appear to have been induced to resign to the barbarian innovators of the South,
                    as readily as most other nations were to give up theirs. The French, though they
                    received the Vitruvian architecture from the Italians, were patriotic enough, as
                    soon as they had acquired its principles, to confine the practice of it almost
                    entirely to native architects, in whose hands it assumed a different character
                    from that which it possessed in Italy, and became what maybe called the French
                    style of Cinquecento. Its ecclesiastical structures are less faulty than are
                    those of the corresponding period in Italy, but its secular edifices are as far
                    inferior to those of that country. The grand palatial style, which is
                    exemplified in the Farnese Palace in Rome, never found its way into France; but
                    instead, there arose that monstrous and peculiarly French manner, of which the
                    well-known palaces of the Tuileries and Luxembourg are egregious examples. In
                    the age of Louis XIV. the French appear to have reverted to the Italian manner
                    in a certain degree; for the palace of Versailles includes almost all the
                    extravagances of that school in its worst period, and contains, moreover,
                    architectural deformities which Italy never equalled till it imitated them. They
                    consist in the style of enrichment which is distinguished by the name, and is
                    due in part to the gross taste, of the monarch in whose reign it had its origin.
                    The same period produced one of the most classical architects of the French
                    school—its Palladio or Inigo Jones—Perrault, whose design for the buildings of
                    the Louvre was preferred to that of Bernini, though, indeed, the preference was
                    no compliment to the one nor discredit to the other, considering to whom the
                    decision was of necessity referred. The Hotel des Invalides is of the same age:
                    it exhibits the graces of the Italian cupola, surmounting a composition which
                    includes more than all the faults of St Peter’s in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n499/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0499-0442"/> Rome. The church of Sainte Genevieve, or the
                    Pantheon, a work of the following reign, was intended to be in the ancient Roman
                    style, and of Roman magnificence; but it is rather papally than imperially so.
                    Ancient Rome was regarded in the columnar ordinance, but modern Rome in the
                    architectural composition. In it the ecclesiastical style of the Cinquecento is
                    commingled with the simple beauties of Roman architecture, almost, indeed, to
                    the destraction of the latter; and it is crowned by a too lofty cupola. More
                    recently the works of the ancients have been studied by the architects of
                    France, greatly to the amelioration of their style, although many of them still
                    appear to disregard the peculiarities of real Greek architecture, and to retain
                    their devotion to Vitruvius and the 15th century. Spain received but soon
                    modified the Italo-Vitravian architecture, and has never recovered from the
                    architectural excesses into which her architects plunged when the wealth of
                    their countrymen in the 16th and 17th centuries enabled them to accomplish such
                    enormous works. Of these, the man of the greatest fame out of his own country is
                    Herrera, the architect of the Escorial, a vast palace built upon the ingeniously
                    rural plan of a gridiron. It is a vast but bare, cold, and repulsive building.
                    Not less is the cathedral at Valladolid a grand failure, though Herrera must be
                    credited with much more self-restraint and reserve in the use of ornament than
                    the Italian architects of his own time, and some of his contemporaries and
                    successors in Spain. One of the most famous of these, Churriguerra, gave his
                    name to a fashionable style which was neither more nor less than the most <hi
                    rend="italic">rococo</hi> travesty of Italian Renaissance that could be
                    invented; and another school of architects, imitating the delicate chasing of
                    silversmiths’ work, produced another variation of the style, "which was
                    christened “Plateresque.” If this is less cold than Herrera’s work, and less
                    offensive than Churriguerra’s, it contains at the same time none of the elements
                    of a really great and lasting style of architecture, and is only interesting as
                    a local variety of style. The Italian revival was the means of extinguishing the
                    Pointed style of architecture in Germany, and certainly without affording it an
                    equivalent. Italian architects were employed in Germany, and Germans acquired
                    their manner; but they did not improve it, nor did they make it productive of so
                    many good effects as the Italians themselves did. The change in religion which
                    followed the change in architecture in so large a part of Germany may have
                    tended to prevent the latter from acquiring that degree of exuberance there
                    which it reached in Italy; but even in Catholic Germany the splendid Pointed
                    cathedrals have never given way to modifications of the pseudo-classic St
                    Peter’s. In the use of Cinquecento architecture for secular structures, it may
                    be truly said that the Germans have not excelled the Italians, nor, on the other
                    hand, have they equalled them in the absurdities and extravagances which are so
                    frequently observable in the works of some of the latter. The Germans also have
                    turned their attention to the works of the ancients, and the fruit of this is
                    evident in many parts of the country, particularly in Prussia; still, however,
                    they have yet to show that it is possible to apply the Greek models to modern
                    uses, and to exhibit a proper sense of the exquisite perfection of their detail,
                    as well as to emancipate themselves from the trammels of the Vitruvian school.
                    The northern Continental nations have been dependent for their architecture on
                    Germany, France, or Italy, and can produce nothing that gives them a claim to
                    consideration in such a review as the present. St Petersburg is exclusively the
                    work of architects of the nations just enumerated, and presents a mass of the
                    merest common-places of Italian architecture, in structures calculated by their
                    extent only, like Versailles, the Escorial, and St Peter’s, to impose on the
                    vulgar eye.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Modern English Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already more than once had occasion to refer incidentally to the
                    introduction of Cinquecento architecture into Britain; and in noticing it more
                    particularly, and tracing its course, we are saved the trouble of keeping up a
                    distinction between the different parts of our triple nation, because at the
                    time it actually crossed the Channel the union of the kingdoms had taken
                    place.</p>
                <p>When the Pointed style received its deathblow in England, in the reign of Henry
                    VIII., it did not immediately cease to exist; nor was it immediately succeeded
                    by the Italian when it became extinct. It was gradually declining through all
                    the 16th century, during the latter part of which period what has been called
                    the Elizabethan style became somewhat permanent. It consists of a singular
                    admixture of the Italian orders with many peculiarities of the Pointed style,
                    and in many examples the latter appears predominant. With such difficulty,
                    indeed, did that fascinating manner give up its hold on the minds of men in this
                    country, that the Cinquecentists appear to have relinquished the hope of
                    effecting its destruction, unfortunately, however, not until the injury was
                    done; and for some time we were left without a style of any kind, unless that
                    may be called by the name which marks the edifices of the reign of James I., and
                    of which the oldest parts of St James’s Palace are a specimen.</p>
                <p>The destraction of the Pointed style has been referred by some to the change in
                    religion which took place under the Tudor line of English monarchs, but
                    certainly without sufficient reason. It was the “Reformation” of architecture in
                    Italy, and not that of religion in Great Britain, that effected it; and it may
                    be doubted whether the change would not have taken place sooner in this country
                    if its connection with Italy had not been so materially affected by the moral
                    change here; for it was Germany and France that supplied us with architectural
                    reformers during the reigns of Henry VIII. and his children, and not Italy,
                    whose professors might possibly have obtained more credit than their disciples
                    did.</p>
                <p>So dilatory were we, indeed, in the cultivation of the Italian style, that the
                    first professor of it who was actually employed on edifices in this country came
                    to it from Denmark! It is true he w as an Englishman; but so little hope did he
                    appear to have of success at home, that he accepted an invitation from the king
                    of that country. He had gone to Venice to study painting; but becoming enamoured
                    of architecture, as he saw it in the works of Palladio, he had made that his
                    study instead, and had already acquired considerable reputation in that city
                    when Christian IV. of Denmark invited him to his court to occupy the post of his
                    first architect. A train of circumstances brought him to England a few years
                    after James I. came to the English crown, and he was appointed architect at
                    first to the queen, and subsequently to Henry prince of Wales. But this does not
                    appear to have then obtained employment for him, since after the death of the
                    prince he went again to Italy, where he remained till the office of
                    surveyor-general, which had been promised him in reversion, fell vacant. This
                    was the celebrated Inigo Jones, who has been called the English Palladio; and,
                    indeed, he succeeded so well in acquiring the peculiar manner of that architect,
                    that he richly deserves whatever credit the appellation conveys. It is
                    unfortunate, however, for his own reputation, that he had not looked beyond
                    Palladio and their common preceptor Vitruvius to the models the latter pretends
                    to describe; in which case he might have been the means of solving the question
                    whether the truly classical architecture of the ancients could ever be
                    introduced here with any advantage. But instead of that he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n500/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0500-0443"/> brought nothing home but Italian rules and
                    Italian prejudices. Jones commenced the truly Gothic custom of thrusting
                    Cinquecento fittings into our Pointed cathedrals, by putting up an Italian
                    screen in that of Winchester; and he barbarised the ancient cathedral of St Paul
                    in London, by repairing it according to his notions of Pointed architecture,
                    whilst at the same he defaced its exterior· by affixing to it an Italian front.
                    Of the Palladian style, however, he was a complete master. He designed a royal
                    palace, which was to have been built at Whitehall, in a manner as far superior
                    to those of Versailles and the Escorial as the works of Palladio are to those of
                    Borromini. The only part of Jones’s design ever executed is the structure called
                    the Banqueting House, whose exterior is an epitome of many of the faults, and
                    most of the beauties of the Palladian school. It rises boldly from the ground
                    with a broad, simple, and nearly continuous basement, or stereobate, and the
                    various compartments of its principal front are beautifully proportioned; but
                    though the circular pediments to the windows, the attached unfluted columns,
                    with broken entablatures and stylobates, the attic and balustrade, be the
                    materials of Palladian, it may be confidently denied that they are consistent
                    with classical, architecture. Another well-known work of this architect is the
                    Italo-Vitruvian Tuscan church of St Paul, Covent Garden, whose eastern portico
                    is well-proportioned in general, but grossly deformed in detail, and whose
                    interior was left to take care of itself, having absolutely no charm either of
                    proportion or detail.</p>
                <p>Architecture was in abeyance in this country, again, from the troublous times of
                    Charles I. till the restoration of the monarchy in the person of his son, whose
                    French taste would have completely Gallicised the architecture of the nation, if
                    the genius of Sir Christopher Wren had not been present to avert the infliction,
                    or rather to modify it; for it cannot be denied that the influence of the French
                    manner had an effect on the architecture of this country from that period down
                    to the middle of the last century. Indeed, Wren himself knew the style he
                    practised mainly from books and the structures of France; and, in consequence of
                    his visit to France, the peculiarities of the French style are obvious in many
                    of his less esteemed works. Fortunately, however, he was proof against the
                    grosser peculiarities of the Cinquecento, whether in the books of the Italians
                    or in the edifices of the French; and his own productions show that he had
                    imbibed much of the spirit of the antique monuments of Italy, which he could
                    have known only from engravings, and those very imperfect ones. The field that
                    was opened to his genius by the great fire of London in 1666, and its result,
                    are equally well known. It is true that the general absence of taste and feeling
                    with regard to the Pointed style extended even to him. Wren was guilty of many
                    offences in that respect, besides giving authority to the opprobrious term
                    Gothic; and in no case more so than inthe construction of the towers added to
                    Westminster Abbey, which are a lasting proof of his ignorance of its most
                    obvious principles. Nevertheless, to the influence of our beautiful native style
                    on his mind the architecture of his period is indebted for some of its best
                    works. If Wren had not been accustomed to contemplate the graceful and elegant
                    pyramids or spires of his native country, he would never have originated the
                    tapering steeple, in the composition of which with the materials of Italian
                    architecture he still stands as unrivalled as he was original. Witness the·
                    steeples of Bow Church and St Bride’s in London, the former of which is hardly
                    surpassed in grace and elegance by the pointed spires themselves. It must remain
                    a constant subject of curious speculation, what effect would have been produced
                    on this great head of the English school of Cinquecento architecture if he had
                    known the remains of ancient Greece and Rome from personal observation. With his
                    splendid genius and fine taste, if he had not been imposed on by the specious
                    pretence of the Italo-Vitruvian school, his works might have been models for
                    imitation and study, as they are objects of admiration; as it was, he avoided
                    many of the faults of that school, and improved on many of its beauties.
                    Although he did not know the Greek style at all, and knew the Roman only through
                    imperfect mediums, and, indeed, had never seen an example of either, whenever he
                    has varied from the Italian practice it has been towards the proportions and
                    peculiarities of the Greek! The great west front of St Paul’s, though it is said
                    to be imitated from that of St Peter’s in Rome, or rather from what it was
                    proposed to be, with the two towers to form its wings, is a much finer, a more
                    imposing, and more classical specimen of architecture than its prototype; for
                    the advantage the latter should have in being of columns in one height is lost
                    entirely in their poverty, and in the miserable arrangement of the whole front,
                    whereas that of St Paul’s is in two noble pseudo-prostyle and recessed
                    porticoes, with the columns fluted, and generally conceived and executed in much
                    better taste than those of St Peter’s. The entablatures, though massive, are
                    finely proportioned, and sufficiently ornate to be elegant; they are, too, quite
                    continuous, and the upper one is surmounted by a noble pediment, whose pyramidal
                    form gives at the same time dignity and a finished appearance to the whole
                    front. The coupling of the columns, however, and the putting of one columnar
                    ordinance over another, can only be defended by the practice of the Italian
                    school; though, in the present case, both are rendered less offensive by the
                    judicious management of the architect. Nothing shows more strikingly the
                    superiority of St Paul’s to St Peter’s as an architectural composition, than a
                    parallel of their flanks. The great magnitude of the latter may strike the
                    vulgar eye with admiration in the contrast; but the rudest taste must appreciate
                    the surpassing merit of the former in the form and arrangement of the cupola,
                    and the noble peristyle, with its unbroken entablature and stylobate, out of
                    which it rises, when compared with the sharper form and depressed substructure
                    of that of St Peter’s. The superiority of St Paul’s in the composition of the
                    main body of the edifice is not less in degree, though, perhaps, less obvious,
                    than in the superstructure. In the one it is broken and frittered, and in the
                    other almost perfectly continuous, in broad, bold, and effective masses.</p>
                <p>The history of the works of Sir Christopher Wren is the history of the
                    architecture of the period in this country; and as it must be admitted that he
                    was not so successful in the composition of the architecture of secular
                    structures as of ecclesiastical, it will follow that our secular edifices of
                    that time are of inferior merit. If it were not indeed an historical fact, it
                    would hardly be credited that Chelsea College, the old College of Physicians in
                    London, and the halls of some of the city companies, arc by the architect of Bow
                    Church and St Paul’s.</p>
                <p>The style introduced by Sir John Vanbrugh, who may be said to have succeeded Sir
                    Christopher Wren in the direction of architecture in England, was distinguished
                    by massiveness unsuited to the style in which he built, which was, of course,
                    Italian. It was, however, free from the extravagances which characterise that
                    style generally in other countries at the same period, but -was certainly more
                    suited to the soberer character of ecclesiastical than of secular structures,
                    whereas his principal works were noblemen’s mansions. Vanbrugh’s faults were
                    generally those of Michel Angelo; he was a painter architect, and did not
                    understand beauty of proportion and detail so well as the pictorial arrangement
                    of lights and shadows,—to produce which in the Cinquecento it is almost
                    necessary to part with all the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n501/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0501-0444"/> higher beauties of architecture. Hawksmoor added
                    to the style of his master that noble ornament in which Italian works are so
                    very deficient—a prostyle portico. His compositions are marked by severe
                    simplicity, and only want to be absolved from a few faults and enriched with a
                    few elegances to be among the best of modern times. Not the least distinguished
                    architect of the same age (the first half of the 18th century) was the earl of
                    Burlington, who was a passionate admirer of the style of Palladio and Inigo
                    Jones. Many of the edifices erected by Kent are asserted to be from the designs
                    of that nobleman, who, with considerable talent, was, however, a somewhat
                    bigoted devotee to Vitruvius and the Cinquecento generally, as well as to
                    Palladio in particular; for he frequently used columns representing half-barked
                    trees in conformity with the silly tales of Vitruvius, and the sillier whims of
                    his disciples. The portal of his own house in Piccadilly, and that of the King’s
                    Mews, were special examples of this bad taste, and of other faults of the school
                    besides. Lord Burlington built for himself at Chiswick a villa on the model of
                    the Villa Capra, or Rotonda, near Vicenza—a structure which has been called the
                    master-piece of Palladio. In form and proportion it is certainly elegant, but
                    its details strongly exhibit the poverty of Italian columnar architecture, when
                    unaided by the frittering which is its bane, and almost its only element of
                    effect. Gibbs, a contemporary, had, like Hawksmoor, imbibed a taste for the
                    classic prostyle portico, which he evinced in St Martin’s Church in London; but
                    that he also was in the trammels of the Italian school is no less evident, in
                    the same structure, to a considerable extent, and still more so in the church of
                    St Mary in the Strand, which is a mediocre specimen of architecture, though a
                    favourable one of its style. During the following half-century (the latter half
                    of the 18th) Sir William Chambers and Sir Robert Taylor were the most
                    distinguished architects of this country. They were both men of genius and
                    skill, who had availed themselves of the remains of Roman antiquity to good
                    purpose (for as yet those of Greece were cither unknown or unappreciated), and
                    the former has left us, in the Strand front of Somerset House in London, perhaps
                    the best specimen of its style in existence. Other parts of the same edifice,
                    however, are far from deserving the same degree of praise; indeed, as an
                    architectural composition, the river front is altogether inferior in merit to
                    the other, though of much greater pretence. The inner fronts to the great
                    quadrangle, though exhibiting good parts, are, as a whole, not above mediocrity.
                    An air of littleness pervades them; and the general effect of the fronts
                    themselves is made still worse by the little clock towers and cupolas by which
                    they are surmounted; and to this may be added the infinity of ill-arranged
                    chimneys, which impart an ’ air of meanness and confusion that nothing can
                    excuse. While Sir William Chambers and a few others were applying the best
                    qualities of Italian architecture, indeed, improving its general character, and,
                    it may be said, making an English style of it, there were many structures raised
                    in various parts of the country in a manner hardly superior to that of the time
                    of James I.,—structures in which all the meanness and poverty of the Cinquecento
                    are put forth, without any of its elegance of proportion, or that degree of
                    effectiveness which men of talent contrived to give it. During the same period,
                    too, the seeds of a revolution were sown, which almost succeeded in ejecting the
                    Italian style and its derivative from this country, without perhaps having
                    furnished a complete equivalent.</p>
                <p>In the year 1748 James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, two painters pursuing their
                    studies in Rome, having moreover paid some attention to architecture, issued
                    “Proposals for publishing an accurate description of the Antiquities of Athens,
                    &amp;c.” These proposals met with general approbation, and in consequence they
                    determined on prosecuting their plan; but various hindrances prevented their
                    arrival in Athens till March 1751, when they commenced measuring and delineating
                    the architecural monuments of that city and its environs. In this work they were
                    unremittingly employed (as far as their own exertions went, for they were
                    frequently interrupted by the Turks) for several years, so that they did not
                    reach England with the result of their labours until 1755; and, by a series of
                    almost unaccountable delays, the first volume of their work did not appear until
                    the year 1762. Sixteen years more expired before the second issued from the
                    press; and the third was not published until 1794, being nearly fifty years from
                    the time the work was first announced! In the meantime a Frenchman of the name
                    of Le Roy, who was at Rome when our countrymen issued their proposals, had gone
                    to Athens, and collecting in a very short time some loose materials, had
                    published at Paris, in 1758, a work which he called <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Ruines</hi><hi rend="italic">des plus beaux Moηumens</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Grèce,</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;kc.,</hi> in which he makes not the slightest
                    mention of Stuart and Revett, or of their labours or intentions, with all of
                    which he was well acquainted. This work is, moreover, notoriously and grossly
                    incorrect,—so incorrect, indeed, as to make it difficult of belief that its
                    author ever saw the objects of which he professes to give the representations.
                    It was, however, from M. le Roy’s work that the public had to judge of the
                    merits and beauties of Greek architecture; for the first volume of Stuart and
                    Revett's <hi rend="italic">Antiquities</hi> did not appear for several years
                    after it, and that doeβ not contain any pure specimen of the national or Doric
                    style: the second, which does, was not published for twenty years after Le
                    Roy’s. Considering, therefore, the source of information on the subject, it can
                    hardly be wondered at that Greek architecture was vituperated on all sides; and
                    by none with greater acrimony than by Sir William Chambers, whose apology must
                    be ignorance and the prejudices of education. He really did not know the style
                    he carped at; and his education in the Italo-Vitruvian school had unfitted him
                    for appreciating its grand, chaste, and simple beauties, even if he had known
                    it. Notwithstanding the misrepresentations of Le Roy, the vituperations of
                    Chambers, the established reputation of Italian architecture, and the trammels
                    which Vitruvius and his disciples had fixed on the public mind, when Stuart and
                    Revett’s work actually appeared, the Greek style gradually advanced in esteem,
                    by its intrinsic merits alone—for it has had no factitious aids; and since that
                    period, Greece and all her colonies which possess remains of her unrivalled
                    architecture have been explored, and we now possess correct delineations of
                    almost every Greek structure which has survived, though in ruins, the wreck of
                    time and the desolation of barbarism. To our country and nation, then, is due
                    the honour of opening the temple of Greek architectural art, of drawing away the
                    veil of ignorance which obscured the beauties it contains, and of snatching from
                    destruction, and consequent oblivion, the noble relics of ancient architecture
                    which bear the impress of the Grecian mind. Not only, indeed, were we the first
                    to open the mine, but by us it has been principally worked; for among the
                    numerous treatises on the Hellenic remains which now exist, by far the greatest
                    number, and indisputably the most correct, are by Englishmen, and have been
                    published in England. It required, however, a generation for the effects of
                    ignorance and prejudice in some, and imperfect knowledge in others, to wear away
                    before any effects of the study of the Greek style could be obvious in our
                    structures. The works of the Adams, who were the contemporaries and immediate
                    successors of Sir William Chambers, evince a taste for the beauties of Greek
                    architecture, but a very imperfect knowledge, indeed, of the means of
                    reproducing them. The <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0502-0445"/> architects who had the direction of our principal
                    works during the earlier part of this century had the disadvantage of being
                    pupils of those who were themselves, as we have shown, incompetent to appreciate
                    the Greek style; and at a time, too, when the state of Europe prevented all
                    access to the remains of Greece and Rome, so that no great improvement could
                    perhaps be expected from them. Personal study of the monuments they wish to
                    rival is the absolute duty of all architects, and it is possible that study even
                    of the older examples may in all cases teach them some useful lesson. The
                    structures of Egypt may show us how to arrange large masses harmoniously and
                    effectively, those of Greece and Rome how to impart grace and dignity. The
                    structures of Italy show us how far the materials of ancient architecture may be
                    moulded to modern uses, while at the same time they give practical warning of
                    what may result from the abuse of the most obvious principles of the art, and
                    from the neglect of our national style or the requirements of our own country
                    and climate, with which it is almost unnecessary to say it is quite impossible
                    to harmonise the works of so entirely different a climate as that of Greece.</p>
                <p>The difference between the representations of the Athenian antiquities by Stuart
                    and his colleague, and the misrepresentations of them by Le Roy, appears to have
                    opened the eyes of the world to those of ancient Rome, to see if they too had
                    not been dealt with unjustly; for much more correct delineations of them had
                    appeared than those of Palladio and Desgodets,—delineations of them as they
                    exist, exhibiting the spirit of the originals, and not warped to the Vitruvian
                    precepts, and thereby stripped of their best quality, truth. The excavation of
                    the ancient cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii has opened to us much interesting
                    and instructive matter, and their ruins have now been correctly delineated.</p>
                <p>It is an argument in proof of the classical beauty of the Pointed style, that
                    when the eyes of men were opened to the perfections of Greek architecture, they
                    began to discover its merits also. Pointed architecture, under the opprobrious
                    name Gothic, had long been a subject of discussion among antiquaries,—that is,
                    essays were written by them to prove how the pointed arch originated, but none
                    appreciated its beauties. Our Pointed cathedrals and churches were, after the
                    example of Inigo Jones, ruthlessly barbarised in course of repairing and fitting
                    them up. If an architect?-were employed to do anything about one of them, he
                    appears to have thought it incumbent on him to convert it to the doctrines of
                    his own faith—to Italianise it. Deans and chapters for the most part entrusted
                    their commissions to country masons and plasterers, who also operated according
                    to the laws of the “five orders.” About the middle of the 18th century one Batty
                    Langley endeavoured to draw the attention of the world to Pointed architecture,
                    by reducing it to rules, and dividing it into orders. Fortunately he was only
                    laughed at, and both he and the book he published on the subject were soon
                    forgotten. One of the first men in rank and influence of his time, in matters of
                    taste particularly, Horace Walpole, <hi rend="italic">patronised</hi> Pointed
                    architecture, but ineffectually. He had himself neither taste nor feeling to
                    appreciate its beauties, as his Strawberry Hill clearly shows. Delineations were
                    indeed put forth from time to time, but generally so rude and imperfect, that
                    they did more harm than good. The Society of Antiquaries, however, at length
                    took up the subject, engaged Mr John Carter, an ardent and judicious admirer of
                    our national architecture, and commenced the publication of a series of splendid
                    volumes, containing engravings of its best specimens, from drawings and
                    admeasurements by him. The <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of Athens</hi> had
                    already done much to dispossess men of their prejudicies, by showing that Greek
                    architecture, though neither Vitruvian nor Palladian, was nevertheless
                    beautiful; and the great work of the Society of Antiquaries did the same for
                    Pointed architecture. Since the death of Mr Carter our national buildings have
                    been studied, catalogued, drawn, and published by an infinity of admirers, who
                    have done their work with zeal which has been thoroughly enthusiastic. The works
                    of the elder Pugin were the first to show how architecture ought to be drawn,
                    whilst the work of Mr Rickman was the first to show how it ought to be studied.
                    From the time of these two pioneers in the work, it would be impossible to
                    catalogue a hundredth of the works which have be?.n devoted to the subject. Nor
                    have they been written by architects only. On the contrary, a large number of
                    them are the work of amateurs, and it may be truly asserted that never since art
                    has been written upon at all have so vast a number of publications, on every
                    branch of it, been given to the world as within the last thirty years have been
                    devoted to the illustration and history of our national Gothic architecture.
                    Germany and France have been equally prolific on the same subject, and the only
                    difficulty now is, out of the mass of materials how to select that which is
                    useful and to the point. In Spain and Italy no such zeal has been shown, and the
                    elucidation of their mediaeval antiquities has been left almost entirely to
                    foreign hands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saracenic Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>The beautiful forms by which Saracenic or Arabian architecture is best known were
                    wrought into a style, if they were not invented, by the descendants of the wild
                    Arab tribes who accepted Mahomet as their leader and prophet. In estimating
                    their influence upon architecture, the first point to be considered is whether
                    the Arabs, as they emerged from their deserts and overran the rich <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n503/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0503-0446"/> countries of Syria, Persia, and Egypt, brought
                    with them any art of their own, or whether they formed their style after their
                    conquests were secured, when they had become great, and had consequently leisure
                    and power to form it by the aid of foreigners. Now, in the Koran no notices are
                    found that would lead us to suppose that any definite forms of art were known to
                    the Arabs in early times. We gather also that the minaret, one of the most
                    prominent and beautiful forms of their architecture, could not have been used in
                    early times, since we are told that the call to prayers was then made from the
                    roofs of the mosques.</p>
                <p>The earliest example of a mosque in Arabia itself is supposed to have been that
                    at Mecca, 705 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> But this was rebuilt in the 15 th
                    century, and that of Medina in the 16th, and we have no definite account of the
                    original structures. The earliest of those which still exist are the Mosque of
                    Amrou at Cairo (about 642 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and that of Damascus
                    (705). Both of these were built of columns, &lt;fcc., obtained by the
                    destruction of Roman work.</p>
                <p>In the Mosque of Tooloon at Cairo we find for the first time anything original.
                    It was constructed about 879, and is said to have been designed by a Christian
                    architect. Indeed, numerous passages in the early history of the Saracens seem
                    to show that their architects and art workers generally were foreigners,
                    attracted from Baghdad, Byzantium, and other places. It was the same throughout
                    their progress in Spain as well as in Egypt; and however that style was
                    eventually formed, which has given to us the beautiful domes and minarets of
                    Cairo, the Alhambra in Spain, and the houses of Algiers, there can be little
                    doubt but that it was based upon the art of Persia and Byzantium.</p>
                <p>Ultimately it developed into two very distinct forms,— the Arabic of Cairo and
                    the Moorish of Spain. But these still showed themselves, both in general form
                    and in details, to be members of the same great family which we now call
                    Saracenic. The chief structures in this style are the mosques and tombs. The
                    former are very simple in plan, consisting, usually, of a mere open space with
                    colonnades round and with a prayer niche <hi rend="italic">(mehrab)</hi> in the
                    side towards Mecca. Near this was a pulpit <hi rend="italic">(mimbar),</hi> and
                    as this part of the edifice was of course the most frequented, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n504/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0504-0447"/> the colonnades were made of extra depth. In the
                    centre of the court was a fountain, just as in the atrium of the Christian
                    basilicas; and conspicuously, sometimes at each corner of the mosque, was placed
                    a minaret. The size of the whole and the number and richness of the columns
                    might vary, but the general arrangement was nearly always the same, the really
                    essential parts being the prayer niche, the pulpit, the fountain, some
                    protection against the burning noonday heat, and some elevated place from which
                    the priest could call to prayers. A remarkable exception to the ordinary plan
                    occurs in the celebrated Mosque Soultan Hassan at Cairo, which is in the form of
                    a cross, the four arms being arched over, whilst the centre is left open and
                    contains the usual fountain. Closely connected with the mosque is, often, the
                    tomb of its founder. This is nearly always covered with a dome which, when on a
                    large scale, was almost invariably a sign of a sepulchral edifice.</p>
                <p>In these mosques and tombs we meet with general forms and details unknown
                    elsewhere in Western art at the time of their erection. First of all we meet
                    with the pointed arch. Very early in the style, and long before the era of
                    Pointed architecture, this arch was used by the Saracens. But peculiar to their
                    art are the beautiful minarets. Springing from a square base, they were
                    gradually brought to an octagon or a round with a corbelled gallery at every
                    change, and each part ornamented by diaper work of the most elaborate kind. The
                    domes are equally varied and beautiful. They spring from a square base, and are
                    gathered into the usual circular form in the most graceful manner. Quite
                    opposite also to the Western mode, the external surfaces of the domes are
                    sometimes decorated with diaper or other work, beautiful in. itself and equally
                    so in its application, and never is the Saracenic dome concealed outside by a
                    conical roof. The want of a crowning cornice to the long lines of the walls was
                    to some extent supplied by a peculiarly bold crest ornament often filled in with
                    rich scroll or other work. A variety of these adorns many of the mediaeval
                    palaces of Venice. The ornamentation was almost entirely conventional, as the
                    strict rules of the Koran forbade the copying of any natural objects. That this
                    rule was not always followed may be seen in the Alhambra; but it, nevertheless,
                    was in general attended to, and wonderfully beautiful were the results of this
                    absence of all copying. Intricate scrollwork, flat in appearance on the surface,
                    but really in various planes and intertwining, formed the usual basis. And from
                    the scrolls came a sort of leafwork certainly like nothing in nature, but most
                    graceful and varied in its elegant curves. The whole is utterly conventional—as
                    entirely the creation of the artist’s mind as the most conventional work of a
                    Gothic architect. The capitals of the columns were usually some adaptation of
                    the classic. But in Spain, as specially seen in the Alhambra, they were of quite
                    an original type, somewhat like that which we have described as being the germ
                    of the Ionic, but with long leaves under the block, tied together with a band at
                    the top of the shaft.</p>
                <p>One of the ornaments peculiar to the Saracens, and constantly used by them, was
                    the honey-comb by which they brought the square base, which they almost always
                    used on plan, into the circular dome or niche-head.</p>
                <p>It was, in fact, the Saracenic pendentive. In its simplest form it occurs very
                    early in the style, as, e.y., at the Mosque of Tooloon at Cairo, and was
                    composed of a series of small niches, the pointed head of each of which bent
                    forward at the top and formed the springing point of two others. The repetition
                    of a few rows of this produced a pendentive in which it is impossible to detect
                    any harsh point of junction between the square base and the circular finish.
                    Sometimes this honey-comb work was exceedingly intricate, and formed
                    niche-heads, roofs, &amp;c. Good examples of this occurs at the Zisa, Palermo,
                    and at the Alhambra. The entrance doorways were often grandly composed in a very
                    high square recess; but the Saracens were as carefid as the Gothic architects
                    not to dwarf the size of the interior of their buildings by making the actual
                    openings large, and thus the recess was brought down in height by elaborate work
                    in the upper part, and the actual doorway thus reduced to just the size required
                    for use. The windows were, of necessity, small, in order to guard against the
                    heat; they were fitted up with thick bars of marble or of plaster, in elaborate
                    diaper patterns.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"

                <p>these being filled in with pot metal glass, brilliantly coloured. The ceilings,
                    when not domed, were flat, showing the timbers, which, in the finest examples,
                    were richly painted and gilt, the wood being first canvased over, and then
                    covered with a fine thin stucco to receive the decoration. The pavements were of
                    marble mosaic, in some cases lighted up in colour by enamelled earthenware
                    tesserae. The walls were often lined with still more elaborate mosaic, the
                    outlines being in some cases marked out with mother-of-pearl. Add to this that
                    the pulpits, doors, and other woodwork were of the most exquisite workmanship,
                    and the bronze hinges, &amp;c., often chased in a manner scarcely to be
                    paralleled in any other style, and we have a combination of outlines and details
                    which could scarcely be surpassed in design or execution in buildings of a size
                    comparatively so small. Admirable descriptions of Saracenic architecture in
                    Spain have been given by the late Mr Owen Jones and Μ. Coste; of that in Egypt,
                    also by M. Coste, and in India by Mr Fergus-son. Of the houses in Egypt the best
                    descriptions, probably, are those given in <hi rend="italic">The Modern
                    Egyptians,</hi> by Mr Lane, who has illustrated his work by numerous details of
                    the carved wood and other work in which the Arabs excelled. Of the houses in

                    1868-9.</p>
                <p>It remains only to say that the present successors of the Saracens seem now to
                    have lost nearly all claim to individuality in art, and to be unable even to
                    copy or imitate the illuminated MSS., the mosaics, the carving in wood or in
                    ivory, which lend so great a charm to the old work. What is now done is merely a
                    copy, and a bad copy, of the work of their European neighbours.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chinese Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>The buildings of the Chinese are very inferior in character to those of India; in
                    fact, Mr Fergusson goes so far as to say, “China possesses scarcely anything
                    worthy of the name of architecture.” Sir W. Chambers has described one of the
                    Buddhist temples, that at Ho-nang, which is not unlike those of India in
                    arrangement. There is an extensive court, with avenues of trees, leading to a
                    flight of steps and portico of four columns. In a second vestibule behind this
                    are four colossal figures bearing various emblems. Beyond this is a very large
                    second court, entirely surrounded by colonnades and small sleeping cells for the
                    priests or <hi rend="italic">bonzes;</hi> in other words, a huge cloister, much
                    like the Indian viharas. In the same ranges are four pavilions filled with
                    idols, and large rooms for refectories, behind which are the kitchen, courts,
                    &amp;c. At the extreme corners of the grand court are four other pavilions, the
                    dwellings of the higher order of priests. At equal distances behind each other,
                    down the centre of the court, are three larger pavilions, called <hi
                    rend="italic">tings,</hi> entered on each side by a flight of steps, and a
                    fourth engaged in the cloister itself, and having a front portico and one flight
                    of steps only. The first three are square, two stories in height, the lowest
                    surrounded by fourteen columns, each face or front showing six. They have rude
                    caps, composed of eight brackets, projecting various ways. Sir William Chambers
                    says there are four species of <hi rend="italic">tings,—</hi> three used for
                    temples and the fourth for gardens; some having a gallery and fretted railing
                    round the first floor on the outside, the upper story being set back. The roofs
                    all have the peculiar hollow dip, which leads one to suppose their prototype was
                    the tent, the sag of the cloth of which would suggest the form. They are
                    frequently surmounted with a sort of cresting and finial, and each angle is
                    turned up sharply, and ornamented with a dragon. Sometimes the columns have a
                    frieze perforated in the form of frets; sometimes the same is also under the
                    eaves of the upper roof. Examples are also given of smaller octagonal <hi
                    rend="italic">tings,</hi> intended to cover the large vessels in which the
                    Chinese burn gilt paper to their idols.</p>
                <p>Mr Simpson has given an interesting account of the temple of Heaven at Peking. It
                    lies in an open space of about one mile square, surrounded by a triple
                    enclosure. In this space were kept the animals destined for sacrifice. The
                    temple proper consisted of several detached structures, the most sacred being to
                    the south, and consisting of a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n506/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0506-0449"/> raised platform approached by three terraces, and
                    bearing simply an altar unscreened by any building and open to the sky. The
                    northern structure was roofed but not enclosed.</p>
                <p>Four pillars supported the main roof, which was 99 feet high, and lower roofs
                    round the higher one were upheld by 24 columns of less height, all richly
                    sculptured and gilt.</p>
                <p>The accompanying illustrations (figs. 52 to 54) represent Chinese temples of
                    different types.</p>
                <p>The most striking buildings in China are, however, the tapering towers which they
                    call <hi rend="italic">taas,</hi> and our old writers pagodas. These are of
                    brick covered with marble, or most generally with glazed tiles; and are built in
                    stories, one over the other, from three, four, or five, to as many as nine in
                    number. Each story is reduced in width, and has a gallery round it. The roofs
                    are hollow or sagging, like those formerly described. They project a great deal,
                    the corners being turned up sharply. On these light bells are suspended, which
                    make a constant ringing when the wind blows. The roofs are covered with glazed
                    tiles of various colours, and the summit ornamented with a species of spire and
                    finial. The most celebrated of these was that known as the porcelain tower at
                    Nanking. It had nine stories, and was about 200 feet high, exclusive of the iron
                    spire. At each angle was a bell, making seventy-two in all; and there were eight
                    chains hanging from the top of the finial to the angles of the spire, and
                    carrying nine bells each, or seventy-two more. This celebrated building was
                    destroyed by the Taepings in 1853. The <hi rend="italic">taa</hi> is not a
                    pagoda or temple, but a memorial of some event or of some great personage. At
                    Peking is one used as an observatory, and at Nanganfoo one was erected simply to
                    bring good luck.</p>
                <p>Buildings called <hi rend="italic">Toov Tang,</hi> or halls of ancestors, are
                    found in all considerable towns. These much resemble temples, but instead of
                    idols, memorial tablets are placed in the niches to record the transactions and
                    deeds of the “worthies” or celebrated inhabitants of the neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pai Loo,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pai Fang,</hi> is
                    another common object in China. These are monumental memorials, though they have
                    been mistaken for triumphal arches. Quatremère says, the Chinese annals reckon
                    3636 of these, erected in honour of literary men, philosophers, princes,
                    generals, &amp;c. The smaller are of wood, forming a sort of doorway. The larger
                    have three openings side by side, and over these are several broad panelled
                    fascias for inscriptions and carving, which is often very bold and in high
                    relief, and over all is a projecting cornice carrying a tiled roof. Chambers has
                    given one, the side gateways of which have semicircular arches, with festoons of
                    drapery. The resemblance of these to the famous Sanchi tope is evident, as is
                    also their being adaptations from wooden originals, for the stones are put
                    together with mortices and other joints just as a wooden framework would be. The
                    Chinese gateways are, however, very poor in comparison with those of India.</p>
                <p>There is not much variety of design about the houses of the Chinese, as every one
                    must be on a scale corresponding to the rank of the inhabitant. Le Comte
                    mentions a case where a mandarin was obliged to pull down one that he had
                    constructed of a somewhat better quality than those of the others. Chambers has
                    given a plan of a house which he says is of very common design. It is about 260
                    feet from front to back, and about 65 feet wide. It is entered at the front by a
                    passage nearly 20 feet wide, which goes nearly through the entire building. On
                    each side of this, fronting the street, is a shop, with its back shop. It should
                    be stated, that the divisions on the two sides of the central passage exactly
                    correspond with each other. First we have two studies and two small bedrooms;
                    then two saloons or reception rooms, about 24 feet by 18, looking into open
                    courts or gardens, with fish ponds, fountains, flowers, &amp;c., divided by
                    walls; then two more saloons with bedrooms, and then the great dining-hall,
                    which runs right across the house. This is about 60 feet by 30, and is carried
                    on eight columns. Behind this is the kitchen and other offices. The first floor
                    has two bedrooms, one on each side of a passage, for the shop-keeper; then on
                    each side is a saloon and the bedrooms for the family. Between these last, and
                    also carried on columns, is the hall where the family idol is worshipped. This
                    overlooks the open gardens before mentioned. At the further end of these courts
                    are two more saloons and bedrooms, and then a hall, said to be devoted to the
                    use of strangers or visitors, which is over the ground floor dining-hall, and of
                    the same size. Chambers tells us every house has a number of movable partitions
                    kept ready, to be put up to subdivide the larger rooms.</p>
                <p>The tombs are as singular as the rest of the Chinese edifices. The grandest of
                    them, viz., those of the Ming dynasty, which ended in 1628, have been well
                    described by Mr Simpson in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. £. A.,</hi> 1873-4. One of these tombs
                    is at Nanking, but the chief are about 40 miles north of Peking. The entry is by
                    a grand Pai Loo of five gateways in white marble, and then through several other
                    gateways to a singular dromos, nearly a mile long, of 32 colossal figures
                    (ranged in pairs), some human, others of camels, griffins, elephants, &amp;c.
                    Such a dromos exists also at Shanghai. The tombs, thirteen in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n507/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0507-0450"/> number, are ranged round the base of a hill and
                    extend for eeveral miles. Each consists of an earthen mound about half a mile in
                    circuit, having, at its base, a crenellated retaining wall 20 feet high. The
                    mound has no entrance, nor any indication of the exact place of burial. To the
                    south of the tomb is a temple in an open court, about 1200 feet by 500. The plan
                    is just the ordinary one of a palace, and the names, “The House of the living
                    and the House of the dead,” seem to show clearly that this resemblance was
                    intended.</p>
                <p>The Chinese method of construction is very peculiar. Their roofs are put up
                    first, supported on wooden posts, which are removed as the permanent fabric is
                    built. The walls of the grand edifices are of stone, but the ordinary material
                    is brick, and the work is often executed with beautifully close joints. In
                    palaces and temples the whole was often gorgeously coloured with glazed tiles,
                    or the bricks themselves were coloured and glazed. A magnificent example of this
                    is a temple near the summer palace at Peking, all of which is of bright
                    majolica, except its marble base. As with all structures belonging to the
                    emperor the colour was yellow, it being a capital offence for any other person
                    to use that colour.</p>
                <p>The Chinese never use square timber when they can get round trees of a suitable
                    size, probably on account of the lightness, strength, and convenience of the
                    bamboo. The roofs are of very peculiar construction, and all timbers are left
                    visible. The windows are filled in with the lining of the oyster shell, which
                    looks like talc, and is quite as transparent; and the main door is frequently a
                    perfectly round aperture. The old buildings of the Chinese, like those of the
                    Saracens, are fast going to decay, and the streets of even their grand capital,
                    Peking, now exhibit immense ranges of ruined buildings.</p>

                <p>It was not long before the exhumation by Mr Layard, in Central Asia, of the
                    wonderful remains of fine art entombed in earthen mounds, that Mr J. L.
                    Stephens, when engaged on a mission from his Government—that of the United
                    States of North America—to some of the mutable states of Central America, heard
                    of and tracked out in the forests of Yucatan <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the
                    remains of a bygone time, exhibited in sculptural and architectural monuments of

                <p>Layard describes as having existed in and about the valleys of the Tigris and
                    Euphrates. The remains of fifty or sixty cities have been discovered, the most
                    interesting being those of Chololu, Palenque, Uxmal, Tescuco, and Mitla. The
                    chief structures were evidently temples <hi rend="italic">(fTeocalHs),</hi>
                    raised high above the surrounding buildings on grand basements, square on plan,
                    and rising by huge steps to the summit, so as to have the general outline of a
                    low truncated pyramid. One at Palenque is 280 feet square at the base, and about
                    60 feet high to the platform, on which stands the temple, the latter being
                    oblong on plan, measuring about 7 6 feet by 25. It was a low building, with a
                    roof formed by stone gradini, so as to be, in fact, a continuation of the
                    pyramid. Other structures, supposed to be palaces, are described by Mr Stephens,
                    Mr Catherwood, Lord Kingsborough, &amp;c., and copiously illustrated in their
                    works. Many of them are very extensive, but of no great elevation. They are
                    chiefly built on massive stone basements and surmounted by cornices, the friezes
                    of which are adorned with evident imitations of logs of wood in upright rows.
                    The greater part of the roofs were of wood, but among the objects represented in
                    Mr Catherwood’s <hi rend="italic">Views of Ancient Monuments in Central America,
                    Chiapas, and Yucatan,</hi> are several examples of vaults having the arch form,
                    but not being arched vaults,—that is to say, of vaults presenting the appearance
                    internally, or upon the soffit, of arches, but formed by the gathering over of
                    horizontally-coursed masonry, with the inner and lower angles worked away— or
                    cleaned off, as it is technically expressed—to the appearance on the inside
                    which an arched vault would present.</p>
                <p>(See fig. 59.) The circumstance tħat the arch form presented in the American
                    monuments is produced by the gathering over of horizontally-ranged masonry, and
                    not by means of arch structure, would seem to show clearly that if the builders
                    ever had intercourse with the Old World, it was before the properties of the
                    arch were known and exemplified in it. These remains show an advance on the <hi

                    representations of monuments which would almost appear to be the same as some of
                    those subsequently explored by Mr Stephens.</p>

                <p>Mr Catherwood states that he and Mr Stephens concur in the opinion expressed by
                    Mr Prescott, in his <hi rend="italic">History of the Conquest of Mexico, —</hi>
                    “that though the coincidences are sufficiently strong to authorise a belief that
                    the civilisation of Anahuac (Ancient</p>
                <p>Mexico) was in some degree influenced by Eastern Asia, yet the discrepancies are
                    so great as to carry back the communication to a very remote period, so remote
                    that this foreign influence has been too feeble to interfere materially with the
                    growth of what may be regarded, in its essential features, as a peculiar and
                    indigenous civilisation;” and this opinion the monuments, as presented by Mr
                    Catherwood, would seem fully to justify. But Mr Catherwood adds to this, as the
                    ground, it would appear, for coinciding with Mr Prescott’s opinion, that the
                    results arrived at by Mr Stephens and himself “are briefly, that they (the
                    American monuments) are not of immemorial antiquity, the work of unknown men;
                    but that, as we now see them, they were occupied and probably erected by the
                    Indian tribes in possession of the country at the time of the Spanish conquest,
                    that they are the production of an indigenous school of art, adapted to the
                    natural circumstances of the country, and to the civil and religious polity then
                    prevailing; and that they present but very slight and accidental analogies with
                    the works of any people or country in the Old World.”</p>
                <p>Less artistic, but more vast and massive, are the structures in Peru, which have
                    been as yet imperfectly explored.</p>
                <p>Referred by Mr Prescott to the reigns of the Incas, they are now considered to
                    have been the works of a far earlier race, of whom the Incas were the
                    conquerors. The rudest of these early works are sepulchral, and much of the same
                    kind as the cromlechs and stone-circles already referred to (p. 383). One circle
                    at Sillustani is 90 feet diameter, another 150 feet, and they have a massive
                    paved platform all round them outside, which is not found in similar remains in
                    the Old World. The cromlechs are not covered <pb break="no"

                    by overlapping stones.</p>
                <p>A much more artistic class of tombs is built of stones in the form of a tower,
                    but <hi rend="italic">increasing</hi> in width towards the top, and domed as
                    above described. Most of them are round on plan, but some are square and two
                    stories high, the upper being covered with overlapping stones cut to the arch
                    shape. Many of these are of hard stone, beautifully fitted together, and the
                    chambers are lined with a peculiar stucco still in good preservation.</p>
                <p>Some other sepulchral remains are on a much grander scale, being immense mounds
                    held up by huge retaining walls. One of these mounds is 108 feet high, and 276
                    yards by 75 at the top. None seem to have been as yet explored. Of the
                    fortresses one of the grandest examples is at Cuzco, 760 feet above the level of
                    that city. It has three lines of fortifications in terraces 1800 feet long, the
                    lower terrace havin" a retaining wall now 25 feet high, the second</p>
                <p>(30 feet behind the first) 18 feet, and the third (18 feet behind the second) 14
                    feet high. The walls are of cyclopean masonry, accurately fitted, one stone
                    being 27 feet by 14</p>
                <p>by 12, and many are 15 by 12 by 10 feet. The plan shows considerable skill, as
                    the walls are not straight, but built with recesses and re-entering angles,
                    evidently for giving the garrison command of the ground close to the walls. The
                    most interesting remains in Peru are those called <hi rend="italic">Huacas;</hi>
                    but whether they were forts, or palaces, or tombs, is not as yet clearly
                    ascertained. They are described as being enclosed by walls (in various examples
                    100 to 180 yards long, and 60 or 70 yards broad), and divided by cross walls,
                    thus forming enclosures or chambers, many of which are still lined with stucco.
                    In some of these are considerable remains of staircases, but the upper parts are
                    destroyed. The chambers and enclosures are almost invariably filled with clay,
                    which presents great difficulties in their examination. This filling in may,
                    possibly, be accounted for by the construction of the walls, which are immensely
                    thick (some at Chanchan are 15 feet), and usually of sun-dried bricks, either

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Present Position of Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>We have, in conclusion, a few remarks to make upon the present position of
                    architecture. The increase of commerce and of wealth in the United Kingdom of
                    late years, has thrown into the hands of the architect and engineer a vast
                    amount of work, both for public and private edifices. Not only has there been an
                    increase in the number of buildings, but the old parts of very many towns are
                    being rebuilt on a larger and grander scale, and new, wide streets are being
                    formed through their busiest and most densely peopled quarters. In London, in
                    the great manufacturing towns of the north, in the universities, in the seaport
                    towns, north and south, and in the pleasure-seeking cities on the sea-board on
                    every coast, this process is going on at a rapid rate; and we look with interest
                    and anxiety as to what are replacing the old buildings (many of them landmarks
                    in our art) which have been destroyed, or what is to range beside those which
                    are left. And besides these reconstructions, there are rising up, in every part
                    of the country, railway stations, colossal hotels, baths and washhouses, working
                    men’s dwellings, and such other edifices as the Crystal and Alexandra Palaces,
                    of a kind entirely unknown to the past generation. In addition to these we have
                    the altogether new towns of Swindon, Wolverton, Crewe, Fleetwood,
                    Barrow-in-Furness, Middlesborough, &amp;c. These last afford, perhaps, the least
                    encouraging view of modern work as contrasted with the old. Our old towns were
                    usually picturesquely placed on the margin of a river for trade, or on a hill
                    for defence; gradually increased round some nucleus of importance—a church or
                    monastery or castle; and comprised the mansions of the rich as well as the shops
                    of the trader and dwellings of the poor. But the modern town is all built at
                    once, on some sudden call, on a site selected, perhaps, simply from its being at
                    the junction of two railways. It shows only long straight streets of small
                    dwellings for artisans, unbroken, except, perhaps, by a church, or an
                    assembly-room, or more forcibly by the long, unpicturesque lines of railway
                    sheds. Neither the architect nor the engineer has had much to do with this, and
                    the result is about as wretchedly uninteresting a series of streets as it is
                    possible to conceive. Horace Walpole’s satirical description of London, “a
                    gigantic mass of littleness,” would apply well to them.</p>
                <p>It has been better with the extension of the old towns. At first this gave us
                    such long, bald lines of streets as Bath shows in stone, and Baker Street,
                    &amp;c., in London, in brick. These léd by a natural result to a more ornate
                    class, and we had the Regent’s Park, and Regent Street, London, wherein a number
                    of houses are grouped together into one <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n510/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0510-0453"/> mass, abounding with Roman columns and cornices,
                    and receiving something of the massive appearance and lightness of stone from
                    being covered with stucco, just as most of Palladio’s buildings in Italy were.
                    But whilst they were far better in general effect than the class which preceded
                    them, the columns and their long unbroken lines of cornices often sadly
                    interfered with the requirements of the dwellings, and in the new streets and
                    terraces of our towns we see but few imitations of Roman porticoes and
                    pediments, and the speculating builder mostly limits himself to putting a
                    portico to the door, a few mouldings (in stucco) to the windows, and a slight
                    cornice as a finish to the tops.</p>
                <p>On the Continent the usual style of living—in flats —enables the builders to
                    produce, with the same number of rooms, a more massive external effect than with
                    us. One large entrance doorway suffices for the whole, and thus four or five
                    separate houses (as they are in reality) have the effect of one large mansion.
                    Still more is this the case when a courtyard, requiring a carriage entrance,
                    occupies the centre of the building.</p>
                <p>Of a far higher class than the private dwellings are many of the places of
                    business recently erected in our great towns. In the new banks, exchanges,
                    insurance offices, &lt;fcc., many of our most noted architects have produced
                    good results; and if we cannot congratulate ourselves upon much that is being
                    done, we can, at least, say that the new work is an improvement upon the old. In
                    no instance, perhaps, is the advance more to be noted than in the clubhouses and
                    the great warehouses for storing the lighter class of goods. A façade having
                    long lines of windows, in many stories, each story of considerable height, and
                    with only one main entrance doorway, affords the materials, of course, for
                    forming a massive and pleasing effect much as that of the Continental houses
                    above described. And the opportunity has certainly not been lost. Our plan, too,
                    of letting each owner build to a considerable extent according to his own
                    design, results in a more picturesque arrangement of our streets than those of a
                    Continental town, which usually present lines of uninteresting houses, all of
                    much the same design.</p>
                <p>As a still further mark of progress we must mention the town-halls and other
                    civic structures at Bradford, Halifax, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Plymouth,
                    Preston, &amp;c., and the local museums and picture galleries, as at Cambridge,
                    Edinburgh, Exeter, Leeds, Liverpool, Oxford. Salisbury, &amp;c. Not only do
                    these great civic buildings give importance by their magnitude to the towns, but
                    they lead to other works in rivalry or imitation, just as a mediaeval building
                    of note did in olden times, and the goodness of their design is therefore a
                    matter of prime importance. The museums are gradually helping to fill up a void
                    most painfully felt by every stranger in our towns, and will help to preserve
                    many local pieces of antiquity which would otherwise have been lost.</p>
                <p>Of a higher class still are the colleges at Edinburgh, Glasgow, London,
                    Manchester (Owens), &amp;c., and many of the additions to those of the old
                    universities. In these colleges the number of rooms of varying size, the
                    entrance tower, and the internal quadrangles, allow of picturesque effects, but
                    seldom present any one very grand mass. This has, however, been produced at
                    University College, London, by the central portico (probably the finest in
                    England), which rises high above the rest of the edifice.</p>
                <p>In the civic buildings a bolder effect can be produced by their actual
                    requirements, viz., a grand hall of large area and height, with spacious
                    corridors and staircases, and a high clock tower, which seems to furnish the
                    natural complement to such structures. If we have not rivalled Ypres or Louvain,
                    we have at least improved on the wretched civic buildings of the last
                    century.</p>
                <p>Larger and grander than any of the above works are the Houses of Parhament in
                    London. However much of the detail may be open to criticism, it must be readily
                    acknowledged that the architect had in his mind, and steadily carried out, the
                    idea of combining the whole into one grand mass, in place of leaving it as a
                    mere series of fronts, as in the Bank of England or Somerset House; and the
                    variously designed steeples and towers culminating in the one grand tower at the
                    royal entrance form the whole into one of the grandest buildings of the age.</p>
                <p>Of a class unknown to the last generation are the railway stations, some of the
                    largest edifices of the time, but usually almost hidden by another new class of
                    buildings, viz., the colossal hotels. The stations themselves are in the main
                    mere great vaults of glass on iron ribs, whose curved outlines are disfigured by
                    the iron ties which the safety of a great extent of such roofing requires, and
                    thus the only beauty, viz., the cur ved form, is to a large extent obscured. It
                    is a fortunate circumstance that this form is the best adapted to the purpose,
                    and when, as in many notable instances, the skill or good taste of the engineer
                    has allowed of the ties being dispensed with, the vast size and lightness of the
                    vault have a very impressive look. The hotels, which in most cases form the
                    frontage of the stations in our country, are, for the most part, worthy of the
                    striking positions which they occupy; but they are chiefly by living architects,
                    and so beyond the scope of our criticism. No one, however, can study the way in
                    which most of them are attached to the station buildings which they front
                    without wishing most heartily that the engineer of the one and the architect of
                    the other had worked somewhat more in harmony with each other.</p>
                <p>Of an entirely novel design and construction was the Crystal Palace, admirably
                    adapted, no doubt, for the purpose for which Paxton designed it, or for any
                    other purpose for which a flood of light without impediment is required. But the
                    manner in which the second, at Sydenham, has been altered is instructive. Where
                    a grand orchestra was required the top was covered as a great sounding board,
                    and when pictures or art works were to be exhibited the sides were closed,—the
                    result showing plainly that the top lights are of the chief value, the side ones
                    being little required except for the prospect through; and even for picture
                    galleries a much smaller amount of light is required than in the Crystal Palace
                    roof. Its curved form is, however, very pleasing, and the brilliancy of the
                    light glass roof will ensure its being adopted in many buildings where a vivid
                    light is required.</p>
                <p>We have now passed hurriedly in review most of the forms of modern architecture,
                    and we need scarcely add that it is developed in every conceivable style. If a
                    church is to be built we may, indeed, pretty safely predict that it will be in
                    one of the many pointed styles, but even then it may be English, French, or
                    Italian. But of any other kind of edifice no one could safely predict the style.
                    Probably it might be safe to assert that a theatre would not have (as Covent
                    Garden in London had) a Grecian Doric portico, or an Egyptian pylon be made to
                    do duty (as in Piccadilly, London) for a couple of shops. One might also be
                    tolerably sure that a monument to a distinguished person would not be a granite
                    column -with a staircase up the middle, and a statue almost out of sight, with a
                    lightning conductor through the head at top, as at the duke of York’s column,
                    London. But short of this, almost any prediction as to the style might come
                    true; and as nearly every building of note throughout the world is brought to
                    the eyes of tho public by means of engravings or photographs, there seems little
                    chance of its being otherwise.</p>
                <p>In the United States the architects of the public buildings<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n511/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0511-0454"/> appear to be of much the same feeling as were
                    English architects some years ago. The churches are often Gothic, but the other
                    great edifices are in the main Italian, such as the capitols of Ohio, New York
                    (Albany), and Washington. The last is a building of great size and picturesque
                    outline, depending for its chief effect on the lavish use of porticoes and
                    colonnades.</p>
                <p>In Canada very much the same state of things exists as in the United States, the
                    art in each being much the reflex of that in the old country.</p>
                <p>The adoption of Greek, Roman, or Italian architectural details, little modified
                    by climate and customs, is, in fact, to be noted in almost every country—any
                    form of art peculiarly national being now abandoned in their favour; and if the
                    houses in Paris were to be transported to Berlin or Cairo, they would simply
                    agree with what has already been done in those cities. And if, further, the
                    Bourse or the Pantheon at Paris, the Museum at Berlin, the Glyptothek at Munich,
                    or the great church of St Isaac at St Petersburg, were to be severally changed
                    to any of the other cities, it would be fairly in harmony with the modern works
                    around it. though the nationality and language of the peoples in those cities
                    are utterly distinct from each other. This abandonment of natural and peculiar
                    styles is now producing another result quite foreign to anything known in art
                    history before. From the earliest period known until the 17th century almost
                    every nation had its own peculiar forms of art, and practised it (modified,
                    perhaps, by the conditions of climate) in every part of the world which it
                    colonised or conquered; and the result was the interesting remains of Roman art,
                    clearly to be identified as such in Europe, Asia, and Africa; of Norman in
                    France, England, Italy, and Sicily; and of Saracenic from Spain to India. This
                    clear identification of a nation by its art works is as valuable to the
                    historian as to the artist. But we can look for this no longer. We ourselves
                    build Greek, Roman, or Italian palaces in our great towns of India, whilst close
                    by, perhaps, is a church or cathedral in our English style of Gothic, and a
                    college in the style of the Saracens, who themselves, centuries back, brought it
                    with them as the art of foreign conquerors from Egypt or Persia. And the French
                    in Algiers, to celebrate the triumph of their religion, erect a splendid church

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">On the Application of Colour to Architecture.</hi></p>
                <p>On none of the subsidiary arts connected with architecture has there been in
                    modern practice so little agreement with all ancient rules or customs as on
                    this. It is only of late years that any one has conceded that the duty of
                    architects is to give the best possible combination of form and colour, and that
                    the completest form of architecture is that which affords examples of'such a
                    combination.</p>
                <p>For the last three centuries architects have shown almost a contempt for colour,
                    to such a degree, indeed, that the world till lately was taught to believe that
                    purity of style and absence of colour always went together; and that it was only
                    a vulgar and uneducated eye which saw the greatest evidence of good and matured
                    taste in the harmonious application of colour and form. Our sculptors encouraged
                    this feeling by their dislike to the application of colour to their work, even
                    when it was purely architectural. Both architects and sculptors found it
                    convenient, apparently, to disencumber themselves of one-half of the
                    responsibilities of their calling, and escaped all obligation of studying the
                    laws of colour, or of entering on the large field of its application to
                    architecture; whilst our painters, partly because they lacked the opportunity,
                    partly, it is true, because their art had ceased to be exercised for the public
                    benefit in the old sense, had ceased to regard wall-painting as their legitimate
                    work, and had so completely sunk into the habit of treating only small subjects
                    in a small way, that it will take an age to develop in them the power of dealing
                    properly with those large wall spaces which present them with the grandest
                    opportunity of achieving real distinction. It is abundantly clear that those who
                    argue against the application of colour to architecture, do so without the
                    weight which the authority of their ancestors would have given them. Of late
                    years much attention has been devoted to this point; there has been considerable
                    discussion, and in the end, though there has been much difference of opinion as
                    to the <hi rend="italic">extent</hi> to which colour was applied by the Greeks
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n512/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0512-0455"/> and Romans, there has been none as to the fact
                    that, at any rate, some introduction of colour was well-nigh invariable in their
                    work. Mr Owen Jones’s <hi rend="italic">Apology for the Colouring of the Greek
                    Court</hi> at the Crystal Palace contains, in a small compass, quite sufficient
                    evidence to show how strong is the ground of those who maintain the necessity of
                    colour in classic buildings; and equally valuable is the report, drawn up by the
                    Committee of the Institute of British architects, on the colouring of the Elgin
                    marbles, with Professor Faraday’s analyses of portions of the coatings of
                    marbles brought from several ancient buildings in Athens, upon all of which he
                    makes it perfectly clear that colour was extensively and generally applied.
                    Professor Semper of Berlin, in treating of the origin of architectural
                    polychromy, proves that the Syrians, Persians, Egyptians, Chinese, Indians,
                    Jews, Phoenicians, and Greeks all used colour in their architecture and
                    sculpture; and we may safely conclude, therefore, that there is no country which
                    has been in any way remarkable f r its architectural monuments in which the
                    necessity of the om-bination has been ignored or forgotten. This statement is
                    sufficient on the subject so far as it affects all ancient schools of art.</p>
                <p>If we turn to later times we shall discover in all the schools of mediaeval
                    artists a still greater and more pronounced adhesion to the same principle. It
                    seems, indeed, almost superfluous to say that there are most abundant evidences
                    of the fact that the architects of the Middle Ages were seldom satisfied until
                    they had covered their walls with colour; in one place with that in which nature
                    has been so lavish in marble and precious stones; in another with the artificial
                    tints of tiles and bricks; in another with the bright stencilling of gay diapers
                    over entire walls; or, lastly, in the teaching of Scripture story, or legend or
                    history, by the aid of the greatest painters of the day.</p>
                <p>If we look for an instant to Italy we shall see what a lesson these artists have
                    left us there. There is, for instance, the Arena chapel at Padua, designed by
                    Giotto, and then painted by him with his own hands in such fashion that, to the
                    present day, this simple little room—some 20 feet by 40 in its dimensions—is one
                    of the greatest pilgrimage places in Europe for all lovers of Christian art; and
                    again, in that far grander work—the noble church so finely stationed on the
                    steep slopes of the Apennines at Assisi— we see how Cimabue, Simone Memmi,
                    Giotto, and many others, helped to cover with pictures, conceived in a really
                    divine spirit, the walls which would otherwise, no doubt, have been resplendent
                    with the less artistic, but still most effective labours of the patient
                    stenciller. The Same lesson is taught if we look at the Campo Santo of Pisa, and
                    see how Andrea Orcagna, that great architect, painter, sculptor, and poet, and
                    beside him a succession of artists, among whom we count Buffalmacco, Simone
                    Memmi, Giotto, and Benozzo Gozzoli, helped each in their turn in this
                    illumination of architecture; or at the church and refectory of Sta Croce, and
                    the church and chapter-house of Sta Maria Novella, and the crypt of San Miniato,
                    Florence; or at that masterpiece of decorative art—St Mark’s at Venice— where
                    precious marbles and mosaics rich in gold and bright colour almost dazzle the
                    eye with their magnificence, but combine to make an interior in which none can
                    fail to admit that the effect of the mere architecture of the building has been
                    extraordinarily enhanced.</p>
                <p>Nor was such practice as this peculiar to mediaeval artists; for the earlier
                    Renaissance men had the same feeling in some degree, and Benozzo Gozzoli has
                    shown us in his exquisite paintings in the chapel of the Riccardi Palace at
                    Florence, and Perugino and Raffaelle in the Stanze of the Vatican, how their
                    work might be best adorned.</p>
                <p>But it was not only in Italy—the land <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of
                    colour—that men had a true appreciation of its value. It need hardly be told how
                    St Louis, in the palmiest days of the French kingdom, covered the w <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> alls of the Sainte Chapelle of Paris with gold and
                    colour and mosaic, and filled its windows with stained glass of the richest
                    hues, so that to the present day it is an example of the most gorgeous colouring
                    it is possible to conceive; or how, in England, when our monarchs wished to
                    rival the zeal and enthusiasm of St Louis, they gave, in St Stephen’s Chapel at
                    Westminster, an example equally sumptuous and rich in colour; whilst at the same
                    time, not only in our cathedrals, but in almost every parish church throughout
                    our country, traces of more or less colouring are found to have existed over
                    nearly the whole surface of the walls. Taking for granted, therefore, that every
                    one will allow that it was, at any rate, the intention of all architects, as far
                    as possible, to combine colour with form, it remains to be seen how this was
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>There were two great and distinct orders of architectural colourists, the
                    constructional and the decorative. The first were those who built their walls
                    partially or altogether with coloured materials; the second those who so built
                    them that colour might afterwards be added, and with an especial view to its
                    introduction. It is of the works of the former of these two classes that it is
                    right to speak first, because the way in which they did their work was, on the
                    whole, a more thoroughly enduring and proper way than that of the other school.
                    It was also more definitely the work of architects.</p>
                <p>The works of the constructional school of architectural colourists must be
                    subdivided into two classes :—1st, Those in which the coloured materials were
                    part of the substance of the walls, and necessary for the stability of the whole
                    fabric; and 2dly, Those in which the walls were covered with decoration, such as
                    mosaic, or tiles, or thin veneers of marble, which had nothing whatever to do
                    with their structural requirements.</p>
                <p>The first class was that which was, on the whole, both the best and the most
                    frequently adopted. The few examples which we see in this country, and, indeed,
                    generally throughout the north of Europe, belong to it. The poverty of England
                    in coloured stones or marbles will account sufficiently for the comparative
                    rarity of the examples we can adduce. Among them are many of the
                    Northamptonshire churches,—as Irchester, Strixton, and St Peter’s,
                    Northampton,—which are built with horizontal bands or courses of dark red and
                    light stones used alternately; in other districts we find courses of stones and
                    flint alternated, as in the church at Penton Mewsey, near Andover, and in a
                    gateway at Rochester. In others flint and stone are used, but with inferior
                    effect, in a regular chequerwork over the whole surface of the wall. In the
                    church standing close to the north side of Rochester Cathedral, a course of
                    chequer-work in flint and stone is introduced under one string-course, and two
                    courses of flint separated by one of stone under another. The churches of Essex,
                    Suffolk, and Norfolk abound in examples of tracery, and other devices formed by
                    cutting out patterns in the stone, and filling them in with carefully-cut and
                    faced flints of very dark colour, so as to produce a very elaborate system of
                    decoration in two tints. In the cloisters of Westminster Abbey the groining is
                    executed in chalk, with occasional lines of dark stone at regular intervals. Our
                    red brick buildings are constantly diapered with patterns in black. The
                    interiors of our churches, when not painted, were usually left with the natural
                    colour of all the stone work—whether wrought or not—visible on the interior, an
                    arrangement which, though rough and rugged in character, ccrtainly gives a great
                    amount of natural colour in a low <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n513/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0513-0456"/> key, but infinitely more agreeable to the eye
                    than the cold expanse of plaster generally visible in new public buildings.
                    Finally, throughout the 13th century the use of polished marble columns, of a
                    colour much darker than that of the materials of the wall, is one of the most
                    marked features in all the best English work, and cannot properly be omitted in
                    any catalogue of modes of coloured construction. Every one of these arrangements
                    is noticeable as having been introduced intentionally, and with a sole view to
                    variety of colour. In France examples are much more numerous than in England,
                    and the very interesting church at Vézelay is an early instance of the
                    alternated use of dark and light stones in the interior as well as the exterior.
                    Sta Maria in Capitolio, at Cologne, has some good remains of the same kind; and
                    St Anne’s Kloster, at Lübeck, is built with alternate courses of red brick and
                    stone. It is in Italy, however, that we find the most plentiful store of
                    examples of this kind of work, of which a few may be mentioned. The cathedral,
                    baptistery, and the buildings generally in Pisa and Lucca are built, both inside
                    and out, with white stone courses, with thin courses of black marble occurring
                    at about every fourth course. This is a very delicate and effective mode of
                    dividing the wall space. The baptistery and campanile of the cathedral at
                    Pistoia, and the campanile of Siena, are built in almost equal courses of black
                    and white. In Genoa we find the same equal division of the courses in the
                    façades of the c⅜thedral, and of the churches of San Matteo and San Stefano. At
                    Bergamo the porch of Sta Maria Maggiore is executed in red, white, and grey
                    marble. It is of three divisions in height, the highest stage being entirely of
                    grey marble; the middle stage has all the moulded parts of red, and the arches
                    and their spandrils of grey marble; the space at the back of the porch and over
                    its main arch are built in equal courses of red and white marble; the groining
                    is in black, red, and white marble, fitted to diamond-shaped panels, and all the
                    shafts are of red marble. The whole design depends for effect almost entirely
                    upon the arrangement and counter-changing of the three primary colours, the
                    white becoming by age sufficiently yellow to take its place very well as one of
                    them. Similar to this in the colours of its marbles is the 13th century front of
                    the Broletto or town-hall at Como; but here the courses are very irregular in
                    their height, and not arranged upon any symmetrical rule. The campanile of the
                    cathedral at Florence is the last example of this class that need be mentioned,
                    and it is the very finest of all; here the component colours are red marble of
                    Perugia, green serpentine, and white marble (the two latter have the effect at a
                    slight distance of being black and yellow), but these colours are further varied
                    by the introduction of very elaborate patterns inlaid in delicate marble mosaic
                    on almost every available space, whilst glass mosaic is introduced behind
                    sculpture in the stages near the ground, in order to make the figures as
                    distinct as possible. It is important to observe that, in this unsurpassed work,
                    Giotto showed not only his sense of the value of colour, but equally his feeling
                    for true architectural proportion. No building was ever more carefully designed
                    in this way; and the result is so great a success in outline, in detail, and in
                    colour, as to make it one of the most worthy of study of any work in Europe.
                    Here it may be observed, that in the doorways of St Mark’s, Venice, we have
                    examples of exquisite beauty, of sculpture of foliage and figures in marble set
                    off by a ground filled in entirely with mosaic, similar in idea to the way in
                    which figures are set upon a mosaic ground in Giotto’s work at Florence.</p>
                <p>In the great church of San Petronio at Bologna, the flat space between the two
                    stone moulded plinths is of red marble, and above the plinths the wai 's are all
                    of red brick. This coloured plinth is very fine in its effect, and dignifies the
                    whole building. The upper part of the Ducal Palace and the house called the Ca’
                    d’Oro, at Venice, are examples of a coloured chequer-work over the whole surface
                    of the wall. In the Ducal Palace this is aιτanged so as to form a regular diaper
                    divided by lines of white and grey marble. The monument of Can Signorio, one of
                    the Scaliger family, in the churchyard of Sta Maria ΓAntica at Verona, is a good
                    example of the successful application of coloured materials to works of delicate
                    detail. It is a lofty erection, composed of a great canopied monument in the
                    centre, with a number of smaller canopied niches rising out of it, or standing
                    upon shafts around it. The base is all of red marble, the niches have red marble
                    columns, white gables, and red pyramids above them. The central mass is mainly
                    of a yellowish tint, with white marble niches and pinnacles of red marble, and,
                    owing to the extent to which the colours are counterchanged, the effect is very
                    good. The west doorway of Sta Anastasia, and the north doorway of San Fermo
                    Maggiore, both at Verona, are beautiful examples of the simple alternation of
                    white, red, and grey marbles in the jamb and arches; and in both these cases the
                    extreme beauty of the effect appears to be owing to the delicacy and harmony of
                    the tints of the marble employed, and to the absence of the very violent
                    contrasts of colour which are sometimes seen.</p>
                <p>There are other examples of buildings decorated with inlaid ornaments which
                    belong to this class; such are some of the French churches, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> those throughout the Puy de Dome, of which we may
                    select as a typical example Nôtre Dame-du-Port, Clermont Ferrand. Here the lower
                    part of the walls is of uniform colour, the windows have alternate voussoirs of
                    light and dark stone, and the wall above them is entirely covered with a mosaic
                    diaper; the walls are crowned by a heavy cornice supported on corbels, between
                    each of which the space is filled in with a star in mosaic. Similar examples
                    occur at S. Etienne, Nevers, in Poitou, on the banks of the Loire, and
                    frequently in volcanic districts where dark and light materials, tufa and
                    scoriae, abound, and suggest the treatment which has been adopted. Some of the
                    churches at Pisa are very beautifully and delicately enriched with inlaying. The
                    little church of San Matteo has round all its arches inlaid chevrons, diamonds,
                    or triangles, and a line of inlaying under the moulded eaves cornice of the
                    aisle. The front of San Michele, also in Pisa, is covered with inlaid patterns
                    filling in the spandrils, or following all the architectural lines of the
                    arcading with which the whole upper portion is covered; similar inlaid patterns
                    are to be seen between corbels under the tympanum of the south door of San
                    Paolo, Pistoia. An inlaid pattern is carried along under the string-course below
                    the aisle windows of the Cathedral of Lucca, and here, as in the other examples
                    which have been given, the inlaid material is dark, on the white ground of the
                    stone wall, and the object of its introduction was, no doubt, to give as much
                    emphasis as possible to important features. In the case of the windows at Lucca
                    the label is of dark marble, whilst the rest of the head of the window is white.
                    In the church of San Domenico, Perugia, a window arch is built of grey stone,
                    with occasional voussoirs of red, and on these, in order to make them as
                    conspicuous as possible, small rosettes are carved. Another window in the same
                    church has alternate voussoirs of red and white stone, and a red shaft for a
                    monial. In the Palazzo Publico of Perugia the cornices and strings have ranges
                    of corbels, the spaces between which are filled in with red marble to make the
                    shadow deeper and more effective; in the windows, the shafts are of red marble;
                    and in the doorway the tympanum is of red marble, with figures in white in front
                    of it. The west front of Lucca Cathedral is inlaid in the most <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0514-0457"/> elaborate manner, the upper part with
                    illustrations of field sports, and the lower part with geometrical patterns.
                    Here, too, and in Giotto’s campanile at Florence, the shafts themselves are
                    inlaid in the same way as the rest of the work.</p>
                <p>In the arcades outside the walls of San Fermo Maggiore, and in the windows of the
                    little church opposite the cathedral, at Verona, great effect is produced by the
                    ingenious combination of brick and stone; and throughout the north of Italy
                    examples of this sort of arrangement of colour occur, and there is none more
                    easy of imitation or reproduction with good effect at the present day and in our
                    own country. In Sant’ Antonio, at Padua, an arcade of brick and stone in the
                    west front has all its spandrils filled in with red marble; and the case of the
                    east end of the church at Murano will be remembered by all who have read Mr
                    Ruskin’s <hi rend="italic">Stones of Venice.</hi> Here the substance of the
                    walls is red brick for a few feet from the ground, and above that a rather
                    coarse yellow brick; red brick is used in place of labels, &lt;fcc., to define
                    the arches; the shafts are of various marbles; and courses of marble, cut in
                    triangles and alternately coloured and carved, are also introduced. The examples
                    here given are enough to show, at any rate, the general prevalence of a love of
                    colour in the Middle Ages throughout Europe.</p>
                <p>It would be somewhat beyond the scope of the examination of such a subject from
                    its architectural side to go at any length into the mode of decorative painting,
                    which was almost universally adopted at the same time. In this application of
                    colour all countries agree, and there is hardly room to doubt the beauty and
                    expediency of the practice. The passage to the chapter-house at Salisbury, the
                    early church of St Mary at Guildford, the chapels at the east end of Winchester
                    Cathedral, are interesting English examples of early work. The Norfolk screens
                    and roofs are still more interesting and beautiful works of the richest
                    description,. and so numerous were these that at one time no church seems to
                    have been thought furnished which had none of this kind of decoration. These had
                    every portion of their moulded surfaces adorned in the richest way with gold and
                    colours, whilst their solid panels were covered with pictures of single figures
                    or subjects. English roofs were decorated in the same fashion, and of these the
                    finest examples are in Peterborough Cathedral and St Alban’s Abbey. If we turn
                    to the pages of illuminated manuscripts we shall find views of towns in which
                    whole houses are decorated with masses of colour on the outside to distinguish
                    them from their neighbours. And in rather later times, as we see in Florence, in
                    Brescia, at Augsburg, at Meran, and often elsewhere, most brilliant effects were
                    produced by painting subjects on the external walls of palaces and houses. But,
                    generally speaking, beautiful as this sort of decoration was, it erred rather in
                    ignoring to a considerable extent the architecture which it adorned,—unlike the
                    earlier works, where the effort of the colourist was usually and rightly to make
                    all the mouldings or members of the work decorated more distinct and
                    intelligible than they can be in the absence of colour. Without coloured
                    illustrations of an elaborate description it would be impossible to explain any
                    or all the features of architectural polychrome. But enough has been said to
                    show that the subject is one not only of interest to architects, but of
                    importance to all who care for architecture, for it is hardly possible that
                    works such as those which have here been shortly referred to should be passed
                    over by the student or amateur of architecture as though they had no interest
                    for us, and it may be confidently asserted that modern schools of architecture
                    cannot with safety ignore so interesting a development of the art. (τ. <hi

                <p>GLOSSARY OF ARCHITECTURAL TERMS (ESPECIALLY CLASSICAL AND MEDIAeVAL).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abaciscus,</hi> diminutive of Abacus, applied to the
                    chequers or squares of a tessellated pavement.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abacus,</hi> from the Gr. <hi rend="italic">&amp;βαζ,</hi> a

                    >tailloir,</hi> the upper part of the capital of a column, pier, &amp;c. (See
                    separate article, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Capital.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Abated,</hi> a term for such work in mediaeval masonry as is worked down or
                    sunk.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abbey</hi> (Fr. <hi rend="italic">abbaye,</hi> Ital. <hi
                    rend="italic">abbadia,</hi> or contracted, <hi rend="italic">badia,</hi> Ger.
                    <hi rend="italic">Abtei,</hi><hi rend="italic">Kloster),</hi> a term for the
                    church and other buildings used by conventual bodies presided over by an abbot
                    or abbess, in contradistinction to <hi rend="italic">cathedral,</hi> which is
                    presided over by a bishop, and <hi rend="italic">priory,</hi> the head of which
                    was a prior or prioress. (See separate article.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Acroterium</hi> (Gr. <hi rend="italic">hκpωτhpιοv,</hi> the
                    summit or vertex), a statue or ornament of any kind placed on the apex of a
                    pediment. The term is often restricted to the plinth, which forms the podium
                    merely for the acroterium.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aisle,</hi> sometimes written Isle, Yle, and Alley (Lat. and
                    I tai. <hi rend="italic">ala,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">aile, bas-coté,</hi>
                    Ger. <hi rend="italic">Seitenschiff, Seitenchor),</hi> in its primary sense the
                    wing of a house, but generally used to describe the alleys or passages at the
                    sides of the naves and choirs of churches. (See separate article.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alcove,</hi> a recess in a room usually screened off by
                    pillars, balustrade, or drapery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alien-Houses,</hi> religious houses in England belonging to
                    foreign ecclesiastics, or under their control. They generally were built where
                    property had been left by the donors to foreign orders to pray for their souls.
                    They were frequently regular <hi rend="italic">priories,</hi> but sometimes only
                    <hi rend="italic">cells,</hi> and even <hi rend="italic">granges,</hi> with
                    small chapels attached. Some, particularly in cities, seem to have been a sort
                    of mission-houses. There were more than 100 in England. Many alien-houses were
                    suppressed by Henry V., and the rest by Henry VIII.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alley,</hi> also called Ambulatory (Lat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >deambulatorium),</hi> the covered passages round a cloister. (See also <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Alure.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Almery,</hi> also Aumery,
                    Aumbrie, and Ambry (Fr. <hi rend="italic">armoire,</hi> Ital. <hi rend="italic"
                    >armario),</hi> a recess in the wall of a church, sometimes square-headed, and
                    sometimes arched over, and closed with a door like a cupboard—used to contain
                    the chalices, basins, cruets, &amp;c., for the use of the priest; many of them
                    have stone shelves. They are sometimes near the piscina, but more often on the
                    opposite side. The word also seems in mediaeval times to be used commonly for
                    any closed cupboard, and even bookcase.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Almonry</hi> (Lat. <hi rend="italic">eleemosinarium,</hi>
                    Fr. <hi rend="italic">aumonerie,</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic">Almosenhaus),</hi>
                    the place or chamber where alms were distributed to the poor in churches, or
                    other ecclesiastical buildings. At Bishopstone Church, Wiltshire, it is a sort
                    of covered porch attached to the south transept, but not communicating with the
                    interior of the church. At Worcester Cathedral the alms are said to have been
                    distributed on stone tables, on each side, within the great porch. In large
                    monastic establishments, as at Westminster, it seems to have been a separate
                    building of some importance, either joining the gatehouse or near it, that the
                    establishment might be disturbed aβ little as possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Almshouses,</hi> small buildings for the residence of the
                    aged poor, generally endowed with some yearly stipend. The greater portion were
                    built after the Reformation. Two interesting early examples are—that at St
                    Cross, near Winchester, and that near the Preaching Cross of the Black Friars at
                    Hereford.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Altar,</hi> anciently written Auter, or Awter (Lat. and I
                    tai. <hi rend="italic">altare,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">autel),</hi> the
                    elevated table devoted to the celebration of the Eucharist. (See separate
                    article.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alure</hi> (Lat. <hi rend="italic">alura—allorium,</hi>
                    probably from <hi rend="italic">alcdorium),</hi> an alley, passage, the water
                    way or flat gutter behind a parapet, the galleries of a clerestory, sometimes
                    even the aisle itself of a church. The term is sometimes written <hi
                    rend="italic">valure,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">r&gt;aloring.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amphiprostyle</hi> (Gr. <hi rend="italic">aμ&lt;ρi,</hi> around
                    or about, and <hi rend="italic">prostyle, q.v.)</hi> A temple with a portico at
                    each end is said to be amphiprostylar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Angel-Lights,</hi> the outer upper lights in a perpendicular
                    window, next to the springing; probably a corruption of the word anglelights, as
                    they are nearly triangular.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Annulet</hi> (Lat. <hi rend="italic">annulus,</hi> a ring),
                    a term applied to the small fillets or bands which encircle the lower part of
                    the Doric capital immediately above the neck or trachelium.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Antae</hi> (probably from the Gr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >àvrlos,</hi> or some other derivative of the preposition <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,vτl,</hi> opposite to), the pier-formed ends of the walls of a building, as
                    in the portico of a Greek temple. A portico is said to be <hi rend="italic">in
                    antis</hi> when columns stand between antae, as in the temple of Theseus,
                    supposing the peristyle or surrounding columns removed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ante-Chapel,</hi> a small chapel forming the entrance to
                    another. There are examples at the Cathedral and at Merton College, Oxford, and
                    at King’s College, Cambridge, besides several others. The ante-chapel to the
                    Lady chapel in cathedrals is generally called the Presbytery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ante-Choir,</hi> the part under the rood loft, between the
                    doors of the choir and the outer entrance of the screen, forming a sort of
                    lobby. It is also called the Fore-Choir.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Antefixae</hi> (Lat. <hi rend="italic">ante,</hi> before,
                    and <hi rend="italic">fixus,</hi> fixed), upright blocks with an ornamented face
                    placed at regular intervals on a cornice. Antefixae were originally adapted to
                    close and hide the lower ends of the joints of the covering tiles on the roof of
                    a temple.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Apophyge</hi> (Gr. <hi rend="italic">i∙πo&lt;pυyh,</hi> a
                    flying off), the lowest part of the shaft of an Ionic or Corinthian column, or
                    the highest member of its base if the column be considered as a whole. The
                    apophyge is the inverted cavetto or concave sweep, on the upper edge of which
                    the diminishing shaft rests.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Apse</hi> (Gr. αψir, Lat. <hi rend="italic">absis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tribuna, concha,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">abside,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rond-point,</hi> Ital. <hi rend="italic">apside,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tribuna,</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic">Ablauf),</hi> the
                    semicircular or polygonal termination to the chancel of a church. (See separate
                    article.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Apteral</hi> (Gr. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> priv., and <hi
                    rend="italic">ιrτeρiv,</hi> a wing), a temple without columns on the flanks or
                    sides.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Araeostyle</hi> (Gr. <hi rend="italic">aρaiοs,</hi> rare or
                    weak, and <hi rend="italic">στι&gt;Kοs,</hi> a column), a wide
                    intercolumniation. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Eustyle.)</hi> The space assigned
                    to this term by Vitruvius is uncertain; the modems assign to it four
                    diameters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Araeosystyle</hi> (compounded of <hi rend="italic"
                    >araeostyle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">systyle, q.v.)</hi> expresses the
                    arrangement attendant on coupled columns, as in the western front of St Paul's
                    Cathedral.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arcade</hi> (Fr. <hi rend="italic">arcade, arcature,</hi>
                    Ital. <hi rend="italic">areata,</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic">Bogengang),</hi> a
                    range of arches, supported either on columns or on piers, and detached or
                    attached to the wall. (See separate article.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Architrave</hi> (Gr. <hi rend="italic">hpχh,</hi> chief, and
                    Lat. <hi rend="italic">trabs,</hi> a beam), the chief <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n517/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0517-0460"/> beam—that part of the entablature which rests
                    immediately on the heads of the columns and is surmounted by the frieze; it is
                    also called the epistylium or epistyle. The moulded enrichment on the sides and
                    head of a door or window is called an architrave.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Archivolt,</hi> a contraction of the Italian <hi
                    rend="italic">architrave voltato,</hi> is applied to the architrave moulding on
                    the face of an arch, and following its contour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Armature,</hi> the French term for the iron stays by which
                    the lead lights are secured in windows. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Stanchions</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Saddle Bars.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Arris,</hi> the sharp edge or angle in which two sides or surfaces meet. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ashlar,</hi> also written Ashler, Ashelere, &amp;c., (probably
                    from the Lat. <hi rend="italic">assella),</hi> squared stones, generally applied
                    to those used for facing walls. In a contract of date 1398 we read—“Murus erit
                    exterius de puro lapide vocato <hi rend="italic">achilar,</hi> plane incisso,
                    interius vero de lapide fracto vocato <hi rend="italic">roghwallT</hi> “Clene
                    hewen” ashler often occurs in mediaeval documents; this no doubt means tooled or
                    finely scappled, in contradistinction to rough-axed, faces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ashler Pieces,</hi> upright pieces of wood going from the
                    common rafters so as to cut off the lower angle of the roof in the attic story.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Astragal</hi> (Gr. <hi rend="italic">iστpiγaKοs,</hi> a
                    bone of the ancle), a convex moulding.</p>
                <p>This term is generally applied to small mouldings, torus to large ones of the
                    same form. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Torus.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Attic,</hi> a low story above an entablature, or above a cornice which limits
                    the height of the main part of an elevation. Although the term is evidently
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">Αττικ0s,</hi> we find nothing exactly answering
                    to it in Greek architecture; but it is very common in both Roman and Italian
                    practice. What are otherwise called tholobates in St Peter’s and St Paul’s
                    Cathedrals are frequently termed attics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Back-Choir,</hi> a place behind the altar in the principal
                    choir, in which there is, or was, a small altar standing back to back with the
                    former.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bahut,</hi> the French term for a wall of plain masonry on
                    which there is some superstructure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bailey,</hi> said to be a corruption of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ballium</hi> by some, and derived by others from the French “bailie,” a
                    corruption of “bataille,” because there the soldiers were drilled in battle
                    array; the open space between the inner and outer lines of a fortification.
                    Sometimes there were more than one, as the Inner and Outer Bailey; we have the
                    Old Bailey at London and at York, and the Upper and Nether Baileys at

                    generally placed in rows at equal distances in the hollow of a moulding,
                    frequently by the sides of mullions. The earliest known is said to be in the

                    the shaft stands. The only base used by the Egyptians was a mere square plinth.
                    The Assyrians evidently understood the value of a base as an architectural
                    accessory, and some bases shown on the bas-reliefs are strongly moulded. But all
                    actually remaining are like the one recently placed in the British Museum, which
                    consists merely of a large torus. The Persian bases were finely moulded, elegant
                    in outline, and more richly ornamented than in any other style. The chief
                    mouldings are a torus, and a large reversed cyma. In pure Greek work a base is
                    never used in the Doric, but always in the Ionic and Corinthian. The plainer
                    sort is that well known as the Attic, consisting mainly of a hollow between two
                    tori; but the tori are, in other instances, deeply channelled, so as to have a
                    very complicated appearance. The Romans had bases to all their orders, the more
                    usual form being like the Attic. The Romanesque and Norman bases were evidently
                    copies, for the most part, from classic forms; but were often adorned with
                    leaves at the angles of the square plinths, thereby leading them into the round
                    in a very pleasing way. This was done still more elegantly in the Early English
                    style, whose most characteristic base was much like the Attic, but with the
                    hollow prolonged upwards in a deep water-holding section. The Perpendicular were
                    mostly very high, formed with two or more plinths and bold mouldings, chiefly
                    reversed ogees.</p>

                    of defence hurled on besiegers. The raised portions are called <hi rend="italic"

                    while discharging his weapon through the latter. Their use is of great
                    antiquity; they are found in,the sculptures of Nineveh, in the tombs of Egypt,
                    and on the famous François vase, where there is a delineation of the siege of
                    Troy. In ecclesiastical architecture the early battlements have small shallow
                    embrasures at somo distance apart. In the Decorated period they are closer
                    together, and deeper, and the mouldings on the top of the merlon and bottom of
                    the embrasure are richer. During this period, and the earlier part of the
                    Perpendicular, the sides or cheeks of the embrasures are perfectly square and
                    plain. In later times the mouldings were continued round the sides, as well as
                    at top and bottom, mitring at the angles, as over the doorway of Magdalene
                    College, Oxford. The battlements of the Decorated and later periods are often
                    richly, ornamented by panelling, as in the last example. In castellated work the
                    merlons are often pierced by narrow arrow-slits. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Oylet.)</hi> In South Italy some battlements are found strongly resembling
                    those of old Rome and Pompeii; in foreign ecclesiastical architecture the
                    parapets are very rarely embattled.</p>

                    the upper part or cover of a niche, or the projecting ornament over an altar or

                    mosquito curtain. Early English canopies are generally simple, with trefoiled or
                    cinquefoiled heads; but in the later styles they are very rich, and divided into
                    compartments with pendants, knots, pinnacles, &amp;c. The triangular arrangement
                    over an Early English and Decorated doorway is often called a canopy. The
                    triangular canopies in the north of Italy ai e peculiar. Those in England are
                    generally part of the arrangement of the arch mouldings of the door, and form,
                    as it were, the hoodmoulds to them, as at York. The former areabove and
                    independent of the door mouldings, and frequently support an arch with a
                    tympanum, above which is a triangular canopy, as in the Duomo at Florence.
                    Sometimes the canopy and arch project from the wall, and are carried on small
                    jamb shafts, as at San Pietro Martire at Verona. An extremely curious canopy,
                    being a sort of horseshoe arch, surmounting and breaking into a circular arch,
                    from Tournay is given. Similar canopies are often over windows, as at York
                    Minster over the great west window, and lower tiers in the towers. These are
                    triangular, while the upper windows in the towers have ogee canopies.</p>

                    &amp;c. Capitals have been used in every style down to the present time. That
                    mostly used by the Egyptians was bell-shaped, with or without ornaments. The
                    Persians used the double-headed bell, forming a kind of bracket capital. The
                    Assyrians apparently made use of the Ionic and Corinthian, which were developed
                    by the Greeks, Romans, and Italians, into their present well-known forms. The
                    Doric was apparently an invention or adaptation by the Greeks, and was altered
                    by the Romans and Italians. But in all these examples, both ancient and modern,
                    the capitals of an order are all of the same form throughout the same building,
                    so that if one be seen the form of all the others is known. The Romanesque
                    architects altered all this, and in the carving of their capitals often
                    introduced such figures and emblems as helped to tell the story of their
                    building. Another form was introduced by them in the curtain capital, Hide at
                    first, but afterwards highly decorated. It evidently took its origin from the
                    cutting off of the lower angles of a square block, and then rounding them off.
                    The process may be distinctly seen, in its several stages, in Mayence Cathedral.
                    But this form of capital was more fully developed by the Normans, with whom it
                    became a marked feature. In the Early English capitals a peculiar flower of
                    three or more lobes was used, spreading from the necking upwards in most
                    graceful forms. In Decorated and Perpendicular this was abandoned in favour of
                    more realistic forms of crumpled leaves, enclosing the bell like a wreath. In
                    each style bold abacus mouldings were always used, whether with or without
                    foliage.</p>

                    windows. It wa9 at one time supposed that the scrolls on which inscriptions of

                    Albans there are very old flat ceilings of boards curiously painted. In later
                    times the boarded ceilings, and, in fact, some of those of plaster, have moulded
                    ribs, locked with bosses at the intersection, and are sometimes elaborately

                    insulated or attached. They are said to be attached or engaged when they form
                    part of a wall, projecting one half or more, but not the whole, of their
                    substance. For the columns of different styles and orders of architecture, see

                    derived) or covering of a wall. This is of stone, weathered to throw off the
                    wet. In Norman times, as· far as can be judged from the little there is left, it
                    was generally plain and flat, and projected over the wall with a throating to
                    form a drip. Afterwards it assumed a toms or bowtell at the top, and became
                    deeper, and in the Decorated period there were generally several sets-off. The
                    copings in the late Perpendicular period assumed something of the wavy section
                    of the buttress caps, and mitred round the sides of the embrasure, as well as
                    the top and bottom.</p>

                    timber projecting in the same way was called a tassel or a bragger. Thus the
                    carved ornaments from which the vaulting shafts spring at Lincoln are corbels.
                    Norman corbels are generally plain. In the Early English period they are
                    sometimes elaborately carved, as at Lincoln above cited, and sometimes more
                    simply so, as at Stone. They sometimes end with a point apparently growing into
                    the wall, or forming a knot, as at Winchester, and often are supported by angels
                    and other figures. In the later periods the foliage or ornaments resemble those

                    blocking-course, common in classic architecture. In Norman times, the wall
                    finished with a corbel table, which carried a portion of plain projecting work,
                    which was finished by a coping, and the whole formed a Parapet In Early English
                    times the parapet was much the same, but the work was executed in a much better
                    way, especially the small arches connecting the corbels. In the Decorated period
                    the corbel table was nearly abandoned, and a large hollow, with one or two
                    subordinate mouldings, substituted; this was sometimes filled with the ball
                    flowers, and sometimes with running foliages. In the Perpendicular style, the
                    parapet frequently did not project beyond the wall-line below; the moulding then
                    became a string (though often improperly called a cornice), and was ornamented
                    by a quatrefoil or small rosettes set at equal intervals immediately under tho
                    battlements. In many French examples the moulded string is very bold, and
                    enriched with foliage ornaments.</p>

                    which a proportion of two diameters and a quarter is assigned. This term,
                    together with the others of similar import—pycnostyle, systyle, diastyle, and
                    araeostyle— referring to the distances of columns from one another in
                    composition, is from Vitruvius, who assigns to each the space it is to express.
                    It will be seen, however, by reference to them individually, that the words
                    themselves, though perhaps sufficiently applicable, convey no idea of an exactly
                    defined space, and by reference to the columnar structures of the ancients, that
                    no attention was paid by them to such limitations. It follows, then, that the
                    proportions assigned to each are purely conventional, and may or may not be
                    attended to without vitiating the power of applying the terms. Eustyle means the
                    best or most beautiful arrangement; but as the effect of a columnar composition
                    depends on many things besides the diameter of the columns, the same
                    proportioned intercolumniation would look well or ill according to those other
                    circumstances, so that the limitation of eustyle to two diameters and a quarter
                    is absurd.</p>

                    fillets. In mediaeval work, the fillet is a small, flat, projecting square,
                    chiefly used to separate hollows and rounds, and often found in the outer parts
                    of shafts and bowtells. In this situation the centre fillet has been termed a

                    in point of design. They are found in early work where there are no crockets.
                    The simplest form more resembles a bud about to burst than an open flower. They
                    soon became more elaborate, as at Lincoln, and still more, as at Westminster and
                    the Hotel Cluny at Paris. Many Perpendicular finials are like four crockets
                    bound together. Almost every known example of a finial has a sort of necking

                    one cusp on each side, however long the division may be. The mouldings seem to

                    Those in the baptisteries in Italy are all large, and were intended for
                    immersion; as time went on, they seem to have become smaller. What they were in
                    Saxon times is uncertain, though it is not improbable that some of the plain
                    examples, called NormaD, may have been of earlieι date. Norman fonts are
                    sometimes mere plain, hollow cylinders, generally a little smaller below than
                    above; others are massive squares, supported on a thick stem, round which
                    sometimes there are smaller shafts. In the Early English this form is still
                    pursued, and the shafts are detached; sometimes, however, they are hexagonal and
                    octagonal, and in this and the later styles assume the foιm of a vessel on a
                    stem. Norman fonts have frequently curious carvings on them, approaching the
                    grotesque; in later times the foliages, &amp;c., partook absolutely of the
                    character of those used in other architectural details of their respective
                    periods. The font is usually placed close to a pillar near the entrance,

                <p>When a roof is not hipped or returned on itself at the ends, its ends are stopped
                    by carrying up the walls under them in the triangular form of the roof itself.
                    This is called the gable, or, in the case of the ornamental and ornamented
                    gable, the pediment. Of course gables follow the angles of the slope of the
                    roof, and differ in the various styles. In Norman work they are generally about
                    half pitch; in Early English, seldom Jess than equilateral, and often more. In
                    Decorated work they become lower, and still more so in the Perpendicular style.
                    In all important buildings they are finished with copings or parapets. In early
                    times the copings were nearly flat. In the later styles gables are often
                    surmounted with battlements, or enriched with crockets; they are also often
                    panelled or perforated, sometimes very richly. The gables in ecclesiastical
                    buildings are mostly terminated with a cross; in others, by a finial or
                    pinnacle. In later times the parapets or copings were broken into a sort of
                    steps, called <hi rend="italic">corbie steps.</hi> In buildings of less
                    pretension, the tiles er other roof covering passed over the front of the wall,
                    which then, of course, had no coping. In this case the outer pair of rafters
                    were concealed by moulded or carved verge boards. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    and very sharp in pitch. In the Decorated period they are often enriched with
                    panelling and crockets. They are sometimes finished with small crosses, but
                    offener with finials.</p>

                    Scriptural expression, “Galilee of the Gentiles.” Galilees are supposed to have
                    been used sometimes as courts of law, but chiefly for penitents not yet admitted
                    to the body of the church. At Durham thegalilee is a chapel at the main entrance

                    gallery, though originally a loft. In later times the name was given to any very
                    long rooms, particularly those intended for purposes of state. (See <hi

                    They generally had a large gateway protected by a gate, and also a portcullis,
                    over which were battlemented parapets with holes (machicolations) for throwing
                    down darts, melted lead, or hot sand, on the besiegers. Gatehouses always had a
                    lodge, with apartments for the porter, and guard-rooms for the soldiers; and
                    generally rooms over for the officers, and often places for prisoners beneath.
                    They are sometimes open in the rear, as at Cooling Castle, and often have doors
                    with portcullises, &amp;c., on both sides, in case the enemy should scale the
                    walls, and attack them both in front and rear. In this case, the space betweên,
                    on the ground floor, was generally groined over, with holes for missile

                    walls strongly buttressed. In England the term is applied not only to the barns,
                    but to the whole of the buildings which formed the detached farms belonging to
                    the monasteries; in most cases there was a chapel either included among these or

                    Queen Eleanor in Westminster Abbey. They are of wrought iron, ornamented by the

                    English church at Warmington, and one at Winchester Cathedral, exactly

                    d'arête,</hi> Ital. <hi rend="italic">fornice),</hi> the system of covering a
                    building with stone vaults which cross and intersect each other, as opposed to
                    the barrel vaulting <hi rend="italic">{voûte de berceau),</hi> or series of
                    arches placed side by side. The earliest groins are plain, without any ribs,
                    except occasionally a sort of wide band from wall to wall, to strengthen the
                    construction. In later Norman times ribs were added on the line of intersection
                    of the spandrils, crossing each other, and having a boss as a key common to
                    both; these ribs the French authors call <hi rend="italic">nerfs en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ogive.</hi> Their introduction, however, caused an entire change
                    in the system of vaulting; instead of arches of uniform thickness' and great
                    weight, these ribs were first put up as the main construction, and spandrils <hi
                    rend="italic">{remplissage)</hi> of the lightest and thinnest possible material
                    placed upon them, the haunches only being loaded sufficiently to counterbalance
                    the pressure from the crown. Shortly after, half ribs against the walls <hi
                    rend="italic">{formerets)</hi> were introduced to carry the spandrils without
                    cutting into the walling, and· to add to the appearance. The work was now not
                    treated as continued vaulting, but as divided into bays <hi rend="italic"
                    >{travées),</hi> and it was formed by keeping up the ogive or intersecting ribs
                    and their bosses; a sort of construction having some affinity to the dome was
                    formed, which added much to the strength of the groining. Of course the top of
                    the soffit or ridge of the vault was not horizontal , But rose from the level of
                    the top of the forrneret-rib to the boss and fell again; but this could not be
                    perceived from below. As this system of construction got more into use, and as
                    the vaults were required to be of greater span and of higher pitch, the
                    spandrils became larger, and wanted more support. To give this another set of
                    ribs was introduced, passing from the springers of the ogive ribs, and going to
                    about half-way between these and the ogive, and meeting on the ridge of the
                    vault; these intermediate ribs are called by the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >tiercerons,</hi> and began to come into use in the transition from Early
                    English to Decorated. About the same period a system of vaulting came into use
                    called <hi rend="italic">hexpartite,</hi> from the fact that every bay is
                    divided into six compartments instead of four. It was invented to cover the
                    naves of churches of unusual width. The filling of the spandrils in this style
                    is very peculiar; and, where the different compartments meet at the ridge, some
                    pieces of harder stone have been used, which have rather a pleasing effect. The
                    arches against the wall being of smaller span than the main arches, cause the
                    centre springers to be perpendicular and parallel for some height, and the
                    spandrils themselves are very hollow. As styles progressed, and the desire for
                    greater richness increased, another series of ribs called <hi rend="italic"
                    >liernes,</hi> was introduced; these passed cross-ways from the <hi
                    rend="italic">ogives</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">tiercerons,</hi> and thence
                    to the <hi rend="italic">doubleaux,</hi> dividing the spandrils nearly
                    horizontally. These various systems increased in the Perpendicular period, so
                    that the vaults were quite.a network of ribs, and led at last to the Tudor, or,
                    as it is called by many, <hi rend="italic">fan tracery</hi> vaulting. In this
                    system the ribs are no part of the real construction, but are merely carved upon
                    the vous-soirs, which form the actual vaulting. Fan Tracery is so called because
                    the ribs radiate from the springers, and spread out like the sticks of a fan.
                    These later methods are not strictly groins, for the peridentives are not square
                    on plan, but circular, and there is therefore no arris intersection or <hi

                    floor, where the retainers lived, the basement being devoted to stores and
                    dungeons for confining prisoners. Later halls, indeed some Norman halls (not in
                    castles), are generally on the ground floor, as at Westminster, approached by a
                    porch either at the end, as in this last example, or at the side, as at
                    Guildhall, London, having at one end a raised <hi rend="smallcaps">Dais</hi>
                    (which see) or Estrade. The roofs are generally open, and more or less

                    large chimney places with funnels or chimney shafts for this purpose. At this

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">High Altar,</hi> the principal altar in a cathedral or

                    label over a window or door opening, whether inside or out; but it seems more
                    properly to be applied to the mouldings at the arris of the arch at the inner
                    side of such opening.. Sometimes these assume the form of a label, and have
                    jamb-shafts. Frequently the soffit is slightly hollowed and finishes with an

                    magistrates, barracks for police, prisons, and all other fiscal purposes. As may
                    be imagined, they differ very much in different towns, but they have almost
                    invariably attached to them, or closely adjacent, a large clock-tower <hi

                    abroad there are many. The most celebrated is the one at Angers, described by
                    Parker. They do not seem to differ much Li arrangement of plan from those in
                    modern days—the accommodation for the chaplain, medicine, nurses, stores,
                    &amp;c., being much the same in all ages, except that in some of the earlier,
                    instead of the sick being placed in long wards like galleries, as is now done,
                    they occupied large buildings, with naves and side aisles like churches. The
                    reader is referred to the works of Parker, Viollet-le-Duc, and Verdier and
                    Cattois, for further details.</p>

                    The term may be the more easily understood by supposing the roof removed from
                    over the nave of a church in which columns or piers go up from the floor to the

                    the hypotrachelium is a projecting fillet or moulding, and in others, as the
                    Doric, it is composed of a channel or groove, .and sometimes of more than

                    to mediaeval architecture, as the mouldings in general spring from the capital
                    of a shaft, or from a corbel; or they continue without breaking down to the
                    base, or till they are stopped by a chamfer or a regular base moulding, or they

                    chiefly confined to the hinges, &amp;c., of doors and of church chests, &amp;c.
                    Specimens of Norman iron work are very rare. Early English specimens are
                    numerous, and very elaborate. In some instances not only do the hinges become a
                    mass of scroll work, but the surface of the doors is covered by similar
                    ornaments. In both these periods the design evidently partakes of the feeling
                    exhibited in the. stone or weed carving. In the Decorated period the scroll work
                    is more graceful, and, like the foliage of the time, more natural. As styles
                    progressed, there was a greater desire that the framing of the doors should be
                    richer, and the ledges were chamfered or raised, then panelled, and at last the
                    doors became a mass of scroll panelling. This, of course, interfered with the
                    design of the hinges, the ornamentation of which gradually became unusual. In
                    almost all styles the smaller and less important doors had merely plain strap
                    hinges, terminating in a few bent scrolls, and latterly in <hi rend="italic"

                    partook more or less of the character of the time. On the Continent the knockers
                    are very elaborate. At all periods doors have been ornamented with nails having
                    projecting heads, sometimes square, sometimes polygonal, and sometimes
                    ornamented with rosee, &amp;c. The iron work of windows is generally plain, and
                    the ornament confined to simple <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lis</hi> heads to the
                    stancheons. The iron work of screens enclosing tombs and chapels is noticed
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Grille,</hi><hi rend="italic">q.υ.</hi><hi

                    benedicere,” &amp;c., were read.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Keep</hi> (Fr. <hi rend="italic">donjon),</hi> the inmost
                    and strongest part of a mediaeval castle, answering to the citadel of modern
                    times. The arrangement is said to have originated with Gundulf, the celebrated
                    bishop of Rochester.. The Norman keep is generally a very massive square tower,
                    the basement or stories partly below ground being used for stores and prisons.
                    The main story is generally a great deal above ground level, with a projecting
                    entrance, approached by a flight of εteps and drawbridge. This floor is
                    generally supposed to have been the guard-room or place for the soldiery; above
                    this was the hall, which generally extended over the whole area of the building,
                    and is sometime separated by columns; above this are other apartments for the
                    residents. There are winding staircases in the angles of the buildings; and
                    passages and small chambers in the thickness of the walls. The keep was intended
                    for the last refuge, in case the outworks were scaled and the other buildings
                    stormed. There is generally a well in a mediaeval keep, ingeniously concealed in
                    the thickness of a wall, or in a pillar. The most celebrated of Norman times are
                    the White Tower in London, the castles at Rochester, Arundel, and Newcastle,
                    Castle Hedingham, &amp;c. The keep was often circular, as at Conishorough and
                    Windsor. ·</p>

                    could come, and consequently there is no drip. The latter term is described
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Hood-MoUld.</hi> In Norman times the label frequently
                    did not project at all, and when it did it was very little, and formed part of
                    the series of arch mouldings. In the Early English’styles they were not very
                    large, sometimes slightly undercut, sometimes deeply, sometimes a quarter round
                    with chamfer, and very frequently a “roll" or “scroll moulding,” so called
                    because it resembles the part of a scroll where the edge laps over the body of
                    the roll. Labels generally resemble the string-courses of the periods, and, in
                    fact, often return horizontally ami form strings. They are less common in
                    Continental architecture than in English. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Dripstone,

                    carvings on which the labels terminated near the springing of the windows. In
                    Norman times these were frequently grotesque heads of fish, birds, &amp;c., and
                    sometimes stiff foliage, as at Shoreham. In the Early English and Decorated
                    periods they are often elegant knots of flowers, or heads of kings, queens,
                    bishops, and other persons supposed to be the founders of churches. In the
                    Perpendicular period they often finished with a short, square mitred return or
                    knee, and the foliages are generally leaves of square or octagonal form.</p>

                    containing vertical windows, but covered in horizontally. The name was also

                    Viollet-le-Duc. In general it is a sort of trough, and in some places has an

                    rend="italic">Simswcrk).</hi> When any work is wrought into long regular
                    channels or projections, forming curves or rounds, hollows, &amp;e., it is said
                    to be <hi rend="italic">moulded,</hi> and each separate member is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">moulding.</hi> In mediaeval architecture the principal mouldings
                    are those of the arches, doors, windows, piers, &amp;c. The remains of Saxon
                    work are so few, that we can tell but little about these mouldings. The arches
                    have sometimes a simple rib on them, sometimes are chamfered, and sometimes are
                    quite plain. Early Norman work is much the same. By degrees, however, the
                    arrises were finished by a round or bowtell. Later, hollows and rounds together
                    became common, and the arches were set back one behind another, each being
                    frequently supported by a jamb-shaft or column, though very often the arch
                    mouldings continued down the jambs without any break. In the Early English
                    style, the mouldings, for some time, like those of the preceding period, formed
                    groups set back in squares; they are smaller, lighter, more graceful, and
                    frequently very deeply undercut. The <hi rend="italic">scroll</hi> moulding is
                    also common. Small fillets now became very frequent in the outer parts of the
                    rounds. This has often been called the <hi rend="italic">keel</hi> moulding,
                    from its resemblance in section to the bottom of a ship: sometimes also it has a
                    peculiar hollow on each side like two wings. Later in the Decorated style the
                    mouldings are more varied in design, though hollows and rounds still prevail.
                    The undercutting is not so deep, fillets abound, ogees are more frequent, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">wave</hi> mould, double ogee, or double ressaunt, is often
                    seen. In many places the strings and labels are a round, the lower half of which
                    is cut off by a plain chamfer. The mouldings in the later styles in some degree
                    resemble those of the Decorated, flattened and extended; they run more into one
                    another, having fewer fillets, and being as it were less grouped. One of the
                    principal· features of the change is the substitution of one, or perhaps two
                    (seldom more), very large hollows in the set of mouldings. These hollows are
                    neither circular nor elliptical, but obovate, like an egg cut across, so that
                    one-half is larger than the other. The brace mould also has a small bead, where
                    the two ogees meet. Another sort of moulding, which has been called a ⅛ <hi
                    rend="italic">mould,</hi> is common in parapets, bases, and weatherings. For the
                    ancient mouldings see the general article, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mouldings, Ornamented.</hi> The Saxon and early Norman
                    mouldings do not seem to have been much enriched, but the complete and later
                    styles of Norman are remarkable for a profusion of ornamentation, the most usual
                    of which is what is called the zig-zag. This seems to be to Norman architecture
                    what the meander or fret was to the Grecian; but it was probably derived from
                    the Saxons, as it is very frequently found in their pottery. Bezants,
                    quatrefoils, lozenges, crescents, billets, heads of nails, are very common .
                    ornaments; besides these, battlements, cables, large ropes, round which smaller
                    ropes are turned, or, as our sailors say, “wormed,” scallops, pellets, chains, a
                    sort of conical barrels, quaint stiff foliages, beaks of birds, heads of fish,
                    ornaments of almost every conceivable kind, are sculptured in Norman mouldings;
                    and they are used in such profusion as has been attempted in no other style. The
                    decorations on Early English mouldings are chiefly the dog-tooth, which is one
                    of the great characteristics of this style, though it is to be found in the
                    Transition Norman. It is generally placed in a deep hollow between two
                    projecting mouldings, the dark shadow in the hollow contrasting in a very
                    beautiful way with the light in these mouldings. In this period and in the next
                    the tympanum over doorways, particularly if théy are double doors, is highly
                    ornamented. Those of the Decorated period resemble the former, except that the
                    foliage is more natural, and the dog-tooth gives way to the ball-flower. Some of
                    the hollows also are ornamented with rosettes set at intervals, which are
                    sometimes connected by a running tendril, as the ball-flowers are frequently.
                    Some very pleasing leaf-like ornaments in the labels of windows are often found
                    in Continental architecture. In the Perpendicular period the mouldings are
                    ornamented very frequently by square four-leaved flowers set at intervals, but
                    the two characteristic ornaments of the time are running patterns of vine
                    leaves, tendrils, and grapes in the hollows, which by old writers are called
                    “vignettes in casements,” and upright stiff leaves, generally called the Tudor
                    leaf. On the Continent mouldings partook much of the same character.</p>

                    perpendicular pieces of stone, sometimes like columns, sometimes like slender

                    other. In all styles, in less important work, the mullions are often simply
                    plain chamfered, and more commonly have a very flat hollow on each side. In
                    larger buildings there is often a bead or bowtell on the edge, and often a
                    single very small column with a capital; these are more frequent in foreign work
                    than in English. Instead of the bowtell they often finish with a sort of double
                    ogee. As tracery grew richer, the windows were divided by a larger order of
                    mullion, between which came a lesser or subordinate set of mullions, which ran
                    into each other.</p>

                    latter eso-narthex. In the Byzantine churches this inner narthex forms part of
                    the solid structure of the church, being marked off by a wall or row of columns,

                    often deeply recessed, and form niches with trefoil heads and sometimes
                    canopies. In the Decorated style the cusping and other enrichments of panels
                    become more elaborate, and they are often filled with shields, foliages, and
                    sometimes figures. Towards the end of this period the walls of important
                    buildings were often entirely covered with long or square panels, the former
                    frequently forming niches with statues. The use of panels in this way became
                    very common in Perpendicular work, the wall frequently being entirely covered
                    with long, short, and square panels, which latter are frequently richly cusped,
                    and .filled with every species of ornament, as shields, bosses of foliage,
                    portcullis, lilies, Tudor roses,'&amp;c. Wooden panellings very much resembled
                    those of stone, except in the Tudor period, when the panels were enriched by a

                    other designs—so that the light is seen through. Panelled parapets are those
                    ornamented by a series of panels, either oblong or square, and more or less
                    enriched, but are not perforated. These are common in the Decorated and

                    those surrounded λvith clustered columns, which carry the main arches of a
                    building. Saxon and early Norman pillars are generally stout cylindrical shafts
                    built up of small stones. Sometimes, however, they are quite square, sometimes
                    with other squares breaking out of them (this is more common on the Continent),
                    sometimes with angular shafts, and sometimes they are plain octagons. In
                    Romanesque Norman work the pillar is sometimes square, with two or more
                    semicircular or half columns attached. In the Early English period the pillars
                    become loftier and lighter, and in most important buildings are a series of
                    clustered columns, frequently of marble, placed side by side, sometimes set at
                    intervals round a circular centre, and sometimes almost touching each other.
                    These shafts are often wholly detached from the central pillar, though grouped
                    round it, in which case they are almost always of Purbeck or Eethersden marbles.
                    In Decorated work the shafts on plan are very often placed round a square set
                    anglewise, or a lozenge, the long way down the nave; the centre or core itself
                    is often worked into hollows or other mouldings, to show between the shafts, and
                    to form part of the composition. In this and the latter part of the previous
                    style there is generally a fillet on the outer part of the shaft, forming what
                    has been called a keel moulding. They are also often as it were tied together by
                    bands formed of rings of stone and sometimes of metal. About this period, too,'
                    these intermediate mouldings run up into and form part of the arch moulds, the
                    impost not being continuous; or rather there is no impost, but the shafts have
                    each their own separate cap. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Impost.)</hi> This
                    arrangement became much more frequent in the Perpendicular period; in fact it
                    was almost universal, the commonest section being a lozenge set with the long
                    side from the nave to the aisle, and not towards the other arclies, as in the
                    Decorated period, with four shafts at the angles, between which were shallow
                    mouldings, one of which in general was a wide hollow, sometimes with wave
                    moulds. As the pillar altogether by the arrangement was wider than the wall
                    above, the shafts facing the nave ran up to the roof, and served in place of the
                    vaulting shafts of the previous periods. The small pillars at the jambs of doors
                    and windows, and in arcades, and also those slender columns attached to pillars,
                    or standing detached, are generally called <hi rend="smallcaps">Shafts</hi>

                    Viollet-le-Duc gives examples from St Germer and St Remi, and there is one of
                    similar form at the west front of Rochester Cathedral. In the later Norman
                    period, two examples have been cited, one from Bredon in Worcestershire, and the
                    other from Cleeve in Gloucestershire. In these the buttresses run up, forming a
                    sort of square turret, and crowned with a pyramidal cap, very much like those of
                    the next period, the Early English. In this and the following styles the
                    pinnacle seems generally to have had its appropriate uses. It was a weight to
                    counteract the thrust of the groining of roofs, particularly where there were
                    flying buttresses; it stopped the tendency to slip of the stone copings of the
                    gables, and counterpoised the thrust of spires; it formed the piers to steady
                    the elegant perforated parapets of later periods; and in France especially
                    served to counterbalance the weight of overhanging corbel tables, huge
                    gargoyles, &amp;c. In the Early English period the smaller buttresses frequently
                    finished with <hi rend="smallcaps">Gablets</hi> (which see), and the more
                    important with pinnacles supported with clustered shafts. At this period the
                    pinnacles were often supported on these shafts alone, and were open below; and
                    in larger work in this and the subsequent periods they frequently form niches
                    and contain statues. About the Transition and during the Decorated period, the
                    different faces above the angle shafts often finish with gablets. Those of the
                    last-named period are much richer, and are generally decorated with crockets and
                    finials, and sometimes with ball-flowers. Very fine groups are found at Beverley
                    Minster and at the rise of the spire of St Mary’s, Oxford. Perpendicular
                    pinnacles differ but little from Decorated, except that the crockets and finials
                    are of later character. They are also often set angle-ways, particularly on
                    parapets, and the shafts are panelled. In France, pinna ’ cles, like spires,
                    seem to have been in use earlier than in England. There are small pinnacles at
                    the angles of the tower in the Abbey of Saintes. At Roullet there are pinnacles
                    in a similar position, each composed of four small shafts, with caps and bases
                    surmounted with small pyramidal spires. In all these examples the towers have
                    semicircular headed windows..</p>

                    On the inside face of old rubble walls it was not only used for purposes of

                    rend="italic">portico,</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic">Vorhalle),</hi> a covered
                    erection forming a shelter to the entrance door of a large building. The
                    earliest known are the long arcaded porches in front of the early Christian
                    basilicas, called <hi rend="smallcaps">Narthex</hi> (which see). In later times
                    they assume two forms—one the projecting erection covering the entrance at the
                    west front of cathedrals, and divided into three or more doorways, &amp;c., and
                    the other a kind of covered chambers open at the ends, and having small windows
                    at the sides as a protection from rain. These generally stand on the north or
                    south sides of churches, though in Kent there are a few instances (as Snodland
                    and Boxley) where they are at the west ends. Porches are of very early use.
                    Those of the Norman period generally have but little projection, and are
                    sometimes so flat as to be but little more than outer dressings and hood-moulds
                    to the inner door. They are, however, often very richly ornamented, and, as at
                    Southwell in England and Kelso in Scotland, have rooms over, which have been
                    erroneously called <hi rend="italic">parvises.</hi> (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paradise.)</hi> Early English porches are much longer, or project much further
                    from the faces of the churches to which they are attached, and in larger and
                    more important buildings have very frequently rooms above; the gables are
                    generally bold and high pitched. In larger buildings also, as at Wells, St
                    Albans, &amp;c., the interiors are very rich in design, quite as much so, in
                    fact, as thé exteriors. Decorated and Perpendicular porches partake of much the
                    same characteristics, the pitch of roof, mouldings, copings, battlements,
                    &amp;c., being of course influenced by the taste of the time. As a general rule,
                    however, the later porches had rooms over them more frequently than in earlier
                    times; these are often approached from the lower story by small winding stairs,
                    and sometimes have fire-places, and are supposed to have served as vestries; and
                    sometimes thero are the remains of a piscina, and relics of altar3. as if they
                    had been used as chantry chapels. It is probable there were wooden porches at
                    all periods, particularly in ‘those places where stone was scarce; but, as may
                    be expected from their exposed position, the earliest have decayed. At Cobham,
                    Surrey, there was one that had ranges of semicircular arches in oak at the
                    sides, of strong Norman character, which is now unfortunately destroyed. It is
                    said there are several in which portions of Early English work still are
                    traceable, as at Chevington, in Suffolk. In the Decorated and later periods,
                    however, wooden porches are very common, some plain, and others with richly
                    carved tracery and barge boards; these frequently stand on a sort of half story
                    of stone work or <hi rend="italic">bahut.</hi> The entrance porches at the west
                    end of our cathedrals are generally called <hi rend="italic">portals,</hi> and
                    where they assume the character of separate buildings, are designated <hi
                    rend="italic">galilees.</hi> Both these are'more common on the Continent than in
                    England. Many of the French cathedrals have the doors βo deeply recessed as to
                    be almost like open porches. These are called <hi rend="italic">portails</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">portes abrités.</hi> Many, however, have detached porches in
                    front of the portals themselves. The noblest example of an open projecting
                    western porch in England, and probably in the world, is at Peterborough, of the
                    Early English period, attached to the Early Norman nave.</p>

                    entirely made of metal, hung so as to slide up and down in grooves with
                    counterbalances, and intended to protect the gateways of castles, &amp;c. The
                    defenders having opened the gates and lowered the portcullis, could send arrows
                    and darts through the gratings, and yet the assailants could not enter. One of
                    these constructions was in existence until modern times in a gateway at York;
                    they are said not to be older than the 12th century, and were probably (as their
                    Italian name imports) invented as a defence against the sudden attacks of the

                    till, in narrow streets, it is said the houses almost touched each other at the

                    circular braces cut out of the croδked boughs of trees, and to fill in under and
                    sometimes over the window openings with cross struts, sometimes like the St
                    Andrew’s cross, and sometimes in circles and various designs. The main posts
                    also were strengthened inside and out with a sort of projecting corbels, called

                    have great projections to throw off the wet, and the jutting of the stories, one

                    raised platform with enclosed front, whence sermons, homilies, &amp;c., were
                    delivered. Pulpits were probably derived in their modern form from the <hi
                    rend="italic">amboncs</hi> in the early Christian church. There are many old
                    pulpits of stone, though the majority are of wood. Those in churches are
                    generally hexagonal or octagonal; and some stand on stone bases, and others on
                    slender wooden stems, like columns. The designs vary according to the periods in
                    which they rvero erected, having panelling, tracery, cuspings, crockets, and
                    other ornaments then in use. Some are extremely rich, and ornamented with colour
                    and gilding. A few also have fine canopies or sounding-boards. Their usual place
                    is in the nave, mostly on the north side, against the second pier from the
                    chancel arch. -Pulpits for addressing the people in the open air were common in
                    the mediaeval period, and stood near a road or cross. Thus there was one at
                    Spital Fields, and one at St Paul’s, London. External pulpits still remain at
                    Magdalene College, Oxford, and at Shrewsbury. Pulpits, or rather places for .
                    reading during the meals of the monks, gre found in the refectories at Chester,
                    Beaulieu, Shrewsbury, &amp;c., in England; and at St Martin des Champs, St
                    Germain des Prés, &amp;c., in France; also in the cloisters at St Die and St Lo.
                    Shortly after the Reformation the canons ordered pulpits to be erected in all
                    churches where there were none before. It is supposed that to this circumstance
                    we owe so many of the time of Elizabeth and James. Many of them are veιy
                    beautifully and elaborately carved, and are evidently of Flemish workmanship.
                    The pulpits in the Mahometan mosques are quite different in form, being usually
                    canopied and approached, by a straight flight of steps. These have a doorway at
                    the foot, with an architrave, and boldly moulded head; the whole of the work to
                    this and to the stairs, parapet, and pulpit itself being of wood, richly inlaid,
                    and often in part gorgeously painted and gilt.</p>

                    are generally cusped, and the cusps are often feathered. (See <hi

                    stronger. Saxon quoin stonee are said to have been composed of one long and one
                    short stone alternately. Early quoins are generally roughly axed; in later times
                    they had a draft tooled by the chisel round the outside edges, and later still
                    were worked fine from the saw.</p>

                    slab work. By rag-stone, near London, is meant an excellent material from the
                    neighbourhood of Maidstone. It is a very hard limestone of bluish-grey colour,
                    and peculiarly suited for mediaeval work. It is often laid as uncoursed work, or
                    random work, sometimes as random coursed work, and sometimes as regular ashlar.
                    The first method, however, is the more picturesque.</p>

                    of them were of plain masonιy, and adorned with hangings or paraments. In large
                    churches abroad, the high altar usually stands under a sort of canopy or

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Groined Vaulting.)</hi> The earliest groining had no ribs.
                    In early Norman times plain flat arches crossed each other, forming <hi
                    rend="italic">Ogive Ribs.</hi> These by. degrees became narrower, had greater
                    projection, and were chamfered. In later Norman work the ribs were often formed
                    of a large roll placed upon the flat band, and then of two rolls side by side,
                    with a smaller roll or a fillet between them, much like the lower member.
                    Sometimes they are enriched with zigzags and other Norman decorations, and about
                    this time bosses became of very general use. (See Boss.) As styles progressed,
                    the mouldings were more undercut, richer and more elaborate, and had the
                    dog-tooth or ball-flower or other characteristic ornament in the hollows. In all
                    instances the mouldings are of similar contours to those of arches, &amp;c., of
                    the respective periods. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mouldings.)</hi> In
                    Perpendicular work the ribs are broader aud shallower, and almost always have
                    two great hollows of elliptic shape, one on each side. In those churches of the
                    Early English and Decorated periods where there is a groining of wooden ribs
                    filled in between the spandrils with their narrow oak boards, these ribs
                    resemble those of stone, but are slighter, and the mouldings not so bold. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Ceiling.)</hi> Later, wooden roofs are often tormcd into
                    cants or polygonal barrel vaults, and in these the ribs are generally a cluster
                    of rounds, and form square or stellar panels, with carved bosses or shields at

                    beam, with or without a low screen, with folding-doors below but forming no part
                    of such support. The general construction of wooden screens is close panelling
                    beneath, about 3 feet to 3 feet 6 inches high, on which stands screen work
                    composed of slender turned balusters or regular wooden mullions, supporting
                    tracery more or less rich with cornices, crestings, &amp;c., and often painted
                    in brilliant colours, and gilded. These not only enclose the chancels, but also
                    chapels, chantries, and sometimes even tombs. In mansions, and some private
                    houses, the great halls were screened off by a low passage at the end opposite
                    to the dais, over which was a gallery for the use of minstrels or spectators.
                    These screens were sometimes close and sometimes <hi rend="italic">glazed.</hi>
                    There are many of these in England, generally more or less mutilated: one of the
                    most perfect galleries is that at Chariton-on-0 tmoor, in Oxfordshire.</p>

                    This also often leads out on the roof. On the Continent these stairs often lead
                    out of the interior of churches, and are enclosed with exquisitely perforated

                    &amp;c., were kept by the officer called the sacristan. In the early Christian
                    basilicas there were two semicircular recesses or apsides, one on each side of
                    the altar. One of these served as a sacristy, and the other as the bibliotheca
                    or library. Some have supposed the sacristy to have been the place where the
                    vestments were kept, and the vestry that-where the priests put them on; but we
                    find from Durandus that the <hi rend="italic">sacrarium</hi> was used for both

                    Church, Oxford, show; but afterwards they become much more lofty and simply
                    pointed. The probability is that the sight of the high •domes and aspiring
                    minarets of the Holy Land had suggested the erection of these lofty monuments to
                    the Crusaders. At this porio&lt;l the spires generally covered the whole tower
                    top, ar.d had hmm·hings where the square broke into the octagon. In the
                    Decorated period the spires became still slenderer and sharper; the broach spire
                    gradually gave place to those rising at once in octagon form from the flat of
                    the towers surrounded with parapets, often richly perforated, and with pinnacles
                    at the angles. The spires themselves often are decorated with ball-flowers and
                    crockets, and sometimes have broad horizontal bands of tracery at intervals. In
                    both these styles spire lights or <hi rend="italic">lucarnes</hi> are common.
                    Perpendicular spires partake also of most of these characteristics, except that
                    they scarcely furnish an example of a broach spire. It is remarkable with how
                    little material some of the loftiest spires have been erected, that at Salisbury
                    being barely 9 inches thick for a great part of its height. On the Continent the
                    spire seems to have been used earlier than with us. That at Brantôme is a mere
                    low pyramid. At Saintes it is a low carved cone, with something of domical
                    character. AtEoullet it is a sharp circular cone, with four open pinnacles at
                    the base. At Isomes it is octagonal, and as sharp as many of our Early English
                    spires. In all these examples the windows below are semicircular. Timber spires
                    are very common in England. Some are covered with lead in flat sheets, others
                    with the same metal in narrow stripes laid diagonally. Very many are covered
                    with shingles. Abroad there are some elegant examples of spires of open timber
                    work covered with lead.</p>

                    relief, and not detached statues. In Early English work they are deeper, and
                    instead of simple arches there is often a canopy over the figure, which was
                    placed on a small low pedestal. Later in the style the heads of the tabernacles

                    carved to imitate groin ribs, and the figures stand either on high pedestals, or
                    on corbels. Perpendicular tabernacles possess much the same features, but the
                    work is generally more elaborate; the figures generally stand on rich pedestals,
                    but sometimes on corbels, and the canopies generally project, sometimes in a
                    triangular form, and sometimes, with a sort of domical top. (See <hi

                    Ger. <hi rend="italic">Thurm),</hi> an elevated building originally designed for
                    purposes of defence. Those buildings are of the remotest antiquity, and are,
                    indeed, mentioned in the earliest Scriptures. In mediaeval times they are
                    generally attached to churches, to cemeteries, to castles, or are used as
                    bell-towers in public places of large cities. In churches, the towers of the
                    Saxon period are generally square, the only round example being supposed to be
                    that of Tasburgh. They are not very lofty, and are of strong, rude workmanship.
                    Two only, Brigstock and Brixworth, have staircases supposed to be original; both
                    these are on the west front of the tower. The masonry partakes of the usual
                    character attributed to Saxon work, as strip pilasters, long and short work,
                    &amp;c. The upper windows are generally circular-headed in two lights, separated
                    by a shaft much resembling . a turned baluster sometimes with heavy projecting
                    caps. Norman towers are also generally square. Many are entirely without
                    buttresses; others have broad, flat, shallow projections, which serve for</p>
                <p>• this purpose. The lower windows are very narrow, with extremely wide splays
                    inside, probably intended to be defended by archers. The upper windows, like
                    those of the preceding style, are generally separated into two lights, but by a
                    shaft or short column, and not by a baluster. Sometimes these towers have
                    arcades round them, and are ornamented, as at St Albans, in some cases very
                    richly, as at Norwich, "Winchester, Tewkesbury, Southwell, Sandwich, &amp;c.
                    They frequently have stone staircases at one of the angles. . In many of our
                    churches the Norman tower is placed between the chancel and nave, and is of the
                    full width of the latter. For the covering of these towers abroad, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Spire, Pinnacle, Parapet.</hi> A few round towers of this
                    period (and also of the next) are found on the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk; as
                    these mostly have no external doors, and are accessible only from the church,
                    and as some have chimneys, they are supposed to have been built as places of
                    refuge in case of invasion. Early English towers are generally taller, and of
                    more elegant proportions. They almost always have large projecting buttresses,
                    and frequently stone staircases. The lower windows, as in the former style, are
                    frequently mere arrow-slits; the upper are in couplets or triplets, and
                    sometimes the tower top has an arcade all round, as at Middleton Stoney. The
                    spires are generally <hi rend="smallcaps">Broach Spires</hi> (which see); but
                    sometimes the tower tops finish with corbel courses and plain parapets, and
                    (rarely) with pinnacles. Some of the towers and spires, particularly in the
                    midland counties, are richly ornamented; a very good specimen is at Raunds. A
                    few Early English towers break into the octagon from the square towards the top,
                    and still fewer finish with two gables, as at Brookthorpe and Ickford; Both
                    these methods of termination, however, are ’ common on the Continent. At
                    Vendôme, Chartres, and Senlis, the towers have octagonal upper stages surrounded
                    with pinnacles, from which elegant spires arise. Decorated towers differ but <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n532/mode/1up"

                    often lighter in effect; the buttresses, too, are set angularly; the parapets
                    are also frequently embattled, or perforated in elegant designs, and these
                    generally have pinnacles. The spires, also, now generally arise at once from the
                    octagon, and are not broach spires; those that are of this latter character have
                    the haunchings much smaller. There is a fine example of a Decorated tower and
                    spire at Ellington, in Huntingdonshire. Most Perpendicular towers are very fine,
                    particularly the great central towers, as at Canterbury and Gloucester. They are
                    generally richly panelled throughout; the buttresses project boldly, and are
                    sometimes set anglewise, and sometimes square, not close to each other, but
                    showing a ' small portion of the angle of the tower where they otherwise would
                    have intersected. The pinnacles are often richly canopied and the battlements
                    panelled, and often perforated; sometimes a pinnacle, and sometimes a canopied
                    niche, is placed in the middle of the parapet. At Boston, and in several other
                    places, there are fine lanterns at the tops of the towers. Taunton, Evesham,
                    Louth, Magdalene College, Oxford, and very many other places, have very fine
                    Perpendicular towers. In the north of Italy, and in Rome, they are generally
                    tall, square shafts in four to six stages, without buttresses, with couplets or
                    triplets of semicircular windows in each stage, generally crenellated at top,
                    and covered with a low pyramidal roof. The well-known hanging tower at Pisa is
                    cylindrical, in five stories of arcaded colonnades. In Ireland there are in some
                    of the churchyards very curious round towers.</p>
                <p>T <hi rend="smallcaps">racery,</hi> the ornamental filling in of the heads of
                    windows, panels, circular windows, &amp;c., which has given such characteristic
                    beauty to the architecture of the 14th century. I,ike almost everything
                    connected with mediaeval architecture, this elegant and sometimes fairy-like
                    decoration seems to have sprung from the smallest beginnings. The
                    circular-headed window of the Normans gradually gave way to the narrow-pointed
                    lancets of the Early English period, and as less light was afforded by the
                    latter system than by the former, it was necessary to have a greater number of
                    windows; and it was found convenient to group them together in couplets,
                    triplets, &amp;c. When these couplets were assembled under one label, a sort of
                    vacant space or spandril was formed over the lancets and under the label. To
                    relieve this, the first attempts Were simply to perforate this flat spandril,
                    first by a simple lozenge-shaped or circular opening, and afterwards by a
                    quatrefoil. By piercing the whole of the vacant spaces in the window head,
                    carrying mouldings round the tracery, and adding cusps to it, the formation of
                    tracery was complete, and its earliest result was the beautiful geometrical work
                    such as is found at Westminster Abbey. When this style had reached perfection
                    the usual decline followed; and the architects of the Decorated period designed
                    tracery, beautiful in itself, but which wants the vigour of the geometrical, and
                    appears more as if the stonework had been twisted than if it had been cut out of
                    the solid. Nevertheless, however fanciful the design may be, the whole element
                    is really geometrical—that is, it is formed of portions of circles, the centres
                    of which fall on the intersections of certain geometrical ligure3. The great
                    east window at Carlisle is composed of 86 distinct pieces of stone, and is
                    struck from 263 centres; and the glorious west window at York is probably
                    produced from a still greater number. Probably as a reaction against the
                    weakness of the Decorated, the flowing tracery gradually admitted upright
                    straight lines into its element.. This change was τ&gt;erhaps made to afford, as
                    it were, rectilineal frames to suit the glass painter, the foliages and
                    medallions of the preceding styles having given way to single figures, standing
                    on pedestals under rich canopies. Be this as it may, these have given a name to
                    the style of the 15th and 16th centuries. The mullions then, as at King’s
                    College Chapel, at St Jøhn’s, Oxford, and in several other examples, had more
                    flow, and fewer perpendicular lines, till at last plain, upright, and transverse
                    bars took their place, and held casement lights, which were at last superseded
                    by our modern sash windows. On the Continent, the windows of the first period,
                    or <hi rend="italic">ogivale</hi><hi rend="italic">primitive,</hi> were very
                    much like our own Early English. So in like manner those of the early part of

                    Geometrical Decorated. Later, however, in France and Germany, two. styles
