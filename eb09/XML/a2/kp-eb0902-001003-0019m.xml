                    than the modern provinces which have been formed out of it. These are eight in
                    number— Seville, Huelva, Cadiz, Jaen, Cordova, Granada, Almeria, Malaga. It also
                    corresponds to the “four kingdoms”— Seville, Jaen, Cordova, and Granada — into
                    which the Moors divided the south of Spain, to the still older Roman province of
                    <hi rend="italic">Boetica,</hi> and probably, in part at all events, to the
                    Tarshish of the Bible, a famous trading emporium and district belonging to the
                    Phoenicians, who were the earliest known inhabitants of the country. The name
                    Andalusia is said to be a corruption of Vandalusia, from the Vandals, who
                    overran this part of Spain after the downfall of the Roman Empire; other
                    authorities, however, consider that the Moors, who occupied the country after
                    the Vandals, gave it its present name from their term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andalosh,</hi> “land of the West.” Andalusia has an area of about 33,000 square
                    miles, and in 1867 had a population of 3,200,944. The principal river of
                    Andalusia is the Guadalquivir, the Roman <hi rend="italic">Boetis,</hi> which
                    rises in the mountains of Jaen, and flows in a south-westerly direction to the
                    Mediterranean at San Lucar. Its chief aflluents are the Jandula, the Guadiata,
                    and the Huebla on the right, and the Xenil on the left. Among the other rivers
                    of the province are the Tinto, the Guadalete, and the. Guadaljorce. The country
                    is very mountainous; the chief ranges are the Sierras Morena and de Arsohe in
                    the north, the Sierra Susana in the centre, and the Sierras Nevada, de Gador,
                    and Bermeja in the south. There are several peaks of great elevation; among the
                    highest are Mulahacen (11,781 feet) and Picacho de la Veleta (11,597 feet), both
                    in the Sierra Nevada. Many of the mountains abound with metals, as silver, lead,
                    copper, iron, and with coal; while marble and quartz are also found, the former
                    in large quantities, and of a fine quality. Though its soil and climate vary
                    with the elevation of the land, Andalusia must be considered the finest and most
                    delightful of all the divisions of the peninsula. Some of the higher mountains
                    are covered with perpetual snow, a luxury which is highly prized by the
                    inhabitants of the valleys, where the summer is usually extremely hot, and in
                    winter the snow falls only to melt when it reaches the ground. Here the more
                    common European plants and trees give place to the wild olive, the caper bush,
                    the aloe, the cactus, the evergreen oak, the orange, the lemon, the palm, and
                    other productions of a tropical climate. On the coasts of the Mediterranean,
                    about Marbella and Malaga, the sugar-cane is successfully cultivated; and no
                    inconsiderable quantity of silk is produced in the same region. Agriculture is
                    in a very backward state, and the implements used are of the most primitive
                    description; nevertheless, owing to the natural richness of the soil, large
                    crops of wheat and other cereals are grown. There are, however, considerable
                    tracts of land which, from want of water, are neither cultivated nor <pb

                    province. The horses and bulls of Andalusia are celebrated all over Spain; sheep
                    and swine are extensively bred, and game is abundant The inhabitants are a
                    lively, good-humoured, and ready-witted people, fond of pleasure, lazy, and
                    extremely superstitious, great boasters, and, Like most boasters, very cowardly
                    and unwarlike. The men are tall, handsome, aud well-made, and the women are
                    among the most beautiful in Spain; while the dark complexion and hair of both
                    sexes, and their peculiar dialect of Spanish, so distasteful to pure Castilians,
                    are as evident traces of the long rule of the Moors, as are the magnificent
                    architectural remains which adorn many of the Andalusian towns.</p>
