                    small province of Persia, bounded on the N. by the Caspian Sea and the desert,
                    on the S. by the Elburz Mountains, W. by Mazanderan, and E. by the river
                    Gourgan. The country, although mountainous, and interspersed with dense forests,
                    in which it is scarcely possible to travel, possesses beautiful and fertile
                    valleys, producing rice, wheat, and other grains in abundance, or spread out in
                    a boundless expanse of verdure, the pasturage of numerous flocks and herds.
                    Fraser, who travelled through Persia in 1822, extols in the most lavish terms
                    the appearance of the country. The soil, with little culture, is exceedingly
                    productive, owing to the abundance of water which irrigates and fertilises it.
                    But while the province in many parts presents a landscape of luxuriant beauty,
                    it is a prey to the ravages of disease, and the frequent incursions of the
                    surrounding tribes. The heavy torrents which fall in the rainy season stagnate
                    in the forests, forming morasses, which, in the heats of summer and autumn,
                    exhale a pestilential vapour, from the decomposition of the vegetable matter
                    they contain. From these seats of noxious effluvia the wandering tribes of
                    shepherds fly beyond the Gourgan or the Atrek, and live on the verge of the
                    burning sand, although they have to carry water for each day’s consumption from
                    the distant river. The better classes retire from the intense heats of summer
                    into the mountains; but the settled inhabitants of the villages, who cannot so
                    easily remove, and who generally remain, suffer severely from sickness. The
                    inhabitants, notwithstanding the unhealthiness of their climate, are a stout and
                    athletic race. The province is famous for furnishing a supply of matchlocks for
                    the king’s body-guard. It is the ancient Hyrcania, and the native country of the
                    Kajers, a Turkish tribe, of whom the king is the head, and on whom he considers
                    he can rely in times of danger.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Astrabad,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Asterabad,</hi> the
                    capital of the above province, is situated near the mouth of the River Gourgan,
                    which flows into the Caspian, and at the head of a sheltered bay, convenient for
                    shipping. It is a straggling town, about 3J∙ miles in circuit, and picturesque
                    in appearance, from the buildings being intermingled with trees and gardens. At
                    one time of greater size, it was reduced by Nadir Shah within its present
                    limits. It is surrounded by a dilapidated mud wall, once lofty and formidable,
                    and defended by numerous towers, and also by a wide and deep ditch, now almost
                    filled with rubbish. Astrabad owes its origin to Yezzen-ibn-Messlub, who
                    commanded the armies of Soliman, the seventh caliph of the Ommiades, early in
                    the 7 th century. It was destroyed by Tamerlane in 1384. In 1744 Hanway the
                    English traveller visited the place, and attempted to open a direct trade with
                    Europe. At present its bazaars, though extensive, are but poorly filled, but
                    commercial activity is said to be on the increase, in spite of the insecurity
                    caused by the Turcomans, who attack the caravans at the very gate of the town.
                    The number of houses within the walls is estimated at from 2000 to 3000. Owing
                    to the noxious exhalations of-,the surrounding forests, the town is so extremely
                    unhealthy during the hot weather as to have acquired the title of the City of
                    the Plague. Distance N.E. of Ispahan, 400 miles. Long. 54’ 25' E., lat. 36° 50'
                    N.</p>
