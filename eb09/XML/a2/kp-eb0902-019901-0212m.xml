                <p><label type="entry">APOTHEOSIS</label>, deification, the enrolment of a mortal
                    among the gods. In its most rudimentary form, this practice may be regarded as
                    an offshoot of the universal belief of primitive mankind in the existence of
                    disembodied spirits, and their continued agency in human affairs. (Tylor, <hi
                    rend="italic">Primitive Culture,</hi> ch. xi.-xvii.) An invisible being thus
                    invested with beneficent or malefic attributes, and capable of being offended or
                    propitiated, virtually becomes a local or tutelary divinity. The cultus of such
                    genii constitutes a large part of the religion of most negro nations. In China
                    it takes the shape of a respectful veneration of ancestors, accompanied by a
                    species of liturgical service. In India it is apparently excluded by the tenet
                    of incarnation, according to which the individual either resumes a rank
                    previously held by him, or enters upon a cycle of transmigrations admitting of
                    no fixity of condition and, consequently, of no absolute deification. The
                    Egyptian, Persian and Phoenician theologies seem to offer no trace of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0213-0200"/> the idea; but there is reason to expect that it
                    will be shown to have been a leading feature of the religions of Assyria and
                    Babylon. For perfectly unequivocal examples of its prevalence among a highly
                    cultivated people, we must resort to Greece and Rome. In Greece the worship of
                    deified heroes was universal. A distinction, however, must be observed between
                    the imaginary patriarchs of the golden age, who, after their decease, according
                    to Hesiod <hi rend="italic">(Op.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dies,</hi> 121), became by the counsel of Zeus beneficent daemons, guardians of
                    mortal men, but who seem to have enjoyed only a vague and general veneration,
                    and the mythical heroes, definite objects of worship, who may have been equally
                    apocryphal, but whose legends were none the less regarded as authentic history.
                    The reputed founders of cities were especially honoured with sacrifices by their
                    descendants, and the practice extended to such indubitably historical personages
                    as Lycurgus, Brasidas, Harmodius, Aristogiton, and Ptolemy Lagus. Instances of
                    the origination of such worship in the.historical period are nevertheless rare,
                    and the veneration paid to the hero was in all cases merely local. The religious
                    honours subsequently bestowed in their lifetime on Lysander, Alexander the
                    Great, and other illustrious persons, were merely the extravagance of flattery,
                    devoid of any influence on the national theology. The same cannot be said of the
                    apotheosis of the Caesars, the germ of which already existed in the veneration
                    paid to the legendary founder of Rome. To the Roman the emperor appeared as the
                    visible manifestation of the genius of the state, long the object of his
                    reverence. (Friedländer, <hi rend="italic">Sittengeschichte Doms,</hi> vol. iii.
                    p. 455.) The people, says Suetonius, fully believed in the divinity of Julius
                    Caesar, hinting at the same time that this was by no means the case with the
                    majority of the apotheoses subsequently decreed by the senate. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Jul.</hi><hi rend="italic">Coes.</hi> c. 88.) The honour was indeed not only
                    conferred upon almost every emperor who transmitted the sceptre to his
                    descendants, but frequently upon deceased members of his family, or even his
                    personal favourites, as in the case of Antinous. Sixty persons altogether are
                    recorded as having been thus raised to divine honours from the time of Caesar to
                    that of Constantine. The majority of such apotheoses would be regarded as mere
                    matters of official form; in some instances, however, it was otherwise. We learn
                    from Capitolinus that Marcus Aurelius was still worshipped as a household
                    divinity in the time of Diocletian, and was believed to impart revelations in
                    dreams. <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    Ant.</hi> c. 18.) Antinous was adored in Egypt a century after his death
                    (Origen, <hi rend="italic">Contra</hi><hi rend="italic">Celsum,</hi> iii. 36).
                    The ceremonies attendant on an imperial apotheosis are very fully described by
                    Herodian (lib. iv. c. 2) on occasion of the obsequies of Severus, which he
                    appears to have witnessed. The most significant was the dismission, at the
                    moment of kindling the funeral pyre, of an eagle which was supposed to bear the
                    emperor’s soul to heaven. Sharp-sighted persons had actually beheld the
                    ascension of Augustus (Suet., <hi rend="italic">August,</hi> c. 100), and of
                    Drusilla, sister of Caligula; the latter eyewitness took the public incredulity
                    exceedingly amiss (Seneca, <hi rend="italic">Apocolocyntosis.)</hi> The
                    ludicrous side of the deification of a bad or indifferent emperor could escape
                    no one, and is pungently illustrated by Seneca in the witty lampoon just quoted:
                    even here, however, it is laid down <hi rend="italic">thzΛ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >principes pietate et justitia dei fiunt.</hi> Representations of apotheoses
                    occur on several works of art; the most important are the apotheosis of Homer on
                    a relief in the Townley collection, and that of Augustus on a magnificent cameo
                    in the Louvre. The establishment of Christianity put an end to apotheosis as an
                    avowed belief and a public ceremony, although the principle on which it rested
                    is still conspicuous in the adoration and invocation of saints by the Latin,
                    Greek, and African Churches. The commemo ration of Auguste Comte by his
                    followers may be cited as another instance in point. The worship of Ali and his
                    sons by some Persian sects, and that of the Caliph Hakem by the Druses, are not
                    properly examples of apotheosis, being rendered to them not as deified mortals,
                    but as incarnations of the Deity. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. g.)</hi></p>
