                <p>THE beginnings of the British navy may be traced back to the long-continued
                    struggle of Alfred and his successors with Danish invaders and pirates. Alfred
                    has been called the first English admiral, as he was, it is supposed, the first
                    English sovereign who commanded his own fleet in battle; and it was still to
                    check these marauders, and protect the coasts of the kingdom, that William I.,
                    in 1066, established the Cinque Ports, and gave them certain privileges, on
                    condition of their furnishing 52 ships, with 24 men in each, for fifteen days,
                    in cases of emergency. We should not, perhaps, be far amiss in dating the period
                    of English naval architecture from the Conquest; but there is little to record
                    of the navy till the period of the French wars. In these very numerous fleets
                    were sometimes engaged. King John is said to have fitted out 500 ships in 1213
                    against Philip of France; and in 1293, in the reign of Edward I., a battle took
                    place in mid Channel where both the French and English fleets met in force, and
                    about 240 ships of the former were captured. In the reign of John a close
                    approach was made to a regular naval establishment, and encouragement given to
                    foreign commerce by a declaration of safe-conduct to all foreign merchants to
                    pass to or repass from England.</p>
                <p>There cannot be any doubt that the earlier fleets comprised many private ships
                    pressed into the king’s service. A fleet of Edward the Confessor in 1049
                    consisted partly of “king’s ships,” partly of “people’s ships.” In the Black
                    Book of the Admiralty (which is a collection of sea-laws and customs drawn up
                    for the use of the judge of the Court of Admiralty) it is provided that “in case
                    a man be indicted that he hath broken the arrest of his ship, arrested for the
                    king’s service, and be thereof convicted by twelve men, he shall lose his ship
                    unless he obtaineth pardon of the king or the high admiral.” Richard I. at
                    Grimsby expressly combated by an ordinance the notion that ships were not liable
                    to be pressed; and in a mandate of Sir Thomas Beaufort, admiral of England,
                    Ireland, and Aquitania, temp. Hen. IV., are to be found instructions to his
                    lieutenant of the North to arrest twenty-four vessels for service abroad, “upon
                    certain weighty matters.” Orders were sent at the same time to press mariners
                    for one of the king’s barges.</p>
                <p>In an action with the French fleet off the harbour of Sluys (1340), Edward III.
                    is said to have slain 30,000 of the enemy, and to have taken 200 great ships,
                    “in one of which only there were 400 dead bodies.” All writers <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n291/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0291-0280"/> agree in describing the battle as one of the most
                    sanguinary and desperate sea-fights ever known. The same monarch, at the siege
                    of Calais, is stated to have blockaded that port with 730 sail, having on board
                    14,956 mariners, 25 only of w hich were of the royal navy, bearing 419 mariners,
                    or about 17 men each.</p>
                <p>The earlier and middle parts of the reign of Edward III. were particularly famous
                    for the power of the English fleet, and for the dread which it inspired. After a
                    splendid victory over the Spanish fleet in 1350, the title of “king of the sea”
                    was bestowed on the sovereign. Towards the end of that reign, however, naval as
                    well as other affairs were neglected, the seas were left unguarded, the coasts
                    were insulted, and acts of piracy were committed in English waters which a few
                    years before had been impossible. Complaints were loud and frequent. The duke of
                    Lancaster, Edward’s brother, was charged with having misspent a sum of money
                    granted to him for the guardianship of the seas, and the anger of the Commons,
                    unable to vent itself upon him, expended itself in a successful impeachment of
                    some of the king’s ministers. In the next reign attempts were made to improve
                    matters; but, notwithstanding the levies from the Cinque Ports and other towns,
                    the naval force in 1378 was insufficient to keep even English waters free from
                    pirates, and it was due to the private exertions of John Philpot, a London
                    merchant, who fitted out a squadron at his own expense, that John Mercer, a
                    celebrated Scottish pirate, was captured and his career ended. Plymouth and
                    Hastings were burned, Winchelsea was attacked, and two descents were made, with
                    much damage, upon the Isle of Wight. In one of these descents the French
                    possessed themselves of most of the island, but were finally driven to their
                    ships by Sir Hugh Tyrrel, governor of Carisbrooke, and “a spur of incredible
                    sharpness.” Return expeditions were made to French and Spanish towns by the
                    English, who, however, acted rather in the privateer capacity of men who had to
                    take the law into their own hands than as authorized warriors of the English
                    king.</p>
                <p>Naval affairs improved under Henry IV., and the reign of Henry V. was most
                    glorious in maintaining the naval superiority over the fleets of France. From a
                    letter of this sovereign to his lord chancellor, dated 12 th August 1417,
                    discovered by Samuel Lysons among the records in the Tower, and of which the
                    following is a copy, it would appear that there was something like an
                    established royal navy in his reign, independently of the shipping furnished by
                    the Cinque Ports and the merchants, for the king’s own use, on occasion of any
                    particular expedition. The letter appears to have been written nine days after
                    the surrender of the castle of Touque, near Honfleur, in Normandy, whence it is
                    dated.</p>

                    “niefs, barges, and bally tigers,” some with three, and others two mariners
                    only. But history informs us that about this time Henry embarked an army of
                    25,000 men at Dover on board of 1500 sail of ships, two of which carried purple
                    sails, embroidered with the arms of England and France,—one styled the “King’s
                    Chamber,” the other his “Saloon,” as typical of his keeping his court at sea,
                    which he considered as a part of his dominions.</p>
                <p>The general orders for the admit ιl of a fleet, contained in the Black Book of
                    the Admiralty, lay it down that “the admirall ought by his office to elect and
                    order for the king’s person, if he be present, otherwise for his lieutenant, the
                    best and most able shipp of the kingdome, which shall be called the chamber of
                    the king or of his lieutenant; and if the king be present then the Comptroller
                    of his household is to make choice of some of the best shipps of the whole
                    ffleete (that is to say) one shipp for the Hall, another for the Wardrobe, the
                    third for the Larder, and the fourth for the Kitchen.” Froissart, writing of the
                    battle of L’Espagnols sur Mer, in 1350, speaks of a ship called “la Salle du
                    Roi, où tous ses hotels étoient.” It would appear from a very curious poem,<note

                    parliament roll (20th Henry VI., 1442) that an armed naval force, consisting
                    only of eight large ships, with smaller vessels to attend them, was to be
                    collected from the ports of London, Bristol, Dartmouth, Hull, Newcastle,
                    Winchelsea, Plymouth, Falmouth, Ac.; and, of course, the royal ships of 1417,
                    the names of which are. contained in the foregoing schedule, were then either
                    gone to decay or dispersed. We are not to judge of the size of the ships from
                    the few mariners appointed to each. These were merely the ship-keepers, or
                    harbourduty men, placed on permanent pay, to keep the ships in a condition fit
                    for sea when wanted.</p>
                <p>The classes of ships and vessels mentioned in the records of what may be called
                    the first period of the British navy are very numerous, varying with the use for
                    which they were designed. Thus there were “cogs,” or large, swift vessels,
                    sometimes of 250 tons, carrying 130 seamen besides archers and soldiers;
                    “barges,” or small cogs, which carried 60 to 80 men; “balingers,” or boats
                    resembling modern barges; “caraks,” large vessels, chiefly used in Continental
                    navies; “crayers,” transport <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n292/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0292-0281"/> vessels, seldom over 60 tons; “doggers and
                    lodeships,” fishing and pilot boats, with 30 men, which were occasionally
                    impressed into the king’s service; “fluves,” two-masted vessels, used for
                    conveyance of troops (Edward III. commanded the burgesses of Kingston-upon-Hull
                    to build him a “fluve”); “galleys” and “galiots”; “hoc-boats,” cargo or store
                    ships. There were also “lynes,” “persouers,” and “pikards,” or large boats.
                    “Pinnaces,” with 35 men, figured at Sluys, and at the battle of L’Espagnols sur
                    Mer in 1350; and in 1339 two “espinaces” were given to Sir Richard Talbot for
                    the defence of Southampton.</p>
                <p>It is very probable that, until English merchants engaged in the Mediterranean
                    trade, and the attention of the Government was turned, in the reign of Henry
                    VII. (about 1496), to imitate Portugal in making foreign discovery, under the
                    skilful seaman Sebastian Cabot, very little was added to the capacity or the
                    power of British ships of war. In his reign was built a ship called the “Great
                    Harry,” the first on record that deserved the name of a ship of war, if it was
                    not the first exclusively appropriated to the service of the state. This is the
                    ship which Camden called the “Henry Grace de Dieu,” but erroneously,—the vessel
                    so named not having been built till the reign of Henry VIII. The “Great Harry”
                    is stated to have cost £14,000; there is reason to suppose that she was renamed
                    the “Regent” on the accession of Henry VIII.</p>
                <p>We now come to that period in which England might be truly said to possess a
                    military marine. Some curious details have been preserved in the Pepysian
                    collection at Magdalene College, Cambridge, from which papers it appears that in
                    the thirteenth year of Henry VIII. the following constituted the royal navy

                    imperfect.</p></note> This ship, the better-known “Great Harry,” appears to have
                    been begun at Erith, in August or September 1512, to replace the “Regent,” which
                    was burned in the former month in action with the French fleet, when carrying
                    the flag of the lord high admiral. There is a drawing of the ship in the
                    Pepysian papers. From these papers it appears that she carried fourteen guns on
                    the lower deck, twelve on the main deck, eighteen on the quarter-deck and poop,
                    eighteen on the lofty forecastle, and ten in her stern-ports, making altogether
                    seventy-two guns. Her regular establishment of men is said to have consisted of
                    349 soldiers, 301 mariners, and 50 gunners, making altogether 700 men. The war
                    ships of this period were awkward to manoeuvre: on the appearance of the French
                    fleet at St Helens, the <hi rend="superscript"> ti</hi> Great Harry,” the first
                    ship built with two decks, had nearly been sunk; and the “Mary Rose,” of 600
                    tons, with 500 or 600 men on board, was actually sunk at Spithead, as Raleigh
                    informs us, in consequence of “a little sway in casting the ship about, her
                    ports being within 16 inches of the water.” On this occasion the fleets
                    cannonaded each other for two hours; and it is remarked as something
                    extraordinary that not less than three hundred cannon-shot were fired on both
                    sides in the course of this action. From the drawings still extant it is quite
                    surprising how the vessels could be trusted on the sea at all, their enormous
                    poops and forecastles making them appear loftier and more awkward than the large
                    Chinese junks, to which, indeed, they bear a strong resemblance.</p>
                <p>Henry VIII. may justly be said to have laid the foundation of the British navy as
                    a permanent or standing force, He established the dockyards at Deptford,
                    Woolwich, and Portsmouth; he appointed certain commissioners to superintend the
                    civil affairs of the navy, and settled the rank and pay of admirals,
                    vice-admirals, and inferior officers, thus creating a national navy, and raising
                    the officers to a separate and distinct profession. The principal officers of
                    the navy then were—the vice-admiral of England, master of the ordnance, surveyor
                    of the marine causes, treasurer, comptroller, general surveyor of the
                    victualling, clerk of the ships, and clerk of the stores. Each of these officers
                    had his particular duties, but they met at their office on Tower Hill once a
                    week, to consult, and make their reports to the lord high admiral. Henry also
                    established the fraternities or guilds of the Trinity House at Deptford, Hull,
                    and Newcastle for the improvement of navigation and the encouragement of
                    commerce, and built thé castles of Deal, Walmer, Sandgate, Hurst Castle,
                    &lt;fcc., for the protection of his fleet and of the coast.</p>
                <p>At the death of Henry VIII. in 1547, the royal navy consisted of about 50 ships
                    and vessels of different sizes, the former from 1000 to 150 tons, and the latter
                    down to 20 tons, making in the whole about 12,000 tons, and manned by about 8000
                    mariners, soldiers, gunners, &amp;c. Thus, as has been well said, “everything
                    was leading up to a time when the perils of the seas should claim all that was
                    most heroic in England’s most heroic age.” In the short reign of his son Edward
                    little alteration seems to have taken place in the state and condition of the
                    royal navy. But the regulations which had been made in the reign of his father
                    for the civil government of naval affairs were revised, arranged, and turned
                    into ordinances, which form the basis of all the subsequent instructions given
                    to the commissioners for the management of the civil affairs of the navy. In the
                    reign of Mary the tonnage of the navy was reduced to about 7000 tons; but her
                    lord high admiral nobly maintained the title assumed by England of Sovereign of
                    the Seas, by compelling Philip of Spain to strike his flag that was flying at
                    the main-top-mast head, though on his way to England to marry Queen Mary, by
                    firing a shot at the Spanish admiral. He also demanded that the whole fleet,
                    consisting of 160 sail, should strike their colours and lower their top-sails,
                    as a homage to the English flag, before he would permit his own squadron to
                    salute the Spanish monarch.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth not only increased the numerical force of the regular navy, but
                    established many wise regulations for its preservation, and for securing
                    adequate supplies of timber and other naval stores. She placed her naval
                    officers on a more respectable footing, and encouraged foreign trade and
                    geographical discovery, so that she acquired justly the title of the Restorer of
                    Naval Power, and Sovereign of the Northern Seas. The greatest naval force that
                    had till then been called together was that which was assembled to oppose the
                    Invincible Armada, and which, according to the notes of Pepys, consisted of 176
                    ships, with 14,992 men; but these were not all “Shippes Royall,” but consisted
                    largely of the contributions of the Cinque Ports and private persons. The number
                    actually belonging to the navy is stated by the commissioners of 1618 in their
                    report (several manuscript copies of which exist) to have been 34 ships of
                    12,190 tons, carrying 6225 men. Sir Edward Coke (4 Inst. 50) “thinks it matter
                    of boast that the royal navy of England then consisted of 33 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n293/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0293-0282"/> ships” (Blackstone). At the end of Elizabeth’s
                    reign, however, the navy had greatly increased, the list in 1603 consisting of
                    42 ships of various descriptions, amounting to 17,000 tons, and manned with 8346
                    men. Of these, two were of the burden of 1000 tons each, three of 900 tons, and
                    ten of from 600 to 800 tons.</p>
                <p>James I. was not inattentive to his navy. He warmly patronized Phineas Pett, to
                    whom we undoubtedly owe the first essential improvements in the form and
                    construction of ships. The cumbrous top-works were first got rid of under his
                    superintendence. “In my owne time,” says Raleigh, “the shape of our English
                    ships hath been greatly bettered; in extremity we carry our ordnance better than
                    we were wont; we have added crosse pillars in our royal! shippes, to strengthen
                    them; we have given longer floors to our shippes than in older times,” &amp;c.
                    In 1610 Pett laid down a ship named the “Prince Royal”; her burden was 1400
                    tons, her keel 114 feet, and she was armed with sixty-four pieces of great
                    ordnance, “beingin all respects,” says Stowe, “the greatest and goodliest ship
                    that was ever built in England.”</p>
                <p>The state of the navy at the king’s death is variously given by different
                    writers; but on this subject the memoranda left by Pepys are most likely to be
                    correct. From them we learn that in 1618 certain commissioners were appointed to
                    examine into the state of the navy, and by their report it appears there were
                    then only 39 ships and vessels, whose tonnage amounted to 14,700 tons: while in
                    1624, on the same authority, the number had decreased to 32 or 33, but the
                    tonnage increased to about 19,400 tons. The commissioners had, in fact,
                    recommended many of the small craft to be broken up or sold, and more ships of
                    the higher rates to be kept up.</p>
                <p>Charles I. added upwards of 20 sail to the navy, generally of the smaller kind;
                    but one of them, built by Pett, was of a description, both as to form and
                    dimensions, far superior to any that had yet been launched. This ship was the
                    celebrated “Sovereign of the Seas,” launched at Woolwich in 1637. The length of
                    her keel was 128 feet, the main breadth 48 feet, and the length from stem to
                    stern 232 feet. In the description of this ship by Thomas Heywood it is said
                    that she “bore five lanthorns, the biggest of which would hold ten persons
                    upright; had three flush-decks, a forecastle, half-deck, quarter-deck, and
                    round-house. Her lower tier had thirty ports for cannon and demi-cannon; middle
                    tier, thirty for culverins and demi-culverins; third tier, twenty-six for other
                    ordnance; forecastle, twelve; and two half-decks, thirteen or fourteen ports
                    more within board, for murthering pieces; besides ten pieces of chace ordnance
                    forward, and ten right aft, and many loopholes in the cabins for musquet-shot.
                    She had eleven anchors, one of 4400 lb weight. She was of the burden of 1637
                    tons.” It appears, however, that she was found, on trial, to be too high for a
                    good serviceable ship in all weathers, and was therefore cut down to a deck
                    less. After this she became an excellent ship, and was in almost all the great
                    actions with the Dutch; she was rebuilt in 1684, when the name was changed to
                    that of “Royal Sovereign,” and was about to be rebuilt a second time at Chatham
                    in 1696 when she was totally destroyed by fire. In this reign the ships of the
                    navy were first classed, or divided into six rates, the first being from 100 to
                    60 guns, the second from 54 to 36, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In 1642 the management of the navy was taken out of the king’s hands, and in 1648
                    Prince Rupert carried away twenty-five ships, none of which ever returned; and
                    such, indeed, was the reduced state of the establishment that at the beginning
                    of Cromwell’s government he had only fourteen ships of war of two decks, and
                    some of these carried only 40 guns; but, under the careful management of very
                    able men in different commissions which he appointed, such vigorous measures
                    were pursued that, in five years, though engaged within that time in war with
                    the greatest naval power in Europe, the fleet was increased to 150 sail (of
                    which more than a third part had two decks, and many had been captured from the
                    Dutch), while upwards of 20,000 seamen were employed in the navy. The military
                    marine was, indeed, raised by Cromwell to a height which it had never before
                    reached.</p>
                <p>Though Cromwell found the navy divided into six rates or classes, it was under
                    his government that these ratings were defined and established in the manner
                    nearly in which they were till the middle of the present century; and it may
                    also be remarked, that under his government were constructed a large number of
                    frigates, or vessels designed specially for speed and having a peculiar
                    sharpness of form. The first built in England was the “Constant Warwick.” “She
                    was built,” says Pepys, “in 1640, by Mr Peter Pett (son of Phineas), for a
                    privateer for the earl of Warwick, and was sold by him to the state. Mr Pett
                    took his model of this ship from a French frigate which he had seen in the
                    Thames.”</p>
                <p>We know comparatively little about ships’ armaments up to this period. It
                    appears, however, that they were furnished about the year 1337 with espringalds,
                    haubergeons, bacinets, bows, arrows, jacks, doublets, targets, pavises (or large
                    shields placed at the side, and serving the double purpose of protection against
                    the sea and the enemy), lances, and “firing barrels.” It also appears that as
                    early as 1338 cannon formed part of the armament of ships, and that about 1372
                    guns and gunpowder were commonly used. Among the stores belonging to the
                    “Christopher of the Tower” in June 1338 were three iron cannon with five
                    chambers, a hand gun, and three old stone bags, probably for shot. The “Mary of
                    the Tower” had an iron cannon with two chambers, and one of brass with one
                    chamber. The precise character and description of the earlier guns are difficult
                    to be found, but among the “crakys of war” mentioned as most used on board ship
                    are “cannon-paviors,” or stone-shot throwers, and “murtherers,” which were
                    smaller and threw any kind of shot. There were also in the first period of naval
                    history basilisks, port pieces, stock-fowlers, sakers, and bombards. The
                    last-named were large instruments of hammered iron, made of bars welded and
                    bound together with iron bands. They threw stone shot of 140 lb, and even of 195
                    lb weight. A battery of these erected on a slip of land at the naval battle of
                    Chioggia (1380), between the Venetians and the Genoese, did great damage. They
                    were loaded over night and fired in the morning—one discharge per diem being
                    considered enough for the gun, if not for the enemy. Froissart mentions a
                    bombard at the siege of Oudenarde by Philip van Artevelde, that “might be heard
                    five leagues off in the daytime, and ten at night. The report of it was so loud
                    that it seemed as if all the devils in hell had broken loose.” According to Lord
                    Herbert, brass ordnance were first cast in England in the year 1535. They had
                    various names, such as cannon, demi-cannon, culverins, demi-culverins, sakers,
                    mynions, falcons, falconets, &amp;c. What the calibre of each of these was is
                    not accurately known, but the cannon are supposed to have been about
                    60-pounders, the demi-cannon 32, culverins 18, falcons 2, mynions 4, sakers 5,
                    &amp;c. Many of these pieces of different calibres were mounted on the same
                    deck, which must have occasioned great confusion in action in finding for each
                    its proper shot.</p>
                <p>On the restoration of Charles II. the duke of York was immediately appointed lord
                    high admiral, and by his advice a committee was named to consider a plan,
                    proposed by himself, for the future regulation of the affairs of the navy, at
                    which the duke presided. By the advice and able assistance of Pepys as a
                    principal officer of the navy, great progress was speedily made in the
                    reparation and increase of the fleet. The duke remained lord high admiral till
                    1673, when, in consequence of the test required by parliament, to which he could
                    not submit, he resigned, and that office was in part put in commission, and the
                    rest retained by the king. Prince Rupert was put at the head of this commission,
                    and Pepys appointed secretary of the Admiralty. By his able and judicious
                    management there were in sea-pay, in the year 1679, and in excellent condition,
                    7 6 ships of the line, all furnished with stores for six months, 8 fire-ships
                    besides a numerous train of ketches, <pb break="no"

                    seamen; and also 30 new ships building, and a good supply of stores in the
                    dockyards. But this flourishing condition of the navy did not last long. In
                    consequence of the dissipation of the king, and his pecuniary difficulties, he
                    neglected the navy on account of the expenses; the duke was sent abroad, and
                    Pepys to the Tower. A new set of commissioners was appointed, without
                    experience, ability, or industry; and the consequence was, as stated by the
                    commissioners of revision, that “all the wise regulations formed during the
                    administration of the duke of York were neglected; and such supineness and waste
                    appear to have prevailed that, at the end of not more than five years, when he
                    was recalled to the office of lord high admiral, only 22 ships, none larger than
                    a fourth rate, with two fire-ships, were at sea; those in harbour were quite
                    unfit for service <hi rend="italic">; even</hi> the 30 new ships which he had
                    left building had been suffered to fall into a state of great decay, and hardly
                    any stores were found to remain in the dockyards.”</p>
                <p>The first act on the duke’s return was the reappointment of Pepys as secretary of
                    the Admiralty. In 1686, finding the principal officers unequal to the duties
                    required of them, he appointed a special commission to restore the navy to its
                    former strength and condition. Sir Anthony Deane, the most experienced of the
                    shipbuilders then in England, was joined with the commissioners. He is said to
                    have introduced important improvements in ships of the line, his model being the
                    “Superbe,” a French ship of 74 guns, from which he built the “Harwich” in 1664.
                    Others, however, are of opinion that no advance was made on the model of the
                    “Sovereign of the Seas” after she was cut down. The commissioners undertook, in
                    three years, to complete the repair of the fleet, and furnish the dockyards with
                    a proper supply of stores, on an estimate of £400,000 a year, to be issued in
                    weekly payments; and in two years and a half they finished their task to the
                    satisfaction of the king and the whole nation, 108 sail of the line being
                    repaired and under repair, besides smaller vessels. At the time of the king’s
                    abdication, the list of the navy amounted to 173 sail, of 101,892 tons, carrying
                    6930 guns and 42,000 seamen.</p>
                <p>The naval regulations were wisely left unaltered at the Revolution, and the
                    business of the Admiralty continued to be carried on for a short time, under the
                    immediate direction of King William, by Pepys, till the arrival of Admiral
                    Herbert and Captain Russell from the fleet, into whose hands, he says, “he
                    silently let it fall.” Upon the general principles of that system, thus
                    established with his aid by the duke of York, the civil government of the
                    British navy has been carried on ever since.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Up to this time merchantmen, hired and armed, but commanded
                    by officers of the navy, formed more or less a part of every fleet sent out.
                    Now, however, the navy became independent for fighting purposes, while the
                    development of commerce and colonial trade made the establishment of a system of
                    convoys and cruisers an absolute necessity.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the second year of William III. (1690), no less than 27 ships were ordered to
                    be built, of 60 and 80 guns each; and in 1697 the king, in his speech to
                    parliament, stated that the naval force of the kingdom was increased to nearly
                    double what he found it at his accession. It was now partly composed of various
                    classes of French ships which had been captured in the course of the war,
                    amounting in number to more than 60, and in guns to 2300,—the losses by storms
                    and captures being about half the tonnage and half the guns acquired. At the
                    commencement of William’s reign, the navy, as already stated, consisted of 173
                    ships, measuring 101,892 tons; at his death it had been extended to 272 ships,
                    measuring 159,020 tons, being an increase of more than one-half both in number
                    and in tonnage. The ships of the line numbered then 130, and this continued to
                    be the average number till the middle of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The accession of Queen Anne was immediately followed by a war with France and
                    Spain, and in the second year of her reign she had the misfortune to lose no
                    less than 13 of her ships by one of the most tremendous storms that was ever
                    known; but every energy was used to repair this national calamity. In the course
                    of this war there were taken or destroyed about 50 ships of war, mounting 3000
                    cannon; and about half that number were lost. At the death of the queen, in
                    1714, the list of the navy was reduced in number to 247 ships, measuring 167,219
                    tons, being an increase in tonnage of 8199 tons.</p>
                <p>George I. left the navy pretty nearly in the state in which he found it. At his
                    death, in 1727, the list consisted of 233 ships, measuring 170,862 tons, being a
                    decrease in number of 14, but an increase in tonnage of 3643 tons.</p>
                <p>George II. was engaged in a war with Spain in 1739, in consequence of which the
                    size of ships of the line ordered to be built was considerably enlarged. On the
                    restoration of peace in 1748 it was found that England’s naval strength had
                    prodigiously increased. The loss had been little or nothing, while the English
                    had taken and destroyed 20 French and 15 Spanish sail of the line, besides
                    smaller vessels. The war with France of 1756 added considerably to the list, so
                    that at the king’s decease in 1760 it consisted of 412 ships, measuring 321,104
                    tons.</p>
                <p>In the short war of 1762, George III. added no less than 20 sail of the line to
                    the navy. At the conclusion of the American war in 1782, the list of the navy
                    was increased to 600 sail; and at the signing of the preliminaries in 1783 it
                    amounted to 617 sail, measuring upwards of 500,000 tons, being an increase of
                    185 ships and 157,000 tons and upwards since the year 1762. At the peace of
                    Amiens the list of the fleet amounted to upwards of 700 sail, of which 144 were
                    of the line. The number taken from the enemy, or destroyed, amounted nearly to
                    600, of which 90 were of the line, including 50-gun ships, and upwards of 200
                    were frigates; the English loss amounted to about 60, of which 6 were of the
                    line and 12 frigates.</p>
                <p>The recommencement and long continuance of the revolutionary war, the glorious
                    successes of England in naval actions, and the protection required for the
                    extended commerce, of which, in fact, Britain might be said to enjoy a monopoly,
                    and for the security of the numerous colonies, contributed to raise the British
                    navy to a magnitude to which the accumulated navies of the whole world bore but
                    a small proportion. From 1808 to 1813 there were seldom less than from 100 to
                    106 sail of the line in commission, and from 130 to 160 frigates, and upwards of
                    200 sloops, besides bombs, gun-brigs, cutters, schooners, &amp;c., amounting in
                    the whole to about 500 sail of effective ships and vessels, to which may be
                    added 500 more in the ordinary, and as prison, hospital, and receiving ships,—
                    making at least 1000 pennants, and measuring from 800,000 to 900,000 tons. The
                    commissioners appointed to inquire into the state and condition of the woods,
                    forests, and land revenues of the crown state, in their report to parliament, in
                    the year 1792, that, “at the accession of his majesty (George III.) to the
                    throne, the tonnage of the royal navy was 321,104 tons, and at the end of the
                    year 1788 it had risen to no less than 413,467 tons.” In 1808 it had amounted to
                    the enormous total of 800,000 tons, having nearly doubled itself in twenty
                    years. It must not, however, be supposed that the effective navy consisted of
                    more than half this amount of tonnage.</p>

                <p>Since the conclusion of the war with France, it would appear that at least
                    one-half of the ships had been sold or broken up as unfit for service; and as,
                    by the list of the navy at the beginning of the year 1821, the number of ships
                    and vessels of every description, in commission, in ordinary, building,
                    repairing, and ordered to be built, had been reduced to 609 sail, we may take
                    the greatest extent of the tonnage at 500,000 tons; but the greater part, if not
                    the whole, of this tonnage was efficient, and in a state of progressive
                    efficiency.</p>
                <p>According to the printed list of the 1st January 1821, the 609 sail of ships and
                    vessels appear to be as under:—</p>

                <p>making a total of 432; to which have to be added 177 gun-brigs, cutters,
                    schooners, tenders, bombs, troop-ships, store-ships, yachts, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>In the year 1836 the total number of ships of war, including every description
                    mentioned in the above list, amounted to about 560 sail; of which 95 were ships
                    of the line in a state of efficiency for any service, or capable of being
                    speedily put into a fit state for sea; and many of them were of a very superior
                    class to any employed in the war. In 1846 there were 671 ships, including every
                    description; and in 1857 there were on the list of the royal navy 735 ships,
                    exclusive of those appropriated to harbour service, and of the coastguard
                    cruisers, making a grand total of 888 ships and vessels of all classes.</p>
                <p>Soon after the commencement of Queen Victoria’s reign steam began to assert its
                    superiority over sail-power for the propulsion of ships of war. It has now to a
                    great extent usurped the place of manual labour also in ships, and it has been
                    the main cause of the revolution which has been effected in their type.</p>
                <p>The paddle-wheel was first adopted as the means of utilizing the power of steam
                    for propulsion. The first ship of war of any importance fitted with the paddle
                    was the 46-gun frigate “Penelope.” In 1843 she was cut in two, lengthened, and
                    furnished with engines of 650 horse-power. A number of ships were also built
                    expressly for the paddle, of which class the “Terrible,” a powerful,
                    frigate-built ship of 21 guns and 800 horse-power, may be taken as a type. The
                    “Valorous” is almost the only remaining example of it in 1883, and she has been
                    relegated to dockyard service.</p>
                <p>The success of the screw, however, as a means of propulsion soon made it evident
                    that this must be the system of the future for warships. By its use the whole
                    motive power could be protected by being placed below the water-line. It
                    interfered much less than the paddle with the efficiency and handiness of the
                    vessel under sail alone, and it enabled ships to be kept generally under sail.
                    Great importance was attached to this, as the handling of a ship under sail was
                    justly thought an invaluable means of training both officers and men in ready
                    resource, prompt action, and self-reliance. For this reason masts and sails have
                    been retained long after they were admitted to be detrimental to the fighting
                    qualities of battle ships.</p>
                <p>The screw was therefore eagerly adopted, and rapid progress was made in the
                    conversion of ships into screw steamers,—some being cut in two and lengthened,
                    others being razeed or having decks removed, while new ships were building, so
                    that the Russian war, which broke out in 1854, found Great Britain in possession
                    of a powerful steam fleet. Of this fleet the three-decker “Duke of Wellington,”
                    of 700 horse-power (nominal) and 131 guns, the two-decker “Agamemnon,” of 600
                    horse-power (nominal) and 91 guns, and the frigate “Shannon,” of 600 horse-power
                    (nominal) and 51 guns, may be taken as the finest examples; a powerful flotilla
                    of steam gunboats was built for the occasion. Henceforth ships propelled only by
                    sail were obsolete for war purposes.</p>
                <p>In this war mechanical mines or torpedoes were used by the Russians for the
                    defence of their harbours, but with not much effect.</p>
                <p>The advance of gunnery, and the disastrous effect of explosive shells, which were
                    new weapons since the great naval wars of forty years before, operated to the
                    disadvantage of ships with wooden walls. The fleets were unable to do much more
                    than blockade, and it became necessary to furnish means by which they might also
                    attack.</p>
                <p>The French were the first to apply in a practical shape the idea (which appears
                    to have originated in the United States) of reviving the use of armour, and
                    placing it on the sides of ships. They constructed five floating batteries clad
                    with 4∣ inches of iron, on an oak backing 8 inches thick. Of these the first was
                    the “Tonnante,” mounting 16 guns. She was launched at Brest in March 1855, and
                    was quickly followed by the others. Three of them took part in the bombardment
                    of Kinburn in the Black Sea on the 17th October following.</p>
                <p>The British Admiralty at once put in hand similar vessels, and with such
                    diligence that the “Erebus” and “Terror” arrived at Kinburn on the 24th October.
                    They were hastily constructed for work in shallow water, and were difficult to
                    manage; but the results were sufficiently satisfactory to induce the French to
                    convert a wooden line-of-battle ship on the stocks into a frigate armoured all
                    over with 4f inches of iron. She was launched at Toulon under the name of “La
                    Gloire” in November 1859, andλvas of 5600 tons displacement and 800 horse-power
                    (nominal).</p>
                <p>In December 1858 a committee was appointed under the administration of Lord
                    Derby, because the attention of the cabinet had been drawn to the very serious
                    increase which had taken place of late years in the navy estimates, while, at
                    the same time, it was represented that the naval force of the country was far
                    inferior to what it ought to be with reference to that of other powers, and
                    especially of France, and that increased efforts and increased expenditure were
                    imperatively called for to place it on a proper footing. One of the main causes
                    assigned for a prospective increase was the comparative state of preparation of
                    France, in respect of powerful screw steamers, and the expenditure which had
                    taken place and was still going on in her dockyards.</p>
                <p>The committee, in its report, January 6, 1859, directed its remarks principally
                    to the increase in the estimates of 1858 as compared with those of 1852, and
                    omitted the disturbed period between those dates. They say that in 1852 the navy
                    estimates were revised and increased, and measures taken to supply what were
                    supposed to be deficiencies in former years, and to adapt the navy to the
                    altered state of things occasioned by the application of the screw to ships of
                    war. They remark that no one probably in the year 1852 could have anticipated
                    the wonderful progress which a few years had exhibited, superseding practically
                    the use of sailing vessels in the navy, and introducing the use of screw
                    steamers of immense size and power, and involving a more than commensurate
                    additional expense. The total amounts voted were—in 1852, £5,835,588, and in
                    1858, £8,851,371. They say, at the outbreak of the French revolutionary war
                    England possessed 145 sail of the line, France 77. These comparative numbers
                    were reduced in 1850 to—England 86, and France 45. “At this latter period the
                    effective strength of the two navies in line-of-battle ships exclusively, and
                    almost exclusively in frigates, consisted of sailing vessels; but, the French
                    having subsequently decided on, and nearly carried out, the conversion of all
                    their sailing ships that were fit for it into steamships, as sailing vessels
                    could not be opposed to steamships with any chance of success, the latter must
                    now be considered as the only ships really effective for the purposes of war,
                    and the following is at present the relative strength of the two navies in steam
                    line-of-battle ships and frigates, including ships building and
                    converting”:—</p>

                <p>It is curious to observe what happened as a consequence of this report and the
                    circumstances of the time. The committee did not recommend building an
                    iron-plated line-of-battle ship or frigate, although the “Warrior” was commenced
                    a few months later. They recommended converting 19 sailing ships of the line
                    into steamships of the line and steam frigates. Two years later there were 67
                    tvooden steamships of war building and converting for the royal navy, and navy
                    estimates had gone up to twelve millions and a half; unhappily all these wooden
                    line-of-battle ships and frigates were soon found to be no real addition to the
                    force of the navy, and many of them were not completed. The four iron-plated
                    ships appearing so ominously at the foot of the French list had completely
                    changed the situation.</p>
                <p>At this date iron had been gradually encroaching on wood as a material for the
                    hulls of British merchant ships. It was thought at one time to be unsuitable for
                    war-ships on account of the irregular holes made by shot passing through it, and
                    the difficulty of plugging them, but the use of armour tended to prevent shot,
                    or at least shell, from passing through. Iron presented also the advantage of
                    permitting the use of water-tight bulkheads. (The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n296/mode/1up"

                    within the last few years by the use of double bottoms and of longitudinal as
                    well as transverse bulkheads, and has added much to, the security of ships
                    against perils of the sea or acts of the queen’s enemies.) By the use of iron
                    the country was, moreover, relieved from all anxiety on the score of the supply
                    of timber of suitable dimensions and quality.</p>
                <p>The Admiralty therefore determined to build their first sea-going ironclad ship,
                    the “Warrior,” of iron, and the decision has been amply justified by the event.
                    Her displacement was 9200 tons, and the indicated horse-power 5470. The central
                    part of the ship was protected by 4⅛-inch armour from the upper deck to 5 feet
                    below the water-line,—the main deck battery being enclosed at its foremost and
                    after ends by armoured transverse bulkheads. She cost, including engines,
                    £357,000, and was able to withstand the fire, at 200 yards, of the heaviest gun
                    of the day, the 68- ρounder of 95 cwts. Her own armament consisted of thirty-six
                    of these guns. She was similar in appearance to the frigates of her day, on a
                    large scale. She was launched in December 1860.</p>
                <p>Much discussion ensued as to the relative merits of the rival ships ‘ ‘ La
                    Gloire” and ‘ ‘ Warrior.” The latter was the faster ship, but her great length
                    (380 feet between perpendiculars) had made it desirable to leave 85 feet at each
                    end entirely unprotected, and, as she had only a single propeller, the steering
                    gear was necessarily by this arrangement exposed to shot. Her length also
                    limited her power of manoeuvring.</p>
                <p>In the meantime the “Black Prince,” a sister ship, had been built; the “Defence”
                    and “Resistance” soon followed on a smaller scale. In 1861 eleven ironclads were
                    ordered; five of them were converted from λvooden ships on the stocks, and these
                    no longer appear in the <hi rend="italic">Navy List.</hi> The “Hector’’and
                    “Valiant” followed the “Warrior,” but the armour on the main deck extended
                    further. In the “Achilles” the battery remained as in the “Warrior,” but the
                    armour was extended as a belt, at the suggestion of Mr Reed, all round the
                    water-line. The “Minotaur,” “Agincourt,” and “Northumberland” were armoured from
                    end to end, the thickness being increased to 5⅛ inches. This additional armour,
                    with the desired fineness of form, involved a length of 400 feet, ami a
                    displacement of 10,690 tons. They had five masts. Like the “Warrior” they were
                    unhandy, and were thought liable to fall a prey to smaller and nimbler
                    antagonists. The belt type of the “Achilles” has survived except where it has
                    been replaced by submerged armoured decks, as in the “Shannon,” “Nelson,”
                    “Inflexible,” and following ships.</p>
                <p>During this time the comparative impotence of artillery had suggested recourse to
                    a weapon of the galleys of the Middle Ages. The ram was revived, the French
                    again setting the example. England followed, without however at first making it
                    so prominent a feature as the French. The weapon has since become general, or at
                    least the bows are strengthened to stand the shock of ramming.</p>
                <p>After the Russian war torpedoes and submarine mines and counter-mines, mechanical
                    and electrical, attracted much attention. Schools were established for the
                    instruction of officers and men in their use. For the British navy, the “Vernon”
                    was set apart for this purpose. In 1871 the secret of the celebrated Whitehead
                    fish torpedo was purchased by the Admiralty. It has since been acquired by
                    nearly all foreign nations. It was designed to attack ships below water, since
                    their batteries were deemed practically invulnerable. At first it was only
                    arranged to project the torpedoes from a submerged tube in the line of keel
                    ahead, but it was found that they could be effectively projected from the
                    broadside above water, and this plan has been extensively adopted. The Whitehead
                    torpedo is projected by means of an impulse of compressed air or steam, and is
                    propelled through the water by means of a screw and pair of engines actuated by
                    compressed air, carried within it. The head carries the explosive, which is
                    fired on contact, and a secret chamber contains the mechanism regulating the
                    depth below the surface at which it is to travel. It now forms part of the
                    armament of most war-ships. A torpedo invented by Captain Harvey, R.N., was in
                    use for some years till superseded by the λVhitehead. It was towed on the
                    broadside or quarter.</p>
                <p>Fast screw torpedo boats to use the Whitehead or the spar torpedo were introduced
                    by Mr Thornycroft of Chiswick, and they were at once acquired or copied by all
                    foreign powers.</p>
                <p>The superiority of the defence due to armour was short-lived. Apart from the
                    introduction of new weapons for attack, the artillery continued to advance in
                    power and weight.</p>
                <p>With the rivalry between guns and armour sprang up designs for the best mode of
                    defence combined with the most powerful means of attack. Captain Coles advocated
                    for masted ships the turret system, and Mr Reed (now Sir Edward Reed) the
                    broadside system, each striving to give the utmost protection armouf could
                    afford to the battery and other vital parts, whilst enabling the largest guns to
                    be worked safely under these defences. The broadside system armoured the battery
                    and the water-line, whilst the sides and upper portions of the ships remained
                    much as in the older frigates. The turret aimed at lower sides as offering less
                    target to the enemy, whilst a deadly fighting power had all-round sway from
                    behind armoured cover. In 1862 the “Enterprise,” “Favourite,” and “Research”
                    were adapted to Mr Reed’s principle,—the belt and battery,—upon which also, with
                    the addition of indented ports at the corners of the battery to give a wider
                    range of fire, were built the “Pallas,” “Penelope,” “Bellérophon,” and
                    “Hercules.” In the “Sultan” an upper deck battery was added with four guns. On
                    the “Sultan” pattern the “Audacious” and several other vessels were built. As
                    the guns increased in size, the batteries decreased and the guns became fewer,
                    but the belt remained.</p>
                <p>In 1862 also the first turret ship was produced in the shape of the “Royal
                    Sovereign,” a three-decker cut down and converted; the “Prince Albert,” built of
                    iron, followed. Both these ships were without sail-power, and calculated for
                    coast defence only.</p>
                <p>The “Monarch,” ordered in 1865, was designed as a sea-going rigged turret ship,
                    having 7-inch armour, a free-board of 14 feet, and an armament of four 25-ton
                    guns in two turrets plated with 10- and 8-inch armour. Then came the “Captain
                    ”—a ship designed by Captain Coles and Messrs Laird in rivalry of the “Monarch,”
                    and built by Messrs Laird at Birkenhead in 1869. She was intended to combine the
                    low freeboard of the “Royal Sovereign” with the qualities of a sailing frigate;
                    and for a time she was thought to give promise of such a combination. The
                    calamity of her capsizing, on the night of the 6th of September 1870, with 500
                    men, of whom only 18 were saved, will not be forgotten while the annals of the
                    navy are preserved.</p>
                <p>At this date (1870) a sea-going mastless turret ship type had been devised under
                    the administration of Mr Childers, and there were three such ships building, the
                    “Devastation,” “Thunderer,” and “Fury,” designed by Mr Reed for service as
                    battle ships at sea. They were, after the loss of the “Captain,” strongly
                    condemned by anticipation by most eminent naval men. But their design has since
                    been fully approved by experience.</p>
                <p>The important questions arising out of these changes in types of ships, and
                    especially as to the “Devastation” class, were discussed in 1871 by a very
                    distinguished committee, knou <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> n as the Committee
                    on Designs. They said in their report :—</p>
                <p>“A perfect ship of war is a desideratum which lias never yet been attained, and
                    is now further than ever removed from our reach. Any near approach to perfection
                    in one direction inevitably brings with it disadvantages in another. From the
                    time when ships of war first carried artillery, and were thus converted from
                    mere vehicles for the transport of armed men into engines of war, naval
                    architects have been compelled, in designing them, to content themselves with a
                    more or less satisfactory compromise. The difficulty, always great, of bringing
                    into harmony the conflicting features which are desirable in a ship of war was
                    much increased by the adoption of steam-power throughout the navy; the form of
                    hull which was thought to be requisite for obtaining the best results under
                    steam alone being very different from that most suitable for sailing. When to
                    this was added the still more serious embarrassment arising from the
                    introduction of armour-plating, the problem presented to naval architects became
                    one of extreme difficulty and complexity.</p>
                <p>“For some time, indeed, after the necessity of using armour-plating had been
                    recognized, but before the penetrative power of artillery had reached its
                    present stage of development, the question how to unite in one ship the power of
                    sailing, steaming, and carrying both heavy guns and armour, although difficult,
                    did not appear to be insoluble, and was met with remarkable ability, and a very
                    large measure of success, by the constructive department of the navy. In the
                    meantime, however, a rapid progressive increase in the power of artillery led to
                    a corresponding augmentation in the thickness and weight of the armour borne by
                    ships, until the point had been reached at which it became impossible to combine
                    in one vessel all the qualities which it is desirable a ship of war should
                    possess, consistently with the attainment of a very high degree of efficiency in
                    any of the more important of them.</p>
                <p>“The necessity, in some cases at least, of altogether sacrificing some one
                    desirable feature, in order that another may be secured in a higher degree than
                    would otherwise be possible, was recognized by their lordships when they adopted
                    the design of the ‘ Devastation ’ class, in which the power of sailing was
                    entirely given up in favour of that of carrying thick armour and very powerful
                    guns, of moving under steam at a fair although not very high speed, and,
                    finally, of carrying a sufficient quantity of coal to admit of voyages across
                    the Atlantic being made without the aid of sails. In the ‘ Inconstant ’ class a
                    compromise of a similar character, but in a different direction, had previously
                    been sanctioned, the protection of armour being altogether abandoned in order to
                    secure very high speed under steam, combined with as efficient sail-power as
                    could be attained without interference with the essential feature of great speed
                    under steam alone. Each of these types possesses valuable features which are
                    totally wanting in the other. Each in our opinion meets a part of the
                    requirements of modern warfare, and must (subject to modification and
                    improvement) continue to be represented in the British navy.” ....</p>
                <p>“After making every allowance for the disadvantages that attend the use of an
                    enormous dead weight of very costly armour, which after all is not absolutely
                    impenetrable to certain special guns, we cannot lose sight of the indisputable
                    fact that in an action between an armour-clad and an unarmoured ship (assuming
                    that they carry guns of equal power) the former has, and must have, an immense
                    advantage in being able to penetrate the sides of her adversary at a distance at
                    which she is herself impenetrable, and, further, in being able to use with
                    effect those most destructive projectiles <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> common
                    ’ shells, which would fall harmless from her own armoured sides. Even assuming
                    that absolute impenetrability to shot proves to be unattainable, it is still our
                    opinion that the time has not come to throw off armour altogether, but that it
                    is necessary that the first ranks of our ships of war should continue to carry
                    armour of as great resisting power as possible.</p>
                <p>“Before quitting this part of our subject, we desire to remark that, although, as
                    before pointed out, there are serious difficulties in the way of increasing to
                    any very material extent the thickness of armour applied in the usual manner to
                    sea-going ships, viz., in the form of a complete belt round the ship, from stem
                    to stern, at the water-line, besides local protection for guns, men, Ac., it is
                    not <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n297/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0297-0286"/> by any means certain that some method may not be
                    devised of securing the requisite reserve of buoyancy by other means than
                    armour-plating. Were this accomplished, the area of the armour might be
                    diminished, and its thickness increased in a corresponding degree. The ship
                    would then comprise a very strongly plated central citadel, surrounded and
                    supported by an unaπnoured raft constructed on a cellular system, or containing
                    some buoyant substance such as cork, which, without offering any material
                    resistance to the passage of projectiles, would not be deprived of its buoyancy
                    by penetration.” ....</p>
                <p>“At present we find ourselves compelled to regard the attainment of a very high
                    degree of offensive and defensive power united with real efficiency under sail
                    as an insoluble problem; and we believe that our transmarine possessions, and
                    other important interests in distant parts of the world, will be more
                    efficiently protected by the establishment, where requisite, of centres of naval
                    power, from which vessels of the ’ Devastation ’ class may operate, than by
                    relying upon cruising ships of such limited fighting power as the ‘Monarch.’ We
                    think, however, that a class of vessel in many respects resembling the ‘
                    Monarch,’ although much smaller and less costly, ought to form part of the
                    British navy."</p>
                <p>In 1873 Italy was contemplating the construction of the “Duilio” and “Dandolo,”
                    large turret ships of the “Devastation” type, but intended to mount four very
                    heavy guns which were being constructed by Sir William Armstrong &amp; Co., to
                    be protected by armour 22 inches in thickness. It was necessary that England
                    should not be behind, and the “Inflexible” was laid down. She was to carry four
                    60-ton guns in two revolving turrets, similar to the “Devastation,” except that,
                    in order to obtain right-ahead fire of all four guns, and to meet the objections
                    raised by naval officers and in parliament against the lowness of the upper deck
                    of the “Devastation” class, the turrets were placed “en échelon,” the foremost
                    turret on the port side and the after one on the starboard side, and a
                    superstructure was erected between them along the centre of the ship. The belt
                    also beyond the citadel was omitted, and a submerged armour deck, of 3 inches in
                    thickness, replaced it at the ends. This deck descended forward and helped to
                    strengthen the ram. The armour on the sides was to be 24 inches; before the ship
                    was completed, however, compound armour had been introduced, which allowed the
                    thickness on the turrets to be reduced to 16 inches. The total weight of armour
                    was 3155 tons. To enable this great weight to be carried, to provide stability
                    when injured, and to allow all the guns to fire in line of keel, the breadth,
                    which had not before exceeded 60 feet in sea-going ships of war, was increased
                    to 75 feet, the utmost which existing docks allowed. The length was 320 feet,
                    and the displacement reached 11,880 tons. The horse-power was 8000, and this
                    gave her, after she was launched in 1876, a speed of 14∣ knots, and when fully
                    equipped at Malta 13’87 knots. She is rigged as a brig. This is, however, only
                    an arrangement for peace time. In consequence of an important question having
                    been raised in the press and in parliament as to her stability in the event of
                    the unarmoured ends being badly damaged in action, a committee was appointed,
                    who reported that ‘ ‘ it cannot be said that the armoured citadel is
                    invulnerable, or that the unarmoured ends are indestructible, although the
                    character of the risk they run is different. But in our opinion the unprotected
                    ends are as well able as tlιe armoured citadel to bear the part assigned to them
                    in encountering the various risks of naval warfare, and therefore we consider
                    that a just balance has been maintained in the design, so that out of a given
                    set of conditions a good result has been obtained.”</p>
                <p>It was subsequently laid down in parliament, by the responsible minister, as a
                    guiding principle in such questions, that in a ship of war there should be the
                    greatest possible offensive power, and the defensive arrangements should be such
                    as to ensure her as far as possible, and in equal degrees, against all the
                    various modes in which she may be disabled or destroyed. From this it would
                    follow that it should not be in the power of the enemy to disable the ship by
                    one single blow delivered by any means at his command, if this could have been
                    prevented by causing other defences, where he has not this power, to surrender a
                    portion of their strength to succour the weak part.</p>
                <p>Amplifying this principle, it may be said that there should be defence for the
                    propelling power, for the steering power, and for the floating power against the
                    gun, the ram, and the torpedo. To a very large extent the defence against the
                    two last named must rest with the officer in command; but to resist them he must
                    retain command of speed and steering gear. He therefore requires that these and
                    his floating power should be equally defended against the gun, which he cannot
                    avoid. The avoidable weapons, the ram and the torpedo, are provided against in
                    all ships, even in the “Inflexible,” far less than is the unavoidable weapon,
                    the gun. The equality of defensive power in view of all three weapons is
                    obtained by reckoning as part of the defence against the ram and the torpedo the
                    skill and vigilance of the seaman.</p>
                <p>The “Ajax” and “Agamemnon” were laid down in the year the “Inflexible” was
                    launched (1876). They are of the same type but smaller, carrying only 38-ton
                    guns. Of this type also are the “Colossus” and “Edinburgh,” commenced in 1879,
                    and now (1883) approaching completion. They are the same length as the
                    “Inflexible,” but 7 feet narrower. As they are of later date than the “Iris”
                    (the first war-vessel built entirely of steel), steel is employed almost
                    entirely in their construction, and they have steel-faced armour. They are to be
                    armed with 43-ton breechloading guns in the turrets, and four 6-inch 4-ton guns
                    on the superstructure. The “Conqueror” is another steel ship, designed
                    especially as a ram, having one turret for two 43-ton guns, and four 6-inch guns
                    unprotected by armour.</p>
                <p>The “Collingwood,” commenced in 1880, has a different arrangement. In the
                    endeavour to increase the protection of the vital parts, and at the same time to
                    increase the offensive power without going into extravagant dimensions, it was
                    inevitable that the space to be covered should be reduced, and the armour
                    concentrated. The guns being large, it was thought they would not suffer by
                    being mounted “en barbette,” the loading being still done under cover. By these
                    means the revolving turrets were got rid of, and the citadel was no longer
                    required to protect the loading apparatus. By placing the barbette towers some
                    distance apart it became possible to mount several broadside guns, not indeed
                    protected from the front, but sheltered from raking fire by an armoured screen
                    extending from the barbette towers to the ship’s sides. This then is the design
                    of the “Collingwood” class. The central belt, which rises but little above the
                    water, has 18-inch compound armour, the barbette towers 12-inch, and the screen
                    6-inch. Communication is maintained by means of armoured vertical hollow
                    cylinders between the towers and the protected part of the ship below, whence
                    the supply of ammunition is derived. She will mount four 43-ton guns in the
                    towers, six 4-ton guns in the broadside, and numerous lighter guns. The ‘ ‘
                    Rodney,” “Howe,” “Camperdown,” “Anson,” and “Benbow” are similar to the
                    “Collingwood,” but they will carry 63-ton guns instead of 43-ton. Possibly the
                    “Benbow” may have two exceeding 100 tons instead of the four 63-ton guns.</p>
                <p>The cruising ironclads have also continued to advance. In 1873 the “Alexandra”
                    was commenced, of the “Sultan” type. In this vessel four poλverful guns in the
                    central batteries fire in line of keel ahead, and two astern. She has thicker
                    armour than the “Sultan,” and a bulkhead was placed across the main battery,
                    cutting off the two foremost guns from the rest. In the same year the ‘ ‘
                    Temeraire” was commenced. She differed from the “Alexandra” in having barbette
                    towers forward and aft, instead of the upper deck battery, the 25-ton guns
                    mounted in them being made to descend, on being fired within the tower, for
                    loading. The towers communicated with the protected part below by means of
                    hollow armoured cylinders. She fires three heavy guns from her armoured
                    batteries in line of keel ahead. Then came the “Shannon,” a much smaller vessel,
                    in which the water-line is protected by an armour belt to within 60 feet of the
                    stem, whence a submerged armour deck extends forward; a bulkhead rises from the
                    same point, which covers two guns firing ahead. The remainder of the guns are
                    unprotected, except from right-ahead fire. She was designed for an armoured
                    cruiser, capable of engaging a second-class ironclad. The “Nelson” and
                    “Northampton” followed, but they have central belts and armoured decks at each
                    end, and armour-covered guns for stern as well as bow fire, with eight broadside
                    guns between.</p>
                <p>In 1878, when Russia was threatening Constantinople, three ships then building in
                    England were bought from the Ottoman Government,—the “Belleisle” and “Orion,”
                    belted ships with a central battery and a gun at each of the corners, and the
                    “Superb,” broadside ironclad. At the same time the “Neptune,” a masted turret
                    ship like the “Monarch,” building for Brazil, was bought.</p>
                <p>The “Impérieuse” and “Warspite,” now building, of steel, are the latest type of
                    ironclad cruisers. They are like the “Nelson,” but with barbette towers of the
                    French type forward and aft and amidships instead of the partial battery.</p>
                <p>Recent ships are furnished with every appliance that modern science can devise to
                    augment their efficiency and power. The turrets and the turn-tables of the
                    barbette ships are moved by hydraulic power; the guns are loaded and worked by
                    the same power, and are fired by electricity if desired. Electricity is used to
                    light the batteries and the ship generally, the old fighting lanthorn, or indeed
                    any other, being extinguished by the shock of discharge of modern artillery. The
                    capstan, the steerage of the ship, the gun, the ram and torpedo, the pumps and
                    ventilation, and electric light all require machinery in every direction, so
                    that the ship has become a factory. A large proportion of the crew are relegated
                    to the stokeholds, and but little is left that recalls the war-ship of our
                    fathers.</p>
                <p>The “Polyphemus” is the only other vessel to be here mentioned. She is hardly an
                    ironclad; she comes under the head of special ships, and is described in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Navy List</hi> as a double screw torpedo-ram of 2640 tons and 5500
                    horse-power. Her shape is cylindro-conical, of steel—the part above water being
                    covered with 3 inches of steel. She is intended for ramming and to use the
                    Whitehead torpedo. Her only other armament is the machine gun. These guns are
                    mounted in revolving towers.</p>
                <p>In this ship the first attempt was made in a sea-going vessel to use the
                    locomotive boiler (working with fresh water) with closed stokeholes and forced
                    draught. Mr Thornycroft and other torpedo-boat builders had used one such boiler
                    in boats with great success. As its weight was very considerably less than the
                    ordinary type of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n298/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0298-0287"/> boiler, the experiment seemed to be justified.
                    Great difficulties were, however, found to attend the use of such boilers in
                    numbers sufficient for a sea-going vessel, and while the experiments were in
                    progress it was ascertained that, by using closed stokeholes and forced draught,
                    the ordinary cylindrical marine boiler using salt water could be made as
                    economical of weight as the locomotive type. The ordinary practice up to this
                    date had required a total weight of machinery of about 4 cwt. for each indicated
                    horse-power in a sea-going ship. The employment of forced draught, and
                    concurrent improvements in machinery, made it possible to get a horse-power in
                    such ships with not more than from 2 to 2∣ cwt. total weight of engines and
                    boilers, including the water in boilers and condensers. The locomotive boilers
                    have therefore been given up in this ship.</p>
                <p>The following extract (with slight variations and additions) from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Statesman’s Year-Book,</hi> 1883, gives a fair idea of the present
                    position and strength of the British ironclad fleet :—</p>
                <p>“The most important division of the navy, the ironclad fleet of war, consisted at
                    the end of 1882 of 74 ships afloat and building, of which number 55 were afloat
                    and described as efficient for sea or for coast defence, while 3 were not
                    strictly British, being built solely for the defence of the colonies, 6 were on
                    the stocks, and 10 had become inefficient for naval warfare. The following is a
                    tabulated list of the ‘ so-called ’ efficient ironclads, and of the ironclads
                    still on the stocks, divided into five classes according to the strength of
                    armour and armament and mode of construction.<note anchored="true"

                <p>There are three other 18-ton turret ships of the fourth class, viz., the
                    “Cerberus,” belonging to the Victorian Government, and stationed at Melbourne,
                    and the “Abyssinia” and “Magdala,” belonging to the Indian Government, and
                    stationed at Bombay.</p>
                <p>From the experience of the American civil war and the cruise of the “Alabama” was
                    born the modern type of cruiser, the object of these being to overtake and
                    capture the cruisers of the enemy and to destroy his commerce. It is not
                    supposed that they would be charged with a convoy.</p>
                <p>The “Inconstant,” commenced in 1866, was the first of this class. With a view to
                    retain the advantages of copper sheathing in combination with the iron
                    construction which was necessary in so long a ship, she was built of iron, of
                    5782 tons displacement, cased with λvood in two thicknesses, and coppered. She
                    was heavily armed, and attained a speed of 16 knots at full power. Her coal
                    supply would last two and a quarter days at this speed, but it sufficed without
                    the use of sail for forty-one days at 5 knots an hour. The “Active” and “Volage”
                    were laid down at the same time on a reduced scale, and their speed was 15
                    knots. The “Shah” and “Raleigh,” commenced in 1870, were of the same type as the
                    ‘ ‘ Inconstant,” while the ‘ ‘ Boadicea,” ‘ ‘ Bacchante,” and ‘ ‘Euryalus” were
                    of intermediate type, 4140 tons displacement. They were all built of iron and
                    cased with wood and sheathed.</p>
                <p>The “Iris” was commenced in 1875. She is remarkable as the first war vessel
                    constructed entirely of steel. She was intended for an armed despatch vessel,
                    and in order to obtain the highest speed it was imperative to use the lightest,
                    or, in other words, the strongest, material in her construction. There was at
                    this time, moreover, a great difficulty in getting uniformly good iron even at
                    extravagant prices. On these grounds a mild steel was employed, which enabled
                    her designers to put 7700 horse-power into a hull with a load displacement of
                    only 3730 tons, and to attain the speed of 18'572 knots, with a length of only
                    300 feet. The sister ship, the “Mercury,” did even more, realizing 18'876 knots,
                    or nearly 22 miles an hour.</p>
                <p>The “Comus” was the first of nine vessels built in 1879, and called the C. class
                    from the initial letter of their names. They have iron or steel bottoms, cased
                    with wood, and iron or steel frames and internal fittings. The engines and
                    boilers are protected by a 1⅜- inch steel deck over them, as well as by the coal
                    as much as possible. They are smaller than the “Active” class, and are intended
                    for foreign service. They are variously armed; the “Canada” carries ten 6-inch
                    guns on the broadside. The two foremost ones are mounted on central pivot
                    carriages on sponsons or projections from the side. By this method they each
                    cover half the horizon. The “Calliope” and “Calypso <hi rend="italic">” are</hi>
                    building on a somewhat larger scale. They will mount four 6-inch guns on
                    sponsons, two forward and two aft, with ten 5- or 6-inch guns between them on
                    the broadside. All are coppered.</p>
                <p>There are six of a class called the “Gems,” of which the “Ruby” is the type. They
                    are composite vessels, with iron frames and wood planking, and sheathed with
                    copper.</p>
                <p>The next is a new class, built entirely of steel on the lines of the “Iris,” and
                    described as second-class cruisers. All this class have twin screws, and their
                    armaments are arranged in a similar manner to that of the “Calliope,” and in an
                    open battery. The “Leander” of this class is of 3750 tons, 5000 horse-power,
                    carries 700 tons of coal, and will have a speed of 16 knots.</p>
                <p>The “Mersey” is rather smaller, being of 3550 tons, but she has 500 horse-power
                    more, and is expected to steam 17 knots. She will mount fourteen 6-inch guns,
                    and has a covered battery.</p>
                <p>All the above-named vessels are protected by a steel turtle-back deck. In the
                    “Mersey” class this deck will be carried throughout the length. They will have
                    the Whitehead torpedo and tλvo second class torpedo boats.</p>
                <p>There are, besides, numerous sloops and gun vessels, chiefly composite. The
                    floating gun-carriages of the “Staunch” type, designed by Mr Rendel in 1867 to
                    carry an 18-ton gun, are small, low, mastless boats, with a speed of about 8
                    knots. The gunboats forming the “Mosquito <hi rend="italic">” fleet</hi> in 1854
                    have mostly disappeared.</p>
                <p>The accompanying table gives a list of English unarmoured ships. The vessels
                    named in italics have a protecting deck—the “Mersey,” “Severn,” and “Thames”
                    throughout, the others over machinery and magazines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Materials of Construction.—</hi> Henceforward we have a new
                    departure as regards the material for ships of war. As the iron displaced the
                    wooden walls, so now steel is displacing iron. All the new ships, whether
                    armoured or not, are of steel.</p>
                <p>A remarkable economy in cost has been effected by these means. The steel is so
                    uniform in quality, and the manufacture is so precise, that there is fair
                    competition, and therefore a nearly uniform rate all over the country, and this
                    rate is only one-half of what was given for iron for the royal dockyards when
                    the “Iris” and “Mercury” were commenced. At that date (1875) the contract price
                    of Admiralty plates of a standard size was over £20 per ton. Iron plates
                    supplied to the same specification, but not subject to tests, were supplied by
                    different makers at prices differing from each</p>

                <p>other by more than 100 per cent., according as the makers and the particular
                    brand were supposed to have credit in the market. The steel now in use is
                    absolutely faultless as to surface, stronger and more ductile than iron, and
                    very uniform in quality. That actually employed in the “Iris” and “Mercury,”
                    being a new material (Siemens-Martin of special quality), was no cheaper than
                    the highest quality of tested iron. Since then the extension of its use in all
                    directions has brought it down to half the price given at first. Siemens-Martin
                    and Bessemer steel are now employed almost indifferently. Between 1866 and 1876
                    only three small vessels were built of steel in the United Kingdom. It is now
                    employed in all the shipbuilding establishments in the country. In this case the
                    royal navy gave the start, and private shipbuilders followed, in a most
                    important change in the use of materials of construction.</p>
                <p>The use of steel in the navy has not been confined to shipbuilding. The guns took
                    it up first for internal tubes, and now the whole gun is built of it. The armour
                    has also adopted it, wholly or in part. In England a steel face is cast upon an
                    iron back, the steel being about one-third of the thickness of the plate. The
                    hard face has been found very efficacious in breaking up the attacking
                    projectiles. It has been found by experiment, for example, that flat plates of
                    compound armour 12 inches thick are more effective against iron and steel
                    projectiles, fired normally, at high velocity, from a 9-inch gun, than plates of
                    iron 14 inches thick. But the most important point gained is that it has become
                    impossible for iron shell to perforate armour as shell. The hard face of the
                    armour breaks the shell to pieces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mercantile Marine. —</hi> There has never been a time in
                    British naval history when the merchant service has failed to supply ships and
                    men for the national defence. For some years prior to 1853 it was the practice
                    to insert in mail contracts clauses providing for the armament of the steamships
                    employed in mail service.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of 1852 a report was presented to the Board of Admiralty by a
                    committee of four officers on the question of arming the mail contract
                    steam-packets belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental and Royal West India Mail
                    Packet Companies. Their recapitulation of their report is as follows :—</p>
                <p>“That the two companies have 53 vessels (23 of iron); that 16 ply between
                    Southampton and foreign ports; that 5 on an average are always at home and fit
                    for sea; that 8 may be rendered available for war purposes on an emergency, if
                    they can be spared from the mail packet service within different periods
                    extending altogether over sixty-six days; that they would not make efficient
                    substitutes for regular men-of-war; that they might be fitted for armed packets
                    and armed troop-ships; that it would be prudent in future that the fittings be
                    executed beforehand; that the fittings necessary to the nature of proposed
                    armaments (including magazines and shell-rooms) would cost from £600 to £800 for
                    first and second class vessels, if attended to while a vessel is in progress of
                    building or undergoing a large repair, and proportionally less for smaller
                    vessels; that guns of such calibre be used as are common in the royal navy
                    (viz., 8-inch guns of 65 cwt., and 32-pounders of 42 cwt. ),' to facilitate the
                    supplies and render fittings and ordnance stores transferable from ship to ship;
                    that a store of guns be kept at the port of Southampton (or Portsmouth), with a
                    proper proportion of ordnance and gunners’ stores laid apart ready for an
                    immediate call; that it would be advisable to introduce a clause in the
                    contracts giving the Admiralty a right of pre-emption, and possibly to prevent
                    their sale (but with permission) to a foreign power.”</p>
                <p>In a second report from the same committee, dated March 1853, upon the British
                    and North American, the Pacific, the General Screw, the Australian, the South
                    Western, and the African Companies, the report is summed up in the statement
                    that out of 91 vessels—belonging to eight distinct companies—employed in mail
                    contracts, there were only 16 which could be made available on an emergency for
                    auxiliary war purposes. Iron vessels were excluded from those which might be
                    considered available ‘ ‘ on account of the material used in their construction,”
                    but the committee does not state why the material was considered unsuitable.</p>
                <p>To go into the reasons influencing their decision would make it necessary to
                    refer to the experiments and the scientific and political controversies which
                    had then been going on for ten years. During this time it had been decided to
                    create a war navy of iron ships; the ships were commenced; then it was attempted
                    to stop the building of them, but without success; they were then transformed
                    into troop-and store-ships. Of two great parties, one contended that iron had
                    been proved to be unfit for fighting ships, and the other that there had been no
                    such proof, and that in the end wood must be given up.</p>
                <p>The officers composing this committee appear to have agreed with the former
                    party; and they do not seem to have thought it necessary to·give any reason for
                    their rejection of all the large and fine ships employed in the mail service
                    which, at some small expenditure of money, were suitable for receiving an
                    armament in every particular, except that they were built of iron.</p>
                <p>In March 1853 a Treasury minute was issued calling attention to the enormous cost
                    of the mail packet service, and appointing a committee to consider the whole
                    question. Among other things it is said in these instructions :—</p>
                <p>“In reviewing the purposes and stipulations of the contracts, the committee will
                    have to consider and report whether they can learn either that the prospect of a
                    reserve of ships of war, which was at one time confidently entertained, has been
                    realized in any sensible degree under these costly arrangements, or whether
                    there is any probability that it can be realized hereafter compatibly with the
                    paramount purpose for which the packets have been constructed, viz., that of
                    postal vessels. On this point the committee will consult a report which has been
                    presented to the Board of Admiralty by a committee of naval and artillery
                    officers.</p>
                <p>“It will also be their duty to observe what provisions have been inserted in the
                    contracts to secure the sufficiency of the ships for the purpose of naval
                    warfare; to ascertain whether the stipulations have been carefully fulfilled;
                    whether, in any cases where they have not been so fulfilled, permission to waive
                    them has been regularly sought and obtained from the proper department of the
                    Government; and whether, in consideration of such non-fulfilment, there has been
                    any adequate remission, or any remission, of the price which the state engaged
                    to pay, not for postal service merely, but for the double purpose of postal
                    service, together with a reserve force in aid of the royal navy.”</p>
                <p>In July 1853 the committee reported :—</p>
                <p>“The question which appears to us first in the order of consideration is, whether
                    it is desirable to simplify such contracts as may in future be made, by omitting
                    from them all provisions which do not directly bear upon the efficiency of the
                    postal service. In arranging the terms of these contracts, the Government seized
                    the opportunity of requiring that the vessels should be constructed in a manner
                    that would render them as serviceable for national defence in war as steam
                    packets belonging to the crown would have been if employed in their stead. A
                    provision to this effect was first inserted in the contract with the Royal Mail
                    Company in 1840, and in most of the existing contracts stipulations are to be
                    found, requiring that the vessels should be of a construction and strength fit
                    to carry such an armament as the Admiralty may think proper. In several cases
                    they must be built of wood, and not of iron; and there are some contracts which
                    confer on the Admiralty the right of taking the ships at a valuation when it may
                    be thought desirable to do so.</p>
                <p>“The surveyor’s report upon most of these vessels, as regards their fitness for
                    war purposes, is in the following terms :—‘ Not fitted for armament, but capable
                    of carrying guns when so fitted.’ This report accords with the opinion expressed
                    by the committee of naval and artillery officers upon the vessels which have
                    come under their notice. It appears, however, from the statements of that
                    committee that, although the packets they have examined are for the most part of
                    sufficient strength to carry and fire a certain number of guns, the expense of
                    the alterations which would be necessary before they could be got ready for
                    service would be very considerable, and that, even when such alterations had
                    been made, the efficiency of the vessels would be very small in proportion to
                    their size, and that they could not encounter hostile vessels of equal tonnage
                    without endangering the honour of the British flag.</p>
                <p>“With reference to future contracts, we are decidedly of opinion that no expense
                    should be incurred for the sake of imposing conditions for giving a military
                    character to the postal vessels. We believe the imposition of such conditions to
                    be a measure of false economy. Should a war suddenly break out, the immediate
                    demand for mail steamers would probably be greater than ever, and it might be
                    exceedingly inconvenient to withdraw them at such a time from their legitimate
                    use for the purpose of arming them for battle. Moreover, the high charge for the
                    packet service has been borne with the greater readiness, because it has been
                    supposed by some to include a provision, of large but unknown amount, for the
                    defence of the country; while, on the other hand, the naval estimates have
                    sometimes been complained of as excessive, on the ground that the force provided
                    for was in addition to the large reserve of postal war steamers.</p>
                <p>“We accordingly recommend that for the future the contracts for the conveyance of
                    the mails should be wholly free from stipulations of the nature we have been
                    describing, though it may be desirable in some cases to retain the power in the
                    Government to take possession of the vessels in the event of national
                    emergency.”</p>
                <p>They add :—“An erroneous impression appears to have prevailed among the public as
                    to the efficiency of our postal steamers for direct purposes of warfare. We do
                    not believe that those who are charged with the direction of the military
                    affairs of the country have ever regarded them as likely to be of any great
                    service in an engagement, but their advantage as an auxiliary force will be very
                    considerable. They will be available, in the event of the breaking out of
                    hostilities, for the rapid conveyance of despatches, of specie, and, to a
                    certain extent, of troops and stores. Their speed will be such as probably to
                    secure them from the risk of capture, and will render them highly valuable for
                    procuring intelligence of hostile movements. They may also be expected to
                    furnish queen’s ships with men trained to steam navigation, and possessing an
                    amount of local knowledge which cannot fail to be valuable in several ways.</p>
                <p>“Again, it is not only in a military sense that rapidity of communication between
                    all parts of the Bιitish empire tends to increase its security. While the mother
                    country continues to exercise any control over the proceedings of the colonies,
                    the inconveniences attending the delay of correspondence are severely felt, and
                    speedy communication is of the highest consequence to the preservation of
                    satisfactory relations between them.”</p>
                <p>Within the last few years all references to armament or fitness for warlike
                    services have disappeared from the mail contracts, but there has been in some of
                    them a clause providing that the Admiralty may in cases of great public
                    emergency charter vessels of the company at rates to be agreed on, but in case
                    of difference as to such rates, or damages consequent upon such purchase or
                    hiring, the same is to be settled by arbitration.</p>
                <p>Since 1852, when the committee refused to accept vessels built of iron, many
                    changes have taken place. There are no wooden mail steamers left: iron or steel
                    has completely displaced wood as a material of construction for such purposes.
                    The great development of incendiary projectiles in war, such as percussion
                    shell, red-hot shot, and hollow shot filled with molten iron, not only led to
                    the adoption of iron armour, and thus incidentally to iron frames and skin as
                    well, but showed also that wooden ships would be rapidly set on fire in an
                    action. In the ironclad ship the objection raised to iron for the structure of
                    war ships, viz., that the plating and riveting could be driven out in numerous
                    and dangerous fragments by projectiles, does not hold. The experiments on the
                    “Simoom” targets (1849-51) were doubtless in the minds of the officers who made
                    the reports referred to above, and they must not be forgotten.</p>

                <p>There are now many ships for fighting purposes built with iron frames and iron
                    skin, and without armour; but in most of these cases there is stout wooden
                    planking wrought over this iron skin, with the express object of obliging
                    projectiles passing right through the ship to punch a hole in the side by which
                    they pass out, instead of driving off masses of plating by the breaking of the
                    rivets. There can be no doubt also that plates are better, and riveting is
                    sounder now, than they were apt to be twenty years ago. The iron ships in the
                    merchant navy have not this protection. It is difficult to estimate the precise
                    gravity of the defect, but there is no doubt that it is sufficiently important
                    to make proper division into compartments imperative, so as to give time to
                    cover a damage in the side under water. But, unfortunately, a proper subdivision
                    into compartments, of which the divisional bulkheads rise a sufficient height
                    above the water, is very rare in merchant ships, even in mail steamers. If the
                    compartments are so large and the tops of the bulkhead so low that, by filling a
                    compartment, the top of the bulkhead is brought below the level of the water
                    outside the ship, the loss of the ship is inevitable. Moreover, these ships are,
                    as a rule, very narrow in proportion to their displacement, and their risk of
                    foundering, by the filling of a compartment, is thereby greatly increased,
                    because a narrow ship loses its stability rapidly under these circumstances, and
                    will turn over.</p>
                <p>Another disadvantage is the height of the engines and boilers. In ships of war of
                    the size of the mail steamers, and indeed in nearly all, of whatever size, the
                    engines and boilers are kept below the water, and fairly out of the reach of
                    shot. But in modern mail steamers the engines are worked with their cylinders
                    standing some feet above the load water-line. The advantage of this arrangement,
                    in point of economy of working, is very great, but it involves serious risk in a
                    fighting ship.</p>
                <p>In 1856 a most important event occurred seriously affecting this question, viz.,
                    the signing of what is known as the Declaration of Paris, a sort of rider to the
                    treaty of Paris of March 1856, by which declaration it was laid down that,
                    “whereas it was formerly legal to grant royal commissions to private owners to
                    equip, arm, and man private cruisers, to capture the commerce of the enemy for
                    their own profit, this shall no longer be legal; that, while the cruisers of the
                    state may capture and destroy private ships belonging to subjects of the hostile
                    state, they may not, as of old, search neutral ships in the open seas to
                    discover and confiscate hostile property contained in them, but only to verify
                    their right to fly the neutral flag, and to discover and confiscate property
                    held to be contraband of war, destined for ports of the enemy.”</p>
                <p>This was in fact a ratification in perpetuity of an order in council of the 25th
                    of March 1854, by which, on the outbreak of war with Russia, Great Britain
                    consented to “waive her maritime rights” and allow enemies’ goods to be carried
                    in neutral bottoms without liability to seizure.</p>
                <p>All the parties to the treaty of Paris agreed to this declaration, and the rights
                    it confers on neutrals are rights now common to all the European powers. Under
                    its operation neutrals would doubtless insist on exercising for their own profit
                    the right of carriage into and out of those ports of a belligerent which were
                    not effectively blockaded by the enemy. Privateering being abolished, so far as
                    the European powers are concerned, each maritime nation would seek, on the
                    outbreak of war, to incorporate into the state navy the fastest and most
                    powerful merchant ships it could obtain. Each war navy would become strengthened
                    by the addition of merchant ships capable, at whatever risk to themselves, of
                    mounting guns, of ramming, and of employing the torpedo. By this means the naval
                    power would depend, not only on the strength of the war navy, but also upon the
                    strength and excellence of the national mercantile marine. For this purpose only
                    the fastest ships would be useful, and all the rest would fall a prey, in any
                    encounter, to the fast ships in the hands of an enemy.</p>
                <p>The great importance attached to the possession of such fast ships may be seen
                    from the figures given below.</p>
                <p>British registered merchant ships, sailing and steam (38,939)—esti-Tons.</p>
                <p>mated gross tonnage in 1880 10,200,000</p>
                <p>Of this the proportion of steamers (6903) was 4,400,000</p>
                <p>At the same date the whole number of British ships built and building having an
                    average ocean speed of 12 knots and upwards did not exceed 400; and ships of
                    this speed built and building for all other maritime powers taken together did
                    not reach 100. The onlypow’ers possessing such ships were France, Germany,
                    Holland, Spain, United States, Italy, and Belgium.</p>
                <p>Between 1875 and 1882 the number of English merchant steamers of 13 knots ocean
                    speed and upwards increased from 25 to 65, of 14 knots and upwards from 10 to
                    35, and the maximum speed rose from 15 to 17 knots.</p>
                <p>Since 1875 the Admiralty have been engaged in forming a list of all ocean-going
                    British ships which, being reasonably divided into compartments, might be armed
                    in the event of war. The number on this list having an average ocean speed of 12
                    knots and upwards is, in 1883, 112, with a total gross register tonnage of
                    451,470 tons.</p>
                <p>The number of men and boys actually employed in 1880 in registered British
                    sea-going vessels was nearly 200,000, of which nearly 12 per cent, were foreign
                    and the rest British.</p>
                <p>Sir Thomas Brassey estimates that there are in the British mercantile marine
                    407,000 seamen, exclusive of men in British ships in the colonies and abroad.
                    The total number includes—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Naval Guns.—</hi> From time immemorial smooth-bore guns in cast
                    iron, or bronze for the smaller calibres, had been used for throwing spherical
                    shot with charges not exceeding one-third the weight of the shot.</p>
                <p>The first use of rifled guns in the navy was in 1859-60, when Mr (now Sir
                    William) Armstrong’s breech-loading 40-pounder and 100- pounder guns were issued
                    to the service. The elongated shot or shell and cartridge were entered from the
                    rear, through a hollow screw. A breech piece in which the vent was formed was
                    dropped through a slot in the breech of the gun, and, being tightened up by the
                    hollow screw, closed the bore. The projectile was coated with lead to take the
                    polygroove rifling. It fired much more accurately than the smooth-bore; but in
                    1863, the method of closing the breech having proved inefficient on service in
                    Japan, the manufacture was discontinued.</p>
                <p>In 1865 muzzle-loading guns were adopted, built on Armstrong’s principle of
                    welded wrought-iron coils round a steel tube, rifled on the “shunt” principle,
                    in which a studded projectile was rammed down grooves in the bore, rather deeper
                    than those by which it was afterwards driven out. The guns gradually increased
                    in weight up to the 12-inch 38-ton gun and 16-inch 80-ton gun. In 1876 the
                    80-ton gun was fired with a projectile of 1700 lb and a charge of 425 lb at a
                    target composed of four 8-inch iron plates with 5-inch intervals filled with
                    teak, and perforated it. The charge of this gun was afterwards increased to 450
                    lb of prismatic powder.</p>
                <p>In 1873 the advantage of an increased diameter of the powder chamber was
                    recognized and adopted in the 38-ton gun, but in order to utilize this chamber
                    in a muzzle-loading gun the cartridge had to be made small enough to pass
                    through the bore and afterwards expand in the chamber. This involved an awkward
                    cartridge. Breech-loading obviated this difficulty. The use of slow-burning
                    powder required a considerably increased length of bore, and made muzzle-loading
                    exceedingly difficult. Breech-loading also offered greater facility for closing
                    the windage of the shot. These causes have led to a return to breech-loading.
                    The system adopted is the French intercepted screw. The plan of reinforcing the
                    steel tube by wrought iron coils has been abandoned, and the approved system of
                    construction is a steel tube, supported by a steel breech, which takes the
                    breech screw and extends to the trunnions, reinforced by one or more layers of
                    steel hoops shrunk on. These guns throw an elongated projectile of about three
                    and a half calibres of the bore in length, with a charge nearly half the weight
                    of the shot, which gives a velocity approaching 2000 feet per second. The powder
                    pressure (17 or 18 tons on the square inch) is no higher than it used to be, but
                    is longer sustained. A few only of these guns are yet afloat.</p>
                <p>Boats’ guns are similar in type, but of solid steel. The projectiles are the
                    Palliser chilled shell, or cored shot; the common shell, which contains about
                    one-tenth of its weight of powder; the shrapnel shell, which contains bullets
                    and a small charge to liberate the bullets; and the case shot, which is a thin
                    case containing small shot for short ranges.</p>
                <p>These guns will be made of all calibres and weights. Those already tried are the
                    12-inch 43-ton, 10 ’ 4-inch 26-ton, 9 ’ 2-i∙nch 18- ton, 8-inch ll-ton, 6-inch
                    4-ton, 5-inch 36-cwt., 4-inch 22-cwt.</p>
                <p>The Gatling gun is ten-barrelled revolving. It throws bullets of the same size as
                    the rifle. An improved feed has just been tried, and with it the gun is capable
                    of discharging 1000 rounds a minute. To guard against the attack of torpedo
                    boats a rapid-firing gun of sufficient power to penetrate their sides was
                    necessary, and for this purpose a four-barrel gun, invented by Mr Nordenfelt,
                    was adopted, and is now supplied to all ships. Quick-firing 6-pounder guns are
                    now under trial capable of firing shot or shell.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cost of the Navy.—</hi> Sir Thomas Brassey says, “In
                    considering the general question of our naval expenditure, it is necessary, in
                    justice to those to whom its administration has been entrusted, to look back
                    over a series of years, and to compare the fluctuations in that expenditure with
                    the growth in the value of the trade for the protection of which our navy is
                    maintained. In the year 1858-59 the effective expenditure for the navy was
                    £7,106,100, and non-effective £1,334,000. In 1870-71 the effective expenditure
                    was £7,308,000, while the non-effective had increased to £1,705,000. The
                    estimates for the ensuing year (1881-82) provide for an effective expenditure of
                    £8,434,000, while the non-efiective expenditure amounts to £2,063,000. If we
                    compare the expenditure of the army in the same interval, we find that the
                    effective expenditure <pb break="no"

                    increase of half a million in the non-effective expenditure.</p>
                <p>“The increase in the foreign trade and tonnage of our merchant navy has been out
                    of all proportion with the increase in our naval expenditure. The total tonnage
                    of British merchant ships was 5,711,000 tons in 1860, 7,149,000 tons in 1870,
                    and 8,462,000 tons according to our last returns. Reckoning the carrying power
                    of steamships as fourfold that of sailing ships, we have half the mercantile
                    tonnage of the globe.</p>
                <p>“Germany, with a mercantile tonnage of 1,129,000, spends £890,000 on the
                    maintenance and construction of her fleet. France, with 976,000 tons of merchant
                    shipping, expends £2,893,000 on building and repairs, and employs 26,000 workmen
                    in her dockyards. England, with an excess of tonnage over the French mercantile
                    marine of 7 million tons, employs only 16,000 men in her dockyards, at an
                    expenditure, under votes 6 and 10, of £3,323,000. With these figures before us,
                    it cannot be said that England is leading the way in an aggressive policy, or in
                    the direction of extravagance.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Comparative View of Navies.—</hi> A comparison of the matériel
                    of modern navies would be very misleading if it only took into account the
                    number and power of the regular ships of war, because for some important
                    services there is but little difference between the value of the ship built for
                    war purposes and of that only adapted to such purposes at need. The increasing
                    vulnerability of the ship of war, however carefully built, to weapons which the
                    adapted merchant ship can employ is one of the most notable features in the
                    modern aspect of maritime warfare. The statesman who desires to estimate the
                    naval resources of empires or states will need to consider the quality and
                    extent of their mercantile marine in fast steamships and trained men as well as
                    the number and efficiency of their regular ships of Avar, and their actual war
                    personnel. A comparison limited to armoured or ironclad ships is vitiated by the
                    defect that it does not account for the protection afforded to what are called
                    unarmoured ships by other means than that of armouring their sides. This is fast
                    becoming so considerable that a new term has been introduced (protected ships)
                    to distinguish such vessels from ordinary unarmoured fighting ships.</p>
                <p>The fairest available approximate measure of the power of the ships is their
                    displacement or total weight. It always represents power of some kind, although
                    in many cases the distribution of the various elements of power in the ship may
                    be badly suited for many phases of war. Taking this as a measure, and reckoning,
                    not only completed or practically completed ships, but also those in various
                    stages of building, .the maritime powers named stand as follows, first as to
                    tonnage of armoured ships, secondly as to unarmoured ships, and thirdly as to
                    both taken together:—</p>

                <p>The following facts are noteworthy in connexion with the above figures. (1)
                    Germany, which launched her first ironclad ship in 1864, has not launched one
                    since 1880, and has not one on the slips. (2) The armoured tonnage launched by
                    Italy (1876-83) is greater than that launched by Germany during the same period.
                    (3) The French armoured ships launched before 1873 are, with insignificant
                    exceptions, built of wood. Every armoured ship the French are now building or
                    completing (1883) is of iron or steel. (4) France has in process of
                    construction, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> building or completing, an ironclad
                    navy equal in tonnage to the entire ironclad navy of Germany or Italy built and
                    building; and equal also in tonnage to all the completed ships in her own navy
                    launched during the previous ten years. (5) France expended in building and
                    completing ships for sea in 1873—77 only one-half what was spent by England in
                    those years. Since 1877 her expenditure on this service has usually equalled,
                    and generally exceeded, that of England.</p>
                <p>A general survey shows that the great cost of maintaining a regular war navy is
                    tending to limit its production and employment in states which either are not
                    wealthy or are obliged to maintain large armies. This must be an increasing
                    tendency for the following reasons. (1) There is a growing necessity for high
                    speed. Commerce increases its speed, and war must at least equal it. High speeds
                    and fair fuel endurance require large coal supplies. The ship with a high speed
                    and large coal supply is already a large ship. To protect such a ship
                    efficiently with armour demands the highest quality of protective material over
                    considerable areas. There is then a further demand for powerful artillery for
                    the purpose of dealing with such armour in an adversary. The attack is
                    constantly developing new methods, and demanding not only the adoption of its
                    weapons but also the creation and adoption of corresponding defences against
                    them. So it comes about that nothing but a large and costly ship can take first
                    rank in a regular war navy. (2) The ships so produced need high training in
                    officers and men, and the costly matériel must be accompanied by a
                    correspondingly costly personnel. (3) The warlike usefulness of such ships is
                    narrowed perpetually by the rapidly increasing power of fortresses, aided by
                    torpedoes and torpedo boats, to protect harbours and towns against both attack
                    and blockade. It is narrowed also by their inability to compete in speed and
                    coal endurance with ships not protected or armed. (4) Lastly, and more
                    generally, the occupation of the seas by shipping tends to increase, for
                    economical reasons, in proportion as human labour is divided and specialized,
                    and commodities interchanged. This growth in shipping and in the seafaring
                    population will reduce the significance and importance of the single ship of war
                    which it has cost so much to produce.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Personnel of the Navy.</hi></p>
                <p>The personnel of the British navy is composed of two different bodies of men, the
                    seamen and the marines, each of which has its appropriate officers. The latter
                    body is the subject of a separate article (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Marines).</hi><hi rend="italic">Officers.—</hi> The officers of the navy,
                    exclusive of the marines, are divided into two distinct branches—the military
                    and the civil.</p>
                <p>1. The military, or executive, branch consists of the undermentioned officers,
                    classed in the order of their rank:—flag-officers, commodores, captains, staff
                    captains, commanders, staff commanders, lieutenants, navigating lieutenants,
                    sub-lieutenants, chief gunners, chief boatswains, chief carpenters, gunners,
                    boatswains, carpenters, midshipmen, naval cadets.</p>
                <p>Flag-officers are divided into three ranks, viz., rear-admiral, vice-admiral,
                    admiral. Formerly there were three subdivisions of each grade, according as the
                    officer belonged to the white, blue, or red squadrons, but this distinction has
                    been abolished (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral).</hi> There is also the rank
                    of admiral of the fleet: such an officer, if in command, would carry the union
                    flag at the main.</p>

                <p>The civil powers and duties of the lord high admiral, or lords commissioners of
                    the Admiralty, are treated of in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral.</hi>
                    Their military powers are more extensive and important. By their orders all
                    ships are built, repaired, fitted for sea, or laid up in reserve, broken up, or
                    sold, put in commission or out of commission, armed, stored, and provisioned,
                    and employed on the home or foreign stations, or on voyages of discovery. All
                    promotion in the several ranks emanates from them; all honours bestowed for
                    brilliant services, and all pensions, gratuities, and superannuations for
                    wounds, infirmities, and long services are granted by them or on their
                    recommendation. All returns from the fleet are sent to the Board of Admiralty,
                    and everything that relates to the discipline and good order of every ship. All
                    orders for the payment of naval moneys are issued to the accountant-general of
                    the navy by the lords commissioners of the Admiralty; and the annual estimate of
                    the expenses of the navy is prepared by them, and laid before parliament for its
                    sanction. All new inventions and experiments are tried by their orders before
                    being introduced into the service; all designs of ships must be approved by
                    them; all repairs, alterations, and improvements in the dockyards, and all new
                    buildings of every description, must be submitted for their decision before they
                    are undertaken.</p>
                <p>All flag-officers, commanders-in-chief, are considered as responsible for the
                    conduct of the fleet or squadron under their command. They are bound to keep
                    them in perfect condition for service <hi rend="italic">; to</hi> exercise them
                    frequently in forming orders of sailing and lines of battle, and in performing
                    all such evolutions as may occur in the presence of an enemy; to direct the
                    commanders of squadrons and divisions to inspect the state of each ship under
                    their command; to see that the established rules for good order, discipline, and
                    cleanliness are observed; and occasionally to inquire into these and other
                    matters themselves. They are required to correspond with the secretary of the
                    Admiralty, and report to him all their proceedings.</p>
                <p>Every flag-officer serving in a fleet, but not commanding it, is required to
                    superintend all the ships of the squadron or division placed under his
                    orders,—to see that their crews are properly disciplined, that all orders are
                    punctually attended to, that the stores, provisions, and water are kept as
                    complete as circumstances will admit, that the seamen and marines are frequently
                    exercised, and that every precaution is taken for preserving the health of their
                    crews. When at sea, he is to take care that every ship in his division preserves
                    her station, in whatever line or order of sailing the fleet may be formed; and
                    in battle he is to observe attentively the conduct of every ship near him,
                    whether of the squadron or division under his immediate command or not; and at
                    the end of the battle he is to report it to the commander-in-chief, in order
                    that commendation or censure may be passed, as the case may appear to merit; and
                    he is empowered to send an officer to supersede any captain who may misbehave in
                    battle, or whose ship is evidently avoiding the engagement. If any flag-officer
                    be killed in battle his flag is to be kept flying, and signals to be repeated,
                    in the same manner as if he were still alive, until the battle shall be ended;
                    but the death of a flag-officer, or his being rendered incapable of attending to
                    his duty, is to be conveyed as expeditiously as possible to the
                    commander-in-chief.</p>
                <p>The captain of the fleet is a temporary rank, where a commander-in-chief has ten
                    or more ships of the line under his command; it may be compared with that of
                    adjutantgeneral in the army. He may either be a flag-officer or one of the
                    senior captains; in the former case, he takes his rank with the flag-officers of
                    the fleet; in the latter, he ranks next to the junior rear-admiral, and is
                    entitled to the pay and allowance of a rear-admiral. All orders of the
                    commander-in-chief are issued through him, all returns of the fleet are made
                    through him to the commander-inchief, and he keeps ajournai of the proceedings
                    of the fleet, which he transmits every three months to the Admiralty. He is
                    appointed and can be removed from this situation only by the lords commissioners
                    of the Admiralty.</p>
                <p>A commodore is a temporary rank, and of two kinds,— the one having a captain
                    under him in the same ship, and the other without a captain. The former has the
                    rank, pay, and allowances of a rear-admiral, the latter the pay and allowances
                    of a captain and special allowance as the lords of the Admiralty may direct.
                    They both carry distinguishing pennants.</p>
                <p>When a captain is appointed to command a ship of war he commissions the ship by
                    hoisting his pennant; and if fresh out of the dock, and from the hands of the
                    dockyard officers, he proceeds immediately to prepare her for sea, by demanding
                    her stores, provisions, guns, and ammunition from the respective departments,
                    according to her establishment. He enters such petty officers, leading seamen,
                    able seamen, ordinary seamen, artificers, stokers, firemen, and boys as may be
                    sent to him from the flag or receiving ship. If he be appointed to succeed the
                    captain of a ship already in commission, he passes a receipt to the said captain
                    for the ship’s books, papers, and stores, and becomes responsible for the whole
                    of the remaining stores and provisions; and, to enable him to keep a proper
                    check upon the ship’s accounts, he is allowed a clerk or assistant-clerk.</p>
                <p>The duty of the captain of a ship, with regard to the several books and accounts,
                    pay-books, entry, musters, discharges, &amp;c., is regulated by various Acts of
                    Parliament; but the state of the internal discipline, the order, regularity,
                    cleanliness, and the health of the crews will depend mainly on himself and his
                    officers. In all these respects the general printed orders for his guidance
                    contained in the Queen’s Regulations and Admiralty Instructions are particularly
                    precise and minute. And, for the information of the ship’s company, he is
                    directed to cause the articles of war, and abstracts of all Acts of Parliament
                    for the encouragement of seamen, and all such orders and regulations for
                    discipline as may be established, to be hung up in some public part of the ship,
                    to which the men may at all times have access. He is also to direct that they be
                    read to the ship’s company, all the officers being present, once at least in
                    every month. He is desired to be particularly careful that the chaplain have
                    shown to him the attention and respect due to his sacred office by all the
                    officers and men, and that divine service be performed every Sunday. He is not
                    authorized to inflict summary punishment on any commissioned or warrant-officer,
                    but he may place them under arrest, and suspend any officer who shall misbehave,
                    until an opportunity shall offer of trying such officer by a court-martial. He
                    is enjoined to be very careful not to suffer the inferior officers or men to be
                    treated with cruelty and oppression by their superiors. He is the authority who
                    can order punishment to be inflicted, which he is never to do without sufficient
                    cause, nor ever with greater severity than the offence may really deserve, nor
                    until twenty-four hours after the crime has been committed, which must be
                    specified in the warrant ordering the punishment. He may delegate this authority
                    to a limited extent to certain officers. All the officers and the whole ship’s
                    company are to be present at every punishment, which must be inserted in the
                    log-book, and an abstract sent to the Admiralty every quarter.</p>
                <p>The commander has the chief command in small vessels, such as sloops and
                    gun-vessels. In larger vessels he is chief of the staff to the captain, and
                    assists him in maintaining discipline, and in sailing and fighting the ship.</p>

                <p>The lieutenants take the watch by turns, and are at such times entrusted, in the
                    absence of the captain, with the command of the ship. The one on duty is to
                    inform the captain of all occurrences which take place during his watch,—as
                    strange sails that may be in sight, signals from other ships in company, change
                    of wind, &amp;c. He is to see that the ship be properly steered, the log hove,
                    and the course and distance entered on the log-board; and, in short, he is to
                    see that the whole of the duties of the ship are carried on with the same
                    punctuality as if the captain himself were present. In the absence of the
                    captain, the commander or senior executive officer is responsible for everything
                    done on board.</p>
                <p>The navigating officer receives his orders from the captain or the senior
                    executive officer. His more immediate duties are those of stowing the ship’s
                    hold and attending to her sailing qualities, of receiving and placing the
                    provisions in the ship, so as most conveniently to come at those which may be
                    wanted. He is to take care that the cables are properly coiled in the tiers. The
                    keys of the spirit-room are in his custody, and he is directed to entrust them
                    only to the officer authorized to use them. He has the charge of the store-rooms
                    of the warrantofficers, which he is ordered frequently to visit; and he is also
                    entrusted, under the command of the captain, with the charge of navigating the
                    ship, bringing her to anchor, ascertaining the latitude and longitude of her
                    place at sea, surveying harbours, and making such nautical remarks and
                    observations as may be useful to navigation in general. He. keeps the ship’s
                    log-book and remark-book.</p>
                <p>The warrant-officers of the navy may be compared with the non-commissioned
                    officers of the army. They take rank as follows, viz., gunner, boatswain,
                    carpenter; and, compared with other officers, they take rank after
                    sub-lieutenants and before midshipmen. They are charged with the duty of
                    receiving on board from the dockyards, and examining, the stores of their
                    respective departments, and keeping an account of the expenditure of them.</p>
                <p>The gunner has the charge of the ship’s artillery, and of the powder magazine. He
                    is to see that the locks and carriages are kept in good order, and that the
                    powder is preserved from damp; he is frequently to examine the musketry and
                    small arms, and to see that they are kept clean and fit for service; and, in
                    preparing for battle, it is his duty to take care that all the quarters are
                    supplied with everything necessary for the service of the guns, and, during the
                    action, that there be no want of ammunition served out. He is frequently to
                    exercise the men at the guns, and to see that they perform this part of their
                    duty with correctness. The armourer and his mates are under the immediate orders
                    of the gunner in everything that relates to the great guns and small arms.</p>
                <p>The boatswain is charged with all the stores belonging to his department,
                    consisting chiefly of the ropes and rigging, the latter of which he is ordered
                    to inspect daily, in order that any part of it chafed or likely to give way may
                    be repaired without loss of time. He is always required to be on deck at such
                    times as all hands are employed; he is bound to see that the men, when called,
                    move quickly upon deck, and when there that they perform their duty with
                    alacrity, and without noise or confusion. The sailmaker and the ropemaker are
                    under his immediate orders.</p>
                <p>The carpenter, when appointed to a ship, is carefully to inspect the state of the
                    masts and the yards, whether in the dockyard or on board of the ship, to see
                    that they are perfectly sound and in good order. He is to examine every part of
                    the ship’s hull, magazine, store-rooms, and cabins. He is every day when at sea
                    carefully to examine into the state of the masts and yards, and to report to the
                    officer of the watch if any appear to be sprung, or in any way defective. He is
                    to see that the ports are secure and properly lined, and that the pumps are kept
                    in good order, as also the boats, ladders, and gratings. The caulker,
                    carpenter’s mates, and carpenter’s crew are placed under his immediate
                    orders.</p>
                <p>The midshipmen are considered as the principal subordinate officers, but have no
                    specific duties assigned to them. In the smaller vessels some of the senior ones
                    are entrusted with the watch; they attend parties of men sent on shore, pass the
                    word of command on board, and see that the orders of their superiors are carried
                    into effect; in short, they are exercised in all the duties of their profession,
                    so as, after five years’ service as cadets and midshipmen, to qualify them to
                    become lieutenants, and are then rated sub-lieutenants provided they have passed
                    the requisite examination, and are nineteen years of age.</p>
                <p>2. The civil branch comprises the following officers, whose relative rank is

                <p>The engineer, when first appointed to a steam-vessel, carefully examines the
                    engines, screw (or paddles), and the boilers, and reports to the commanding
                    officer any defects he discovers. He takes charge of all the engineer’s stores
                    and tools, and keeps account of receipts and expenditure. He is never to quit
                    the engine-room during his watch, and visits it frequently at all times day and
                    night. The engineroom artificers, leading stoker, and stokers are under his
                    immediate control.</p>
                <p>The paymaster (formerly purser) has the charge of all moneys belonging to the
                    crown, the conduct of all cash transactions, and the charge of all the ship’s
                    provisions, and of the serving them out for the use of the crew. The regulations
                    and instructions for his guidance are minutely detailed in the general printed
                    instructions, with all the various forms established for the keeping of his
                    accounts with the accountant-general of the navy, to whom he is immediately
                    responsible. To assist him in the performance of his duties there are assistant
                    paymasters and clerks. The captain, who is responsible for the strict
                    performance of the duties of all the officers under his orders, acts as a check
                    on the paymaster in many parts of his duty regarding the slop-books,
                    muster-books, &amp;c. He has also to count at uncertain times the cash in charge
                    of the paymaster, and to see that it corresponds with the balance per account.
                    For store duties the paymaster has also a steward under his immediate
                    orders.</p>
                <p>The duties of the medical inspectors of hospitals and fleets, the medical officer
                    of a ship and his assistants, the secretary to the commander-in-chief, the
                    chaplain, the naval instructor, and inspectors of machinery afloat are too
                    obvious to require specification.</p>
                <p>The petty officers are very numerous; they are classified as chief petty officers
                    and first and second class working petty officers.</p>
                <p>The regulations under which candidates for the several branches of officer are
                    received into the navy will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Navy List,</hi>
                    which is published quarterly under the authority of the lords commissioners of
                    the Admiralty. The limits of age vary with the line chosen. Cadets are entered
                    between the ages of twelve and thirteen and a half, and. they must pass after
                    entry two years in study on board the “Britannia” before final examination and
                    transmission to a sea-going training ship. Since the foundation and opening of
                    Greenwich Naval College, on 1st February 1873, very great facilities have been
                    given for the higher education of naval officers of all ranks from
                    sub-lieutenants to captains. Engineer officer students are also received.</p>
                <p>By an order in council, the following regulations are established for the
                    promotion of commissioned officers of the navy. Midshipmen are required to serve
                    five years as midshipmen or cadet on board some of Her Majesty’s ships to render
                    them eligible to the rank and situation of lieutenant; and they must be nineteen
                    years of age. To qualify an officer for sub-lieutenant, he must have served the
                    time, and passed the examination, required to qualify for a lieutenancy. No
                    lieutenant can be promoted to the rank of commander except for gallantry in
                    action until he has served four years as lieutenant, three of them at sea; and
                    no commander to the rank of captain except for gallantry in action until he has
                    served two years as commander, one of them at sea. Captains become admirals in
                    succession according to their seniority on the list, provided they shall have
                    commanded four years in a rated ship during war, or six years during peace, or
                    five years in war and peace combined. Appointments as navigating lieutenant
                    (formerly master) are no longer made. The old list of masters, now subdivided
                    into staff captains, staff commanders, and navigating lieutenants, will
                    gradually die out, and the duties will be performed by lieutenants and
                    commanders. No person can be appointed gunner unless he shall have served seven
                    years, one of them as gunner’s mate or other petty officer, or seaman gunner, on
                    board one or more of Her Majesty’s ships; and he must produce a first class
                    certificate in gunnery, and certificates of his good conduct, and undergo the
                    necessary examination. No person can be appointed boatswain unless he shall have
                    served seven years,,—one complete year with the rating, and actually doing the
                    duty, of a petty officer in Her Majesty’s navy; and he must produce certificates
                    of good conduct, and undergo the necessary examination. No person can be
                    appointed carpenter unless he has been six months a carpenter’s mate or caulker,
                    or twelve months with the rating of shipwright or carpenter’s crew, on board one
                    or more of Her Majesty’s ships. No person can be appointed chaplain to one of
                    Her Majesty’s ships until he has received priest’s orders. No person can be
                    appointed paymaster or assistant-paymaster unless he shall have been rated and
                    have discharged the duties of a clerk for three complete years, and shall
                    produce good certificates. Admission to this class is by limited competition for
                    assistantclerkships. Admission to the medical class is by open competition.
                    Promotion from surgeon to staff surgeon is conferred on qualified officers
                    twelve years from date of entry.</p>
                <p>The long-continued wars towards the close of last century necessarily created a
                    prodigious increase of the commissioned officers of the navy. Their numbers in

                <p>In the year 1857 there were on the active list of the navy 371 captains, 530
                    commanders, 1122 lieutenants, and on the retired and reserved list 129 captains,
                    243 commanders with rank of captain (besides 113 commanders on reserved
                    half-pay), 254 lieutenants with rank of retired commanders (besides 618 on
                    reserved half-pay). The total number of captains was therefore 743, commanders
                    897, lieutenants 1740. The warrant-officers increased from the average of about
                    400 in 1793 and 700 in 1821 to upwards of 1000 in 1857. The total number of
                    officers of the royal navy and royal marines in 1857 was upwards of 7300,
                    excluding mates and midshipmen, clerks, warrant-officers, and engineers, who may
                    be computed at 3000,— making a grand total of 10,300 officers of all ranks.</p>
                <p>The chronic disproportion between the number of officers on the active list and
                    the number for whom it was possible to find employment led to many difficulties.
                    Promotion stagnated, and officers in the higher ranks remained in the service
                    long after the time when in the ordinary course of things they should have been
                    retired for age or infirmity. Several schemes of naval retirement were proposed
                    to remedy the evil. Mr Childers, when first lord of the Admiralty in 1870,
                    framed a scheme much of which remains in force, although amendments in it have
                    be.en found necessary. Full details are given in the <hi rend="italic">Navy
                    List,</hi> and a large body of interesting matter connected with the subject may
                    be found in a parliamentary paper dated 11th July 1872. The active list has been
                    reduced to the number in each rank which is deemed to be sufficient for the
                    purposes of the navy, and provision is made for a regular flow of promotion by
                    requiring the retirement of officers at certain specified ages, or after
                    non-service afloat, irrespective of age, for a given number of years. Improved
                    retired pay has been accorded.</p>
                <p>As the regulations stand at present admirals and vice-admirals are compulsorily
                    retired at the age of sixty-five; rear-admirals at sixty, or if their flag has
                    not been hoisted for ten years; captains are retired at the age of fifty-five,
                    “or at any age if seven years have elapsed since they last served”; commanders
                    at the age of fifty; lieutenants at forty-five, “or at any age if five years
                    have elapsed since they last served”; sub-lieutenants (by order in council 5th
                    February 1872) are compulsorily retired at the age of forty. Permission has been
                    given to flag-officers, captains, commanders, and lieutenants to retire some
                    years sooner than the age of compulsory retirement, and arrangements have been
                    made by which they may commute their retired pay, or a part of it, for a lump
                    sum. Staff captains are retired at the age of sixty, “or at any age if they have
                    not served seven years”; staff commanders at fifty-five; and navigating
                    lieutenants at forty-five, or after five years’ nonservice. Chief engineers are
                    retired at fifty-five, or after five years’ non-service. Chaplains and naval
                    instructors are retired at the age of sixty, or in case of non-service by the
                    former after five years, by the latter after three years. Of medical officers,
                    inspectors and deputy-inspectors of hospitals are retired at sixty, or after
                    five years’ non-service; fleet surgeons, staff surgeons, and surgeons at
                    fifty-five, or in each case after five years’ non-service. Paymasters are
                    retired at sixty. Permission is accorded to these officers also to retire five
                    years sooner than the maximum age.</p>
                <p>A maximum establishment of warrant-officers has been fixed, and ages specified at
                    which retirement is compulsory. The object has been to favour promotion, the
                    employment of none but vigorous men, and to reduce the list to the maximum
                    number it is considered desirable to employ.</p>
                <p>At present (1883) the total number of the officers of the royal navy and royal
                    marines is about 7900. Of these upwards of 2100 are in the ranks of engineer
                    officers, sublieutenants, midshipmen, naval cadets, clerks, &lt;fcc., and
                    warrant-officers.</p>

                <p>All officers of the navy wear a uniform, which is established in pursuance of the
                    pleasure of the sovereign. It consists of blue cloth, with white collars and
                    cuffs to the coats, and various embroidery and epaulets. The epaulets of the
                    officers of the civil branch of the service are embroidered in gold and silver.
                    The full dress, with cocked hats, is worn on state occasions and at
                    courts-martial by all naval officers. The first naval uniform (blue and white)
                    was established in 1748. The identical patterns then issued may now be seen in
                    the United Service Institution. In the reign of William IV. the facings were for
                    a short time changed to red. The last alteration of the uniform was in 1856. The
                    existing regulations may at any time be ascertained by reference to the current
                    number of the <hi rend="italic">Navy List.</hi><hi rend="italic">Men.—</hi> The
                    crew of a ship of war consists of leading seamen, able seamen, ordinary seamen,
                    engine-room artificers, other artificers, leading stokers, stokers, coal-trim
                    mers, boys, and marines. The artificers and stokers and the marines are always
                    entered voluntarily, the latter in the same manner as soldiers, by enlisting
                    into the corps, the former at some rendezvous or on board particular ships. The
                    supply of boys for the navy, from whom the seamen class of men and petty
                    officers is recruited, is also obtained by voluntary entry.</p>
                <p>The conditions under which boys are entered in Her Majesty’s navy are as
                    follows:—All entrants must understand that they are bound to serve continuously
                    for ten years from the time of their attaining the age of eighteen; and they
                    will be required to sign an engagement to that effect; but no.boy will be
                    entered without the written consent of his parents, guardians, or nearest
                    relations. The age for entry is from fifteen to sixteen and a half, and the
                    following are the present standards as to height, &amp;c., which, however, are
                    liable to alteration :—</p>

                <p>They must produce a certificate of birth, or a declaration made by their parents
                    or guardians before a magistrate, to show they are of the proper age. They must
                    also be of sound constitution, not subject to fits, free from any physical
                    defects or malformation, and able to read and write. No boys will be received
                    from reformatories or prisons, or if they have been committed by a magistrate;
                    but boys may be admitted from industrial school ships.</p>
                <p>Able and ordinary seamen are seldom admitted direct into the navy, as the system
                    of training boys proves very satisfactory. Volunteers are occasionally entered,
                    especially from thç naval reserve, and no doubt a large supply of men could be
                    obtained if sought for. The wages given in the merchant service may be higher,
                    but in all other respects the treatment is far superior in the navy: the men
                    have better provisions, continuous employment, and leave on full pay, are
                    subject to much less fatigue and exposure to the weather, are well taken care of
                    in sickness, and are entitled to pensions after twenty years’ service or when
                    disabled.</p>
                <p>Merchant seamen are admitted into the royal naval reserve, receive an annual
                    payment by way of retainer, perform drill on board Her Majesty’s ships, and are
                    engaged to serve in the navy in case of war or emergency. Including the
                    fishermen and boys, who form the second and third classes of this reserve, it is
                    to consist of about 20,000 men.</p>
                <p>The speedy manning of the fleet, on the first breaking out of a war, is one of
                    the most important duties that can fall on the naval administration. A variety
                    of schemes have been brought forward for attaining this end, but all of them
                    have heretofore failed of success, except the compulsory mode of raising men,
                    under the authority of press warrants, issued by the lords commissioners of the
                    Admiralty, by virtue of an order in council, renewed from year to year. On the
                    occasion of the war with Russia in 1855, however, the fleet was manned, for the
                    first time, without recourse to impressment. There likewise issues, on the
                    breaking out of a war, a proclamation from the sovereign, recalling all British
                    seamen out of the service of foreign princes or states; and commanders of all
                    ships of war are directed to search foreign vessels for such seamen.</p>
                <p>The impressment of seafaring men, however anomalous under a free constitution
                    like that of Great Britain, is defensible on state necessity, until it can be
                    shown that the fleet, on an emergency, is capable of being manned without
                    resorting to that measure. In consequence of some doubts being raised on the
                    legality of impressment in the year 1676, when the affairs of the Admiralty were
                    managed immediately under the direction of the king and the great officers of
                    state, a discussion was held on this point, when it was decided by the judges
                    and crown lawyers, that the king had an indefeasible right to the services of
                    his subjects when the state required them, and that the power of impressing
                    seamen was inherent in the crown, seeing that without it the trade and safety of
                    the nation could not be secured. In the Black Book of the Admiralty is an order
                    by Sir Thomas Beaufort, high admiral to Henry IV., commanding the impressment of
                    mariners for service, in the barge “E. de S.,” and punishments were provided for
                    those who failed in service. The statute 2 Rie. II. c. 4 speaks of mariners
                    being arrested and retained for the king’s service as of a thing well known and
                    practised without dispute, and provides a remedy against their running away. By
                    statute 2 &amp; 3 Phil, and Μ. c. 16 any Thames waterman hiding during the
                    execution of a commission of pressing for the royal service is liable to heavy
                    penalties. By 5 Eliz. c. 5 fishermen are exempted from impressment. The subject
                    of impressment is dealt with in many statutes down to the time of George III.,
                    and the power to impress in case of necessity is still conferred by the
                    sovereign in the Admiralty patent. At the present stage of the world’s history,
                    however, this power would not be enforced, except upon application of the maxim
                    “salus populi suprema lex.”</p>
                <p>The first instance of impressing men in Ireland seems to have been in the year
                    1678, when the lord-lieutenant received directions from the privy council to
                    raise 1000 seamen for the fleet. In 1690 the lords-justices of Ireland were
                    directed to assist the officers of the navy in impressing men in that kingdom.
                    In 1697 a register was taken of all the seafaring men in Ireland, which amounted
                    to 4424 men, of whom it is noted 2654 were Catholics. On several occasions,
                    during Queen Anne’s reign, the lords-justices of Ireland received directions to
                    raise men to serve in the fleet.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the mode of raising men by impressment was unknown before the Union;
                    but in various instances the council of Scotland was directed to raise
                    volunteers for the fleet, each man to have 40s. as bounty.</p>
                <p>In 1706 an experiment was tried for the speedy manning of the fleet, by virtue of
                    an Act of Parliament, which required the civil magistrates of all the counties
                    to make diligent search for all seafaring men, and 20s. were allowed to the
                    constables for each man taken up,—the seamen to have pay from the day of
                    delivery to the naval officers stationed to receive them; if they deserted after
                    that, they were .to be considered as guilty of felony. By the same Act,
                    insolvent debtors, fit for the service, and willing to enter it, were released,
                    provided the debt did not exceed £30; and no seaman in the fleet was to be
                    arrested for any debt not exceeding £20. The whole proceeding under this Act
                    incurred a very heavy expense, and totally failed.</p>

                <p>In the same year the queen referred to the prince of Denmark, then lord high
                    admiral, an address from the House of Lords, relating to the three following
                    points :— (1) the most effectual means for manning the fleet; (2) the
                    encouragement and increase of the number of seamen; (3) the restoring and
                    preserving the discipline of the navy. His royal highness submitted these points
                    to such of the flag-officers and other commanders as could be assembled, who
                    made a report, recommending (1) that a general register should be kept of all
                    seafaring men in England and Ireland, and that all marines qualified to act as
                    seamen should be discharged from the army; and (2) that not fewer than 20,000
                    seamen should be kept in employ in time of peace. With regard to the discipline
                    of the navy, they observed that, no particular defect being specified, they
                    could pronounce no opinion on that head.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reserve. —</hi> In addition to the seamen and marines borne on
                    the strength of the navy, there are four lines of reserves at the disposal of
                    the Admiralty :—the coastguard, the seaman pensioner reserve, the royal naval
                    reserve, and the royal naval artillery volunteers.</p>
                <p>To qualify a seaman for admission to the coastguard he must be under thirty-seven
                    years of age, have completed eight years’ continuous service in man’s rating, or
                    such period as the lords commissioners of the Admiralty may from time to time
                    direct, be either a seaman gunner or trained man, be in possession of at least
                    one good conduct badge, and be recommended by his captain.</p>
                <p>Petty officers and seamen of Her Majesty’s navy, on being pensioned for length of
                    service, are eligible for enrolment in the seaman pensioner reserve provided
                    they are either seamen gunners or trained men, and are under forty-five years of
                    age. Men in the seaman pensioner reserve are required to undergo fourteen days’
                    training annually, and on attaining the age of fifty they are granted the
                    Greenwich Hospital age pension and exempted from further drill, provided they
                    have attended drill every year, and not less than six periods of such drill.</p>
                <p>The royal naval reserve comprises those officers and men of the mercantile marine
                    and fishermen who are willing, in consideration of a small retaining salary, to
                    undergo each year a certain number of days’ training on board a ship of war or
                    at a naval reserve battery. The regulations in force for the appointment of
                    officers to the royal naval reserve are published in each issue of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Navy List.</hi> The men are divided into three classes. (1) For
                    enrolment in the first class a man must be under thirty years of age, and show
                    proof of at least eight years’ sea service in foreign-going or regular coasting
                    vessels within the ten years immediately preceding his application, and must
                    have obtained and held the rating of A. B. three years prior to the expiration
                    of such service, or have completed his indentures as an apprentice for a term of
                    not less than four years, one year of which has been served in foreign-going or
                    regular coasting vessels. Men who have been discharged from the royal navy as
                    able seamen with good characters may be enrolled in the reserve if they are
                    physically fit, provided they do not exceed thirty-five years of age. (2)
                    Candidates for enrolment in the second class reserve must not be under nineteen
                    nor above thirty years of age, and must have followed a seafaring life either in
                    foreign-going, coasting, fishing, or other vessels for three years, of which six
                    months at least must have been as ordinary seaman; they must know the compass,
                    and be able to steer and to pull a good oar. (3) Boys who have been eighteen
                    months under training in a mercantile training ship are eligible for enrolment
                    in the third class reserve at the age of sixteen, provided they are under
                    engagement to join a merchant ship for sea service, are physically and mentally
                    fit, and can show satisfactory proficiency in gunnery drills, as well as in
                    certain elementary subjects connected with navigation and seamanship. They are
                    eligible for promotion to the second class at the age of nineteen provided they
                    have served six months at sea, and afterwards to the first-class reserve when in
                    all respects qualified as above. Every enrolment in the royal naval reserve is
                    for a period of five years, and on promotion from a lower to a higher class the
                    man is required to re-enrol. The force was originated in 1859, and the officers
                    and men are liable to be called out for general service in the fleet in the
                    event of war.</p>
                <p>The royal naval artillery volunteers are enrolled under conditions somewhat akin
                    to those attaching to enrolment in volunteer regiments. Brigades of this force
                    have been formed -at London, Liverpool, and Bristol, with batteries at Brighton,
                    Hastings, Southport, Birkenhead, Carnarvon, Bangor, and Swansea.</p>
                <p>The discipline of the navy, or the government of Her Majesty’s ships, vessels,
                    and forces by sea, is regulated by the Naval Discipline Act 29 &amp; 30 Vict. c.
                    109. The Consolidation Act 22 Geo. II. c. 33 replaced the first parliamentary
                    enactment for the government oι the fleet (13 Car. II. § 1, c. 9), and was
                    passed after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, “to remedy some defects which were of
                    fatal consequence in conducting the preceding war.” Previously to the statute of
                    Charles II. the government and discipline as well as the pay of the navy had
                    depended, like the government and pay of the army, upon the quasi-household
                    orders of the sovereign.</p>
                <p>Under the Naval Discipline Act, the lords commissioners of the Admiralty are
                    empowered to order courts-martial for all offences mentioned therein, and
                    committed by any person in and belonging to the fleet and on full pay; and also
                    to delegate the same power to officers in command of fleets and squadrons on
                    foreign stations, which power also may devolve on their successors in case of
                    death or recall. By this Act no court-martial can consist of more than nine or
                    of less than five persons, to be composed of such flag-officers, captains,
                    commanders, and lieutenants, then and there present, as are next in seniority to
                    the officer who presides at the court-martial. Commanders and lieutenants are
                    not required to sit when four officers of higher rank, and junior to the
                    president, can be assembled.</p>
                <p>The former penalty of death for cowardice, or other neglect of duty, in time of
                    action, and for not pursuing the enemy, was, by the 19th George III., so far
                    mitigated as to authorize the court-martial “to pronounce sentence of death or
                    to inflict such other punishment as the nature and degree of the offence shall
                    be found to deserve.” Under these articles thus mitigated, Admiral Byng would
                    probably not have been condemned to death. The provisions of the present Act (29
                    &amp; 30 Vict. c. 109) confine sentence of death, without alternative, to cases
                    of traitorous misconduct in the presence of the enemy, and murder. All other
                    offences which were formerly capital may now be dealt with either by sentence of
                    death or by such other punishment as the court may think fit to award under the
                    provisions of the Act; and penal servitude or imprisonment, with dismissal from
                    the service, are now the severest sentences awarded, flogging having been
                    practically abolished.</p>
                <p>The discipline of the navy is also maintained by a system of summary punishments,
                    including short terms of imprisonment, which can be awarded by the captains of
                    ships, under the regulations issued from time to time by the lords of the
                    Admiralty.</p>
                <p>The first regular code of printed instructions would appear to be that known as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Duke of York’s Sailing and Fighting Instructions,</hi>
                    bearing date about 1660, which formed the basis of all the subsequent ones.
                    Much, however, of the internal discipline of a ship of war depends upon the
                    captain; that officer being empowered to punish the men for minor offences,
                    according to the usage of the service, courts-martial on seamen are rarely found
                    necessary in well-regulated ships. In 1853 a more uniform system, defining the
                    nature and duration of minor punishments, was promulgated by the Board of
                    Admiralty.</p>
                <p>By the general printed instructions, the captains of Her Majesty’s ships are
                    required to accustom the men to assemble at their proper quarters, to exercise
                    them at the great guns, to teach them to point, fire, &amp;c., under all
                    circumstances of sea and weather. Practice in these respects is obviously much
                    more necessary on board ships than on shore.</p>
                <p>At Portsmouth and Devonport regular instruction is given in the theory and
                    practice of gunnery, in the principles which regulate projectiles, in the theory
                    and manipulation of torpedoes, in the use of small arms, and in all the
                    scientific departments of the art of war. Cheinistry and electricity as applied
                    to war and warlike stores are also <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n308/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0308-0297"/> taught practically, and every inducement is given
                    to officers to study and to qualify for the post of gunnery officers in the
                    fleet. Extra rates of pay are given to gunnery lieutenants according to their
                    proficiency. For the training of the men, who up to 1852 were almost devoid of
                    special skill, there was created a class of “seamen gunners” who act as
                    instructors on board ship, under the orders of the gunnery officer. Examinations
                    are held at stated times for the purpose of testing the progress made by
                    officers under training. In the higher education of naval men at Greenwich
                    College gunnery forms one of the principal features.</p>
                <p>The necessity for this special training, and for special efforts to induce men to
                    undergo it, will be evident upon comparison between the guns of thirty years ago
                    and those of the present day. The cannon with which the greatest victories of
                    the British navy were won were 12-, 16-, and 24-pounders. Out of 104 guns
                    carried by Nelson’s “Victory,” 44 were 12-pounders, 30 were 24-pounders, and
                    only 30 were 32 ’ s. In the Russian War, 56 ’ s and a few 68’s constituted the
                    armament of the large war-ships. Now ships go about with 2000-pounder guns—of
                    most scientific make and character. For the proper handling and management of
                    these refined engines of destruction it is clear that very special knowledge and
                    very careful training are required. The issues involved in miss or hit are too
                    momentous to be left to careless or ignorant hands.</p>
                <p>The state of health on board of a ship of war is, generally speaking, not
                    exceeded in the most favoured spot on shore; and the sea-scurvy may now be
                    considered as unknown in the British navy, since the universal introduction of
                    lemon juice, or citric acid, without an ample supply of which no ship is
                    permitted to sail on a foreign voyage. From the official returns collected by
                    Sir Gilbert Blane, Μ. Dupin, a French author well versed in naval subjects, drew
                    out the following table, which exhibits at one view the progressive diminution
                    of sickness, death, and desertion in the British navy, calculated on 100,000 men
                    :—</p>

                <p>Annexed is a memorandum showing the invaliding and death-rates in the navy
                    afloat, including the deaths in hospital, from 1856 to 1881. Comparison with the
                    dead lists of former years, even those cited above, will show the wonderful
                    decrease caused by greater medical knowledge and better sanitary arrangements on
                    board ship. This will be the more apparent when it is borne in mind that the old
                    statistics show only the deaths in hospital, not those which occurred on board
                    ship, through disease or the enemy. The high death-rate of 1870 is accounted for
                    by the sad loss of the “Captain”; and those of 1878, 1880, and 1881 by the
                    sinking of the “Eurydice” and “Atalanta” and the blowing up of the
                    “Doterel.”</p>

                <p>The encouragement given to the navy from its first regular establishment has
                    marked it as a favourite service. The sea-pay, the half-pay, and other
                    emoluments have generally been superior to those enjoyed by the army, but
                    subject to great fluctuations in every reign, and to frequent changes in the
                    same reign. From the Black Book of the Admiralty it appears that the pay of the
                    navy was fixed as follows in the time of Richard II.:—“If the admirall bee
                    knight batchellor hee shall have every day at sea four shillings for himselfe,
                    and for each chevalier gooing in his company two shillings, and for every
                    escuier arme twelvepence a day; and shall have in consideration of thirty hommes
                    d’armes, at the end of each quarter of a yeare, one hundred markes, and so hee
                    shall have for every one. And shall also have for each archer sixpence a day.
                    And soo everyone of his captains shall have theire wages of him. And if the
                    admirall is a baron he shall have six shillings and eightpence a day; and if hee
                    is an earle hee shall have thirteen shillings and fourpence a day.” The admiral
                    had also fourpence in the pound for all wages paid for his fleet; but out of
                    this he had “in the night tyme, all the while that the fleet is at sea, to carry
                    at the topp of his mast two lanthornes, to the end that all the masters of the
                    ffleet my know and perceive by the light and the admirall’s course, what course
                    they shall steer.” “As to the marriners wages upon the voyages of the king or
                    the admirall, each master of a shipp shall have sixpence a day, and every
                    constable (or gunner) of the ffleet shall have the same wages by the day. Each
                    marriner shall have threepence halfpenny per diem, and each marriner shall have
                    sixpence per week for consideration” (or bounty), “and each sea boy shall have
                    twopence halfpenny per diem.”</p>
                <p>The establishment of half-pay was of slow growth. Though the navy, as we have
                    seen, was put upon a regular establishment under the reign of Henry VI11.,
                    neither officers nor seamen received any pay or emolument in time of peace until
                    the reign of Charles II., when in 1668 certain allowances were made to
                    flagofficers and their captains out of the £200,000 a year voted for the whole
                    naval service; and in 1674 certain other allowances were granted, by order in
                    council, to captains who had commanded ships of the first and second rates, and
                    to the second captains to flagofficers, on the ground, as assigned in the
                    preamble, that they had undergone the brunt of the war, without sharing in the
                    incident advantages of it, as prizes, convoys, and such like, which the
                    commanders of the small classes of ships had enjoyed. But the first regular
                    establishment of half-pay for all flag-officers, captains, first-lieutenants,
                    and masters was by King William, in the year 1693, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n309/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0309-0298"/> provided they had served a year in their
                    respective qualities, or had been in a general engagement with the enemy. A
                    regularly established half-pay was further sanctioned by an order in council of
                    Queen Anne in 1700, the conditions of which were, that no officer should enjoy
                    the benefit thereof who had absented himself without permission of the lord high
                    admiral or lords commissioners of the Admiralty, or who had been dismissed for
                    any misdemeanour or by court-martial, or who had not behaved himself to the
                    satisfaction of the lord high admiral, or who should have leisure to go out of
                    His Majesty’s dominions, if employed in the merchant service or otherwise, or
                    who enjoyed the benefit of any public employment. Since the above period the
                    rate of half-pay to the several officers of the navy has undergone various
                    modifications. It has included within its area of benefit a larger number of
                    classes of officers. It has also increased enormously in bulk as a non-effective
                    service charge. So great was the increase in this respect, notwithstanding the
                    subdivision of the half-pay list into “retired” and “reserved” sections in
                    addition to the “active” half-pay list, that in the interest of the officers
                    themselves, as well as of the country, it became necessary in 1869 to make a
                    scheme of retirement, in accordance with which officers on the half-pay list,
                    from whatever cause, for more than a prescribed number of years, were
                    permanently retired, and allowed to draw a retired pay, or to commute for a
                    capital sum the value of their pay. Half-pay is not given to officers below the
                    rank of sub-lieutenant in the military branch, or of paymaster in the civil. For
                    further details see the <hi rend="italic">Navy List.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Prize-Money.—</hi> This additional incentive to exertion on the part of
                    officers and seamen on board ships of war dates from the earliest time. At an
                    early date rules and regulations were made for the due apportionment of prize of
                    war, a large portion going to the king and his admiral. In 1793 precise
                    regulations, in the present sense of the word, were first issued. By them the
                    proceeds arising from captures from the enemy were divided into eight equal
                    parts, and were distributed by order of ranks. These have been amended from time
                    to time, and were the subject of special orders in March 1854. The existing
                    orders are contained in a royal proclamation dated May 1871, and direct, subject
                    to the under-mentioned provisos, that one-thirtieth part of the value of prizes
                    shall go to the admiral in command of the capturing vessels (if two admirals
                    they are to divide the thirtieth, the senior taking two-thirds, the junior
                    one-third), and of the remainder, or of the whole if no flag share is payable,
                    the captain is entitled to a tenth of the entire proceeds. After these
                    deductions the remainder of the net proceeds is to be distributed in ten
                    classes, so that each officer, man, and boy assisting in the capture of the
                    prize shall receive shares, or a share, according to his class. Officers in the
                    first class, including inspectors-general of hospitals afloat, inspectors of
                    steam machinery, secretary to commander-in-chief, are to receive forty-five
                    shares each; in the second class, including senior lieutenant, staff surgeon,
                    and certain paymasters, thirty-five shares each; in the third class,
                    lieutenants, surgeons, captain of marines, and some others, thirty shares each;
                    in the fourth class, including lieutenants of marines, sub-lieutenants, and
                    warrant-officers, twenty shares each. To the fifth class twelve shares each are
                    assigned; to the sixth, ten shares each; to the seventh, seven shares; to the
                    eighth, including able seamen, four shares; to the ninth, including “idlers,”
                    two shares; and to the tenth, boys, one share. Another source of emolument is
                    the percentage charged upon treasure, which, for security’s sake, may be
                    conveyed in ships of war on merchants’ account.</p>
                <p>Another great encouragement for young men to enter the naval service arises from
                    the honours bestowed by the sovereign for any brilliant exploit. Exclusive of
                    peerages and baronetcies, the honours bestowed for gallant conduct in the naval
                    service at present (1883) are the titles of knights grand-crosses of the
                    military order of the Bath, and knights commanders and companions of the Bath,
                    in addition to which there are the civil order of the Bath, and, for colonial
                    services, the order of St Michael and St George, l&lt;oyal medals have also been
                    granted of late years for various naval services, and distributed alike to the
                    officers, seamen, and marines; and a number of officers, seamen, and marines
                    have received the Victoria Cross. Good-sörvice pensions are also awarded to a
                    certain number of flag-officers, captains, and general and field-officers of
                    marines. These are selected according to their standing, and length and nature
                    of services, a statement of which is given, in each case, in the annual naval
                    estimates presented to parliament. The amount of the good-service pension ranges
                    from £100 to £300, according to rank and service. There are also naval and
                    Greenwich Hospital pensions established for the relief of retired officers of
                    long service, who are old, infirm, wounded, or disabled. Some of these pensions
                    are allotted to each class of officers.</p>
                <p>The cost of the British navy has necessarily varied with the times, with the
                    materials used in the construction of ships, and with the number of men borne on
                    the strength of the fleet. The highest number of men borne in the navy was in
                    1813—when 147,047 seamen and marines were borne, and when the total charge was
                    £21,212,012, and the year ended with a navy debt of £8,562,291. This was the
                    largest charge ever made for the navy, except in 1855 (the year of war with
                    Russia), when the charge was £21,394,216.</p>
                <p>Below is a statement showing the number of men voted, the number actually borne,
                    and the charge, for typical years between 1690 and 1881 :—</p>

                <p>In reviewing her resources generally for manning the navy, England may, as Sir
                    Thomas Brassey says, fairly look to the reserves, no less than to the number of
                    men actually borne for fleet service. The coastguard on shore has been
                    maintained for many years at an average strength of 4000 men. The naval reserves
                    have averaged, between 1868 and 1881, 15,785 men. The same authority gave the
                    following figures in 1882 :—pensioner reserve, 1560; first class royal naval
                    reserve, 11,800; second class, 5600; third class, 150; and naval artillery
                    volunteers, 1400. The total reserve for manning a war navy was considered by him
                    to be not less than 40,000 men.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Personnel of Modern Navies Compared.</hi></p>
                <p>In any comparison of the personnel of modern navies, the question of the strength
                    of the mercantile marine is more important than it is in relation to the
                    matériel. Sir T. Brassey reminds us that, of the 140 English ships which were
                    assembled to oppose the Spanish Armada, only 28 belonged to the royal navy, and
                    that Drake, Hawkins, and Frobisher, who commanded the fleet under Lord Howard,
                    were masters in the merchant navy; also that Howe’s victory of 1st June 1794 was
                    gained by the merchant seamen of the kingdom. It is estimated by the same
                    authority that, if the system of naval conscription existing in France were
                    applied to England so as to include, as it does in France, the crews of
                    coasters, fishermen, boatmen, and the workmen in the private shipbuilding yards
                    and the dockyards, there would be a roll of from 700,000 to 800,000 men.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">France. —</hi> The system here was established under Louis
                    XIV., and it comprises a term of compulsory service, by means of which France
                    inscribes on her rolls some 170,000 men, of whom the great majority are
                    fishermen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                <p>The personnel of the navy below the rank of officer is recruited, (1) by the men
                    of the maritime inscription, (2) by voluntary engagements, and (3) in the case
                    of an insufficiency of men of the first two categories, by a contingent from the
                    general recruiting of the country told off for the navy.</p>

                    on Government or on merchant ships, or who can count eighteen months of
                    navigation or two years of coast fishing, and who declares his intention of
                    continuing a seafaring life, is inscribed as a sailor, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0310-0299"/> can be levied for the service of the fleet. Every
                    sailor who is inscribed is called into active service on completing twenty years
                    of age. During the month in which he accomplishes his twentieth year, or during
                    the month which follows his return to France, he is bound to present himself
                    before a commissary of the maritime inscription. He is then enrolled, sent to a
                    port which is the chief town of an arrondissement, and incorporated in a
                    division of sailors of the fleet. If he be considered fit for service, he can,
                    from the age of eighteen years, forestall his call to active service. The young
                    sailor who joins at eighteen years of age performs his service in two periods.
                    During the first, which lasts for five years, he may, when in France, be given
                    renewable furlough without pay, and can then devote himself to navigation of any
                    description. After this first period he remains for two years longer in the same
                    conditions, on renewable furlough. The time passed in this position of renewable
                    furlough is counted as service to the state for every sailor who engages to
                    navigate only in coasting voyages or in home fishing. After this latter period
                    the sailor cannot again be called out except by decree in case of emergency.
                    After serving for three years, the sailor who has not been sent on furlough is
                    entitled to an increase of 2d. to his daily pay. The levies of sailors for duty
                    with the fleet are first made amongst those who have not hitherto rendered any
                    service to the state, then, in case of insufficiency, amongst those who have the
                    least service, or, in case of equal service, those are taken who have been
                    longest on furlough. Inscribed sailors have alone the right of carrying on
                    maritime navigation or coast fishing, and enjoy various other privileges and
                    immunities. The minimum age for the engagement of naval apprentices is eighteen
                    years, the privilege of making an engagement at sixteen years being reserved to
                    young men leaving the school for ship boys, and to those specially selected by
                    the minister. The maximum age for young men who have not rendered any service to
                    the state is fixed at twenty-four years. This is increased to thirty for
                    musicians, stokers, carpenters, sailmakers, and caulkers who can count at least
                    five years’ previous service since the age of sixteen. For pupils and
                    quartermaster mechanicians <hi rend="italic">{quartiers-maîtres
                    mécaniciens)</hi> and working mechanicians <hi rend="italic">{ouvriers
                    mécaniciens)</hi> the minimum limit of age is eighteen and the maximum
                    twenty-five, if they have not previously served the state, or thirty if they
                    belong to either of the callings above mentioned and have rendered previous
                    service to the state.</p>
                <p>2. Voluntary engagements are only allowed according to the requirements of the
                    service. They cannot be made in the colonies. The conditions are the same as for
                    the army. The engagement is made for five years. Re-engagements can be made by
                    sailors of the fleet for three, four, or five years. They are without conditions
                    of age or service, provided only that their length would not retain warrant
                    officers <hi rend="italic">{officiers mariniers)</hi> in the service beyond the
                    age of fifty-five, and quartermasters and sailors beyond fifty, if they can
                    unite with this age a service of twenty-five years.</p>
                <p>3. For men of the navy who do not belong to the maritime inscription, the time of
                    service is five years and in the reserve four years. They then pass immediately
                    into the reserve of the territorial army, in which they remain until they attain
                    forty years of age. The contingent is furnished in proper proportion from each
                    canton, and is composed of the young men comprised in the first part of the
                    cantonal recruiting list, to whom the lowest numbers have fallen when drawing
                    lots.</p>
                <p>The number of men obtained by the general recruiting was 6056 in 1873, 7040 in
                    1874, 6406 in 1875, and 4326 in 1876.</p>
                <p>The sailors on shore are divided into five divisions, of which two (those at
                    Brest and Toulon) are of the first class and three are of the second class. In
                    each division there is a council of administration, entrusted with clothing and
                    pay duties, and, in fact, with all administrative questions. Each first class
                    division consists of a staff and of depot companies, as follows:—one company of
                    seamen gunners <hi rend="italic">{matelots canonniers),</hi> one company of
                    seamen fusiliers <hi rend="italic">{matelots fusiliers),</hi> one company of
                    mechanicians and stokers, three companies of sailors of the maritime
                    inscription, one company of sailors from the general recruiting. The divisions
                    of the second class are each composed of a staff and depot companies as
                    follows:—one company of special branches, two companies of sailors of the
                    maritime inscription and from the general recruiting. Each of these companies is
                    divided into two sections. The division at Lorient comprises, in addition, an
                    instruction battalion of fusilier apprentices. In each division there is an
                    elementary school, a school for teaching bookkeeping to quartermaster-serjeants,
                    a gymnasium, a fencing school, and a swimming school. In the two first divisions
                    there are also music schools. The first masters and second masters belonging to
                    the different special branches and professions form the cadre of the warrant
                    officers of the fleet. When of equal grade, they are classed in the following
                    order:—navigation, gunnery, musketry, steering, mechanicians, carpenters,
                    sailmakers, and caulkers. When not serving afloat or in the divisions, these
                    masters are placed in <hi rend="italic">disponibilité</hi> at their homes, with
                    reduced pay, and are recalled to active service according to roster. The budget
                    for 1878 shows that eighty-nine <hi rend="italic">officiers de vaisseau</hi> are
                    to be employed with the shore divisions of crews and with the establishment for
                    pupils. The number of men provided for is as below (bandmasters, officers,
                    quartermasters, sailors, boys, and supernumeraries):—onshore, 8438; afloat,
                    25,063; reserve, 1607; total, 35,108.</p>
                <p>The marine infantry is not employed in service on board men-of-war in the same
                    manner as the marines of the British navy. Its duties are to garrison the five
                    military ports and the colonies, and to take part in maritime and other wars.
                    When necessary, it furnishes detachments on board ships belonging to the
                    state.</p>

                    The whole of the maritime population, inclusive of the technical personnel, are
                    absolved from land duties, but are liable to serve in the fleet. The
                    distribution of the annual levy is dependent upon the seafaring population, the
                    quota contributed by each state being deducted from its whole liability for the
                    land and sea forces. It used to be the practice to draw exclusively from the
                    seafaring population of the provinces of Prussia, Pomerania, Hanover,
                    Schleswig-Holstein, and other federal states, but it has been found necessary to
                    draw upon the land population of the above provinces in order to make up the
                    required quota.</p>
                <p>The personnel of the navy includes the following officers, noncommissioned
                    officers, and men :—1 chief of the admiralty, 4 rear-admirals, 17 (23) captains,
                    36 (63) captains of corvette, 65 (165) captain lieutenants, 104 (118)
                    lieutenants, 86 (140) sub-lieutenants, and 100 (229) naval cadets, 83 (147) deck
                    officers, 580 (1546) noncommissioned officers of seamen, 4290 (10,267) seamen,
                    330 (499) non-commissioned officers. Besides these there are 12 engineers, 90
                    (304) deck officers (engineers and masters), 110 (189) engineers’ mates, 28
                    engineers’ apprentices, 580 (2131) firemen, 154 (570) masters’ mates, 450 (698)
                    mechanics, 84 (154) staff sergeants for police purposes.</p>
                <p>Every German (except in a few well-defined cases) is liable to service in the
                    army or navy, and is not allowed to provide a substitute nor to purchase
                    exemption. Liability to service commences with the completion of the seventeenth
                    year, and lasts until the close of the forty-second year of age. Of this time,
                    twelve years must be passed in the standing army and landwehr in the case of a
                    soldier, in the fleet and seewehr in the case of a seaman. All men liable to
                    service, who may not be called into the standing army, fleet, landwehr, or
                    seewehr, are liable to be called out in the landsturm in time of war. The
                    estimated seafaring population of North Germany is about 80,000, including
                    fishermen and dock labourers.</p>

                    service takes place according to fixed instructions. The men who are passed as
                    fit and suited for the navy are divided into two categories by lot. Those of the
                    first category are drawn into the service, and have to serve four years either
                    on board or on shore (they pass the remaining six years on unlimited furlough).
                    The men of the second category, however, are allowed to go at once on unlimited
                    furlough, and are only called up in case of war or similar emergency. They are
                    also liable for service for ten years. Volunteers and boys trained at the
                    various naval training establishments are obliged to serve eight years
                    continuously. The number of men per annum who reach the age rendering them
                    liable for service is about 5050 on an average, of whom 2600 are fit or suited
                    for the service. Of these, from 1500 to 1800 are placed in the first category
                    (200 volunteers). Naval officers are chiefly obtained from the naval schools.
                    Under-officers seldom obtain the rank of officer, and only then after a
                    searching examination. The law on promotion of the year 1871 fixes the rules of
                    promotion for all ranks.</p>

                    recommendation of the minister of war, and promulgated to the senate by an
                    imperial ukase. Admission to the service is determined by lot drawing, in which

                    attained the age of twenty years in 1880 was 794,000. The contingent to join on
                    the 1st (13th) January 1881 was fixed at 235,000, and of this number 231,961
                    were enrolled. According to the statutes the number of sailors in the navy
                    should be about 50,000. Of these in time of peace there are serving afloat
                    28,000, and employed ashore 12,000,—the remaining 10,000 being on unlimited
                    furlough. In 1879 the appropriation of the conscripts actually enrolled in the
                    navy was 4504 for the Baltic fleet, 446 for the Black Sea fleet, 72 for the

                    for twelve years, of which three are spent in the standing army, seven in the
                    reserve, and two in the landwehr; men who are incorporated in the landwehr at
                    once serve in it for twelve years. In the navy the period of service is for ten
                    years, of which three years are active and seven years reserve service. The
                    conscription is confined to Dalmatia and the coast districts. One-third of the
                    whole complement of officers and men required to man the fleet in time of war is
                    kept continuously afloat in peace; the war complement is 8079 of all ranks, of
                    whom 2700 are actively employed; the war complement comprises (besides
                    rear-admiral and. staff of the squadron)—officers, &amp;c., 571; sailors and

                <p>To show briefly the general result of all this organization of matériel and
                    personnel, it is perhaps sufficient to state the number of ships in commission
                    at a given date in the present year (1883), and the numbers of their crews.</p>
                <p>Including stationary and harbour ships, tenders, training and drill ships, troop
                    and surveying ships, there are from 230 to 240 ships and vessels in commission
                    in the British navy, mounting about 1400 guns, and having a personnel, all told,
                    of about 34,000 officers, men, and boys. Excluding the vessels specially
                    referred to above, and taking only those which may be regarded as fighting
                    vessels, the number in commission falls to about 100, with about 800 guns, and
                    22,000 officers, men, and boys in the crews. Comparing this with foreign navies,
                    the proportions may be fairly stated as follows :—</p>

                <p>The American navy came into existence shortly after the Declaration of
                    Independence. As early as October 1775 Congress authorized the construction of
                    two national cruisers, and, at the same time, appointed a marine committee to
                    administer naval affairs. The first force, consisting of purchased vessels,
                    badly fitted and built, and insufficiently equipped and manned, embraced two
                    ships of 24 guns each, six brigs carrying from 10 to 12 guns, two schooners each
                    with 8 guns, and four sloops, three of 10 guns and one of 4 guns. On December
                    22d a personnel of officers was selected, one of the lieutenants being the
                    well-known Paul Jones. Ezekiel Hopkins was made commander-in-chief, but, having
                    incuιτed the censure of Congress, he was dismissed early in 1777, and since then
                    the title has never been revived except in the person of the president. In
                    November 1776 the grades of admiral, vice-admiral, rear-admiral, and commodore
                    were assimilated in rank and precedence to relative army titles, but they were
                    never created by law until 1862. During the war a number of spirited engagements
                    occurred, but there was a great lack of efficient material at home, and agents
                    abroad were not able to enlist the active sympathies of nations or rulers.
                    Benjamin Franklin did manage to equip one good squadron, but this was rendered
                    almost useless by internal dissensions, and it required the victory of Paul
                    Jones in the “Bon Homme Richard” over the “Serapis” to bring about any tangible
                    result for the risk taken. During the war 800 vessels of all classes were made
                    prizes, but the navy lost by capture 11 vessels of war and a little squadron of
                    gunboats on the lakes; and, with 13 ships destroyed to avoid capture by the
                    British, 5 condemned, and 3 wrecked at sea, the country was practically without
                    a naval force between 1780 and 1785.</p>
                <p>Owing to the depredations upon commerce of the Barbary powers, Congress in 1794
                    ordered the construction of six frigates, prescribing that four of them should
                    be armed with 44 guns and two with 36 guns; but, the Berbers having made peace,
                    the number of vessels was reduced one half, and no additions were made until
                    1797, when the “Constitution,” “United States,” and “Constellation” were built.
                    Trouble with France from 1798 to 1801 resulted in the formation of four
                    squadrons operating in the West Indies; these numbered 21 vessels in all, and,
                    besides capturing nearly one hundred prizes, they gained experience and prestige
                    by many short and decisive single actions. No further increase was made until
                    1802, when the war with Tripoli was declared; up to this time the navy had cost
                    the country, including sites for navy yards, only £2,000,000. In 1803 the
                    “gunboat policy” was revived, but, though 188 vessels of this class were built,
                    their service was unimportant and their usefulness questionable.</p>
                <p>At the breaking out of hostilities with Great Britain in June 1812, the naval
                    force of the United States consisted of a number of gunboats fitted for the
                    protection of rivers and inlets, and of 17 sea-going ships, 9 of which were
                    below the frigate class. From the close of the war in 1815 until the beginning
                    of hostilities with Mexico in 1846, the American navy was engaged in the
                    suppression of the slave-trade and of piracy, and in voyages of exploration and
                    discovery. In 1846 California, after being once relinquished, was seized, and
                    during the war the United States vessels were employed in blockading or
                    capturing the ports upon both seaboards of Mexico, and in co-operating with the
                    army,—all hostilities ceasing in 1847 with the occupation of the city of Mexico.
                    In 1848 Lieutenant Lynch commanded an expedition engaged on the exploration of
                    the Dead Sea and the river Jordan; in 1856 the ‘ ‘ Advance” and “Rescue”
                    searched for Sir John Franklin, followed later by the expeditions of Kane and of
                    Hartstene; in 1854 Strain made a partial survey of the Isthmus of Panama; and in
                    1855 Rear-Admiral John Rodgers, in the “Vincennes,” went farther into the Arctic
                    Ocean through Behring’s Strait than any previous navigator. In 1858 the Paraguay
                    expedition successfully finished its work; and for many years, earnestly aided
                    by Great Britain, a squadron was employed on the coast of Africa and in the West
                    Indies for the suppression of the slave-trade.</p>
                <p>The civil war broke out in April 1861, and its naval character was marked by two
                    leading features: the first was that, while one side had a small force of naval
                    vessels, which were generally good of their kind, the other entered the contest
                    with absolutely nothing that could be called a man-of-war; the second was that,
                    though certain developments in the character and construction of ships and
                    weapons had been foreshadowed before the war, and had even been partially
                    realized, it was during the progress of the struggle that those changes took
                    place in marine warfare which amounted to a revolution. The effect of rifle and
                    shell-fire, the employment of the ram, the destructive energy of torpedoes, the
                    application of armour to the sides of vessels, and the superiority of
                    iron-armoured ships—all taught in practice what theory had in vain asserted. At
                    the commencement of hostilities the number of vessels of all kinds in commission
                    was 76; 136 were purchasedin 1861, making the total 264, while the roll of
                    enlisted men increased from 7500 to 22,000. At the close of the war there were
                    51,500 seamen and 7000 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n312/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0312-0301"/> officers of all grades, and over 600 vessels; at
                    the navy yards 6880 artisans were employed; 208 steamers were built, and 313 out
                    of a total of 481 were purchased, all at a cost of over £3,000,000; 340 were
                    afterwards sold for £1,500,000. On the 1st of January 1865 there were 5278
                    volunteer officers in service, but in 1870 this number had been reduced to 111,
                    excluding 64 out of 305 applicants who had been admitted to the regular service.
                    The Confederate navy was modelled precisely upon that of the Federal States. In
                    the autumn of 1864, when at a maximum, it consisted of 16 ironclads, 3 of which
                    were rated as floating batteries, of 50 wooden vessels, and of the rover
                    “Shenandoah.” Abroad cruisers were of great assistance to the Confederacy, the
                    most notable of these being the “Sumter,” “Alabama,” “Georgia,” “Florida,”
                    “Rappahannock,” and “Shenandoah.”</p>
                <p>Since the close of the war the United States navy has been doing excellent
                    service in the peaceful pathways of science and humanity, the only warlike
                    demonstrations having been that against Formosa in 1867 and that against Corea
                    in 1870. Expeditions have been sent to the Arctic Ocean; ships have been
                    employed in the survey of every sea; deep-sea soundings have been made both in
                    the Atlantic and the Pacific; and five expeditions have tried to solve the
                    problem of the best route for a trans-isthmian and inter-oceanic canal;
                    scientific observers have occupied stations, and with important results, in the
                    transit observations, and to-day the chain of telegraphic measurements of
                    longitude around the whole world is the work of American naval officers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Condition.—</hi> During the revolutionary
                    war Congress through its committees and agents managed naval affairs. In 1789
                    these duties were entrusted to the secretary of war, and it was not until 1798
                    that the “department of the navy” was established. In 1815 a “board of
                    commissioners for the navy” was constituted, but the Act provided that nothing
                    in it should be construed to take from the secretary his control of marine
                    affairs. In 1842 this law was repealed, and the bureau system, under which all
                    the duties were divided specifically among five offices, was established; in
                    1862 there was a new division of responsibilities, and the eight bureaus now
                    existing were created. Each of these is under the control of a naval officer,
                    nominated by the executive and confirmed by the senate, all chiefs of bureaus
                    having assigned them the temporary rank of commodore, actual or relative, when
                    their own grades are below this. The bureaus are—(1) navigation, which controls
                    all matters relating to pilotage and. navigation, with a direct superintendence
                    of the naval observatory and of the hydrographic, signal, naval intelligence,
                    <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> war record, compass, and detail
                    offices,—this last having charge of the personnel of the service; (2) ordnance,
                    which administers all artillery, ordnance, and torpedo matters; (3) equipment
                    and recruiting, which is in charge of outfits, equipments, stores, recruiting,
                    and apprenticeships; (4) yards and docks, which superintends the construction of
                    docks, naval grounds, buildings, and all civil-engineering work; (5) medicine
                    and surgery; (6) provisions and clothing, which is responsible for the supplies
                    of food, water, and clothing, and manages the accounts, thus performing under
                    one direction these duties relegated in the army to the quartermaster,
                    commissary, and paymaster; (7) steam engineering, which designs and has the care
                    of engines and boilers; and (8) construction and repair, which performs the same
                    duties for ships. The first four bureaus are under the direction of
                    line-officers of the navy.</p>
                <p>There are no maritime districts in the United States, naval authority being
                    limited strictly to the navy-yard government. At present there are seven navy
                    yards and three naval stations, in which the general administration is entrusted
                    to specific departments, all under the direct command of a line-officer of high
                    rank, and each corresponding to a bureau of the central control. It is the
                    intention of the Government to close all but three of the yards, maintaining
                    those at New York, Norfolk, and San Francisco (Mare Island), together with a
                    repair arsenal at Washington.</p>
                <p>The judge advocate’s office and the Naval Academy are under the special
                    supervision of the secretary. The Naval Academy ranks among the best
                    institutions of the kind in the world. It is situated at Annapolis, Maryland,
                    and is governed by a line-officer superintendent, assisted by an academic board
                    made up of the heads of the departments of discipline and of studies, and with a
                    corps of instructors drawn mainly from the line of the navy, with a few engineer
                    and civilian assistants. All appointments of naval cadets are made by the
                    president upon the nominations of members of Congress; each of the congressional
                    districts, about three hundred in all, is entitled to one representative at the
                    institution, admission after nomination being based upon a rigorous examination.
                    The curriculum is for four years, supplemented by a two years’ cruise before
                    final graduation.</p>
                <p>Corresponding to Greenwich Hospital in its days of old pensioners is the Naval
                    Asylum, situated at Philadelphia; and at New’port, Rhode Island, are the
                    headquarters of the torpedo station and of the training system for apprentices.
                    The naval experimental battery is at Annapolis, though not a part of the Naval
                    Academy; and in all the large seaboard towns are rendezvous for the shipping of
                    men, and branches of the hydrographic office for the dissemination of maritime
                    information.</p>
                <p>The personnel of the active list includes 1410 commissioned officers (602 of whom
                    are at sea and 808 on shore), 7500 men, and 700 apprentices; there is also a
                    corps of marine infantry, with 1887 enlisted men and 75 officers. All
                    enlistments of sailors are voluntary, and for a period of three years, with
                    special inducements for re-enlistment within a fixed period, and with the
                    certainty of a pension or of a billet at the Naval Asylum after twenty-one
                    years* service. There is no reserve, the active list representing the available
                    force. For officers who have attained sixty-two years of age, or who have seen
                    service for a term varying from forty to forty-five years, there is a retired
                    list which entitles them without delay to 75 per cent, of their highest sea pay.
                    Upon this list also there are officers, and in the Naval Asylum there are men,
                    who are incapacitated for active service by reason of physical or other causes.
                    Apprentices are enlisted between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, with
                    obligatory service until the age of twenty-one is attained.</p>
                <p>There are five foreign stations, divided geographically,—the North Atlantic,
                    South Atlantic, European, Pacific, and Asiatic. In January 1883 there were 140
                    vessels of all kinds on the register, 23 of which were in commission for general
                    cruising, and 5 were employed on special service. Three modern steel steamers
                    are being built at a private yard, and Congress has under consideration a new
                    construction plan; by an annual expenditure of $4,283,000 this will give in ten
                    years a modern steel navy of 70 ships, in every λvay adequate to the demands of
                    the country. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1885, require for
                    the ordinary purposes of the navy $16,319,307'62, and for the increase of the
                    navy, including the completion of four double-turreted monitors of the armoured
                    fleet, $7,449,581'76, or a total of $23,768,889'38. The present effective
                    cruising force is composed of 1 first rate, 14 second rates, and 21 third rates,
                    or 36 in all; the available armoured vessels are 13 monitors of the old
                    single-turreted type and 6 double-turreted monitors, lately rebuilt.</p>
                <p>The coast survey and lighthouse establishment, both mainly in charge of naval
                    officers, the revenue marine, life-saving, steamboat inspection, and marine
                    hospital services, are all a part of the treasury department; the transfer of
                    their control to the navy department is asked of Congress by the secretary of
                    the navy, who also recommends the establishment, under his administration, of a
                    bureau of mercantile marine, the duties of which -will be analogous to those of
                    the mercantile marine department of the Board of Trade. (J D. J K. )</p>
