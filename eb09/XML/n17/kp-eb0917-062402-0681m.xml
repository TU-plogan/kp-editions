                <p><label type="entry">NUMERALS</label>. The use of visible signs to represent
                    numbers and aid reckoning is not only older than writing but older than the
                    development of numerical language on the denary system; we count by tens because
                    our ancestors counted on their fingers and named numbers accordingly. So used,
                    the fingers are really numerals, that is, visible <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0682-0625"/> numerical signs; and in antiquity the practice of
                    counting by these natural signs prevailed in all classes of society. Even at
                    this day if a Wallachian peasant wants to multiply 8 by 9 he effects this by
                    making the fingers of each hand, counting from the thumb, represent the numbers
                    from 6 to 10 consecutively. He therefore sets his question by stretching out the
                    ring finger of the right hand and the middle finger of the left. He then counts
                    that in the direction from the thumb there is one more finger on the right hand
                    and two on the left. Multiplying 1 by 2 he gets 2 as the units of the product
                    sought. Again the outstretched fingers are respectively the third and fourth
                    from the thumb; adding 3 and 4 he gets 7 for the tens of the product. By this
                    rule he does not need to know the multiplication table above 4 times 4. In the
                    later times of antiquity the finger symbols were developed into a system capable
                    of expressing all numbers below 10,000. The left hand was held up flat with the
                    fingers together. The units from 1 to 9 were expressed by various positions of
                    the third, fourth, and fifth fingers alone, one or more of these being either
                    closed on the palm or simply bent at the middle joint, according to the number
                    meant. The thumb and index were thus left free to express the tens by a variety
                    of relative positions, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> for 30 their points were
                    brought together and stretched forward; for 50 the thumb was bent like the Greek
                    Γ and brought against the ball of the index. The same set of signs if executed
                    with the thumb and index of the right hand meant hundreds instead of tens, and
                    the unit signs if performed on the right hand meant thousands.<note

                <p>The fingers serve to express numbers, but to make a permanent note of numbers
                    some kind of mark or tally is needed. Thus the Romans kept count of years by
                    yearly driving a nail into the temple of Minerva. The nail in this case is a
                    sort of hieroglyphic, and in all systems of hieroglyphics signs for numbers
                    naturally occur. A single stroke is the obvious representation of unity; higher
                    numbers are indicated by groups of strokes. But when the strokes become many
                    they are confusing, and so a new sign must be introduced, perhaps for 5, at any
                    rate for 10, 100, 1000, and so forth. Intermediate numbers are expressed by the
                    addition of symbols, as in the Roman system ccxxxvi = 236. This simplest way of
                    writing numbers is well seen in the Babylonian inscriptions, where all numbers
                    from 1 to 99 are got by repetition of the vertical arrowhead t = 1, and a barbed
                    sign { = 10. But the most interesting case is the Egyptian, because from its
                    hieratic form sprang the Phoenician numerals, and from them in turn those of
                    Palmyra and the Syrians, as illustrated in table 1. Two things are to be noted
                    in this table—first, the way in which groups of units come to be joined by a
                    cross line, and then run together into a single symbol, and, further, the
                    substitution in the hundreds of a principle of multiplication for the mere
                    addition of symbols. The same thing appears in Babylonia, where a smaller number
                    put to the right of the sign for 100 (T-) is to be added to it, but put to the
                    left gives the number of hundreds. Thus T— = 1000, but t*~ =110. The Egyptians
                    had hieroglyphics for a thousand, a myriad, 100,000 (a frog), a million (a man
                    with arms stretched out in admiration), and even for ten millions.</p>
                <p>Alphabetic writing did not do away with the use of numerical symbols, which were
                    more perspicuous and compendious than words written at length. But the letters
                    of the alphabet themselves came to be used as numerals. One way of doing this
                    was to use the initial letter of the name of a number as its sign. This was the
                    old Greek notation, said to go back to the time of Solon, and usually named
                    after the grammarian Herodian, who described it about 200 A.D. I stood for 1, ∏
                    for 5, Δ for 10, H for 100, X for 1000, and Μ for 10,000; ∏ with Δ in its bosom
                    was 50, with H in its bosom it was 500. Another way of using the alphabet
                    depended on the fixed order of its letters. The simplest application of this
                    principle is to use consecutive letters for consecutive numbers. Thus the 24
                    letters of the Ionic alphabet stood for the numbers 1 to 24, as we still see in
                    the letters attached to the books of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> Another
                    way common to the Greeks, Hebrews, and Syrians, and which in Greece gradually

                <p>Herodian numbers, was to make the first nine letters stand for the units and the
                    rest for the tens and hundreds. With the old Semitic alphabet of 22 letters this
                    system broke down at ∏ = 400, and the higher hundreds had to be got by
                    juxtaposition; but when the Hebrew square character got the distinct final forms
                    ∏, D, ∣, ≡), f these served for the hundreds from 500 to 900. The Greeks with
                    their larger alphabet required but three supplemental signs, which they got by
                    keeping for this purpose two old Phoenician letters which were not used in
                    writing <hi rend="italic">(F</hi> or <hi rend="italic">5</hi> = Ί = 6, and? = p
                    = 90), and by adding sampi <hi rend="smallcaps">tλ</hi> for 900.<note

                    the order of the alphabet and extended it to twenty-eight letters, kept the

                    >f∙</hi> for B*), while the hundreds from 500 to 1000 were expressed by the new
                    letters in order from ώ to £. In the time of Caliph Walid (705-715 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a,d.)</hi> the Arabs had as yet no signs of
                    numeration.</p></note></p>

                <p>Among the Greeks the first certain use of this system seems to be on coins of
                    Ptolemy II. The first trace of it on Semitic ground is on Jewish coins of the
                    Hasmoneans. It is the foundation of gematria as we find it in Jewish books and
                    in the apocalyptic number of the beast ("∣□ρ ∏"∣J = 666). But we do not know how
                    old gematria is; the name is borrowed from the Greek.</p>
                <p>The most familiar case of the use of letters as numerals is the Roman system.
                    Here C is the initial of centum and Μ of mille; but instead of these signs we
                    find older forms, consisting of a circle divided vertically for 1000 and
                    horizontally, θ, or in the cognate Etruscan system divided into quadrants, ∈),
                    for 100. From the sign for 1000, still sometimes roughly shown in print as °I°,
                    comes D, the half of the symbol for half the number; and the older forms of L,
                    viz., 1 or χ, suggest that this also was once half of the hundred symbol. So V
                    (Etruscan Λ) is half of X, which itself is not a true Roman letter. The system,
                    therefore, is hardly alphabetic in origin, though the idea has been thrown out
                    that the signs for 10, 50, and 100 were originally the Greek X, Ψ, Φ, which were
                    not used in writing Latin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Studien.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>When high numbers had to be expressed systems such as we have described became
                    very cumbrous, and in alphabetic systems it became inevitable to introduce a
                    principle of periodicity, by which, for example, the signs for 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.,
                    might be used with a difference to express the same number of thousands.
                    Language itself suggested this principle, and so we find in Hebrew N or in Greek
                    ,α = 1000. So further ∕3Mυ, ∕5M., or simply <hi rend="italic">β.</hi> = 20,000
                    (2 myriads). If now the larger were always written to the left of the smaller
                    elements of a number the diacritic mark could be dispensed with in such a case
                    as <hi rend="italic">βωλa,</hi> (instead of <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> ∕3ωλα)
                    = 2831, for here it was plain that ∕5 = 2OOO, not = 2, since otherwise it would
                    not have preceded ω = 800. We have here the germ of the very important notion
                    that the value of a symbol may be periodic and defined by its position. The same
                    idea had appeared much earlier among the Babylonians, who reckoned by powers of
                    60, calling 60 a <hi rend="italic">soss</hi> and 60 sixties a <hi rend="italic"
                    >sar.</hi> On the tablets of Senkerah a list of squares and cubes is given on
                    this principle, and here the square of 59 is written 58'1—that is, 58 × 60 + 1;
                    and the cube of 30 is 7 ’ 30—that is, 7 sar + 30 soss = 7 × 60 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + 30 × 60. Here again we have value by position; but,
                    as there is no zero, it is left to the judgment of the reader to know which
                    power of 60 is meant in each case. The sexagesimal system, long specially
                    associated with astronomy, has left a trace in our division of the hour and of
                    the circle, but as language goes by powers of 10 it is practically very
                    inconvenient for most purposes of reckoning. The Greek mathematicians used a
                    sort of decimal system; thus Archimedes was able to solve his problem of stating
                    a number greater than that of the grains of sand which would fill the sphere of
                    the fixed stars by dividing numbers into octades, the unit of the second octade
                    being 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> and of the third 10 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 16</hi>. So too Apollonius of Perga teaches multiplication
                    by regarding 7 as the <hi rend="italic">pythmen</hi> of 70, 700, and so forth.
                    One must then find successively the product of the several pythmens of the
                    multiplier and the multiplicand, noticing in each case what are tens, what
                    hundreds, and so on, and adding the results. The want of a sign for zero made it
                    impossible mechanically to distinguish the tens, hundreds, &amp;c., as we now
                    do.</p>
                <p>Very early, however, a mechanical contrivance, the abacus, had been introduced
                    for keeping numbers of different denominations apart. This was a table with
                    compartments or columns for counters, each column representing a different value
                    to be given to a counter placed on it. This might be used either for concrete
                    arithmetic—say with columns for pence, shillings, and pounds; or for abstract
                    reckoning—say with the Babylonian sexagesimal system. An old Greek abacus found
                    at Salamis has columns which, taken from right to left, give a counter the value
                    of 1, 10, 100, 1000 drachms, and finally of 1 talent (6000 drachms)
                    respectively. An abacus on the decimal system might be ruled on paper or on a
                    board strewed with fine sand, and was then a first step to the decimal system.
                    Two important steps, however, were still lacking: the first was to use instead
                    of counters distinctive marks (ciphers) for the digits from one to nine; the
                    second and more important was to get a sign for zero, so that the columns might
                    be dispensed with, and the denomination of each cipher seen at once by counting
                    the number of digits following it. These two steps taken, we have at once the
                    modern so-called Arabic numerals and the possibility of modern arithmetic; but
                    the invention of the ciphers and zero came but slowly, and their history is a
                    most obscure problem.</p>
                <p>What is quite certain is that our present decimal system, in its complete form,
                    with the zero which enables us to do without the ruled columns of the abacus, is
                    of Indian origin. From the Indians it passed to the Arabians, probably along
                    with the astronomical tables brought to Baghdad by an Indian ambassador in 773
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> At all events the system was explained in Arabic
                    in the early part of the 9th century by the famous Abù Ja'far Mohammed
                    al-Khârizml, and from that time continued to spread, though at first slowly,
                    through the Arabian world.</p>
                <p>In Europe the complete system with the zero was derived from the Arabs in the
                    12th century, and the arithmetic based on this system was known by the name of
                    algoritmus, algorithm. This barbarous word is nothing more than a transcription
                    of Al-Kharizmi, as was conjectured by Reinaud, and has become plain since the
                    publication of a unique Cambridge MS. containing a Latin translation—perhaps by
                    Adelhard of Bath—of the lost arithmetical treatise of the Arabian
                    mathematician.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Published

                    as in the other old systems we have dealt with. Like the Indian alphabet, they
                    are probably derived from abroad, but, as in the case <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n684/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0684-0627"/> of the alphabet, their origin is obscure. The
                    forms of the later Indian numerals for the nine digits appear to be clearly
                    derived from the earlier system. In table 2 the first two lines give forms
                    earlier than the introduction of the system of position, while the Devanagari in
                    the third line was used with a zero and position value. The “cave” numerals were
                    employed during the first centuries of the Christian era. The earliest known
                    example of a date written on the modern system is of 738 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> while the old system is found in use as late as the early part of
                    the 7th century (Bayley). On the other hand, there is some evidence that a
                    system of value by position was known to Sanskrit writers on arithmetic in the
                    6th Christian century. These writers, however, do not use ciphers, but
                    symbolical words and letters, so that it is not quite clear whether they refer
                    to a system which had a zero, or to a system worked on an abacus, where the zero
                    is represented by a blank column. There is no proof as yet for the use of any
                    system of position in India before the 6th century, and nothing beyond
                    conjecture can be offered as to its origin.</p>
                <p>(2) In Europe, before the introduction of the algorithm or full Indo-Arabic
                    system with the zero, we find a transition system in which calculations were
                    made on the decimal system with an abacus, but instead of unit counters there
                    were placed in the columns ciphers, with values from one to nine, and of forms
                    that are at bottom the Indian forms and agree most nearly with the numerals used
                    by the Arabs of Africa and Spain. For among the Arabs themselves there were
                    varieties in the forms of the Indian numeral, and in particular an eastern and a
                    western type. The latter is called ghobar (dust), a name which seems to connect
                    it with the use of a sand-spread tablet for calculation. The abacus with ciphers
                    instead of counters was used at Rheims about 970-980 by Gerbert, who afterwards
                    was pope under the title of Sylvester II., and it became well known in the 11th
                    century. Where did Gerbert learn the use of the abacus with ciphers? There is no
                    direct evidence as to this, for the story in William of Malmesbury, that he
                    stole it from an Arab in Spain, is generally given up as fabulous. On the other
                    hand, no evidence is offered for an earlier use of the abacus with ciphers,
                    except a passage describing the system in the <hi rend="italic">Geometria</hi>
                    ascribed to Boetius. If this book is genuine the Indian numerals were known in
                    Europe and applied to the abacus in the 5th century, and Gerbert only revived
                    the long-forgotten system. On this view we have to explain how Boetius got the
                    ciphers. The <hi rend="italic">Geometria</hi> ascribes the system to the
                    “Pythagorici ”— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Neo-Pythagoreans—and it has
                    been thought possible that the Indian forms for the numerals reached Alexandria,
                    along with the cruder form of value by position involved in the use of the
                    abacus without a zero, before direct communication between Europe and India
                    ceased, which it did about the 4th century A.D. It is then further conjectured
                    by Woepcke that the ghobar numerals of the western Arabs were by them borrowed
                    from the system of Boetius before the full Indian method with the zero reached
                    them; and thus the resemblance between these forms and those in MSS. of Boetius,
                    which are essentially the same as in other MSS. of the 11th century, would be
                    explained. This view, however, presents great difficulties, of which the total
                    disappearance of all trace of the system between Boetius and Gerbert is only
                    one. We have no proof that the Indians ever used such an abacus, or that they
                    had value by position at so early a date as is required, and the ghobar numerals
                    are too similar to those of the eastern Arabs to make it very credible that the
                    two systems had been separated for centuries. The genuineness of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Geometria</hi> is still ably maintained by Cantor, but it has been
                    attacked on other grounds than that of the passage about the abacus; and on the
                    whole it is still an open question whether the abacus with ciphers is not the
                    outcome of an early imperfect knowledge of the Arabic system, Gerbert or some
                    other having got the signs and a general idea of value by position without
                    having an explanation of the zero.</p>

                    references to the copious literature will be found in Cantor and Friedlein, who
                    also discuss the subject of the notation for fractions, which cannot be entered
                    on here. For systems passed over here, see Pihan, <hi rend="italic">Exposé des
