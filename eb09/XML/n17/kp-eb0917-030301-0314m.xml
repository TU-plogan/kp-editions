                    p'J}), was the name among the Hebrews for a peculiar kind of devotee. The
                    characteristic marks of a Nazarite were unshorn locks and abstinence from wine
                    (Judg. xiii. 5; 1 Sam. i. 11; Amos ii. 11, 12); full regulations for the legal
                    observance of the Nazarite vow are given in Numb, vi., where every product of
                    the grape-vine is forbidden, and the Nazarite is further enjoined to abstain
                    from approaching a dead body, even if it be that of his nearest relative. The
                    law in question is not pre-exilic, and is plainly directed to the regulation of
                    a known usage. It contemplates the assumption of the vow for a limited period,
                    and gives particular details as to the atoning ceremonies at the sanctuary by
                    which the vow must be recommenced if broken by accidental defilement, and the
                    closing sacrifice, at which the Nazarite, on the expiry of his vow, cuts off his
                    hair and burns it on the altar, thus returning to ordinary life. Among the later
                    Jews the Nazarite vow of course corresponded with 'the legal ordinance, which
                    was further developed by the scribes in their usual manner (Mishna, <hi
                    rend="italic">Näzir</hi><hi rend="italic">-,</hi> comp. 1 Mac. iii. 49; Acts i.
                    23 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Joseph., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xix. 6, 1;
                    Id., A. <hi rend="italic">J.,</hi> ii. 15, 1). On the other hand, in the
                    earliest historical case, that of Samson, and in the similar case of Samuel
                    (who, however, is not called a Nazarite), the head remains unshorn throughout
                    life, and in these times the ceremonial observances as to uncleanness must have
                    been less precise. Samson’s mother is forbidden to eat unclean things during
                    pregnancy, but Samson him self touches the carcase of a lion and is often in
                    contact with the slain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In the cases of Samuel and Samson the unshorn locks are a mark of consecration to
                    God (DT⅛κ *τqj, Judg. xiii. 5) for a particular service,—in the one case the
                    service of the sanctuary, in the other the deliverance of Israel from the
                    Philistines. Since, moreover, the Hebrew root <hi rend="smallcaps">n-z-r</hi> is
                    only dialectically different from <hi rend="smallcaps">n-d-r,</hi> “to vow,”
                    both corresponding to the same original Semitic root (Arabic <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">n-dh-r),</hi> it would seem that the peculiar marks of the
                    Nazarite are primarily no more than the usual sign that a man is under a vow of
                    some kind. To leave the locks unshorn during an arduous undertaking in which the
                    divine aid was specially implored, and to consecrate the hair after success, was
                    a practice among various ancient nations, of which examples may be seen in
                    Spencer, <hi rend="italic">De Legibtιs</hi><hi rend="italic">Heb.,</hi> iii. 1,
                    cap. 6; but the closest parallel to the Hebrew’ custom is found in Arabia. There
                    the vow was generally one of war or revenge <hi rend="italic">{Hamdsa,</hi> p.
                    167; 'Antara, <hi rend="italic">Moal.,</hi> 1. 74; <hi rend="italic">Moh. in
                    Medina,</hi> p. 201), and till it was accomplished the man who vowed left his
                    hair unshorn and unkempt, and abstained from wine, women, ointment, and perfume.
                    Such is the figure of Shanfara as described in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ldmiya.</hi> The observances of the <hi rend="italic">ihrdm</hi> belong to the
                    same usage (see vol. xv. p. 674), and we find that at Tâif it was customary to
                    shear the hair at the sanctuary after a journey <hi rend="italic">(Moh. in
                    Medina,</hi> p. 381). The affinity between the Arabian usage and a case like
                    that of Samson is obvious, and the consecration of Samuel has also its Arabic
                    parallel in the dedication of an unborn child by its mother to the service of
                    the Ka'ba (Ibn Hishâm, p. 76; Azrakl, p. 128); but we have not sufficient data
                    to enable us to trace the further development of the Nazarite vow among the
                    Hebrews. The spirit of warlike patriotism that characterized the old religion of
                    Israel could scarcely fail to encourage such vows (comp. 2 Sam. xi. 11, and
                    perhaps 1 Sam. xxi. 4, 5), and from the allusion in Amos we are led to suppose
                    that at one time the Nazari tes had an importance —perhaps even an
                    organization—parallel to that of the prophets, while on the other hand the
                    Canaanized popular religion of the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    made light of an institution that belonged to a very different religious type
                    from Canaanite nature worship. The Nazarites as they appear in Amos have another
                    parallel in the Rechabites.</p>
