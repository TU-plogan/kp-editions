                <p><label type="entry">NEWTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1725-1807), a
                    prominent Evangelical clergyman of the Church of England, and an intimate friend
                    of the poet Cowper, was born in London 24th July 1725. His father, who for a
                    long time was master of a ship in the Mediterranean trade, became in 1748
                    governor of York Fort, Hudson’s Bay, where he died in 1750; his mother, a pious
                    Dissenter, died when he was hardly seven years old. The only time spent by him
                    at school was from his eighth to his tenth year, at Stratford, Essex. When only
                    eleven years of age he joined his father’s ship, where he continued to serve
                    under him till 1742; shortly afterwards he was impressed on board a man-of-war,
                    the</p>
                <p>Harwich,” where he was made a midshipman. For an attempt to escape while his ship
                    lay off Plymouth he was degraded, and treated with so much severity that when
                    two men from a Guinea ship came aboard the man-of-war off Madeira he was glad to
                    take advantage of the opportunity to exchange into an African trader. At Sierra
                    Leone he left this ship and entered into the service of a slave trader, with
                    whom he remained two years. The hardships he suffered were, however, so severe
                    that he brought them under the notice of his father, by whose directions an
                    English ship called for him in 1747 and brought him to England. Shortly
                    afterwards he became mate on board a Liverpool slave ship, with which he made
                    another voyage to Guinea, returning by the West Indies and Charleston. After his
                    marriage in 1750 he made several similar voyages as master, devoting his leisure
                    time to the improvement of his education, especially in mathematics, French, and
                    Latin. The state of his health and a growing aversion to the slave trade led him
                    to quit the sea in 1755, when he was appointed tide-surveyor at Liverpool. He
                    now directed his attention to the study of Greek and Hebrew, and in 1758, in
                    consequence of a gradual deepening of his religious convictions which had been
                    going on for years, applied to the archbishop of York for holy orders. This was
                    refused him, but, having had the curacy of Olney offered to him in April 1764,
                    he was ordained deacon by the bishop of Lincoln, and in June of the following
                    year was ordained priest. About three and a half years afterwards Cowper the
                    poet settled in the parish. An intimate friendship sprung up between them, and
                    they published together the <hi rend="italic">Olney Hymns</hi> (1779). They made
                    it a rule to spend four days of the week in one another’s company, and were
                    rarely “seven successive working hours apart.” In 1779 Newton left Olney to
                    become rector of St Mary Woolnoth, London, where he laboured with unremitting
                    diligence in visiting and preaching till his death, December 31, 1807.</p>
                <p>Like Cowper, Newton held strongly Calvinistic views, although his evangelical
                    fervour allied him closely with the sentiments of Wesley and the Methodists. His
                    enduring fame rests on certain of the <hi rend="italic">Olney Hymns,</hi>
                    remarkable for vigour, simplicity, and directness of devotional utterance, which
                    have passed into almost universal currency throughout the Reformed churches of
                    English speech. His prose works include an <hi rend="italic">Authentic Narrative
                        of some Interesting and Remarkable Particulars in his own Life,</hi> a
                    volume of <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> (1760), <hi rend="italic">Omicron</hi>
                    (a series of letters on religion, 1762), <hi rend="italic">Review of
                        Ecclesiastical History</hi> (1769), and <hi rend="italic">Cardiphonia</hi>
                    (1781); but, though once extensively read, they now, with perhaps the exception
                    of the first-named (a well-told narrative of moral and religious conversion),
                    receive but little attention, and indeed have but little title to a permanent
                    place in religious literature. A <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of Newton by
                    Richard Cecil, first published in 1808, was prefixed to a collected edition of
                    his works which appeared in 6 vols., 1816. Many subsequent editions of his works
                    have been published.</p>
