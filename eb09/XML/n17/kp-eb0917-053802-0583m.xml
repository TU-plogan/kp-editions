                    charge of the distribution of the huge compensation to owners upon the abolition
                    of slavery in the West Indies; it fell to him as lord-lieutenant of Ireland to
                    give effect to the Catholic Emancipation Act; he was English ambassador at Paris
                    during the revolution of 1848, and minister in Tuscany in the years immediately
                    preceding the struggle for Italian unity. The son of the first earl Mulgrave,
                    and born 15th May 1797, he passed through Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge,
                    and sat for the family borough of Scarborough as soon as he attained his
                    majority. But, speaking in favour of Catholic emancipation, and dissenting in
                    other points from the family politics, he thought proper to resign his seat, and
                    went to live in Italy for some two years. Returning in 1822, he was elected for
                    Higham Ferrers, and made a considerable reputation by political pamphlets and by
                    his speeches in the House. He was returned for Malton at the general election of
                    1826, and enrolled himself among the supporters of Canning. Previous to this, in
                    1825, he made his appearance as a novelist with <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi>;
                    and three years later, in 1828, he produced another, <hi rend="italic">Yes
                    and</hi> Ab. Of the brilliant band of fashionable novelists who started up as by
                    a common impulse in those years, including Ward, Lister, Bui wer, Disraeli, Lord
                    Normanby was probably the least impressive; yet his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Matilda</hi> ran through four editions in a year. There is a certain stiffness
                    in the construction of his novels, as if he were either deficient in the
                    story-teller’s vivacity and fertility or, oppressed by his own sense of dignity,
                    over-fastidious in his theory of composition. The novels are comparatively
                    short, and move forward steadily to tragic catastrophes that present themselves
                    ahead from a very early stage in the journey. The moral is so obtrusive that
                    they may almost be called sermons in disguise. Especially is this true of <hi
                    rend="italic">Yes and No,</hi> in which two opposite types of character, the man
                    who says “Yes” with too great facility, and the man who says “No” with too great
                    obstinacy and suspiciousness, are very skilfully contrasted. It was chiefly
                    character that he aimed at, as became a statesman, and his characters were drawn
                    with fulness and keen insight, though not without too much appearance of
                    labour.</p>
                <p>A speech put into the mouth of one of his characters expresses very fairly Lord
                    Normanby’s political creed, a creed not uncommon among the aristocracy at the
                    time of the Reform Bill: “I can’t help thinking it but befits a gentleman to
                    move methodically forward with the main body of the age in its regular march of
                    mind, neither seeking foolish forlorn hopes in advance, nor lagging
                    disgracefully in the rear.” Acting on this principle, Lord Normanby reached the
                    zenith of his career between the age of thirty and forty; after that he began to
                    lag and to decline in political reputation. He succeeded his father as Earl
                    Mulgrave in 1831, was sent out as captaingeneral and governor of Jamaica in the
                    same year, and, in spite of certain defects of manner, gained such credit as an
                    administrator that he was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1835. It is
                    significant of the reputation he then held that his appointment was received
                    with enthusiasm as the beginning of a new order in Ireland; and during his three
                    years of office, one of the most peaceful periods in the history of Ireland,
                    great improvements were made. It is disputed how much was due to him and how
                    much to his subordinate Thomas Drummond. He was created marquis of Normanby in
                    1838, and held successively the offices of colonial secretary and home secretary
                    in the last years of Lord Melbourne’s ministry. From 1846 to 1852 he was
                    ambassador at Paris, and from 1854 to 1858 minister at Florence. He died in
                    London, 28th July 1863. The publication in 1857 of ajournai kept in Paris during
                    the stormy times of 1848 <hi rend="italic">(Ä</hi><hi rend="italic">Year of
                    Revolutions')</hi> brought him into violent controversy with Louis Blanc on
                    questions of fact as well as of policy; and his controversies with Lord
                    Palmerston and Mr Gladstone, after his retirement from the public service, on
                    questions of French and Italian policy, showed him to have fallen behind “the
                    regular march of the mind” of his age.</p>
