                    rend="italic">Ascarides.</hi> They are now by many systematists united with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Acanthocephali</hi> to form the order <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nematoidea</hi> possess an elongated and thread-like form
                    (see fig. 1 ), varying in length from a few lines up to several feet. The body
                    is covered externally by a chitinous cuticle which is a product of the subjacent
                    epidermic layer; this cuticle is frequently prolonged into spines and papillae,
                    which are especially developed at the anterior end of the body. The mouth opens
                    at one extremity of the body and the anus at or near the other. Beneath the
                    epidermis is a longitudinal layer of muscle-fibres which are separated into four
                    distinct groups by the dorsal, ventral, and lateral areas; these are occupied by
                    a continuation of the epidermic layer; in the lateral areas run two thin-walled
                    tubes with clear contents, which unite in the anterior part of the body and open
                    by a pore situated on the ventral area. These vessels are considered to
                    represent the segmental organs of other worms. The lateral areas are entirely
                    absent in <hi rend="italic">Gordius.</hi> The body cavity is largely occupied by
                    connective tissue, and neither here nor elsewhere are cilia found at any period
                    of development. The alimentary tract consists of a straight tube running from
                    the mouth to the anus without any convolutions; it is separable into three
                    divisions :— (1) a muscular oesophagus, which is often provided with cuticular
                    teeth;</p>
                <p>(2) a cellular intestine; and (3) a short terminal rectum surrounded by muscular
                    fibres.</p>
                <p>A nervous system has been shown to exist in many species, and consists of a
                    perioesophageal ring giving off several nerves which run forwards and backwards
                    along the lateral and median lines. Some of the free-living forms possess eye
                    specks. The sexes are distinct (with the exception of a few forms that are
                    hermaphrodite), and the male is always smaller than the female. The generative
                    organs consist of one or two tubes, in the upper portion of which the ova or
                    spermatozoa are developed, the lower portion serving as an oviduct or vas
                    deferens; the female generative organs open at the middle of the body, the male
                    close to the posterior extremity into the terminal portion of the alimentary
                    canal; from this cloaca a diverticulum is given off in which are developed one
                    to three chitinous spicules that subserve the function of copulation. The
                    spermatozoa differ from those of other animals in having the form of cells which
                    sometimes perform amoeboid movements. The development is similar to that of the
                    ova, with which they appear to be homologous.</p>

                    water, in damp earth and moss, and among decaying substances; they are always
                    minute in size, and like many other lower forms of life, are capable of

                    possessed by certain of the parasitic Nematodes, especially by those which lead
                    a free existence during a part of their lifecycle. The free-living differ from
                    the majority of the parasitic forms in undergoing no metamorphosis; they also
                    possess certain structural peculiarities which led Bastian <hi rend="italic"

                    line of demarcation between the free and parasitic species, since—(1) many of
                    the so-called free <hi rend="italic">Nematoidea</hi> live in the slime of

                    of existence, and become encysted in slugs, snails, &amp;c.; (3) it has been

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nematoidea</hi> contain about as many parasitic species as
                    all the other groups of internal parasites taken together; they are found in
                    almost all the organs of the body, and by their presence, especially when
                    encysted in the tissues and during their migration from one part of the body to
                    another, give rise to various pathological conditions. Although some attain
                    their full development in the body of a single host—in this respect differing
                    from all other <hi rend="italic">Entozoa—</hi> the majority do not become
                    sexually mature until after their transference from an “intermediate” to a
                    “definitive” host. This migration is usually accompanied by a more or less
                    complete metamorphosis, which is, however, not so conspicuous as in most other
                    parasites, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Trematoda.</hi> In
                    some cases (many species of <hi rend="italic">Ascaris)</hi> the metamorphosis is
                    reduced to a simple process of growth.</p>
                <p>The parasitic and free-living Nematodes are connected by transitional forms which
                    are free at one stage of their existence and parasitic at another; they may be
                    divided into two classes—those that are parasitic in the larval state but free
                    when adult, and those that are free in the larval state but parasitic when
                    adult.</p>
                <p>(1) To the first class belong the “hairworms” <hi rend="italic">Gordius</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Mermis.</hi> The adult <hi rend="italic">Gordius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aquaticus</hi> inhabits clear running water; it is a long slender
                    worm often about a foot in length but only √ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> inch
                    in diameter. Several individuals are frequently found together twisted into a
                    knot, whence the name <hi rend="italic">Gordius.</hi> The larva when first
                    hatched is provided with a number of cephalic hooks by the aid of which it bores
                    its way into the larvae of the gnat and other <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi>;
                    there it becomes encysted, but continues to move about within the cyst. The gnat
                    larvae are devoured by fish, and the young <hi rend="italic">Gordius</hi> is set
                    free and penetrates the mucous membrane of the intestine, where it encysts
                    itself and becomes quiescent; in this second larval period the cyst differs in
                    character from that formed during the first larval period. In the spring, about
                    six months after the second encystment, the larva becomes free and finds its way
                    through the alimentary canal to the exterior; the cephalic armature disappears,
                    the alimentary canal becomes rudimentary, and after acquiring sexual organs the
                    larva assumes the character of theadult (Villot). (2) To the second class belong
                    <hi rend="italic">Dochmius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Strongylus,</hi> and many
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Ascaris</hi>; the embryo on leaving the egg lives
                    free in water or damp earth, and resembles very closely the free-living genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhabditis.</hi> After a longer or shorter-period it enters the
                    alimentary canal of its proper host and becomes sexually mature. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ascaris</hi><hi rend="italic">nigrovenosa</hi> has a developmental
                    history which is entirely anomalous, passing through two sexual generations
                    which regularly alternate. The worm inhabits the lung of the frog and toad, and
                    is hermaphrodite (Schneider) or parthenogenetic (Leuckart); the embryos hatched
                    from the eggs find their way through the lungs into the alimentary canal and
                    thence to the exterior; in a few days they develop into a sexual <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhabditis,</hi> in which the sexes are distinct; the eggs remain
                    within the uterus, and the young when hatched break through its walls and live
                    free in the perivisceral cavity of the mother, devouring the organs of the body
                    until only the outer cuticle is left; this eventually breaks and sets free the
                    young, which are without teeth, and have therefore lost the typical <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhabditis</hi> form. They live for some time in water or mud,
                    occasionally entering the bodies of water snails, but undergo no change until
                    they reach the lung of a frog, when the cycle begins anew. Although several
                    species belonging to the second class occasionally enter the bodies of water
                    snails and other animals before reaching their definitive host, they undergo no
                    alteration of form in this intermediate host; the case is different, however, in
                    <hi rend="italic">Filaria medinensis, F. bancrofti,</hi> and other forms, in
                    which a free larval is followed by a parasitic existence in two distinct hosts,
                    all the changes being accompanied by a metamorphosis. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filaria</hi><hi rend="italic">medinensis</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the
                    Guinea worm—is parasitic in the subcutaneous connective tissue of man
                    (occasionally also in the horse). It is chiefly found in the tropical parts of
                    Asia and Africa, but has also been met with in South Carolina and several of the
                    West Indian islands. The adult worm, which sometimes reaches a length of 6 feet,
                    has the characters of a female, but is probably hermaphrodite, seeing that no
                    males have ever been discovered. It is viviparous, and the young, which, unlike
                    the parent, are provided with a long tail, live free in water; it was formerly
                    believed from the frequency with which the legs and feet were attacked by this
                    parasite that the embryo entered the skin directly from the water, but it has
                    been proved by Fedschenko that the larva bores its way into the body of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyclops</hi> and there undergoes further development. It is
                    probable that the parasite is then transferred to the alimentary canal of man by
                    means of drinking water, and thence makes its way to the sub cutaneous
                    connective tissue.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nematoidea</hi> which are parasitic during their whole life
                    may similarly be divided into two classes—those -which undergo their development
                    in a single host, and those which undergo their development in the bodies of two
                    distinct host⅛</p>
                <p>(1) In the former class the eggs are extruded -with the faeces, and the young
                    become fully formed within the egg, and when accidentally swallowed by their
                    host are liberated by the solvent action of the gastric juice and com- {)lete
                    their development. This simple type of ife history has been experimentally
                    proved by Leuckart to be characteristic of <hi rend="italic"

                    history of <hi rend="italic">Ollulanus</hi><hi rend="italic">tricuspis</hi> is
                    an example of the second class. <hi rend="italic">Ollulanus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tricuspis</hi> is found in the adult state in the alimentary canal
                    of the cat; the young worms are hatched in the alimentary canal, and often
                    wander into the body of their host and become encysted in the lungs, liver, and
                    other organs; during the encystment the woιm degenerates and loses all trace of
                    structure. This wandering appears to be accidental, and to have nothing to do
                    with the further-evolution of the animal which takes place in those embryos
                    which are voided with the excrement. Leuckart proved experimentally that these
                    young forms become encysted in the muscles of mice, and the cycle is completed
                    after the mouse is devoured by a cat. The well-known <hi rend="italic">Trichina

                    muscle-bandies according to Leuckart, but in the connective tissue between them
                    according to Chatin and others. The co-existence of the asexual encysted form
