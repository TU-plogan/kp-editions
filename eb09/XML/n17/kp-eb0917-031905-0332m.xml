                    North Arcot and Chingleput, and W. by the Eastern Ghfits, separating it from
                    Kamιil and Cuddapah. The area is 8739 square miles. The district comprises a
                    tract of low-lying land extending from the base of the Eastern Ghâts to the sea.
                    Its general aspect is forbidding: the coast-line is a fringe of blown sand
                    through which the waves occasionally break, spreading a salt sterility over the
                    fields. Farther inland the country begins to rise, but the soil is not naturally
                    fertile, nor are means of irrigation readily at hand. Less than one-third of the
                    total area is cultivated; the rest is either rocky waste or is covered with low
                    scrub jungle. The chief rivers are the Pennair, Suvarnamukhi, and Gundlakamma.
                    They are not navigable, but are utilized for irrigation purposes, the chief
                    irrigation work being the <pb break="no"

                    very subject both to droughts and to floods. Copper was discovered in the
                    western hills in 1801, but several attempts by European capitalists to work the
                    ore proved unremunerative, and the enterprise has been abandoned since 1840.
                    Iron ore is smelted by natives in many places. Nellore, with the other districts
                    of the Carnatic, passed under •direct British administration in 1801.</p>
                <p>The population of Nellore in 1881 was 1,220,236, including 1,138,031 Hindus and
                    61,344 Mohammedans. Four Christian missions are established in the
                    district,—Roman Catholic, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Lutheran. Among the
                    aboriginal tribes, the Yanadis are the most numerous. On the island of
                    Sriharikota, from which Madras derives its firewood, they still live in the
                    jungle, and refuse to cultivate the soil or rear cattle. They have adopted some
                    form of Hinduism, but still worship their own demons and bury their dead. Five
                    towns had in 1881 a population of over 5000—Nellore (27,505), Ongole (9200),
                    Venkatagiri (7989), Kandukur (6601), and Addanki (6481). The climate is dry, the
                    monthly temperature varying from about 74° F. in December to 90° in May; and the
                    average annual rainfall is 36 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 53 inches.</p>
                <p>In former days Nellore was celebrated for its textile fabrics, but the export has
                    now ceased, though spinning and weaving for local consumption is carried on in
                    many villages. Prior to the opening of the Madras Railway, Nellore formed the
                    high road between the interior and the coast. The two principal ports are
                    Kottapatam and Ittamukula, both in the north of the district. Indigo is exported
                    by land to Madras at the rate of about 800,000 maunds a year. The chief means of
                    communication is the Great Northern Trunk Road, which runs along the coast to
                    the Bengal frontier. Water communication with Madras city is also afforded by
                    the East Coast or Buckingham Canal.</p>
