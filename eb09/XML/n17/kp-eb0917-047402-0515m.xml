                    mythological elements. It is touched upon in <hi rend="italic">Beowulf,</hi> and
                    forms the most important subject of the old Norse poems, in which it is
                    presented in fragments,—the poets having apparently assumed that the tale as a
                    whole was known to every one, and that their hearers would be able to put each
                    incident in its proper place. It is also set forth in the prose <hi
                    rend="italic">Edda</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Thidrekssaga,</hi> which
                    belongs to the 13th century. The substance of the story in its Norse form is as
                    follows. Beside a waterfall the three Anses—Odin, Loki, and Hönir—see an otter
                    devouring a salmon. They kill it, and taking its skin with them seek shelter for
                    the night in the house of Rodmar. He recognizes the skin as that of his son
                    Otter, and demands that as much gold as is necessary to cover it shall be
                    delivered to him as “wergild.” In a net Loki catches the dwarf Andwari in the
                    shape of a pike, and compels him to pay for his ransom a great treasure, which
                    covers the whole of the skin except one hair. In order to cover this hair Loki
                    takes from the dwarf a magic ring which breeds gold, and Andwari, enraged,
                    curses the hoard. His curse attends it to the last, and begins to operate
                    immediately, for Rodmar, who claims for himself the whole of the “weregild,” is
                    slain by his sons, Fafnir and Begin. Fafnir takes possession of the hoard, and
                    in the form of a snake guards it on Glistenheath. Begin, indignant at being
                    deprived of his share, calls to his aid Sigurd, a young hero for whom he makes
                    the sharp sword Gram; and, armed with Gram, Sigurd goes to Glistenheath and
                    kills Fafnir. While Sigurd is roasting Fafnir’s heart, which Begin has cut out,
                    the fat dropping into the fire burns his finger, and putting the hurt part into
                    his mouth, he finds that he has suddenly obtained the power of understanding the
                    language of birds. He thus learns that Begin intends to act treacherously
                    towards him. Sigurd therefore slays Begin, and rides away with the hoard in two
                    bundles on his horse Grani. In a house on a hill he finds the Walkyrie Brunhild
                    in an enchanted sleep, from which she awakes, and plights her troth to Sigurd,
                    who loves her ardently. Coming to the court of Giuki, a king of the Rhineland,
                    Sigurd forms a friendship with Giuki’s sons, Gunnar, Högni, and Guthorm. Gudrun,
                    Giuki’s daughter, being fascinated by the stranger, gives him an enchanted drink
                    which causes him to forget Brunhild, and then he and Gudrun are married. Gunnar
                    wishes to make Brunhild his wife, and asks Sigurd to go with him in quest of
                    her. Flames encompass her tower; and she will accept as her husband only the
                    hero who shall succeed in riding through them. Gunnar makes the attempt in vain;
                    but Sigurd, mounted on Grani, has no difficulty in passing to Brunhild, with
                    whom he exchanges rings, giving her the ring of the dwarf Andwari. Sigurd,
                    however, has assumed the form of Gunnar, and Brunhild supposes that it is by
                    Gunnar she has been won. All of them return to Giuki’s court, Sigurd having
                    taken his own form again, and Brunhild having become Gunnar’s wife. Here a
                    quarrel breaks out between Brunhild and Gudrun, the former contending that
                    Sigurd’s position is inferior to that of her husband, while Gudrun retorts by
                    telling her rival that it was Sigurd who rode through the flames. Brunhild,
                    maddened by jealousy, incites Guthorm, Gunnar’s brother, to murder Sigurd; and
                    twice Guthorm glides into Sigurd’s chamber to accomplish her will, but departs
                    when he finds Sigurd awake and gazing at him with flashing eyes. The third time
                    Sigurd is asleep, and Guthorm stabs him. Sigurd, before dying, has just strength
                    enough to throw his sword after the murderer, whom it cuts in two. Brunhild
                    laughs at the desolation she has wrought, but all the time she has loved Sigurd,
                    and she kills herself with the sword that has slain him, and is burned with him
                    on his pyre. By and by Gudrun takes as her second husband Atli, Brunhild’s
                    brother, king of the Huns. Atli asks her brothers, Gunnar and Högni, to visit
                    him; and, notwithstanding her warnings, they accept his invitation. He demands
                    of them Sigurd’s hoard, which he claims as Gudrun’s property; but before leaving
                    home they have buried it beneath the Rhine, and they refuse to say where it is
                    concealed. After a fierce contest in which all the followers of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n516/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0516-0475"/> Gunnar and Högni fall, Atli renews his demand,
                    promising to spare Gunnar’s life if he will reveal the secret. Gunnar declines
                    to do so until he sees the heart of his brother Högni. The heart of a slave is
                    laid before him, but he declares that it cannot be Högni’s, since it quakes.
                    Högni’s heart is then cut out, the victim laughing in the midst of his pain; but
                    Gunnar is still resolute, proclaiming that he alone knows where the hoard is,
                    and that no one shall share the knowledge with him. His hands being bound, he is
                    put into the court of serpents, where he plays so sweetly on a harp with his
                    toes that he charms all the reptiles except an adder, by which he is stung to
                    death. Gudrun avenges the murder of her brothers by killing the sons she has
                    borne to Atli, and causing him unwittingly to drink their blood and eat their
                    hearts. In the night she kills Atli himself, burns his hall, and leaps into the
                    sea, by the waves of which she is carried to new scenes, where she has
                    adventures not connected with those recorded in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nibelungenlied.</hi></p>
                <p>The tale of which this is one version, pieced together from many poetical
                    fragments, assumed different forms until it was put into its final shape in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied.</hi> The heroine of the German poem is
                    Kriemhild, who represents Gudrun. She lives at Worms, the capital of the
                    Burgundian kingdom, with her brothers Gunther, Gernot, and Giselher, of whom the
                    eldest, Gunther, is king of the Burgundians. To Worms comes Siegfried (an older
                    form than Sigurd), the son of Siegemund and Siegelind, the king and queen of the
                    Netherlands. Siegfried possesses the magic hoard, but he does not obtain it as
                    Sigurd obtains it in the Norse form of the tale. He takes it from two princes of
                    Nibelungen-land, to whom it has been bequeathed by their father, King Nibelung.
                    Quarrelling as to their respective shares, they appeal to Siegfried to decide
                    between them; and he, irritated by their unreasonableness, kills them and seizes
                    the treasure, together with the sword Balmung and the Tarnkappe, or cloak of
                    darkness, which renders the wearer invisible and gives him the power of twelve
                    men. Although this is how the hoard comes into his hands, he is still
                    represented as slaying a dragon, in whose blood he bathes, being thus rendered
                    invulnerable except in one spot between the shoulders, on which a leaf falls
                    before the blood is dry. At the Burgundian court Siegfried wins the hand of
                    Kriemhild; but before their marriage he establishes a claim to the gratitude of
                    King Gunther, the lover of Brunhild, the young and stalwart queen of Iceland,
                    who requires that any one wishing to be her husband shall surpass her in three
                    games. Gunther and Siegfried with their followers sail to Iceland; and with the
                    aid of Siegfried, who during the trial of skill and vigour makes himself
                    invisible by donning the Tarnkappe, Gunther overcomes the powerful maid. On the
                    night of the wedding Brunhild scoffs at Gunther, struggles with him, binds him,
                    and lets him hang on the wall ignominiously until the morning. Next night,
                    without the knowledge of Brunhild, Siegfried goes to the help of his friend, and
                    as a token of his conquest takes her ring and girdle, after which she is
                    incapable of giving Gunther further trouble. Siegfried and Kriemhild then go to
                    the Netherlands, where they live for some years in perfect happiness and with
                    great splendour, the Nibelungen hoard being sufficient to provide them with the
                    means of lavish display. Invited to visit the Burgundian court, they quit
                    Santen, the capital of the Netherlands and Siegfried’s birthplace, and, attended
                    by a brilliant retinue, make for Worms. Up to this point the tone of the poem is
                    bright and cheerful; we now begin to see the working of tragic forces which from
                    petty complications lead to strife and disaster. Brunhild, who is of a proud and
                    sullen temper, has always shown bitter animosity towards Siegfried, whom she is
                    represented as recognizing when they meet in Iceland. She insults Kriemhild by
                    vaunting the superior greatness of Gunther, and by claiming precedence.
                    Kriemhild resents these pretensions, and in an animated scene before the
                    cathedral of Worms asserts her right to enter first with her attendants. The
                    quarrel becoming furious, Kriemhild pretends that Siegfried had taken an unfair
                    advantage of Brunhild on the night when he had fought with her in her bridal
                    chamber, and produces the girdle and ring (of the seizure of which Brunhild had
                    been unconscious) as evidences of her disgrace. In vain Siegfried tries to
                    restore harmony by rebuking his wife for this malicious invention: Brunhild is
                    too deeply wounded to forgive so bitter a wrong, and meditates a fearful
                    vengeance. At last she decides that Siegfried shall die; and Hagen, one of
                    Gunther’s bravest warriors, undertakes to do her bidding. Inducing Kriemhild to
                    tell him where her husband is vulnerable, he achieves his purpose during a
                    hunting expedition, from which Kriemhild, warned by a dream, has entreated
                    Siegfried to stay away. Kriemhild is overwhelmed with grief and rage, and the
                    rest of the story relates chiefly to her thirst for revenge, and the manner in
                    which she slakes it. For thirteen years she remains quietly at Gunther’s court.
                    Then Rüdiger, margrave of Bechlaren, appears as the ambassador of Etzel
                    (Attila), king of the Huns, and entreats Kriemhild to become Etzel’s wife. She
                    consents, and again thirteen years pass without any important incident. At the
                    end of that time Gunther and his followers are invited by Etzel and Kriemhild to
                    the land of the Huns; and, despite supernatural intimations and Hagen’s
                    presentiments, they resolve to go. The ultimate result is that in a terrible
                    conflict the Burgundian visitors are destroyed. When all of them have fallen
                    save Gunther and Hagen, these survivors are overcome by Dietrich, a resident at
                    Etzel’s court, and delivered by him to Etzel and Kriemhild. The closing scenes
                    are complicated by reference to the hoard of the Nibelungen, which had been
                    taken after Siegfried’s death by Gunther as Kriemhild’s brother. In virtue of
                    his possession of it he and his people are called Nibelungen; but he possesses
                    it only in name, for Hagen, who had brought it to Worms, fearing that it would
                    work evil, had buried it (as Gunnar and Högni are represented to have done)
                    beneath the Rhine. Kriemhild commands Hagen to reveal its resting-place, but he
                    answers that he has sworn not to tell the secret as long as the king lives. The
                    head of Gunther being exhibited to him, he still refuses; whereupon, snatching
                    the sword Balmung, which Hagen has used since Siegfried’s death, Kriemhild rids
                    herself of her enemy by beheading him. Immediately afterwards she herself is
                    killed by Hildebrand, a Hunnish warrior, who is horrified by her savage
                    cruelty.</p>
                <p>Many elements embodied in the Norse rendering of the primitive tale are retained
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied",</hi> and, indeed, it is impossible to
                    understand the latter thoroughly without reference to the former. For instance,
                    the recognition of Siegfried by Brunhild in Iceland, and her misery in beholding
                    his happiness with Kriemhild, are unintelligible until we know that Siegfried
                    and Brunhild are supposed to have been lovers before the action of the poem
                    begins. Again, we cease to be puzzled by the malign power of the hoard only when
                    we learn how an evil fatality has been associated with it by the wrath of
                    Andwari. After all, however, the points in which the later version agrees with
                    the earlier one are not more remarkable than those in which they differ. In the
                    Norse poems the only historical character is Atli or Attila; but in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> Attila (Etzel) is associated with Theodoric
                    the East Goth (Dietrich), while the relations of Gunther to Siegfried seem to be
                    a reminiscence of the absorption <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n517/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0517-0476"/> of the Burgundian kingdom by the Franks.
                    Moreover, almost all the mythological features of the tale have disappeared,
                    ethical influences having become more prominent. The curse on the hoard is
                    little more than a picturesque survival, for although it symbolizes, sometimes
                    very effectively, a kind of mysterious fate in the background, the destinies of
                    the various characters would not have been different if it had been altogether
                    omitted. If the characters are less grand, they are more human; and their
                    motives have a closer resemblance to those represented in modern poetry. It is
                    true that Kriemhild works as much desolation as Gudrun, but her cruelty is not
                    so revolting, and it does not spring, like Gudrun’s, from passions excited by a
                    blood-feud, but from wounded love.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> is composed of stanzas of four lines,
                    the first line rhyming with the second, the third with the fourth. Each line is
                    divided into two parts by the caesura, the first part having four accents, the
                    second part three, except in the last line, where the second part has also four
                    accents. Some of the rhymes indicate poverty of resource, and the diction is
                    very simple; but the poet displays much artistic skill in the handling of the
                    traditions which it was his task to weave into a continuous narrative. He
                    selects his incidents with fine tact, and almost invariably places them in
                    relations which are fitted to bring out their full significance. Character he is
                    able to conceive powerfully and vividly. Perhaps the only character who loses
                    anything by his mode of treatment is Brunhild, who is certainly far less
                    impressive in the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> than in the Norse poems.
                    Kriemhild, on the other hand, is a splendid creation of imaginative genius.
                    First we see her as a simple maid, gentle and modest; then her powers are
                    awakened by love; and when the light of her life is suddenly quenched all her
                    tenderness dies. She has then but one end, to avenge her husband’s death; and
                    for its accomplishment she sacrifices everything—repose, the possibilities of
                    new happiness, and at last existence itself. The transitions are startling, but
                    not unnatural in a rude age; and in the earlier stages of Kriemhild’s career
                    they are lightly and delicately touched. Towards the close, when her vengeance
                    is being sated, the style is intensely concentrated, vivid, and impassioned; but
                    the change does not take the reader by surprise, for he is prepared for it even
                    in the brightest scenes of the poem by hints of inevitable ruin. Siegfried is
                    less complex than Kriemhild, but not less poetically presented. He is a flawless
                    hero, strong, brave, loyal, and generous; and it is possible, as some critics
                    suppose, that in the original myth he personified the radiance of summer in
                    conflict with the approaching gloom of winter. Hagen is as sombre and tragic a
                    figure as Siegfried is bright and genial; and, notwithstanding his guilt, he
                    commands a certain admiration, for his crimes are only a manifestation of his
                    fidelity to the royal house he serves. Another character wrought with great
                    imaginative power is Rüdiger, who was probably introduced into the tale for the
                    first time by the author of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied.</hi> His part
                    is subordinate, but it suffices to evoke the expression of all the most
                    brilliant and attractive qualities of the age of chivalry.</p>
                <p>There are twenty-eight manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied,</hi>
                    some of them complete, others in fragments, and they date from the 13th to the
                    16th century, so that the poem must have been studied until about the time of
                    the Reformation. It had been entirely forgotten when, in the middle of the 18th
                    century, Bodmer, the Swiss poet and critic, issued some portions of it along
                    with the “Klage,” a poem of the same period describing the lamentations at
                    EtzeΓs court over the fallen heroes. In 1782 C. H. Myller published the first
                    full edition, using in the latter part Bodmer’s text. Very little attention,
                    however, was given to the recovered epic until the writers of the Romantic
                    school began to interest themselves in mediaeval literature. Then the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> was read with enthusiasm; and in 1807 Von der
                    Hagen provided an improved text with a glossary. An epoch in the study of the
                    poem was∣ marked by Lachmann, who in various writings contended that it
                    consisted of twenty ancient ballads, that these ballads had been put together
                    about 1210, that the collector or editor had connected them by stanzas of his
                    own composition, and that in the ancient ballads themselves he had inserted
                    unauthentic verses. Lachmann held that the Munich manuscript (A), which is the
                    shortest, contains the purest text, and that it was extended by the authors of
                    the texts in the St Gall manuscript (B) and the Lassberg manuscript (C). This
                    view guided his labours in preparing his edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nibelungenlied</hi> (1826); and the theory was for some time generally
                    accepted. Hahn, however, in 1851, and Holtzmann, in 1854, suggested doubts
                    whether the critical canons by which, Lachmann had distinguished authentic from
                    unauthentic stanzas were valid; and Holtzmann sought to prove that C, the
                    longest manuscript, not A, the shortest, is nearest the original form of the
                    poem. This occasioned an animated controversy, in which many eminent scholars
                    took part. In 1862 Pfeiffer gave a new aspect to the question by maintaining
                    that in the 12th and the early part of the 13th century every poet considered it
                    a point of honour to invent a new kind of stanza, and that, as we possess lyrics
                    by the Austrian poet Von Kürenberg, which are in the same measure as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nibelungenlied,</hi> we are bound to conclude that he was the
                    author of the poem. Developing this hint, Bartsch argues that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> was written about 1140; that in its original
                    form the lines ended not in rhymes but in assonances; that about 1170 a younger
                    poet introduced the principle of rhyme, although imperfectly, into his
                    predecessor’s work; that between 1190 and 1200, when rhyme was considered
                    essential, two poets, independently of one another, completed the transformation
                    which the second poet had begun; and that the work of the one is represented by
                    manuscript C, the work of the other by manuscript B, of which A is an
                    abbreviated form. Bartsch regards B (entitled <hi rend="italic">Nibelunge
                    N6t)</hi> as that which approximates most closely to the work of the first poet;
                    and this he has made the basis of his admirable critical edition, published
                    separately in two volumes, and in.one volume in the series of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deutsche Classiker</hi><hi rend="italic">des Mittelalters.</hi> If Bartsch’s
                    view be correct, the poem must have been greatly injured by its successive
                    transformations. His theory is supported by th’e facts that assonances survive
                    in all the manuscripts, and that the rhymes are not nearly so good as might have
                    been expected from the creative energy with which the general scheme of the work
                    is conceived.</p>
