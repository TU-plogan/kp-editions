                <p><label type="entry">NOVA SCOTIA</label>, originally Acadia, a province of the
                    Dominion of Canada, lies between 43° 25' and 47° N. lat. and 59° 40' and 66° 25'
                    W. long., and is composed of the peninsula proper and the adjoining island of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cape Breton</hi><hi rend="italic">∖q.υ.∖</hi> which is
                    separated from the mainland by the Gut of Canso. It is bounded on the N. by
                    Northumberland Strait (which divides it from Prince Edward Island) and the Gulf
                    of St Lawrence, N.E., S.E., and S. by the Atlantic Ocean, and W. by the Bay of
                    Fundy and New Brunswick, being connected with the latter province by a narrow
                    isthmus 13⅛ miles wide. The extreme length from south-west to north-east is 350
                    miles, the breadth 120 miles, and the area 20,907 square miles (13,382,003
                    acres).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> The province is intersected by chains
                    of lofty hills, in most instances running parallel with the coast-line. The
                    Cobequid Mountains, stretching in a long line from east to west and terminating
                    in Cape Chignecto, form the chief ridge. Several of the elevations are as high
                    as 1100 feet, and are cultivable almost to their summits. Lying on each side of
                    this range are two extensive tracts of arable land which yield profitable crops.
                    A sharply-outlined ridge of precipices runs for 130 miles along the Bay of Fundy
                    from Briar Island at the farthest extremity of Digby Neck to Capes Split and
                    Blomidon. Here and there masses of trap rocks, averaging from 200 to 600 feet in
                    height and crowded with stunted firs, overhang the coasts. Beyond them lies the
                    garden of Nova Scotia, the valley of the Annapolis, full of varied scenery, and
                    unrivalled for its fruit, flowers, and cereals. The general slope of the country
                    is south-easterly, in which direction there are several chains of lakes, the
                    source of many rivers and streams of moderate length. The southeastern coast is
                    remarkable for its harbours, twelve of which are capable of affording shelter to
                    ships of the line, while between Canso and Halifax, a distance of 110 miles’
                    there are fourteen ports which possess ample accommodation for merchantmen of
                    average size. The principal inlets are Bay Verte, Tatamagouche, and St George’s
                    Bay in Northumberland Strait; Chedabucto Bay at the head of the Gut of Canso;
                    Halifax Harbour, Margaret’s and Mahone Bays on the south-east coast; St Mary’s
                    Bay on the south-west; Annapolis Basin, Minas Basin and Channel, and Cobequid
                    Bay on the west. Of these the most remarkable is Minas Basin, the eastern arm of
                    the Bay of Fundy; it penetrates some 60 miles inland, and terminates in Cobequid
                    Bay, where the tides rush in with savage impetuosity, rising sometimes as high
                    as 60 feet, while on the opposite coast, in Halifax Harbour, the spring tides
                    scarcely exceed 7 or 8 feet. The principal inlets in Cape Breton are Aspy Bay,
                    St Anne’s Bay, Sydney Harbour, Miré Bay, and St Peter’s Bay. All along the coast
                    of Nova Scotia there are many small islands, the south-east shore being
                    literally studded -with them. The chief are Caribou and Pictou in Northumberland
                    Strait; St Paul, Scatari, and Isle Madame off the coast of Cape Breton. Sable, a
                    dangerous and sandy island, almost barren, lies 150 miles east of Halifax, and
                    has long been noted as the scene of fearful shipwrecks. Its length is 25 miles
                    by about 1⅜ miles in breadth, the eastern end being in 43° 59' N. lat. and 59°
                    45' W. long. An effective humane establishment is maintained on this island by
                    the provincial Government. Other islands are Cape Sable, Seal, and Mud in the
                    south, and Long Island at the entrance of St Mary’s Bay. The principal capes
                    (apart from those of Cape Breton) are Malagash, John, and St George on the
                    northern coast; Porcupine, Canso, Sambro Head, Pennant Point, Crown Point, and
                    La Have on the south-east; Sable on the south; St Mary, Split, Chignecto, and
                    Blomidon on the west. The interior of the country is traversed and watered by
                    many rivers and lakes, which cover an estimated area of 3000 square miles. The
                    rivers are, with few exceptions, navigable for coasting vessels for distances
                    averaging from 2 to 20 miles. The principal are the Annapolis, Avon,
                    Shubenacadie, East, Middle, and West, St Mary’s, Musquodoboit, La Have, Mersey.
                    The Annapolis river, which is navigable for a long distance, takes its rise in
                    King’s county, flows between the North and South Mountains through a fertile
                    tract of territory and discharges into Annapolis Bay. The Shubenacadie flows
                    from the Grand Lake in Halifax county, receives the waters of ten other streams,
                    and, after winding through Hants county, empties itself into Minas Basin. It is
                    navigable for craft of large size, and its banks are rich in forest trees. The
                    East, West, and Middle rivers, also navigable for similar vessels, discharge
                    into Pictou Harbour. The La Have empties into the Atlantic, the Avon into the
                    Bay of Fundy, and the Mersey into Liverpool Harbour. The Medway, Shelburne,
                    Clyde, Tusket, St Mary’s, and several others have their sources in the numerous
                    lakes which lie in the interior. The largest of the latter is Lake Rossignol,
                    situated in Queen’s county, and more than 20 miles long. Ship Harbour Lake, 15
                    miles in length, and Grand Lake are in Halifax county, College Lake is in the
                    eastern part of <pb break="no"

                    may be best described as an imprisoned sea. It is 50 miles long and of great
                    depth, bordered by the counties of Victoria, Inverness, Richmond, and Cape
                    Breton; it is full of fish, and expands into several streams and bays, each of
                    which affords excellent sport to the angler.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The Lower Cambrian runs along the whole extent
                    of the Atlantic seaboard in one uninterrupted line. To the north of this
                    stretches an extensive district composed of rocks of Upper Silurian and probably
                    others of Lower Silurian age. Along the section on the south coast of the Bay of
                    Fundy, and at Minas Basin and Channel, is to be found the New Red Sandstone
                    formation. Grey granite, gneiss, and mica-slate prevail along the shore. Trap
                    rocks, often embedded in clay-slate, abound in several sections of the province,
                    and the newer Red Sandstone prevails in the western division. There are vast
                    Carboniferous beds, occupying a large area, and forming a source of great wealth
                    to the inhabitants. Millstone grit, the gypsiferous series, limestones, slates,
                    the metamorphic series, the Huronian, &lt;fcc., are also to be noted. The
                    Carboniferous plain of New Brunswick is connected with that of Nova Scotia at
                    its eastern extremity. The coal-fields of the latter are especially valuable and
                    productive. They are situated in Cape Breton, Cumberland, Pictou, Inverness, and
                    Richmond counties. In 1882 there were twenty-one collieries in operation, which
                    produced 1,365,811 tons of coal, consumed principally in Quebec, New Brunswick,
                    Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and the United States. About 4235 persons
                    are employed in this industry. The coal is bituminous and very rich in quality.
                    In the Carboniferous areas there are immense deposits of pyroschist or
                    bituminous shale, “capable,” says Dawson, “of yielding as much as 63 gallons of
                    oil, or 7500 feet of illuminating gas per ton. Owing to the great cheapness of
                    petroleum little attention has been paid to these shales for some years, but it
                    is likely that they will before long again be in demand.”</p>
                <p>Gold is found in workable quantities, the production in 1882 being 14,107 ounces.
                    The gold district includes Caribou, Gay’s River, Montagu, Oldham, Renfrew,
                    Sherbrooke, Stormont, Tangier, Uniacke, Waverley, Wine Harbour, and
                    unproclaimed,—thirty mines in all. Iron ore abounds also in profitable
                    quantities, and of excellent quality; the production in 1882 was 42,135 tons.
                    Other minerals, such as manganese ore, gypsum, barytes, &amp;c., abound. A fair
                    business is annually done in coke, fireclay, building-stone, and grindstones.
                    Some veins of copper, silver, lead, and galena, especially rich in quality,
                    exist. There are many curious and beautiful fossils, besides amethysts, agates,
                    chalcedonies, jaspers, cairngorms, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Vegetation.—</hi> The climate of Nova Scotia
                    somewhat resembles that of New Brunswick. There are extremes of heat and cold,
                    and sudden changes of temperature, varying sometimes in one day as much as 50°.
                    Considering its northern latitude, it is remarkably temperate on the λvhole. The
                    extreme of cold is about 20° below zero in the depth of winter, and the greatest
                    heat is 98°. The climate varies in the different counties, those in the west
                    averaging from 6° to 8° Fahr, warmer than those in the east. The coldest period
                    is from the end of December to the first week in March, during which the weather
                    is tolerably uniform. The spring is usually brief and chilly, but the autumn,
                    which is the most favoured season of the year, is delightfully pleasant.
                    Vegetation develops rapidly. At certain times dense fogs line the banks along
                    the Atlantic coast, but they are not considered unhealthy.</p>
                <p>Nova Scotia is a valuable agricultural country; wheat, oats, rye, barley,
                    buckwheat, Indian corn, potatoes, turnips, beets, tomatoes, &lt;fcc., grow in
                    abundance, while apples, pears, plums, cherries, strawberries, raspberries,
                    cranberries, gooseberries, currants, and other fruits ripen to perfection. Even
                    grapes and peaches grow in the open air in some districts. The Nova Scotia apple
                    is an article of commerce, and quantities have been exported to England. The
                    orchards of Annapolis and King’s counties extend along the roadsides for upwards
                    of 50 miles. The soil is of various degrees of fertility. The intervale lands,
                    which form an extensive part of the country, are rich, and yield largely. The
                    uplands, lying between the hilly sections and the rivers, are of moderate
                    capacity. The high lands are as productive as the intervales. The produce in
                    1881 was 529,251 bushels of wheat, 228,748 of barley, 47,567 of rye, 1,873,113
                    of oats, 339,718 of buckwheat, 37,220 of pease and beans, 8128 of grass and
                    clover seeds, 7,378,387 of potatoes, 1,006,711 of turnips, 326,143 of other
                    roots, and 597,731 tons of hay. Of live stock there were 57,167 horses, 33,275
                    working oxen, 137,639 milch cows, 154,689 other horned cattle, 377,801 sheep,
                    and 47,256 swine.</p>
                <p>The forests of Nova Scotia are extensive and valuable, the principal trees found
                    in New Brunswick also growing in the sister province. They are chiefly pine,
                    oak, tamarack, birch, maple, hemlock, spruce, butternut, ash, &amp;c. The yield
                    of timber is very great, the shipments in 1881 amounting in value to
                    $1,587,941.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industries, Commerce, &lt;L∙c.—</hi> Nova Scotia is not strong
                    as a manufacturing country, but every year some new industries are added to the
                    list. At present there are two sugar-refineries and a cottonfactory in Halifax.
                    Coarse “homespuns,” coarse flannels, bedlinen, blankets, carpets, and tweeds are
                    made in considerable quantities. Tanning is extensively carried on, and there
                    are several factories where household and other furniture, agricultural
                    implements, boots and shoes, saddlery, harness, tobacco, printing and wrapping
                    paper, machinery, nails, pails and wooden ware, fuse gunpowder, carriages, and
                    sleighs, &amp;c., are made. In 1881 the province contained 1190 saw-mills, 263
                    grist-mills, 151 tanneries, 68 carding and weaving establishments, 8 breweries,
                    and various other manufactories; 217,481 lb of maple sugar were produced. The
                    value of the boots and shoes manufactured was $754,128, of iron smelted
                    $720,000, and of sugar refined $1,702,000. The exports of mining produce
                    amounted to $676,078, of agricultural products to $830,804, of manufactures to
                    $487,503, and of animals and their produce to $836,052. The total exports were
                    $9,217,295 and the total imports $8,701,589. Shipbuilding is extensively carried
                    on. In 1882 there were 122 vessels built, tonnage 31,361; and 174 vessels of all
                    classes were registered. In the same year 6615 craft, representing a tonnage of
                    709,167, were engaged in the coasting trade. The total number on the registry
                    books of the province was 3026, tonnage 546,778.</p>
                <p>Next to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia possesses the largest and most valuable
                    fisheries in British North America. Along the entire const, extending over 1000
                    miles, food fish of almost every description (salmon, trout, cod, holibut,
                    haddock, bass, mackerel, herring, shad, lobsters, &amp;c.) may be taken. Immense
                    quantities of these are shipped to the West Indies, the United States, various
                    ports in Canada; and of late years several varieties have been welcomed in
                    British markets. In 1882 fish to the value of $4,437,364 were exported. About
                    19,000 men are employed in this industry.</p>
                <p>Most of the principal birds of North America are to be found in Nova Scotia, and
                    the game of the country includes moose, caribou, duck, teal, geese, woodcock,
                    partridge, snipe, plover, &amp;c. The game laws are very strict, and are rigidly
                    enforced. The wild animals remaining in the province are bears, wolves, foxes,
                    wild-cats, and a few others.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> Nova Scotia is well furnished with
                    railways, there being nearly 600 miles in operation at the present time. The
                    Intercolonial runs from Halifax to Amherst, 138 miles, and thence to St John,
                    N.B., and Quebec. There are two canals in the province, one from Halifax to
                    Cobequid Bay, and the other, the St Peter’s, connecting St Peter’s Bay on the
                    southern side of Cape Breton with the Bras d’Or Lake. The roads of Nova Scotia
                    are exceedingly good and well maintained. Telegraphic lines are established
                    nearly all over the province, and connect with the United States system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government, Finance, &lt;kc.—</hi> The executive authority is
                    in the hands of a lieutenant-governor and a council of eight members, four with
                    portfolios and four without. Thirty-eight representatives are elected every four
                    years to the house of assembly, and twenty legislative councillors are appointed

                    governorgeneral of Canada in council. The system of administration is known as
                    responsible government. The province returns twenty-one members to the Dominion
                    House of Commons, and ten senators are appointed by the crown to the senate of
                    Canada. They hold their positions for life. The province has the right to make
                    its own civil laws, but in all criminal cases the form which obtains in all the
                    courts is the criminal law of the Dominion. The judiciary consists of a chief
                    justice, an equity judge, and five puisne judges, a supreme court having law and
                    equity jurisdiction throughout the province, a vice-admiralty court, and a court
                    of marriage and divorce. In each county there is a court of pçobate. There are
                    also seven county court judges.</p>
                <p>Nova Scotia forms the ninth military district in the militia of Canada. The

                    battalions of infantry and rifles; total, 318 officers, and 3638
                    non-commissioned officers and men. The period of service in time of peace is
                    three years. British regiments of the line are also stationed at Halifax.</p>
                <p>The public revenue of the province is a little more than half a million dollars
                    annually, and the expenditure is about the same. The chief source of revenue is
                    the yearly subsidy granted to the province by the Dominion, under the terms of
                    the British North America Act of 1867. In 1882 it amounted to $380,000. The
                    remainder of the revenue is derived from the sales of wild lands, royalties from
                    mines, miscellaneous fees, marriage and other licences.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Nova Scotia was first visited by the Cabots in
                    1497, but it was 1604 before any attempt at colonization by Europeans was made.
                    This was the expedition headed by De Monts, a Frenchman, which tried to form
                    settlements at Port Royal, St Croix and elsewhere, and endured severe hardships
                    until 1614, when the English colonists of Virginia made a descent upon them,
                    claimed the territory in right of the discovery by the Cabots, and expelled them
                    from the soil. In 1621 Sir "W illiam Alexander obtained a grant of the whole
                    peninsula, and it was named in the patent Nova Scotia instead of Acadia, the old
                    name given the colony by the French. Alexander intended to colonize the country
                    on an extensive scale, but the attempt was frustrated (1623) by the French.
                    During the reign of Charles I. the Nova Scotia baronets were created, and their
                    patents ratified in parliament. Their number was not to exceed 150, and in
                    exchange for their titles and grants of land they agreed to contribute aid to
                    the settlement. Cromwell despatched a strong force to the possession in 1654. In
                    1667 it was ceded by the treaty of Breda to the crown of France. But the
                    restless English colonists, unmindful of treaty obligations, attacked the French
                    from time to time at various points, until in 1713 the latter relinquished all
                    claim to the country. England neglected it until 1749, when, the designs of the
                    French again becoming marked, the Government made strenuous exertions to induce
                    British settlers to go there. More than 4000 emigrants with their families
                    sailed for the colony; and Halifax was founded. But the French settlers, who
                    enjoyed privileges as neutrals, still embraced a considerable portion of the
                    population, and, with their allies the Indians, proved exceedingly troublesome
                    to the English. They were finally expelled; and in 1758 a constitution was
                    granted to Nova Scotia. By the treaty of Paris in 1763 France resigned all
                    pretension to the country. In 1784 New Brunswick and Cape Breton were separated
                    from Nova Scotia; but in 1819 the two latter divisions were reunited, and in
                    1867 they became part of the Dominion of Canada.</p>
