                    (1732-1804), finance minister of Louis XVL, and convener of the states-general
                    of 1789, was born at Geneva in 1732. His father was a native of Ciistrin in

                    of Thelusson &amp; Necker. Thelusson superintended the bank in London (his
                    grandson was made a peer as Lord Rendlesham), while Necker was managing partner
                    in Paris. Between them the bank prospered, and both partners became very rich.
                    He chiefly occupied himself in his bank, but in 1763 fell in love w-ith Madame
                    de Verméneux, the widow of a French officer. She could not make up her mind to
                    marry any one who was not noble, and, while considering his offer, she went on a
                    visit to Geneva, where she met Suzanne Curchod, the daughter of a pastor near
                    Lausanne, to whom Gibbon had been engaged, and took such a fancy to her that she
                    brought her back as her companion to Paris in 1764. There Necker, transferring
                    his love from the widow to the poor Swiss girl, married Suzanne before the end
                    of the year. She was extremely ambitious, and encouraged her husband to try and
                    make himself a public position. He accordingly became a syndic or director of
                    the French East India Company, and, after showing his financial ability in its
                    management, defended it in an able memoir against the attacks of Morellet in
                    1769. He had also made interest with the French Government by lending it money,
                    and was appointed resident at Paris by the republic of Geneva. Madame Necker
                    assisted his ambitious views by entertaining largely the chief leaders of the
                    political, financial, and literary worlds of Paris, and her Fridays became as
                    greatly frequented as the Mondays of Madame Geoffrin, or the Tuesdays of Madame
                    Helvetius. In 1773 Necker won the prize of the Académie Française for an <hi
                    rend="italic">éloge</hi> on Colbert, and in 1775 published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essai</hi><hi rend="italic">sur la législation et le commerce des grains,</hi>
                    in which he attacked the free-trade policy of Turgot. His wife now believed he
                    could get into office as a great financier, and made him give up his share in
                    the bank, which he transferred to his brother Louis. She was right, and in
                    October 1776 Necker was made finance minister of France, though with the title
                    only of director of the treasury, which, however, he changed in 1777 for that of
                    director-general of the finances. He did great good in regulating the finances
                    by attempting to divide the taille or poll tax more equally, by abolishing the
                    “vingtième d’industrie,” and establishing “monts du piété.” But his greatest
                    financial measures were his attempt to fund the French debt and his
                    establishment of annuities under the guarantee of the state. The operation of
                    funding was too difficult in regard to the complicated French debt to be
                    suddenly accomplished, and Necker rather pointed out the right line to be
                    followed than completed the operation. In all this he treated French finance
                    rather as a banker than as a profound political economist, and thus fell far
                    short of Turgot, who was the very greatest economist of his day. Politically he
                    did not do much to stave off the coming Revolution, and his· establishment of
                    provincial assemblies in the “pays d’élection” only tended to keep France
                    disunited. In 1781 he published his famous <hi rend="italic">Compte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Rendu,</hi> in which he drew the balance sheet of France, and was
                    dismissed from his office. Yet his dismissal was not really due to his book, but
                    tσ the influence of Marie Antoinette, whose schemes for benefiting the Due de
                    Guines he had thwarted. In retirement he occupied himself with literature, and
                    with his daughter, Mdlle Necker, who was his only child, and would be a wealthy
                    heiress. He first attempted to procure the young English statesman Mr Pitt for
                    her husband, but eventually chose the Swedish Baron Erik Magnus von
                    Staël-Holstein, on condition that his master made him Swedish ambassador at
                    Paris. Gustavus III. was quite willing, and in 1786 Mdlle Necker became Madame
                    de Staël. But neither Μ. nor Madame Necker cared to remain out of office, and in
                    1787 Necker was banished by “lettre de cachet” 40 leagues from Paris for
                    attacking Calonne. In 1788 the country, which had at the bidding of the literary
                    guests of Madame Necker come to believe that Necker was the only minister who
                    could “stop the deficit,” as they said, demanded Necker’s recall, and in
                    September 1788 he became once more director-general of the finances. He entered
                    office at a critical moment: Dauphiné was in actual rebellion, and France was
                    crying out for the summons of the states-general. Necker put a stop to the
                    rebellion in Dauphiné by legalizing its assembly, and then set to work to
                    arrange for the summons of the states-general. Throughout the early months of
                    1789 Necker was regarded as the saviour of France, but his conduct at the
                    meeting of the states-general sufficiently proved that he was not a. great
                    statesman, and showed that he regarded the states-general merely as an assembly
                    which should grant money,, not organize reforms. The same want of statesmanship
                    appeared in his vacillating conduct -with regard to the·, reunion of the three
                    orders, when he allowed the king to be forced by the assembly instead of taking
                    the lead in ordering the reunion. He was nevertheless regarded as· the cause of
                    the Revolution by the court, and on July 11, while at dinner, received the
                    abrupt order to leave France, at once. But Necker’s dismissal brought about the
                    taking-of the Bastille, which induced the king to recall his old minister. His
                    return was an absolute ovation, and he was received with joy in every city he
                    traversed. But at Paris he again proved to be no statesman. In his conceit he
                    believed he could save France alone, and refused to· act with Mirabeau or La
                    Fayette. He caused the king’s acceptance of the suspensive veto, by which he
                    sacrificed his chief prerogative in September, and destroyed all chance of a
                    strong executive by contriving the decree of November 7, by which the ministry
                    might not be chosen from the assembly. Financially he proved equally incapable
                    for a time of crisis, and could not understand the need of such extreme measures
                    as the establishment of assignats-in order to keep the country quiet. His
                    popularity-vanished when his only idea was to ask the assembly for new loans,
                    and in September 1790 he resigned his office, unregretted by a single Frenchman.
                    Not without difficulty he reached Coppet, near Geneva, an estate he had bought
                    in 1784. Here he occupied himself with literature, but Madame Necker pined for
                    her Paris salon, and died in 1794. He continued to live on at Coppet, under the
                    care of his daughter, Madame de Staël, and his niece, Madame Necker de Saussure,
                    but his time was past, and his books-had no political influence. A momentary
                    excitement was-caused by the advance of the French armies in 1798, when <pb
