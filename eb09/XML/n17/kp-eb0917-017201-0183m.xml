                    department of Loire-Inférieure, is situated on the right bank of the Loire, 35
                    miles above its mouth, in 47° 13' N. lat. and l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>
                    33' W. long. In population (117,555 inhabitants in 1881) it is the first city of
                    Brittany. At Nantes the Loire receives on the left hand the Sèvre Nantaise, and
                    on the right the Erdre, which forms the outlet of the canal between Nantes and
                    Brest; and a large number of bridges spanning the various branches of the
                    different streams join the several quarters of the city. Along the left bank of
                    the Loire stretches an ever-extending line of factories and shipbuilding yards.
                    In all there are 6 miles of quays, 2∙∣ miles traversing the city in its greatest
                    breadth from east to west along the main river. The largest vessels at present
                    come no farther than St Nazaire, but a canal is being made on the left bank
                    which will allow vessels drawing 16 feet to come up to the city. Nantes lies 264
                    miles west-south-west of Paris by the Angers and Le Mans Railway, and 40 miles
                    from St Nazaire. Other lines connect it with Rennes <hi rend="italic">via</hi>
                    Châteaubriant, La Roche-sur-Yon, Paimboeuf, and Pornic.</p>
                <p>The cathedral of Nantes, commenced in 1434 in the Gothic style, is still
                    unfinished. Its length will be, when completed, 335 feet, and the nave is 85
                    feet wide and 123 feet in height. The towers are 205 feet high. There are two
                    interesting monuments in the transept,—on the right Michel Colomb’s tomb of
                    Francis II., duke of Brittany, and his second wife Marguerite de Foix (1507),
                    and on the left that of General Lamoricière by Paul Dubois. The former consists
                    of a white marble base covered by a black marble slab on which rest the two
                    effigies, the four corners being occupied by upright figures of Justice,
                    Fortitude, Temperance, and Prudence. Of the other churches the more interesting
                    are St Nicolas, a modern building in the style of the 13th century, Ste Croix,
                    which occupies the site of an old pagan temple, and St Jacques on the left bank
                    of the Loire.</p>
                <p>Between the cathedral and the Loire, from which it is separated only by the
                    breadth of the quay, stands the castle of Nantes, founded in the 9th or 10th
                    century. Rebuilt by Francis II. and the duchess Anne, it was flanked by Mercoeur
                    in the time of the League with huge bastions decorated with the Lorraine cross.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0184-0173"/> of the dukes of Brittany it became a state prison
                    (Cardinal de Retz, Fouquet, and the duchess of Berri were confined within its
                    walls), and it is now occupied by the artillery headquarters. The chapel in
                    which the marriage of Louis XII. with Anne of Brittany was celebrated was
                    destroyed by an explosion in 1800. Nantes possesses a fine theatre, a
                    court-house, a prefecture, and an exchange, which includes both the tribunal and
                    the chamber of commerce. The town-hall possesses a curious casket in gold and
                    enamel which once, it is said, contained the heart of Anne of Brittany. The
                    public library is in the old corn-market, and the museum of painting and
                    sculpture finds scanty accommodation in the old cloth-market. Apart from the
                    beautiful collection presented to the town by the duke of Feltre, the catalogue
                    includes 1000 pictures and 130 statues. An archaeological museum has its
                    quarters in the old church of the Convent of the Oratory, where Fouché,
                    afterwards duke of Otranto, taught before the Revolution; part of the old mint
                    is occupied by the school of science and arts; and not far oS is the museum of
                    natural history, comprising a complete collection of the minerals of the
                    department. The botanic garden consists of a purely scientific portion and a
                    landscape garden which forms one of the finest promenades of its kind. Between
                    the Loire and the Erdre run Cours St Pierre and Cours St André, adorned at the
                    two ends of the line by statues of Anne of Brittany and Arthur III., Du Guesclin
                    and Olivier de Clisson, and separated by the Place Louis XVI., with a statue of
                    that monarch on a column 92 feet high. The Place Royale, the great meeting-place
                    of the principal thoroughfares of the city, contains a monumental fountain in
                    blue Rennes granite, with a white marble statue of the town of Nantes and bronze
                    statues of the Loire and four of its affluents—the Sèvre, the Erdre, the Cher,
                    and the Loir. A flight of steps at the west end of the town leads up from the
                    quay to the colossal cast-iron statue of St Anne, whence a splendid view may be
                    obtained over the valley of the Loire. Several old houses of the 15 th and 16th
                    centuries, the fish market, the railway station, and the Salorges (a vast
                    granite building now used as a bonded warehouse) are all of interest. Besides
                    two great hospitals —St Jacques on the left bank of the Loire, with 1600 beds,
                    and the Hôtel-Dieu, recently rebuilt in Gloriette island, with 1200 beds—Nantes
                    contains a deaf-mute institute, a secondary school of medicine and pharmacy, a
                    hydrographic school, a drawing school, a branch establishment of the
                    conservatoire at Paris, and a lyceum. It is the see of a bishop, and the
                    headquarters of the 11th corps d’armée. As a seat of the sugar manufacture
                    Nantes stands next to Paris and Marseilles. In city or suburbs there are vast
                    establishments for the manufacture of iron, copper, and lead, shipbuilding
                    yards, factories for agricultural and similar implements, oil-works, soap-works,
                    a national tobacco factory employing 1800 hands, a stainedglass factory, manure
                    works, and granite yards. Foodpreserving is a rapidly growing industry in all
                    the three departments of meat, fish, and vegetables (the last largely grown in
                    the neighbourhood). Commercially Nantes does not occupy so high a position as
                    formerly, being now only eleventh in the list of French ports, though its
                    customhouse still ranks second in amount of receipts. It imports coal from
                    England (duty free), wood from Scandinavia, colonial wares from the Antilles.
                    Its shipowners, whose vessels are rather more numerous than those of Havre, keep
                    possession of the greater part of the trade of the lower Loire and the coast
                    fisheries. In 1875 they had 745 vessels, of 150,000 tons aggregate burden. The
                    commercial movement of the port was 235,000 tons; and the value of the exports
                    and imports amounted to £5,000,000. In 1880 the movement was upwards of 400,000
                    tons.</p>
                <p>Previous to the Roman occupation, Nantes (Condivicenum) was the chief town of the
                    Nannetes, and under the conquerors it became a great commercial and
                    administrative centre. In the middle of tlιe 3d century Christianity was
                    introduced by St Clair. Clotaire I. got possession of the city in 560, and
                    placed it under the government of St Felix the bishop, who executed enormous
                    works to cause the Loire to flow under the walls of the castle. After being
                    several times subdued by Charlemagne, Brittany revolted under his successors,
                    and Nominoé, proclaimed king in 842, ordered the fortifications of Nantes to be
                    razed because it had sided with Charles the Bald. The Normans held the town from
                    843 to 936. About this time began the rivalry between Nantes and Rennes. Pierre
                    de Dreux, declared duke of Brittany by Philip Augustus, made Nantes his capital,
                    surrounded it with fortifications, and defended it valiantly against John of
                    England. During the Breton wars of succession Nantes took part first with
                    Montfort, but afterwards with Charles of Blois, and did not open its gates to
                    Montfort till his success was assured and his English allies had retired. In
                    1560 Francis II. granted Nantes a communal constitution. In the course of the
                    15th and 16th centuries the city suffered from several epidemics. Averse to
                    Protestantism, it joined the League along with Mercoeur, governor of Brittany,
                    who helped to raise the country into an independent duchy; and it was not till
                    1598 that it opened its gates to Henry IV., who here signed on May 2d of that
                    year the famous edict which until its revocation by Louis XIV. in 1685 was the
                    charter of Huguenot liberties in France (see vol. ix. p. 564, 579, and vol. xii.
                    p. 338-9). It was at Nantes that Count Chalais was punished for plotting against
                    Richelieu, that Fouquet was arrested, and that the Cellamare conspirators were
                    executed under the regent. Having warmly embraced the cause of the Revolution in
                    1789, the city was in 1793 treated with extremes! rigour by Carrier, of <hi
                    rend="italic">noyade</hi> fame. Under the empire its foreign commerce was
                    ruined. The duchess of Berri was arrested at Nantes in 1832 while trying to stir
                    up La Vendee against Louis Philippe. Anne of Brittany, Charles Errard, founder
                    of the French Academy at Rome, Generals Cambronne and Lamoricière, and Jules
                    Verne were born in the city.</p>
