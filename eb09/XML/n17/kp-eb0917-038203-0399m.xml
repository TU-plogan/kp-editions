                <p><label type="entry">NEWFOUNDLAND</label>. This island, which is a British colony,
                    lies off the eastern coast of North America, directly across the Gulf of St
                    Lawrence. Its south-western extremity approaches within 50 miles of Cape Breton,
                    while its most easterly projection is only 1640 miles from Valentia, on the
                    coast of Ireland. It is situated between 46° 36' 50" and 51° 39' N. lat., and
                    between 52° 37' and 59° 24' 50" W. long. Its greatest length, from Cape Ray to
                    Cape Norman, is 317 miles; its greatest breadth, from Cape Spear to Cape
                    Anguille, 316 miles; and the total area about 42,000 square miles. Its figure
                    roughly approaches an equilateral triangle. Two large peninsulas project from
                    the main body of the island. One of these (Petit Nord) points northwards, and is
                    long and narrow. The other is the peninsula of Avalon, pointing south-east, and
                    almost severed from the principal portion of the island, the connexion being a
                    narrow isthmus, in one place but 3 miles in width. On the eastern side of the
                    Avalon peninsula is situated St John’s, the capital. Owing to its extensive
                    frontage on the Atlantic, its numerous good harbours, and its proximity to the
                    Banks<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These Banks, which
                    have played such an important part in the history of the colony, and are the
                    chief source of its wealth, stretch for about 300 miles in a south-east
                    direction towards the centre of the North Atlantic, and probably at one time
                    formed a part of the North American continent. The depths range from 15 to 80 or
                    90 fathoms. The deposits consist of sand and gravel composed of ancient rocks,
                    and fragments of quartz, mica, hornblende, felspars, and magnetite; along with
                    these are many calcareous fragments of echinoderms, polyzoa, and many
                    foraminifera. In the deeper parts there is sometimes a fine mud containing the
                    above-mentioned minerals and calcareous fragments, and in addition numerous
                    frustules of diatoms. The Banks are swept by the cold Labrador current, and
                    icebergs are frequently stranded upon them. The Gulf Stream passes over their
                    southern portions. These two currents bear along many species of pelagic algae
                    and animals, which supply abundant food to the myriads of echinoderms, molluscs,
                    annelids, coelenterates, and other invertebrates which live at alljdepths on the
                    Banks. These invertebrates in turn supply food to the cod and other fishes which
                    are sought for by the fishermen. Sea birds frequent the Banks in great numbers;
                    and, as diving birds are not met with at any great distance from them, the
                    presence of these in the sea gives seamen an indication of the shallower
                    water.</p></note> and the smaller fishing grounds, Avalon is the most thickly
                    populated and commercially important part of the island.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> The shores of Newfoundland present
                    generally a rock-bound aspect when seen from the ocean, but. the line of cliffs
                    (200 to 300 feet in height) is broken by numerous magnificent bays, running in
                    some instances 80 to 90 miles inland, and throwing out smaller arms in all
                    directions, so that, though the circumference of the island, measuring from
                    headland to headland, is about 1000 miles, the actual length of coast-line is
                    more than twice as great. The bays frequently present scenes of much beauty,
                    being studded with islands, and having their shores clad in dark green forests
                    to the water’s edge.</p>
                <p>The part of the island nearest the sea consists of a hilly country with eminences
                    of no great elevation. The interior proper consists of an elevated undulating
                    plateau, traversed here and there by ranges of low hills, the surface being
                    diversified with valleys, woods, lakes, ponds, and marshes. Much of this is a
                    savanna country, sustaining vast herds of reindeer. All the great hill ranges
                    take a north-easterly and south-westerly direction, the highest land occurring
                    along the western and southern shores. The principal mountain chain, the Long
                    Range, extends along the western side of the island for nearly its entire
                    length, and has peaks more than 2000 feet high, and parallel to this, but nearer
                    the coast, is the Cape Anguille range. The peninsula of Avalon is very hilly;
                    but the highest summits do not exceed 1500 feet. The country is remarkable for a
                    number of isolated sharply-peaked summits which rise abruptly here and there
                    from the level plain, and bear the local name of “toits.”</p>
                <p>The largest river is the Exploits, 200 miles in length, and having a drainage
                    area of between 3000 and 4000 square miles. It rises in the extreme
                    south-western angle of the island, and flows in a north-easterly direction
                    through Red Indian Lake, terminating in the Bay of Exploits, Notre Dame Bay. The
                    valley through which it flows contains large areas of fertile land, capable of
                    yielding crops of all kinds, and in many places is covered with pine forests
                    containing timber of large growth. The next largest river is the Humber, which
                    rises 20 miles inland from Bonne Bay, and after a circuitous course empties
                    itself into Deer Lake, thence flowing into the Bay of Islands. It drains an area
                    of 2000 square miles. The Gander, which rises near the southern coast, and,
                    flowing through Gander Lake, falls into Gander Bay on the east, has a drainage
                    area of 2500 square miles.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable of the physical features of the island is the immense
                    number of lakes and ponds, which occupy nearly a third of the whole surface. The
                    largest is Grand Lake, 56 miles in length, and covering an area of 192 square
                    miles. It contains an island 22 miles in length and 5 in breadth. Red Indian
                    Lake is 37 miles long and 64 square miles in area; Gander Lake and Deer Lake
                    occupy 33 and 24 square miles respectively; Sandy Lake, Victoria, Hind’s, Terra
                    Nova, and George IV. Lakes range next in size. The shores of these great lakes,
                    and the fertile valleys through which their rivers flow, are as yet absolute
                    solitudes, the very existence of which was until recently all but unknown.</p>
                <p>Of the bays already alluded to, special mention may be made of St Mary’s Bay (25
                    miles wide at the mouth and 35 miles long, with two arms—Salmonier and Colinet—
                    which stretch still farther into the interior), Placentia Bay (55 milec wide at
                    the entrance and 90 miles long), Fortune Bay (25 miles wide and 70 in length,
                    with numerous arms, the chief of which are Bay D’Espoir, Hermitage Bay, and
                    Connaigre Bay). At the entrance of Fortune Bay are the two islands of St Pierre
                    and Miquelon, ceded by treaty to France for the shelter of its fishermen, and
                    now all that remains to France of the vast possessions it once held in North
                    America. Around Bay St George, on the western coast (40 miles wide at the mouth
                    and with a good harbour at its head), are some of the most fertile valleys in
                    the island, with fine forests of timber, and a coal-field of large extent. Bay
                    of Islands has three fine arms running 20 miles inland. It is the seat of a
                    valuable herring fishery. Notre Dame Bay is 50 miles wide at its mouth, and runs
                    inland 70 or 80 miles. On its shores are the now famous copper mines, which are
                    worked with great success.</p>

                <p>Bonavista Bay is of great extent, contains numerous groups of islands, and
                    presents some of the finest scenery in the island. Conception Bay is the most
                    populous and commercially important, having on its shores towns and villages
                    containing a population of 42,000. The harbour of St John’s is spacious and well
                    sheltered.</p>

                    type="authorial"><p>The geological survey of the island was commenced in 1864,
                    and has been prosecuted steadily since; the results are embodied in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Geological Survey of Newfoundland,</hi> by A. Murray, C.M.G.,
                    1881.</p></note><hi rend="italic">—</hi> All the great ancient rock systems,
                    between the Lower Laurentian and the Coal-measures, are more or less represented
                    at one part or another of Newfoundland.</p>
                <p>The Laurentian system has an immense spread in the island. It constitutes the
                    principal mountain ranges, coming to the surface through the more recent
                    deposits, on the axes of anticlinal lines, or brought up by great dislocations,
                    most of which trend nearly parallel with each other in a general bearing of
                    about north-north-east and southsouth-west. The Laurentian gneiss of the Long
                    Range, on the western side, extends in a nearly straight course from Cape Ray to
                    the headwaters of the Castor in the great northern peninsula. On the
                    south-western extremity of the island these rocks occupy the coast from Cape Ray
                    to La Poile. They are largely exhibited on the Grand Lake, running in a spur
                    from the Long Range between it and the Red Indian Lake, and bearing for the
                    south-eastern shores of Hall’s Bay. The central portion of the northern
                    peninsula is Laurentian, which also spreads over a wide expanse of country
                    between Grand Lake and the Humber and Exploits rivers, and shows itself on the
                    coast between Canada Bay and White Bay. Another range of Laurentian comes up in
                    the district of Ferryland, and shows itself occasionally on the coast of
                    Conception Bay. Thus more than half the island is Laurentian.</p>
                <p>Three-fourths of the peninsula of Avalon are Huronian, a formation which does not
                    extend west of Fortune Bay. The town of St John’s and, in fact, nearly all the
                    settlements between Fortune Bay and Bonavista Bay are built upon it. Signal
                    Hill, overlooking the harbour of St John’s, is capped with the sandstone of this
                    formation. The whole Huronian system is not less than 10,000 feet thick, and has
                    been cut through by denudation to the Laurentian floor. The rocks of the
                    Primordial Silurian age are spread unconformably over the area thus ground down.
                    These evidences of denudation and reconstruction are very clear in Conception
                    Bay, where the rocks of the intermediary system have been ground down to the
                    Laurentian gneiss, and, subsequently, the submarine valley thus formed has been
                    filled up with a new set of sediments, the remains of which are still to be
                    found skirting the shores of the bay and forming the islands in it.</p>
                <p>Rocks of the Silurian age are most extensive on the peninsula of Cape St Mary,
                    and around the head of Trinity Bay. These belong to the Primordial Silurian
                    group. The Lower Silurian rocks have a large development, and in them the
                    metallic ores occur which seem destined to render the island a great mining
                    centre. The Lauzon division of the Quebec group, which is the true metalliferous
                    zone of North America, has an immense spread in the island. It consists of
                    serpentine rocks associated with dolomites, diorites, &amp;c., and is well known
                    throughout North America to be usually more or less metalliferous. The
                    Newfoundland rocks are no exception, but give evidence of being rich in metallic
                    ores. The Middle Silurian division of rocks is also widely spread; and the most
                    fertile belts of land and the most valuable forests are nearly all situated on
                    the country occupied by this formation. The great valley of the Exploits and
                    Victoria rivers, the valley of the Gander, and several smaller tracts belong to
                    it.</p>
                <p>The Carboniferous series occupies a large area on the western side of the island,
                    in the neighbourhood of St George’s Bay and Grand Lake. There is also a wider
                    spread of the same series along the valley of the Humber and round the shores of
                    Deer Lake and the eastern half of Grand Lake, and as far as Sandy Lake. “Coal,”
                    says Mr Howley, “is known to exist at several places in this series; and seams,
                    apparently of workable thickness, judging from their out-crops, occur on the
                    Middle Barachois and Robinson’s Brook, in St George’s Bay.”</p>
                <p>It will thus be seen that the Carboniferous series is confined to the western
                    side, while the middle, eastern, and southern portions are occupied by Silurian,
                    Huronian, and Laurentian formations. From the extent to which the Lauzon
                    division of the Quebec group, the true metalliferous zone of North America,
                    prevails in the island, its yet undeveloped mineral wealth must be very great,
                    while it is fitted to sustain a large agricultural population.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate is more temperate than that of most
                    portions of the neighbouring continent. It is but rarely, and then only for a
                    few hours, that the thermometer sinks below zero in winter, while the summer
                    range rarely exceeds 80° Fahr., and for the most part does not rise above 70°.
                    The Arctic current exerts a chilling influence along the eastern coast, but as a
                    compensation it brings with it the enormous wealth of commercial fishes and
                    seals which has rendered the fisheries the most productive in the world. The
                    Gulf Stream, while it creates fogs, modifies the cold. The salubrity of the
                    climate is evidenced by the robust healthy appearance of the inhabitants. Open
                    fireplaces are sufficient to warm the houses, and free exercise in the open air
                    is attainable at all seasons. The average mean temperature at St John’s for
                    eight years ending 1864 was 41° ’ 2 Fahr., the maximum being 83° and the minimum
                    7°; the average height of the barometer was 29 ’ 37 inches.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Tables of Aqueous
                    Precipitation for Series of Years,</hi> collected by the Smithsonian
                    Institution, United States, 1872.</p></note> The average rainfall is 58 ’ 30
                    inches. Winter sets in, as a rule, in the beginning of December, and lasts until
                    the middle of April. Generally the snow lies during this period, and the frost
                    rarely penetrates the ground to a greater depth than a few inches. Spring is
                    sometimes late in arriving, but once vegetation sets in it advances with
                    marvellous rapidity. The autumn is usually very fine, and is often prolonged
                    till November. There is nothing in the climate to interfere with agriculture.
                    Tornadoes are unknown, and thunderstorms are very rare. Fogs, of which so much
                    is said in connexion with the country, are confined to the shores and bays of
                    the southeastern and southern coasts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> Among the well-known wild animals indigenous to
                    the country the caribou or reindeer hold a conspicuous place. They migrate
                    regularly between the south-eastern and north-western portions of the island.
                    The winter months are passed in the south, where “browse” is plentiful, and the
                    snow is not too deep to prevent them from reaching the lichens on the lower
                    grounds. In March they begin their spring migration to the barrens and mountains
                    of the north-west. In May or June they bring forth their young. As soon as the
                    frosts of October begin to nip the vegetation they turn south. September and
                    October are the best months for stalking. In addition to the caribou, the wolf
                    and black bear are found in the interior; the fox (black, silver, grey, and
                    red), beaver, otter, arctic hare, North-American hare, weasel, bat, rat, mouse,
                    and musquash or musk-rat are numerous. The famous Newfoundland dog is still to
                    be met with, but good specimens are rare, and he appears to thrive better
                    elsewhere. The common dogs are a degenerate mongrel race. It is estimated that
                    there are three hundred species of birds in the island, most of them being
                    migratory. Among them may be enumerated the eagle, hawk, owl, woodpecker,
                    swallow, kingfisher, six species of fly-catchers and the same number of
                    thrushes, warblers and swallows in great variety, finches, ravens, jays. The
                    ptarmigan or willow grouse is very abundant, and is the finest game-bird in the

                    curlews, the brent goose, ducks, petrels, gulls, and the great northern diver
                    are met with everywhere. The great auk, now extinct, was once found in myriads
                    around the island. The little auk, guillemot, and the razor-billed auk are
                    abundant. No venomous reptiles, toads, or frogs occur. Of molluscous animals the
                    common squid, a cephalopod about 6 or 7 inches in length, visits the coasts in
                    immense shoals in August and September, and supplies a valuable bait. A gigantic
                    species of cephalopod was discovered in 1873, which excited much interest among
                    naturalists: the body varies from 7 to 15 feet in length, with a circumference
                    of 5 or 6 feet; from the head ten arms radiate, the two longest (tentacles)
                    being from 24 to 40 feet in length, and covered with suckers at their
                    extremities; the other eight arms vary from 6 to 11 feet, and on one side are
                    entirely covered with suckers. Professor Verrill, of Yale College, has
                    distinguished two species—one he named <hi rend="italic">Architeιdhis
                    Harυeyi,</hi> after the discoverer, and the other <hi rend="italic"

                    The pine, spruce, birch, juniper, and larch of the forests of the interior
                    furnish ample materials for a large timber trade as well as for shipbuilding
                    purposes. The white pine grows to the height of 70 or 80 feet in some places,
                    and is 3 or 4 feet in diameter. The mountain ash, balsam poplar, and aspen
                    thrive well. Evergreens are in great variety. The berry-bearing plants cover
                    large areas of the island. The maidenhair or capillaire yields a saccharine
                    matter which is lusciously sweet. Flowering plants and ferns are in vast
                    varieties, and wild grasses and clover grow luxuriantly. Garden vegetables of
                    all kinds, and strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, currants, &amp;c.,
                    thrive well.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.—</hi> These constitute the grand staple industry of
                    the country. The most important is that of the cod, which is the most extensive
                    of the kind in the world. During six years from 1877 to 1882 the average annual
                    export of codfish from Newfoundland amounted to 1,326,259 quintals (cwts.). (For
                    earlier statistics see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fisheries,</hi> vol. ix. p. 266.)
                    The cod are taken on the shores of the island, on the Banks, and along the coast
                    of Labrador. The Bank fishery is now prosecuted chiefly by the French and by
                    Americans, Newfoundlanders occupying themselves with the shore and Labrador
                    fishery. The aggregate annual catch of cod at present in the North-American
                    waters is estimated at 3,700,000 quintals, say 150,000,000 fish. The value at $4
                    a quintal would be $14,800,000. Nearly four-fifths of the entire returns of the
                    Newfoundland fisheries arise from the cod fishery.</p>
                <p>While the cod fishery does not show any marked advance in the quantities taken
                    during the last thirty years, the market value of dried codfish has risen more
                    than 50 per cent., and the average value of the exported products of the fishery
                    may be fairly reckoned at $5,500,000 per annum. Adding to this the local
                    consumption, we must place the entire annual value at $6,364,000, or £1,325,834
                    sterling.</p>
                <p>The last census (1874) showed that there were 26,377 able-bodied fishermen in the
                    colony, and 45,845 persons engaged in catching and curing fish out of a
                    population of 161,374, 1197 vessels of a tonnage of 61,551 tons, 8902 fishing
                    rooms in actual use, and 18,611 boats employed in the shore fishery. There are
                    now (1883) about 53,000 persons engaged in catching and curing fish out of a
                    population exceeding 180,000. The French Newfoundland fisheries on the Banks and
                    along the shores average from 400,000 to 500,000 quintals,—the number of men
                    employed being 5000 to 6000.</p>
                <p>The cod fishery has been prosecuted for about 380 years, but, notwithstanding the
                    enormous drafts every year, to all appearance the cod are as abundant as ever.
                    They begin to appear on the coasts of the island about the first of June, at
                    which time they move from the deep waters of the coast to the shallower and
                    warmer waters near the shore, for spawning purposes. Their approach is heralded
                    by the caplin, a beautiful little fish about 7 inches in length, vast shoals of
                    which arrive, filling every bay and harbour. The cod follow in their wake,
                    feasting greedily upon the caplin, which supply the best bait. In six weeks the
                    caplin disappear, and their place is taken by the squid about the 1st of August.
                    These also supply a valuable bait, and are followed by the herring, which
                    continue till the middle or end of October, when the cod fishery closes. The cod
                    are taken by the hook-and-line, the seine, the cod-net or gill-net, the
                    cod-trap, and the bultow. Newfoundland exports cod to Brazil, Spain, Portugal,
                    Italy, Great Britain, the West Indies, and the United States. Brazil and Spain
                    are the largest consumers.</p>
                <p>Next to the cod fishery in value comes that of the seal, which is not more than
                    eighty years old. At present the average annual value of the seal fishery is
                    about $1,100,000, being an eighth part of the entire exports. The number of men
                    employed is from 8000 to 10,000. Steamers were first used in 1863, and now there
                    are about 25 engaged, some of them from 400 to 500 tons burthen; sailing vessels
                    are rapidly diminishing in numbers. According to law, no sailing vessel can
                    clear for the seal fishery before the 1st of March, and no steamer before the
                    10th. The young seals are born on the ice from the 15th to the 25th of February,
                    and increase in bulk so rapidly that they are in perfect condition by the 20th
                    March.</p>
                <p>The seals frequenting the coasts of Newfoundland have regular migratory
                    movements. They are found on the ice from the middle of February till May, when
                    they commence their northerly movement. In June they are seen in enormous
                    numbers on the Greenland coast, where they spend two or three months. As the
                    early winter sets in they begin their southern migration, keeping ahead of the
                    ice as it forms, and moving towards the coast of Labrador, feeding in its fiords
                    and bays. Beaching the Great Banks by the close of the year, they feed there
                    till the beginning of February, when their northern migration begins, to meet
                    the ice on which their young are to be brought forth and cradled. For more than
                    sixty years they have borne an annual draft of from a quarter to half a million
                    without showing any sensible diminution in their numbers, but the introduction
                    of steam has given increased facilities for following the old seals at a later
                    period of the season, and for shooting them on the ice,—a practice which may
                    ultimately lead to their extermination.</p>
                <p>There are no finer salmon streams than those of Newfoundland, but no proper
                    measures have been taken for their preservation, and in consequence such
                    practices as closing the mouths of the rivers with nets at a time when the fish
                    are ascending to spawn, and constructing weirs, traps, and dams, have been
                    followed to such an extent that in many of the rivers salmon are almost
                    exterminated. The average value of the pickled and fresh salmon exported, during
                    the last ten years, has been about $106,000 per annum. Until recently the chief
                    mode of curing the salmon was salting. In 1842 the export was 4715 tierces; in
                    1871, 3977; in 1880, 6765; in 1881, 3689; and in 1882, 3825 tierces. The methods
                    of preserving salmon in hermetically sealed tins and of exporting it in ice have
                    been lately introduced with success. Of tinned salmon 34,584 ft&gt; were
                    exported in 1880, 20,000 lb in 1881, and 10,000 lb in 1882, while 68,551 lb of
                    frozen salmon were exported in 1881, and 313,000 lb in 1882.</p>
                <p>The chief seats of the herring fishery are Fortune Bay, St George’s Bay, Bay of
                    Islands, Bonne Bay, and the whole coast of Labrador. The finest fish are those
                    taken off Labrador and in the Bay of Islands. The average annual value of
                    herrings exported during the seven years 1877-83 was $358,359. The value of the
                    herrings sold to the French and Americans as bait is about $150,000 per annum.
                    Allowing 73,000 barrels for home comsumption, at $3 per barrel, we have as the
                    total value of the annual catch of herrings $727,359.</p>
                <p>Fifty years ago the mackerel, once very abundant, deserted the Newfoundland
                    waters, and have not since reappeared. But few holibut or haddock are taken.
                    Within the last few years the exportation of preserved lobsters has increased
                    rapidly. Lobster factories have been established at various points. In 1881,
                    1,299,812 lb of preserved lobsters were exported, and 46,428 lb of frozen
                    lobsters, the total value being $111,408. In 1882 the export was 1,265,224 lb of
                    preserved lobsters, the value being $105,432.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Up to a comparatively recent period the
                    people of Newfoundland were so exclusively engaged in the fisheries that no
                    attention was given to agriculture; and persons who were interested in keeping
                    the inhabitants on the sea-coast employed in fishing systematically represented
                    the country as hopelessly barren. That this is not the case has been
                    conclusively proved by the geological survey. According to its <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reports</hi> there are in the valleys on the western coast 1320 square miles
                    “perfectly capable of being reclaimed and converted into fairly productive
                    grazing and arable land”; and these valleys are also for the most part well
                    wooded. In the great valleys of the Gander, Gambo, Terra Nova, and Exploits
                    there are 3320 square miles of land suited admirably for settlement. There are
                    also many smaller fertile tracts around the heads of the bays, along the margin
                    of the smaller streams, and in the islands, so that in all there are 5,000,000
                    acres of cultivable land. At present these fertile tracts are almost wholly
                    unoccupied, but the railway now being constructed will render them accessible
                    and promote their settlement. The last census showed that only 34,293 acres are
                    actually cultivated, the value of the produce being $612,350 per annum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The first copper mine was opened in 1864, and
                    at the end of 1879 the customs returns showed that copper and nickel ore to the
                    value of £1,000,000 had been exported in the interval. At present Newfoundland
                    stands sixth among the copper-producing countries of the world. The mines are
                    all situated around the shores of the Bay of Notre Dame; and until the interior
                    is opened by roads and railways this will be the chief scene of mining
                    enterprise. From one of these mines—Betts Cove—35,000 tons of ore were taken in
                    1877. The ore is found in proximity to the serpentine rocks, but more
                    immediately associated with a chloritic slate which occurs both above and below
                    the serpentine. The area of serpentine rocks in the island is estimated at 5097
                    square miles. Many other minerals besides copper have been found, such as lead
                    (in many places), silver, and magnetic iron ore; gold was recently discovered in
                    one locality. In St George’s Bay there are large workable seams of coal as yet
                    untouched; a seam of excellent cannel coal, 3 feet in thickness, was discovered
                    there many years ago. Mr Jukes estimated the coal basin at 25 miles by 10.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Shipping.—</hi> On December 31, 1881, the registered tonnage of
                    the colony was 1895 vessels, having a tonnage of 89,655 tons. Of these 1866 were
                    sailing vessels and 29 were steamers. In addition, 60 vessels 'were engaged in
                    the foreign carrying trade which, though owned in Newfoundland, were registered
                    in Britain. The number of vessels entered at the various ports in 1881 was 1366,
                    of 158,345 tons; the number cleared was 1018, of 132,743 tons. The number of
                    steamers cleared at the various ports in 1881 was 181, their tonnage 162,285.
                    The total value of exports in 1882 was §8,228,291; of imports, §8,350,222.</p>

                    confined to St John’s. There are a boot and shoe factory, a woollen factory, two
                    tobacco factories, three furniture factories, a rope and cordage factory, three
                    biscuit factories, a tannery, and soap works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population. —</hi> The earliest estimate of the resident
                    population of ewfbundland was made in 1654, when the total amounted to 1750. In
                    1680 it reached 2280; in 1763, 7000; in 1804, 20,000; in 1832, 60,000; in 1836,
                    75,094; in 1857, 124,288; in 1869, 146,536; and in 1874, when the last census
                    was taken, the total population was 161,374. It is now (1883) probably 185,000.
                    St John’s, the capital, contained a population of 15,000 in 1835, and in 1882 it
                    was close on 30,000. From 1845 to 1857 the rate of increase for the island was
                    25 per cent., from 1857 to 1869 18⅜ per cent., and from 1869 to 1874 10 per

                    chiefly, and the Roman Catholic portion descendants of Irish emigrants.</p>
                <p>Education is conducted on the separate or denominational principle, each
                    religious denomination receiving an amount for its elementary schools and
                    academies proportionate to its numbers. The grant amounts to §93,252 per annum.
                    The total number of scholars in attendance at the schools is 24,971, and the
                    number of schools 416. There are four academies in St John’s, and grammar
                    schools in some of the larger towns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Finance.—</hi> The revenue is chiefly derived from duties
                    levιeα on imports. These are partly <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> and partly
                    specific, but only to a very slight extent differential, the tariff being
                    designed for revenue purposes only, not for protection. There are no direct
                    taxes, and no city or town corporations. The expenses connected with the various
                    branches of the public service are all defrayed out of the general revenue. The
                    taxation in 1882 was only §4’94 per head of a population of 185,368. Within the
                    last twenty years the revenue has more than doubled. In 1860 it amounted to
                    §534,432, and in 1882 to §1,119,385. The consolidated and debenture debt of the
                    colony on December 31, 1881, was §1,351,008. The colony has placed to its credit
                    at 4 per cent. §757,704, being a portion of the fishery award in connexion with
                    the treaty of Washington; and a sinking fund has been established which in
                    twenty-one years will remove over half the public debt.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> Newfoundland is a British colony, directly
                    dependent on the crown. Representative government and a constitution were
                    granted to it in 1832, and “responsible government” in 1855. Two legislative
                    chambers were appointed—the house of assembly, to be elected, and the
                    legislative council, to be nominated by the governor in council. This form of
                    government has worked satisfactorily. It consists of a governor who is appointed
                    by the crown, and whose term of office is usually about six years; an executive
                    council chosen by the party commanding a majority in the house of assembly, and
                    consisting of seven members; a legislative council or upper house, of fifteen
                    members, nominated by the governor in council and holding office for life; and a
                    house of assembly of thirty-three members, elected every four years by the votes
                    of the people. There are seventeen electoral districts. The members of the lower
                    house are elected by household suffrage. The governor receives a salary of
                    §12,000 per annum, paid by the colony. The supreme court, instituted in 1826, is
                    composed of a chief justice with a salary of §5000 per annum and two assistant
                    judges with salaries of §4000. They are appointed by the crown, and hold their
                    office for life. The jurisdiction of Newfoundland extends over the whole of the
                    Atlantic coast of Labrador.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roads and Railways.—</hi> The first road was made in 1825 (from
                    St John’s to Portugal Cove), and about §100,000 per annum are now devoted to
                    making and repairing roads and bridges. At present there are 727 miles of postal
                    roads and 1730 miles of district roads, besides 1200 miles in process of
                    construction. In 1880 Government wjιs authorized by the legislature to raise a
                    loan of £1,000,000 sterling, on the credit of the colony, for the purpose of
                    constructing a railway from St John’s to Hall’s Bay, the centre of the mining
                    region, with branches to Brigus, Harbour Grace, and Carbonear, the whole length
                    to be 340 miles. At the close of 1882 there were 45 miles open for traffic. This
                    railway, when completed, will traverse the great valleys of the Gander and
                    Exploits, and afford access to the finest agricultural and timber lands. In 1882
                    a charter was granted to “The Great American and European Short Line Railway
                    Company” to construct another line which is to run from a point on the eastern
                    coast to Cape Ray, the object being to shorten the route between Europe and
                    America by crossing Newfoundland. The proposed plan is to place a line of the
                    swiftest steamers between Newfoundland and a port on the Irish coast; the
                    proposed railway across the island would convey passengers to Cape Ray, whence a
                    steam-ferry would carry them to Cape North, in the island of Cape Breton, and
                    the railway system of Canada would be reached. The company calculate on
                    shortening the time of travel between London and New York by two days.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Newfoundland, the most ancient of Great
                    Britain’s immense colonial possessions, was discovered by <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >John Cabot</hi> (see vol. iv. p. 622) in 1497. Gasper Cortoreal, who ranged the
                    coast of North America in 1500, discovered and named Conception Bay and Portugal
                    Cove in Newfoundland, and established the first regular fisheries on its shores.
                    Seven years after Cabot’s discoveries the fishermen of Normandy, Brittany, and
                    the Basque Provinces were engaged in these. In 1517 40 sail of Portuguese,
                    French, and Spaniards took part in the cod fishery. In 1578, according to
                    Hakluyt, the number of vessels employed in it. had increased to 400, of which
                    only 50 were English, the remainder being French and Spanish. At length,
                    however, England awoke to the importance of Cabot’s great discovery, and an
                    attempt was made to plant a colony on the shores of the island. Sir Humphrey
                    Gilbert (see vol. x. p. 591), provided with letters patent from Queen Elizabeth,
                    landed at St John’s in August 1583, and formally took possession of the country
                    in the queen’s name. This first attempt at colonizing was frustrated by the loss
                    of Gilbert soon afterwards at sea. In 1610 James I. granted a patent to Mr Guy,
                    an enterprising Bristol merchant, for “a plantation” in Newfound* land; but no
                    marked success attended his efforts to found settlements. In 1615 Captain
                    Richard Whitbourne of Exmouth in Devonshire was despatched to Newfoundland by
                    the British Admiralty to establish order and correct abuses which had grown up
                    among the fishermen. On his return in 1622 he wrote a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discourse and Discovery of Newfoundland Trade,</hi> which King James, by an
                    order in council, caused to be distributed among the parishes of the kingdom
                    “for the encouragement of adventurers unto plantation there.” A year after the
                    departure of Whitbourne, Sir George Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, obtained
                    a patent conveying to him the lordship of the whole southern peninsula of
                    Newfoundland, and the right of fishing in the surrounding waters. He planted a
                    colony at Ferryland, 40 miles north of Cape Race, where he built a handsome
                    mansion and resided with his family for many years. The French so harassed his
                    settlement by incessant attacks that he at length abandoned it and went to
                    Maryland, where he founded the city of Baltimore.</p>
                <p>In 1650, or about a century and a half after its discovery, Newfoundland
                    contained only 350 families, or less than 2000 individuals, distributed in
                    fifteen small settlements, chiefly along the eastern shore. These constituted
                    the resident population; but in addition there was a floating population of
                    several thousands who frequented the shores during the summer for the sake of
                    the fisheries, which had now attained very large dimensions. So early as 1626
                    150 vessels were annually despatched from Devonshire alone; and the shipowners
                    and traders residing in the west of England sent out their ships and fishing
                    crews early in summer, to prosecute these lucrative fisheries. The fish caught
                    were salted and dried on shore; and on the approach of λvinter the fishermen
                    re-embarked for England, carrying with them the products of their labour. Hence
                    it became the interest of these traders and shipowners to discourage the
                    settlement of the country, in order to retain the exclusive use of the harbours
                    and fishing coves for their servants, and also a monopoly of the fisheries. They
                    were able to enlist the British Government of the day in their project, and
                    stringent laws were passed prohibiting settlement within 6 miles of the shore,
                    forbidding fishermen to remain behind at the close of the fishing season, and
                    rendering it illegal to build or repair a house without a special licence. The
                    object of this short-sighted policy, which was persisted in for more than a
                    century, was to preserve the island as a fishing station, and the fisheries as
                    nurseries for British seamen.</p>
                <p>There was, however, another element which retarded the prosperity of the country.
                    The French had early realized the immense value of the fisheries, and strove
                    long and desperately to obtain possession of the island. Their constant attacks
                    and encroachments harassed the few settlers, and rendered life and property
                    insecure during the long wars between England and France. When at length, in
                    1713, the treaty of Utrecht ended hostilities, it did not deliver Newfoundland
                    from the grasp of France, as it yielded to her the right of catching and drying
                    fish on the western and northern side of the island. Though no territorial
                    rights were conferred on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0405-0386"/> French, and the sovereignty was secured to
                    England, the practical effect was to exclude the inhabitants from the fairest
                    half of the island. Interminable disputes have arisen regarding those treaties,
                    which are not yet settled, and, as a consequence, the fine lands of western
                    Newfoundland are still untenanted, and the mineral treasures untouched.</p>
                <p>In spite of the restrictive regulations, the number of the resident population
                    continued to increase. The sturdy settlers clung to the soil, combated the
                    “adventurers,” as the merchants were called, and after a lengthened conflict
                    obtained freedom of settlement and relief from oppression. But the contest was
                    severe and so prolonged that only seventy years have elapsed since the repeal of
                    the last of those laws which prohibited settlement and the cultivation of the
                    soil. The progress of the colony since has been most satisfactory.</p>
                <p>The merchant-adventurers strenuously opposed the appointment of a governor; but
                    at length, in 1728, the British) Government appointed Captain Henry Osborne
                    first governor of Newfoundland, with a commission to establish a form of civil
                    government. This constituted a new era in the history of the colony. In 1763 the
                    fixed inhabitants had increased to 8000, while 5000 more were summer residents
                    who returned home each winter. In 1765 the coast of Labrador, from the entrance
                    of Hudson’s Strait to the river St John, opposite the west end of the island of
                    Anticosti, was attached to the governorship of Newfoundland. The population in
                    1785 had increased to 10,000. During the wars between England and France which
                    followed the French Revolution, Newfoundland attained great prosperity, as all
                    competitors in the fisheries were swept from the seas, and the markets of Europe
                    were exclusively in the hands of the merchants of the country. The value of fish
                    trebled; wages rose to a high figure; and in 1814 no less than 7000 emigrants
                    arrived. The population now numbered 80,000. In 1832 representative government
                    was granted to the colony, and provision was made for education. In 1846 a
                    terrible fire destroyed three-fourths of St John’s, and with it an enormous
                    amount of property; but the city rose from its ashes improved and beautified. In
                    1855 the system of responsible government was inaugurated. In 1858 the first
                    Atlantic cable was landed at Bay of Bull’s Arm, Trinity Bay.</p>
                <p>Unproductive fisheries, causing a widespread destitution among the working
                    classes, marked the first eight years of the decade between 1860 and 1870. A
                    system of able-bodied pauper relief was initiated to meet the necessities of the
                    case, but was attended with the usual demoralizing results. The necessity of
                    extending the cultivation of the soil in order to meet the wants of the growing
                    i)opulation was felt more and more as the pressure arising from the ailure of
                    the fisheries showed their precarious nature more sensibly. In 1864 copper ore
                    was discovered in the north, and mining operations, furnishing employment for
                    the people, were successfully initiated. In 1869 a series of successful
                    fisheries began, which enabled the Government to terminate the injurious system
                    of able-bodied pauper relief. In 1871 the revenue rose to $831,160. In 1873
                    direct steam communication with England and America was established.</p>
