                    (1798-1870), the well-known Orientalist, was born of Jewish parents at
                    Reich-mansdorf near Bamberg, on the 22d December 1798. He began life in a
                    merchant’s office at Frankfort, but finding commerce unsuited to his taste he
                    resigned his desk, and in 1816 entered as a student at the university of
                    Heidelberg. From thence he went to Munich, where, under the influence of the
                    liberal opinions which were fast gaining possession of his mind, he deserted his
                    hereditary faith for the Lutheran communion. Once more he sought another alma
                    mater, and finally completed his studies at Göttingen. In 1822 he was appointed
                    to a professorship in a gymnasium at Spires, but the same freedom of thought
                    which had led him to leave the religion of his fathers brought him into conflict
                    with the authorities of that institution, who, believing the religious tendency
                    of his historical teaching to be heterodox, dismissed him from his office. About
                    this time he appears to have entered on the serious study of Armenian, and in
                    1827 we find him at Venice devoting himself to that language under the guidance
                    of the monks of the monastery of San Lazaro. In the following year he visited
                    Paris for the purpose of pursuing a more general study of the Oriental
                    languages, among which Chinese had for him a special attraction. It was not,
                    however, until he reached London in 1829 that <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0917-0376-0363"/> he first contemplated visiting China, a
                    project which in 1830 he carried into execution. While in that country he
                    gathered together a library of 10,000 volumes, consisting of works in all
                    departments of literature, and he also purchased a collection of works in 2400
                    volumes for the royal library at Berlin. On his return to Europe in 1831 he
                    presented the 10,000 volumes to the royal library at Munich, and was most
                    appropriately installed by the Government as curator of his gift, as well as
                    professor of Chinese at the university. His lectures at this period of his
                    career were no less conspicuous for the deep and wide knowledge they displayed
                    of the languages and history of the East than for the zeal for social progress
                    which was apparent in them. During the disturbed years which preceded the
                    revolutionary period of 1848 the natural tendency of his mind placed him in the
                    fore front among the “friends of the people,” and when the outbreak came he was
                    elected a member of the Bavarian Provisional Parliament. The prominent position
                    thus accorded to him cost him his professorship when four years afterwards the
                    royalists found themselves sufficiently powerful to make such reprisals. He,
                    however, still remained at Munich pursuing his favourite studies until 1864,
                    when he removed to Berlin, where he died on the 17 th March 1870.</p>
