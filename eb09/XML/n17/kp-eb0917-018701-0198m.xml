                    Constantinople the claim of occupying the most beautiful site in Europe. It is
                    situated on the northern shore of the Bay of Naples <hi rend="italic"

                    E. long., as taken from the lighthouse on the mole. By rail it is distant 161
                    miles from Rome.</p>
                <p>No other place in the world combines within the same compass so much natural
                    beauty with so many objects of interest to the antiquary, the historian, and the
                    geologist as the Bay of Naples. Its circuit is about 35 miles from the Capo di
                    Miseno on the north-west to the Punta della Campanella on the south-east, or
                    more than 52 miles if the islands of Ischia, at the north-west, and of Capri, at
                    the south entrance, be included. At its opening between these two islands it is
                    14 miles broad; and from the opening to its head at Portici the distance is 15
                    miles. It affords good anchorage, with nearly 7 fathoms water, and is well
                    sheltered, except from winds which blow from points between south-east and
                    south-west. There is a perceptible tide of nearly 9 inches.</p>
                <p>On the north-east shore of the bay, east of Naples, is an extensive flat, forming
                    part of the ancient <hi rend="italic">Campania Felix,</hi> and watered by the
                    small stream Sebeto and by the Sarno, which formerly flowed by Pompeii. From
                    this flat, between the sea and the range of the Apennines, rises Vesuvius, at
                    the base of which, on or near the sea-shore, are the town-like villages of San
                    Giovanni Teduccio, Portici, Resina, Torre del Greco, Torre dell’ Annunziata,
                    Ac., and the classic sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii. At the south-east
                    extremity of the plain, 3 miles beyond the outlet of the Sarno, a great offshoot
                    of the Apennines, branching from the main range near Cava, and projecting as a
                    peninsula more than 12 miles west, divides the Bay of Naples from the Bay of
                    Salerno <hi rend="italic">(Sinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Paestanus),</hi> and ends

                    strait of 4 miles from Capri. On the north slope of this peninsula, where the
                    plain ends and the coast abruptly bends to the west, stands the town of
                    Castellammare, near the site of <hi rend="italic">Stabiae,</hi> at the foot of

                    western, or Bay of Baiae, which is sheltered from all winds. A tunnel through
                    the promontory, 2244 feet long, 21 feet broad, and in some places as much as 70

                <p>The city of Naples is built at the base and on the slopes of a range of volcanic
                    hills, and, rising from the shore like an amphitheatre, is seen to best
                    advantage from the water. From the summit occupied by the castle of St Elmo a
                    transverse ridge runs south to form the promontory of Pizzofalcone, and divides
                    the city into two natural crescents. The western crescent, known as the Chiaja
                    ward, though merely a long and narrow strip between the sea and Vomero hill, is
                    the fashionable quarter most affected by foreign residents and visitors. A fine
                    broad street, the Riviera di Chiaja, commenced in the close of the 16th century
                    by Count d’Olivares, and completed by the Duke de Medina Celi (1695-1700), runs
                    for a mile and a half from east to west, ending in the quarter of Mergellina and
                    Piedigrotta at the foot of the hill of Posillipo. In front lie the Villa
                    Nazionale (Reale) public gardens, the chief promenade of the city, which were
                    first laid out in 1780, and have been successively extended in 1807, in 1834,
                    and under the new régime; and the whole edge of the bay from the Castel dell’
                    Ονο to Posillipo is lined by a massive embankment and carriage-way, the Via
                    Caracciolo, constructed in 1875—81. The eastern crescent includes by far the
                    largest as well as the oldest portion of Naples—the ports, the arsenal, the
                    principal churches, &lt;tc. The main thoroughfare is the Toledo (as it is still
                    popularly called, though the official name is Via di Roma), which runs almost
                    due north from the Piazza (Largo) del Plebiscito in front of the Palazzo Reale,
                    till, as Strada Nuova di Capodimonte, <pb break="no"

                    Murat across the valley between Santa Teresa and Capodimonte), it reaches the
                    gates of the Capodimonte palace. A new drive, Corso Vittorio Emmanuele, winds
                    along the slopes behind the city from the Str. di Piedi (at the west end of the
                    Riv. di Chiaja) towards the continuation of the Toledo. The character of the
                    shore of the eastern crescent is being rapidly altered by the new harbour works:
                    about the middle of the curve lies the new Villa del Popolo, or People’s Park,
                    constructed on land reclaimed from the bay.</p>
                <p>The streets of Naples are generally well-paved with lava or volcanic basalt,
                    which, however, renders them both noisy and slippery for horses. Side-pavements,
                    where they exist, are usually narrow. In the older districts there is a
                    countless variety of narrow gloomy streets, many of them steep. The houses
                    throughout the city are more remarkable for their size and the solidity of their
                    construction than for taste and elegance. They are mostly five or six stories
                    high, are covered with stucco made of a kind of pozzuolana which hardens by
                    exposure, and have large balconies and flat roofs frequently ornamented with
                    flowers, shrubs, and small trees planted in boxes filled with earth. The castle
                    of St Elmo (St Ermo, St Erasmus), which dominates the whole city, had its origin
                    in a fort (Belforte) erected by King Robert the Wise in 1343. The present
                    building, with its rock-hewn fosses and massive ramparts, was constructed by Don
                    Pedro de Toledo at the command of Charles V. in 1535, and was long considered
                    practically impregnable. Damaged by lightning in 1857, it was afterwards
                    restored, but it is no longer used for defensive purposes. On a small island (I.
                    del Salvatore, the <hi rend="italic">Megaris</hi> of Pliny) now joined to the
                    shore at the foot of the Pizzofalcone by an arch-supported causeway 800 feet
                    long, stands the Castel dell’ Ovo (so called from its shape, though mediaeval
                    legend associates the name with the enchanted egg on which the magician Virgil
                    made the safety of the city to depend), which, dating from 1154, was for several
                    centuries a place of great strength. The walls of its chapel were frescoed by
                    Giotto; but the whole building was ruined by Ferdinand II. in 1495, and had to
                    be restored in the 16th century. Castel Nuovo, a very picturesque building
                    constructed near the harbour in 1283 by Charles I. of Anjou, contains between
                    the round towers of its façade the triumphal arch erected in 1470 to Alphonse
                    I., and numbers among its chambers the Gothic hall of Giovanni Pisano in which
                    Celestine V. abdicated the papal dignity. Castel ∣ del Carmine, founded by
                    Ferdinand I. in 1484, was occupied by the populace in Masaniello’s insurrection,
                    was used as a prison for the patriots of 1796, and became municipal property in
                    1878. The royal palace, begun in 1600 by the Count de Lemos, from designs by
                    Domenico Fontana, partly burned in 1837, and since repaired and enlarged by
                    Ferdinand II., is an enormous building with a sea frontage of 800 feet, and a
                    main façade 554 feet long and 95 feet high, exhibiting the Doric, Ionic, and
                    Composite orders in its three stories. On their visits to Naples, Kings Victor
                    Emmanuel and Humbert have usually preferred the suburban palace of Capodimonte,
                    begun by Charles III. and completed by Ferdinand II. Naples is the see of a
                    Roman Catholic archbishop, always a cardinal. The cathedral has a chapter of
                    thirty canons, and of the numerous religious houses formerly existing thirteen
                    have in whole or in part survived the suppression in 1868. The city is divided
                    into forty-seven parishes (the boundaries of which are administrative and not
                    topographical, so that different stories of the same house are sometimes in
                    different parishes), and there are 257 Roman Catholic churches and 57 chapels.
                    Most of the churches are remarkable rather for richness of internal decoration
                    than for architectural beauty. The cathedral of St Januarius, occupying the site
                    of temples of Apollo and Neptune, and still containing some of their original
                    granite columns, was designed by Nicola Pisano, and erected between 1272 and
                    1316. Owing to frequent restorations occasioned by earthquakes, it now presents
                    an incongruous mixture of different styles. The general plan is that of a
                    basilica with a nave and two (Gothic vaulted) aisles separated by pilasters.
                    Beneath the high altar is a subterranean chapel containing the tomb of St
                    Januarius (San Gennaro), the patron saint of the city; in the right aisle there
                    is a chapel (Cappella del Tesoro) built between 1608 and 1637 in popular
                    recognition of his having saved Naples in 1527 “from famine, war, plague, and
                    the fire of Vesuvius”; and in a silver tabernacle behind the high altar of this
                    chapel are preserved two phials partially filled with his blood, the periodical
                    liquefaction of which forms a prominent feature in the religious life of the
                    city (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Januarius).</hi> Accessible by a door in the left
                    aisle of the cathedral is the church of Sta Restituta, a basilica of the 7th
                    century, and the original cathedral. Santa Chiara (14th century) is interesting
                    for a fresco ascribed to Giotto (at one time there were many more), and
                    monuments to Robert the Wise, his queen Mary of Valois, and his daughter Mary,
                    empress of Constantinople. San Domenico Maggiore, founded by Charles II. in
                    1285, but completely restored after 1445, has an effective interior particularly
                    rich in Renaissance sculpture. In the neighbouring monastery is shown the cell
                    of Thomas Aquinas. San Filippo Neri or dei Gerolomini, erected in the close of
                    the 16th century, has a white marble façade and two campaniles, and contains the
                    tombstone of Giambattista Vico. Sta Maria del Parto, in the Chiaja, occupies the
                    site of the house of Sannazaro, and is named after his poem <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Partu</hi><hi rend="italic">Virginis.</hi> San
                    Francesco di Paola, opposite the royal palace, is an imitation of the Pantheon
                    at Rome by Pietro Bianchi di Lugano (1815-37), and its dome is one of the
                    boldest in Europe. The church of the Certosa (Carthusian monastery) of San
                    Martino, on the hill below St Elmo’s castle, has now become in name, as so many
                    of the churches are in reality, a museum. Dating from the 14th century, and
                    restored by Fonsega in the 17th, it is a building of extraordinary richness of
                    decoration, with paintings and sculpture by Guido Reni, Lanfranco, Caravaggio,
                    D’Arpino, Solimene, Luca Giordano, and notably a Descent from the Cross by
                    Ribera. One of the cloisters by Fonsega is particularly fine. A more ancient
                    Christian monument than any of the convents or churches is the catacombs, which
                    extend a great distance underground. The entrance is at the Ospizio dei Poveri
                    di San Gennaro (see Schulze’s monograph, Jena, 1877).</p>
                <p>Of all the secular institutions in Naples none is more remarkable than the
                    national museum, better known <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> as the Museo
                    Borbonico. The building, begun in 1586 for cavalry barracks, and remodelled in
                    1615 for the university, received its present destination in 1790. Enriched by
                    the Farnese collection, by all that was most valuable in Naples, and by
                    everything that would bear removal from Herculaneum, Pompeii, Stabiae, Puteoli,
                    Paestum, &amp;c., the museum is unique as a treasure-house of Roman and early
                    Italian antiquities. The collection of Etruscan and Jtalo-Greek vases is
                    unsurpassed. Nor is the variety of objects greater than the artistic value of
                    some of the items—such as the Farnese Hercules, the Farnese Bull (Amphion and
                    Zethus binding Dirce to its horns), the Dancing Faun (bronze), the statues of
                    the Balbi (marble). For the rich libraries of Naples see vol. xiv. pp. 530, 548.
                    The Club Alpino has a unique collection (25,000 volumes) of Vesuvian and
                    seismographical literature.</p>
                <p>The university of Naples is one of the oldest in Italy, having been founded by
                    Frederick II. in the first half of the 13th century. It had fallen to
                    insignificance under the Bourbons, but since 1860 it has rapidly recovered. It
                    comprises five faculties (literature and philosophy, jurisprudence, mathematics,
                    natural science, and medicine), and is well equipped with zoological,
                    mineralogical, and geological museums, a physiological institute, a cabinet of
                    anthropology, botanical gardens, and an observatory on Mount Vesuvius.</p>

                <p>The students in 1882-3 numbered 3421. Originally erected in 1557 for the use of
                    the Jesuits, the university buildings are regarded as the best work of Marco di
                    Pino; the quadrangle, surrounded by a simple but effective peristyle, contains
                    statues of Pietro della Vigna (Frederick’s chancellor), Thomas Aquinas, Vico,
                    and Giordano Bruno. The famous zoological station at Naples, whose aquarium is
                    the principal building in the Villa Nazionale, is not connected with the
                    university; it was founded in 1872 by Dr Dohrn, and has become one of the
                    greatest centres of biological research in Europe. Its <hi rend="italic"

                    and flora of the Gulf of Naples is in progress. The Royal Society of Naples,
                    dating originally from 1756, was reconstituted in 1861, and now comprises three
                    “academies” or departments, dealing respectively with the physical and
                    mathematical sciences, the moral and political sciences, and literature,
                    archaeology, and the fine arts. The famous Accademia Pontaniana, founded in 1471
                    by Ant Panormita and J. J. Pontanus, was restored in 1809, and still exists. The
                    royal school of Oriental languages (35 pupils in 1880) owes its existence to
                    Matteo Ripa, who in 1732 established a college for Chinese missionaries with
                    money which he had collected by visiting various European courts in company with
                    ten or twelve young Chinamen. Since 1857 Ludovico da Casoria, relying on public
                    subscriptions, has carried on a special college for the education of Africans
                    (Coll, dei Mori a Capodimonte). The royal college of music, practically founded
                    by Charles III. in 1760, and thus one of the oldest as it is one of the most
                    celebrated institutions of its class, was re-established in 1879. It has a
                    teaching staff of nearly forty persons, takes in boarders (50 Italians
                    gratuitously), and carries on a free day school for males and females. A large
                    and beautiful building in Strada Fuori Porta Medina, erected in a Pompeian style
                    by Francesco del Giudice, accommodates the royal institute for the encouragement
                    of the natural and economical sciences, the royal technical institute (535
                    pupils), and the nautical institute (46 pupils); and in Str. del Salvatore there
                    is a royal school of engineering with 250 pupils. Four technical schools are
                    maintained by the municipality. The primary education of the people was so much
                    neglected under the Bourbons that after twenty years of a better régime there
                    were still 294,384 persons in Naples who could neither read nor write. That some
                    progress had been made was shown in 1881 by the fact that the number of persons
                    under thirty years of age who could both read and write had increased from
                    79,224 in 1871 to 101,277. In 1872 there were 14,461 children attending school;
                    in 1879 there were 75,311. The educational expenditure of the commune was
                    £64.972 in 1882 for the education of 30,000 children. About one-fourth of the
                    children attending the infant schools are gratuitously supplied with soup at
                    midday, and the children of the working classes are taught free of charge. Among
                    the various private educational enterprises Mrs Salis Schwabe’s Froebel
                    Institute, founded in 1873, the Italian Protestant schools, and the institution
                    established by the Marquis Casanova in 1869 to take charge of boys leaving
                    school and bring them up to some special trade, deserve special mention. There
                    are three schools for the blind—notably Lady Strachan’s (1865) and the “Prince
                    of Naples,” founded by Martuscelli (1873) —and as many for the deaf and
                    dumb.</p>
                <p>Charitable institutions are unusually numerous in Naples. The oldest civil
                    hospitalis S. Eligio, dating from 1270; but the largest is the Casa Santa degli
                    Incurabili, founded in 1521 by Francesca Maria Longo. It is open to patients of
                    both sexes and any rank, contains upwards of 1000 beds, and has an annual income
                    of about £32,000. In 1877 an international hospital was established by the
                    foreign residents. The Albergo dei Poveri (poorhouse) occupies a magnificent
                    range of buildings, commenced in 1761 by Charles III. at the suggestion of Padre
                    Rocco. Starting with an income of about £3000, it now disposes yearly of
                    £48,000; and it has successively absorbed various minor institutions such as the
                    Conservatorio of St Francis of Sales (1816) and the deaf-mute school (1818). The
                    great almshouse of St Januarius for old men (Ospiz. di S. Gennaro dei Poveri)
                    dates from 1666. Besides the great provincial lunatic asylum (340 patients), now
                    transferred to the convent of St Francis of Sales, there are three smaller
                    asylums in the suburbs. Nothing perhaps is more characteristic of Naples than
                    its so-called <hi rend="italic">Arci-con-</hi><hi rend="italic">frcdernità,</hi>
                    associations similar to our friendly and burial societies, but entering more
                    into the life of all classes of society. There are about one hundred and thirty
                    of them. The oldest which has kept the date of its origin is that of the Bianchi
                    della Carità, founded in 1382; seven belong to the 15th century and twenty-seven
                    to the 16th. Mutual benefit societies are also numerous.</p>
                <p>There are about a score of theatres in Naples. The San Carlo opera-house, with
                    its area of 5157 square yards, and its pit capable of containing one thousand
                    spectators, is one of the largest in Europe. It was originally erected in 1737
                    under Charles III. after the designs of Giovanni Medrano, but had to be almost
                    completely rebuilt after the fire of 1816. Though closely associated with the
                    names of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Mercadante, &amp;c., San Carlo has always
                    had to be subsidized—first by the Bourbon princes, and since 1860 by the
                    municipality, which also helps to support the Mercadante theatre. It is enough
                    to mention the Teatro Nuovo, the Sannazaro, the Dei Fiorentini (devoted to the
                    Italian drama), and the Bellini (dating from 1876, and second to none in the
                    matter of decoration). The San Carlino, though mean and incommodious, is largely
                    frequented by all classes from royalty downwards, its Pulcinella farces, always
                    in the Neapolitan dialect, being a purely local institution, connected it may be
                    with the Atellan plays.</p>
                <p>At a very early date the original harbour at Naples, now known in its greatly
                    reduced state as Porto Piccolo, and fit only for boats and lighters, became too
                    small. In 1302 Charles II. of Anjou began the construction of the Porto Grande
                    by forming the Molo Grande or San Gennaro, which stretched eastward into the
                    bay, and was terminated by a lighthouse in the 15th century. By the addition of
                    a new pieι ’ running north-east from the lighthouse, and protected by a heavily
                    armed battery, Charles III. in 1740 added greatly to the safety of the harbour.
                    In 1826 the open area to the south of the Porto Grande was formed into the Porto
                    Militare by the construction of the Molo San Vincenzo, 1200 feet long. Shortly
                    after the formation of the new kingdom of Italy attention was called to the
                    insufficiency of the harbour for modern wants; and new works were commenced in
                    1862. Besides the lengthening of the Molo San Vincenzo to a total of more than
                    5000 feet, the scheme as authorized in 1879 includes the formation of a new
                    pier, which is to extend from the Castel del Carmine a distance of about 2460
                    feet, the construction of quays along the shore between the fort and the Porto
                    Grande, the deepening of the enclosed area to about 25 feet, and the
                    establishment of new bonded warehouses and a floating dock on the
                    Clark-Stanfield system. The contract provides for the completion of the works in
                    1885. The entrance to the harbour will then measure more than 2000 feet.</p>
                <p>The port of Naples is second in the kingdom. Tire total tonnage of foreign and
                    coasting trade (entrance and clearance) had increased from 1,812,138 register
                    tons in 1863 to 4,128,057 in 1882. In the foreign trade the first place belongs
                    to French shipping, 956,171 tons; the second to British, 374,608; and the third
                    to Italian, 93,424. Cotton, cereals, sugar, coffee, tobacco, wool, &amp;c., are
                    the chief imports; pastes, coral(to the value of £1,500,000), and jewellers’
                    work, dried fruit, hats, tartar and wine lees, wine, and olive oil are the chief
                    exports. The total value of imports and exports was £9,374,940 in 1881 and
                    £8,055,798 in 1882. Coral, kid gloves, and macaroni are manufactured in the city
                    on an extensive scale.</p>
                <p>Naples has several good local springs (notably the Acqua del Leone at
                    Mergellina); a covered channel brings the waters of Monte Somma (Vesuvius) to
                    the lower parts of the town; an aqueduct, constructed in the 17th century at the
                    cost of Criminelle and Carmignano, taps the Isclero at Sant' Agata dei Goti, 30
                    miles distant; and a number of artesian wells have proved successful as far as
                    quantity is concerned. But in spite of all these resources the water supply has
                    long been far below the demand; and a city which from its position might be one
                    of the best-drained, cleanest, and healthiest in the world has had an unenviable
                    reputation for dirtiness and unwholesomeness. At present extensive works are in
                    progress by which good drinking water is to be brought from Serino (nearly 50
                    miles distant) and laid on at three different high levels at the rate of
                    22,000,000 gallons daily for the use of tlιe inhabitants and 1,000,000 for
                    public purposes.</p>
                <p>Naples, the most densely peopled city in Europe, is slowly but steadily
                    increasing. The commune—which includes not only the urban districts <hi
                    rend="italic">(frazioni)</hi> of S. Ferdinand, Chiaja, S. Giuseppe, Monte
                    Calvario. Avvocata, Stella, San Carlo all’ Arena, Vicaria, S. Lorenzo, Mercato,
                    Pendino, and Porto, but also the suburban districts of Vomero, Posillipo,
                    Fuorigrotta, Miano-Mianella, and Piscinola-Marianella—has advanced from 404,000
                    inhabitants in 1788 to 493,115 in 1881, and the city proper (the first twelve
                    districts) from 326,130 in 1812 to 461,962 in 1881. In the condition of the
                    lower classes considerable improvement has been effected since 1860; the
                    lazzaroni, who bulked so largely in the experience of the tourist in the early
                    part of the century, no longer exist, their place being taken by the
                    dock-labourer, the fisherman, and the artisan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> All ancient writers agree in representing Naples
                    as a Greek settlement, though its foundation is obscurely and differently
                    narrated. It seems that the oldest city on its site was founded by a colony from
                    the neighbouring Greek town of Cumae. They are said to have given it the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Parthenope,</hi> from a legendary connection of the locality
                    with the siren Parthenope, whose tomb was still shown at the time of Strabo. A
                    number of Chalcidic and Athenian colonists are reported to have afterwards
                    joined the original settlers, and to have built for themselves separate
                    dwellings, which they called <hi rend="italic">Neapolis,</hi> or the new city,
                    in contradistinction to the old settlement, which in consequence was styled <hi
                    rend="italic">Palaepolis,</hi> or the old city. All modern attempts to define
                    the respective extent and situation of Palaepolis and Neapolis have failed; but
                    Livy’s testimony leaves no doubt that they were close to each other, and
                    identical in language and government.</p>
                <p>In the year 328 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the Palaepolitans having provoked
                    the hostility of Rome by their incursions upon her Campanian allies, <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0202-0191"/> the consul Publilius Philo marched against them,
                    and, having taken his position between the old and the new city, laid regular
                    siege to Palaepolis. By the aid of a strong Samnite garrison λvhich they
                    received, the Palaepolitans were long able to withstand the attacks of the
                    consul; but at length the city was betrayed into the hands of the Romans by two
                    of her citizens. Neapolis possibly surrendered to the consul without any
                    resistance, as it was received on favourable terms, had its liberties secured by
                    a treaty, and obtained the chief authority, which previously seems to have been
                    enjoyed by the older city. From that time Palaepolis totally disappeared from
                    history, and Neapolis became as an allied city— <hi rend="italic">foederata
                    civitas</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a dependency of Rome, to whose alliance it
                    remained constantly faithful, even under most trying circumstances. In 280 B.c.
                    Pyrrhus unsuccessfully attacked its walls; and in the Second Punic War Hannibal
                    was by their strength deterred from attempting to make himself master of the
                    town. During the civil wars of Marius and Sulla, a body of partisans of the
                    latter having entered it by treachery, 82 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> made a
                    general massacre of the inhabitants; but Neapolis soon recovered the blow, as it
                    was again a flourishing city in the time of Cicero. It became a <hi
                    rend="italic">municipium</hi> after the passing of the <hi rend="italic">lex
                    Julia</hi>; under the empire it is noticed as a <hi rend="italic">colonia,</hi>
                    but the time when it first obtained that rank is uncertain—possibly under
                    Claudius.</p>
                <p>Though a municipal town, Neapolis long retained its Greek culture and
                    institutions; and even at the time of Strabo had gymnasia and quinquennial
                    games, and was divided into <hi rend="italic">phratriae,</hi> after the Greek
                    fashion. When the Romans became masters of the world, many of their upper
                    classes, both before the close of the republic and under the empire, from a love
                    of Greek manners and literature or from indolent and effeminate habits, resorted
                    to Neapolis, either for education and the cultivation of gymnastic exercises or
                    for the enjoyment of music and of a soft and luxurious climate. Hence we find
                    Neapolis variously styled—by Horace as “otiosa Neapolis,” by Martial as “docta
                    Parthenope,” by Ovid as “inotia natam Parthenopen.” It was the favourite
                    residence of many of the emperors: Nero made his first appearance on the stage
                    in one of its theatres; Titus assumed the office of its archon; and Hadrian
                    became its demarch. It was chiefly at Neapolis that Virgil composed his <hi
                    rend="italic">Georgies</hi>; and he was buried on the hill of Pausilypus, the
                    modern Posillipo, in its neighbourhood. It was also the favourite residence of
                    the poets Statius and Silius Italicus, the former of whom was a Neapolitan by
                    birth.</p>
                <p>After the fall of the Roman empire, Neapolis suffered severely during the Gothic
                    wars. Having espoused the Gothic cause in the year 536, it was taken, after a
                    protracted siege, by Belisarius, who turned aside an aqueduct, marched by
                    surprise into the city through its channel, and put many of the inhabitants to
                    the sword. In 542 Totila besieged it and compelled it to surrender; but, being
                    soon after recovered by Narses, it remained long a dependency of the exarchate
                    of Ravenna, under the immediate government of a duke, appointed by the Byzantine
                    emperors. When the Lombards invaded Italy, and pushed their conquests in the
                    southern provinces, the limits of the Neapolitan duchy were considerably
                    narrowed. In the beginning of the 8th century, at the time of the Iconoclastic
                    controversy, the emperor Leo the Isaurian having forced compliance to his edict
                    against the worshipping of images, the Neapolitans, encouraged by Pope Gregory
                    III., threw off their allegiance to the Eastern emperors, and established a
                    republican form of government under a duke of their own appointment. Under this
                    régime Neapolis retained her independence for nearly four hundred years, though
                    constantly struggling against the powerful Lombard dukes of Benevento, who twice
                    unsuccessfully besieged it. In 1027, however, Pandulf IV., a Lombard prince of
                    Capua, succeeded in making himself master of it; but he was expelled in 1030 by
                    Duke Sergius, chiefly through the aid of a few Norman adventurers. The Normans,
                    in their turn, gradually superseded all powers, whether Greek, Lombard, or
                    republican, which had previously divided the south of Italy, and furthermore
                    checked the Saracens in the advances they were making through Apulia.</p>

                    here to state that the leaders of the house of Hauteville in 1053 did homage to
                    the pope for all conquests they had made or might make both in the island and
                    upon the mainland, and that in 1130 Count Roger of that family assumed the style
                    of king. In this way the south of Italy, together with the adjacent island of
                    Sicily, was converted into one political body, which, owing to the peculiar
                    temper of its Norman rulers and their powerful organization, assumed a more
                    feudal character than any other part of the peninsula. The “regno,” as it was
                    called by the Italians, constituted a state apart, differing in social
                    institutions, foreign relations, and type of home government from the
                    commonwealths and tyrannies of upper· Italy. It should furthermore be noticed
                    that the indirect right acquired by the popes as lords paramount over this vast
                    section of Italian territory gave occasion to all the most serious disturbances
                    of Italy between the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 16th centuries, by
                    the introduction of the house of Anjou into Naples and the disputed succession
                    of Angevine and Aragonese princes. From the date at which the south of Italy and
                    Sicily were subjugated by the Normans, the history of Naples ceases to be the
                    history of a republic or a city, and merges itself, as the history of a kingdom,
                    in that of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Naples henceforth formed the
                    metropolis of the Italian portion of that kingdom, owing this pre-eminence to
                    its advantageous position on the side of Italy towards Sicily, and to the favour
                    of successive princes. Separated from Sicily between the years 1282 and 1442,
                    reunited to Sicily between 1442 and 1458, again separated between 1458 and 1504,
                    and finally reunited in the year 1504, the kingdom of Naples remained from that
                    date forward, with short interruptions, under one crown, together with Sicily,
                    until 1861. Then both Sicily and Naples were absorbed in the Italian kingdom
                    through the cession by Garibaldi of his conquest to the popularly sanctioned
                    sceptre of the house of Savoy.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to write the history of Naples in modern times apart from that
                    of Sicily, or to separate it from that of the several dynasties which have held
                    royal or vice-royal state in Naples as their capital. But an epitome of the main
                    vicissitudes which it has undergone during the last seven centuries and a half
                    may be supplied. The Norman dynasty controlled both Sicily and Naples until the
                    year 1194, when theiι ’ rights were transmitted, by failure of legitimate male
                    issue, to Henry VI., emperor, and husband of Constance de Hauteville. The popes,
                    in pursuance of their Guelf policy, persecuted the great imperial house of
                    Hohenstaufen to extinction, subdued the Ghibelline party in southern Italy, and
                    conferred the kingdom of the Two Sicilies upon Charles of Anjou after his
                    victory at Grandella, in the year 1265. As a consequence of the Sicilian
                    Vespers, Charles had to relinquish Sicily in 1282; but he continued to be king
                    of Naples. It was then shown that, though the Normans had welded Sicily and the
                    southern provinces of Italy into one substantial political whole, the island and
                    the mainland had no strong bond of national cohesion. The subsequent history of
                    the sister kingdoms makes this even more apparent. Seven princes of the house of
                    Anjou ruled Naples after the death of Charles until the year 1442. Meanwhile
                    Sicily obeyed the house of Aragon, whose rights were derived from Constance, the
                    daughter of Manfred, a bastard son of the emperor Frederick II. In 1442 Alphonso
                    V. of Aragon and Sicily, surnamed the Magnanimous, expelled René of Anjou from
                    the kingdom of Naples, and reunited the Two Sicilies under his own rule. Upon
                    his death in 1458, his brother John became king of Aragon and Sicily; while his
                    natural son Ferdinand assumed the crown of Naples, which was bequeathed to him
                    by Alphonso as being his own property by right of conquest. The bastard
                    Aragonese dynasty thus founded continued to hold sway in Naples, separate from
                    Sicily, through four successive princes, until their line ended by the expulsion
                    of Frederick, Alphonso’s grandson, in 1501. Betrayed by his cousin Ferdinand of
                    Spain, this prince surrendered to a French army and died in captivity in France
                    three years later. The French and Spaniards were at this epoch disputing the
                    possession of Italy. Charles VIII. of France had already, in 1494, reasserted
                    the claims of the Angevine line, and had conquered the kingdom of Naples; but he
                    proved unable or unwilling to maintain his conquest more than a few months. His
                    successor Louis XII. covenanted in 1500 to partition Naples with Ferdinand the
                    Catholic of Spain, who was already king of Sicily. Ferdinand, however, having no
                    intention of fulfilling his engagements with his French ally, succeeded in
                    possessing himself of the whole kingdom of Naples, which he now reunited to that
                    of Sicily, and governed together with Castile and Aragon. From 1504 until 1707
                    Naples and Sicily owed immediate obedience to viceroys of the kings of
                    Spain,—the only important episode in the history of the city throughout this
                    period being the revolt of <hi rend="smallcaps">Masaniello</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{q.υ.}</hi> in 1647. After 1707, during the wars of the Spanish succession, the
                    Austrians made themselves masters of both Sicily and Naples; and, though Sicily
                    was ceded by them in 1713 to the house of Savoy, and in 1718 conquered by Spain,
                    they became again in 1720 possessors of both kingdoms. Naples was at this time
                    of her history administered by Austrian, as previously by Spanish, viceroys. The
                    war of the Polish succession gave monarchial independence once more to the Two
                    Sicilies; for in 1735 Don Carlos, a younger son of Philip V., of the Bourbon
                    dynasty in Spain, after a successful campaign against the Austrians, was crowned
                    sovereign of both kingdoms at Palermo. He founded the Bourbon line, which
                    reigned in Sicily and Naples until the year 1861, interrupted only by the
                    disturbances of the French Revolution and by a brief French occupation
                    (1806-15), during which Joseph Bonaparte bore the title of king of Naples for
                    two years and Joachim Murat for seven years. Sicily throughout this period of
                    French influence remained beneath the sway of her Bourbon princes. For the
                    events which led to the expulsion of the Bourbons and the annexation of both
                    Sicily and Naples to the crown of Italy, the reader is referred to the article
