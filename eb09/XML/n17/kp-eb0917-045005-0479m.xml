                <p>I. New York State.</p>
                <p>NEW YORK, one of the original thirteen United States of America, is situated
                    between 40° 29' 40'' and 45° 0' 2" N. lat. and between 71° 51' and 79° 45' 54"∙4
                    W. long. It is bounded N. by Lake Ontario and the St Lawrence river, which
                    separate it from the province of Ontario j. E. by Vermont, Massachusetts, and
                    Connecticut; S. by the Atlantic Ocean, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; and W. by
                    Pennsylvania, Lake Erie, and the Niagara river.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Topography.—</hi> The State of New York has a triangular
                    outline, with a breadth from east to west of 326'46 miles, and from north to
                    south, on the line of the Hudson, of 300 miles. In addition it includes Long
                    Island and Staten Island on the Atlantic coast. Its area is 49,170 square
                    miles,—47,620 square miles, or 30,476,800 acres, being land, and the remainder
                    portions of the great lakes that border it. The surface is more diversified than
                    that of any other State in the Union. The eastern and southern portions are
                    high, and from these the land slopes gently north and west to Lake Ontario. The
                    mountainous belt of the eastern part is cut through by the great water-gap of
                    the Mohawk valley, which once connected the Ontario basin with the trough of the
                    Hudson below the present ocean-level, and is the most interesting and important
                    feature in the topography of the State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—</hi> The mountains of New York form three distinct
                    groups. (1) The Adirondacks, a series of short ranges having a north-north-east
                    and south-south-west direction, form the centre of the elevated region of the
                    north-east section of the State. The highest of these is Mount Marcy, 5344 feet,
                    with several associated summits which reach the altitude of 5000 feet. (2) The
                    Catskill Mountains, with their foothills, occupy about 500 square miles south of
                    the Mohawk valley and west of the Hudson; the highest peaks reach an altitude of
                    4000 feet. The Helderberg and Shawangunk Mountains are topographically a portion
                    of the Catskills, the first on the north, the second on the south. These all
                    belong to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n484/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0484-0451"/> Alleghany system, and are connected with the
                    mountains of Pennsylvania by the Delaware Mountains, which have an altitude of
                    from 1600 to 2800 feet. (3) The Highlands of the Hudson, through which the river
                    passes at West Point, are the northern continuation of the Blue Ridge of
                    Pennsylvania, having an altitude of from 1200 to 1800 feet. The so-called
                    mountains of the central and southern counties are portions of a high plateau
                    which connects with the Helderberg and Catskill Mountains on the east. This is
                    cut by eroded valleys in such a way as to leave many elevated points, of which
                    the highest is East Hill in Otsego county, 2300 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>One of the most peculiar and impressive topographical features is formed by the
                    cliffs of the Palisades, which border the Hudson in Rockland county, and are
                    continuous with those of New Jersey.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lakes and Rivers.—</hi> Two of the chain of great lakes border
                    the State, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, connected by the Niagara river, on which
                    is the most celebrated cataract in the world. Lake Erie gives about 75 miles of
                    coast-line to New York, Lake Ontario over 200. The surface level of the former
                    is 573 feet above the sea, of the latter 245 feet; and this is 606 feet deep. A
                    portion of the eastern border of New York is formed by Lake Champlain, which
                    lies in the trough between the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains. Within the
                    State the number of lakes is very great. The largest is Lake George, famous for
                    its beautiful scenery. Through the central portion a series of peculiar
                    elongated lakes are found which lie with a nearly north-and-south bearing on the
                    slope from the southern highlands to the Ontario basin, or the Mohawk valley.
                    The largest of these are Cayuga, Seneca, Oneida, Crooked, Canandaigua, Owasco,
                    and Otsego. These are river valleys once occupied and modified by glaciers and
                    dammed up by moraines. The Adirondack region is famous for its system of lakes,
                    which are favourite places of resort for tourists. Among the rivers of New York
                    the Hudson is the largest and most beautiful. Formerly it ran several hundred
                    feet below its present level, and was the great channel of drainage which led
                    through the Mohawk valley from the interior. Now, by a subsidence of the
                    continent, it is an arm of the sea, and navigable to Troy, 151 miles from its
                    mouth. The Black River, the Mohawk, and the Genesee are all large streams which
                    lie entirely within the State, while the Alleghany, the Susquehanna, and the
                    Delaware rise there, but soon leave it to become the great rivers of
                    Pennsylvania. From the varied topography and the abundant rainfall the number of
                    streams is large, and many of them are marked by picturesque falls. Besides the
                    great cataract of Niagara, a mile wide and 164 feet high, which New York shares
                    with Canada, there are many other falls worthy of mention, as those of the
                    Genesee at Rochester and Portage, Trenton Falls, the Falls of Ticonderoga,
                    &amp;c. Among the natural features which distinguish the State its mineral
                    springs deserve special mention. Those of Saratoga, Balston, Sharon, Avon, and
                    Richfield are famous throughout the Union. They differ much in chemical
                    composition and medicinal virtues, but all are popular places of resort, and
                    some have gathered round them towns of considerable size.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> In a general way it may be said that the climate
                    of New York is typical of that of the northern United States, a climate of
                    extremes, hot in summer and cold in winter, and yet healthful, stimulating, and
                    on the whole not disagreeable. The average annual temperature is about 47°
                    Fahr., the average maximum of summer heat 93°, the temperature of 100° being
                    rarely reached, and 102° the highest maximum record. The minimum temperature is
                    about - 20° Fahr., never attained in the southern portion, seldom in the
                    central, but often passed by four or five degrees in the most northern counties.
                    The average rainfall is about 40 inches. Frosts begin from September 1st to
                    October 1st, and end from April 1st to May 1st, according to the locality and
                    year. In the Adirondack region the snowfall is heavy, the winter long and
                    severe. In central New York it is not uncommon for snow to accumulate to the
                    depth of 3 or 4 feet, and yet this is not persistent. About New York city and on
                    Long Island the snow rarely exceeds a foot in depth, sleighing is always
                    uncertain, and sometimes the ground will be bare for weeks together. Thus it
                    will be seen that the climate of New York is intermediate in character between
                    that of New England and the Mississippi valley States,—a little milder than the
                    first, severer than the last. The great lakes which border it are never frozen
                    to their centres, and exert an equalizing influence upon the climate of their
                    shores.</p>
                <p>In the absence of extensive alluvial plains and marshes, there is little malaria,
                    and the climate is salubrious. About New York city and on Long Island the ocean
                    softens the rigours of winter, and through the influence of the Arctic current,
                    which bathes the coast as far south as Cape Hatteras, renders the summer
                    perceptibly cooler.</p>
                <p>The local variation of climate within the limits of the State will be best seen
                    by the following table :—</p>

                    forests, and the occupation of the surface by farms, the range of the native
                    animals has been greatly reduced, and they have been unceasingly destroyed by
                    man. Formerly the elk, the moose, and the caribou were abundant in the northern
                    part of the State, but are now all exterminated, while the Virginia deer in many
                    localities is still quite plentiful. Of the carnivorous animals, the couguar,
                    the black bear, two species of lynx, the red and grey foxes, the wolf, otter,
                    fisher, pine marten, mink, and skunk still remain, but the wolf is on the eve of
                    extermination, and the wolverine, never abundant, has perhaps migrated
                    northward. Among the rodents the beaver and. variable hare are found, but in
                    small numbers, while rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, fieldmice, &lt;fcc., are
                    still unpleasantly numerous.</p>
                <p>Civilization has made but little difference with the reptiles, birds, and fishes.
                    All the birds indigenous to the eastern portion of the continent may probably at
                    times be found within the State, though their relative numbers are affected by
                    the removal of the forests. Among the reptiles are seventeen species of snakes,
                    three of which, two rattlesnakes and the copperhead, are venomous. The fishes
                    include all the species found in the lower lakes, in the rivers of the temperate
                    portions of the continent, and on the Atlantic coast; and the fisheries
                    constitute an important element in the revenues and subsistence of the people.
                    The streams and lakes of the more elevated portions contain brook trout in
                    abundance; those of the lower levels are well stocked with bass, pickerel,
                    perch, and other game fish. The salmon, which formerly inhabited the Hudson and
                    its tributaries, was long since exterminated; but an effort has been made to
                    restock some of the streams, and, like the German carp recently introduced, it
                    may now be reckoned as an inhabitant of the waters of New York. Some of the
                    interior lakes are stocked with a land-locked salmon, or lake trout, a valuable
                    and interesting fish. The oyster industry of the coast has its chief commercial
                    centre in New York city, and an important fraction of the supply of clams,
                    oysters, lobsters, and sea fish is obtained from the New York coast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora.—</hi> Originally the surface of New York was occupied by
                    an almost unbroken forest, and, as a consequence of the general fertility of the
                    soil, its topographical diversity, and the range of latitude and longitude, the
                    flora is rich and varied. About seventy species of trees are known to inhabit
                    the State, and these include all found in the adjacent portions of the Union and
                    Canada. The most abundant are oaks, of which there are fifteen species, but with
                    these mingle five species each of maple, pine, and poplar, four species of
                    hickory, three each of elm, spruce, and ash, two of willow, cherry, magnolia,
                    and pepperidge, and one each of larch, liriodendron, dogwood, arbor vitae,
                    balsam, yew, sycamore, honey locust, sweet gum, locust, butternut, black walnut,
                    chestnut, beech, hornbeam, basswood, sassafras, and mulberry. On the summits of
                    the Adirondacks a true alpine vegetation is found, though consisting of but a
                    small number of plants; several of these exist in no other locality in the
                    United States except the mountain summits of Vermont and New Hampshire. The
                    flowering plants and ferns of New York were studied with much care by the late
                    Dr Torrey, and his report upon them forms two of the series of twenty-three
                    quarto volumes which compose the <hi rend="italic">Report on the Natural History
                    of New York.</hi> The flowering plants enumerated by Dr Torrey amount to 1540
                    species, to which a few additions have since been made. The ferns number
                    fifty-four species —more than are found in any other State; the lower forms of
                    plant life, .seaweeds, fungi, lichens, &amp;c., are constantly supplying new
                    material, and many years will yet be required for their complete
                    elaboration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The geological structure of New York is more
                    varied and comprehensive than that of any other State, since it includes, with
                    perhaps the exception of the Jurassic, the entire geological column from the
                    Archaean to the Tertiary. A tabular view of the relations of the rocks of New
                    York may be given as follows :—</p>

                <p>The surface exposures of these rocks can be seen at a glance by reference to the
                    accompanying outline map.</p>
                <p>The boundaries of the State enclose an area which once formed a part of the
                    eastern declivity of the Archaean continent, of which the Canadian and
                    Adirondack highlands art the most important representatives. These are composed
                    of Laurentian rocks, and are perhaps the oldest portion of the earth’s surface.
                    Upon the slope of this old continent the ocean rose and fell in the different
                    geological ages, cutting away the shore by its waves in its advance, and
                    spreading the debris in sheets of sand and gravel—old sea beaches. During
                    long-continued periods of submergence organic sediments, composed of the hard
                    parts of marine animals, accumulated over the sea bottom. In the process of
                    emergence the shallowing and retreating sea <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n486/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0486-0453"/> spread over its deep water deposits mixed
                    sediments, the finer wash of the land and organic material, carbonaceous or
                    calcareous. When indurated, these three kinds of deposits became (1) sandstones
                    or conglomerates, (2) limestones, (3) shales or earthy limestones. During the
                    intervals of emergence the surface was more or less eroded, and the elevations
                    gave obliquity to the planes of deposition, so that in each invasion of the sea
                    it deposited its round of sediments unconformably upon the older ones. The
                    repeated submergences which have here left their record did not cover the same
                    area, but overlapped in such a way that the succession of deposits is easily
                    made out,— the different groups which we call geological systems being separable
                    by unconformability along the planes of contact, by lithological characters
                    which are faithful records of conditions of deposition, and by differences
                    exhibited in their fossils, for in the long intervals which separated these
                    inundations the life of sea and land was completely and repeatedly
                    revolutionized.</p>
                <p>The processes described above went on through the Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian,
                    and Carboniferous ages, forming on the south shore of the Laurentian continent
                    the most complete and consecutive record of Palaeozoic time of which we have any
                    knowledge. Then the strata along a line passing south-westerly through eastern
                    New York were raised in a series of folds which we call the Alleghany Mountains,
                    and at this time all the interval between the Atlantic and the Mississippi was
                    elevated above the ocean. There it has since remained, the sea rising and
                    falling upon its margin, and leaving its marks, but never submerging the
                    interior. The geological record was continued by minor contributions to the land
                    along the Atlantic coast during the Triassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and
                    Quaternary ages, and by the grinding and transporting action of glaciers which
                    once covered the entire surface of the State.</p>
                <p>Previous to the elevation of the Alleghanies the sheets of Palaeozoic rocks
                    formed a littoral plain sloping gently southward from the Archaean continent.
                    But in the formation of this mountain belt the country traversed by the southern
                    line of the State was left with a surface inclination northward, and between the
                    Alleghanies and the Canadian and Adirondack highlands a broad valley was formed
                    which became the channel of drainage for a great interior area. Through this
                    valley flowed a large river which reached the sea at or near New York island.
                    From the Carboniferous age to the Ice period this was the course of the drainage
                    of the interior, and thus was formed the great water-gap between the Helder berg
                    and Adirondack Mountains, the gate of the continent, through which the tide of
                    migration has flowed from the seaboard into the Mississippi valley, and where
                    the canal and railroad lines have been constructed which are the great arteries
                    of commerce.</p>
                <p>During portions of the Tertiary age perhaps the whole, but certainly the eastern
                    margin, of the continent stood many hundred feet above its present level. The
                    drainage of the interior flowed freely and rapidly through the channel which has
                    been described, until that part of it which lies within the State was cut below
                    the present sealevel, and the great river, which as a whole has never been
                    named, but of which the Hudson, the Niagara, the Detroit, and the St Mary’s are
                    representatives, reached the ocean 80 miles south and east of New York harbour,
                    for its channel may be traced to that point on the sea bottom, and its mouth was
                    600 feet below its present one. By a subsequent depression of the land or rise
                    in the ocean-level the sea covered much of its old shore, and filled the
                    channels cut by subaerial erosion; the Hudson became an arm of the sea, and the
                    labyrinth of tideways was formed which are such a marked feature of the coast,
                    and such important auxiliaries to New York harbour. During the Ice period
                    important changes were made in the topography of the State,—by local glaciers in
                    its advent and decline, by the great ice sheet at its climax, —the first perhaps
                    increasing topographical variety, the second producing monotony by grinding down
                    and rounding over asperities, and filling depressions with the debris.</p>
                <p>The basins of the great lakes which border New York, —Ontario, Erie, and
                    Champlain,—and of the peculiar elongated lakes of the interior, are largely the
                    work of glaciers, which broadened and perhaps deepened river channels, and
                    dammed them up with moraines. When the glaciers retreated from the area of New
                    York many of the old channels of drainage were left partially or completely
                    filled, and the flow of surface water took in some cases new directions. Among
                    the obstructed channels was that of the Hudson west of Albany, filled by the
                    Ontario glacier. By this cause the great river flowing from the interior was
                    deflected from its ancient course and found a line of lowest levels leading from
                    the north-east instead of that from the south-east corner of the Ontario valley.
                    In this way the St Lawrence was made the outlet of the interior basin, and the
                    Mohawk dwindled to a local draining stream. Long Island Sound and part of Long
                    Island itself should also be classed among the products of glacial action, the
                    Sound having been scooped out by the great glacier when it left the more
                    resistant ledges of crystalline rocks which occupy south-eastern New York and
                    Connecticut, and plunged into the softer Cretaceous and Tertiary beds which
                    formed the littoral plain that bordered the continent,—the hills of the island
                    being covered, and in part composed of loose material transported by the glacier
                    and deposited along its edge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The mineral resources of New York, though less
                    varied than those of some other States, are still of great importance. The most
                    valuable of these are extensive deposits of iron ore, viz. :—(1) magnetite,
                    found in great abundance in the Adirondack region, and in Putnam, Orange, and
                    Rockland counties; (2) haematite, mined in the vicinity of Rossie (St Lawrence
                    county), Clinton (Oneida county), and elsewhere; (3) limonite, largely worked on
                    Staten Island, and at Amenia, Sharon, &amp;c., on the line of the New York and
                    Harlem Railroad; (4) siderite, mined at Hyde Park on the Hudson. The production
                    of ore from these mines in 1879 was 1,239,759 tons, valued at $3,499,132; and
                    New York is surpassed in the quantity of iron produced by Michigan and
                    Pennsylvania only.</p>
                <p>The quarries of New York are numerous, and they furnish a great variety of
                    products :—granite in the Adirondacks and along the Hudson; roofing slate in
                    Washington county; white marble in Westchester and St Lawrence counties; red
                    marble at Warwick, Orange county; black marble at Glenn’s Falls; verde antique
                    at Moriah and Thurman. Sandstone comes from Potsdam, Medina, and various other
                    localities; shell-limestone from Lockport and Hudson; excellent flagging from
                    Kingston on the Hudson; and paving stone from the trap of the Palisades. In 1880
                    the quarries of New York numbered two hundred and fifty-one, and the value of
                    their product was $1,261,495. A large amount of hydraulic cement is supplied
                    from the quarries at Rondout (Ulster county), Manlius (Onondaga county), and
                    Akron near Buffalo; also gypsum from the vicinity of Syracuse. The deposits of
                    these substances are very extensive, and their production could be increased
                    indefinitely. Another item of importance among the mineral resources of the
                    State is the salt produced from the salt-wells at Syracuse; these have been
                    worked for <pb break="no"

                    10,997,408 bushels, having a value of $1,374,666. In south-western New York gas
                    and oil springs are numerous, and at Fredonia the gas has been used in lighting
                    houses for half a century. Recent discoveries show that the petroleum fields of
                    Pennsylvania extend into New York, and it is probable that petroleum will soon
                    claim a place among the mineral products of the State.</p>
                <p>The Amboy clays of New Jersey extend across Staten and Long Islands. With further
                    investigation they may prove as valuable in the one State as in the other. <hi

                    >History.—</hi> Recent investigations have added little to the knowledge of the
                    prehistoric period of the territory known as the Middle States. The bias of
                    scientific opinion seems to be that the earthworks, palisades, and piles of
                    stone found in the region bounded by the St. Lawrence on the north and watered
                    by the Delaware, the Susquehanna, the Alleghany, and their tributaries are of an
                    origin much more recent than the mound system of the Mississippi and the Ohio,
                    and are the remains of a people intermediate between the aboriginal race and the
                    Indians found on the soil by the first European discoverers and explorers. The
                    latter found the eastern slope of the continent under the domination of the
                    Iroquois tribes. John Smith met with them on the north waters of Chesapeake Bay
                    in 1607, and Hudson found them in 1609 on the banks of the river to which he
                    gave his name. The chief seat of this powerful nation, whose sway was recognized
                    from the St Lawrence to the Tennessee and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi,
                    was in the wide and fertile region of western and northern New York. Forming
                    permanent settlements about the headwaters of the streams which gave them
                    passage to the heart of the country, they organized the political league or
                    confederacy known as the Five Nations. These were the tribes of Mohawks,
                    Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas, and Oneidas. They took the name of “Konoshioni,” or
                    People of the Long House, by which they designated the territory occupied by
                    them, extending west from the Hudson at Albany to the foot of the great lakes, a
                    distance of about 325 miles. There is a tradition in one of the tribes that the
                    confederation was formed four years before Hudson’s arrival, which would fix the
                    date at 1605. On the other hand, a missionary resident among them as early as
                    1742 was informed by a principal chief that the confederacy was established one
                    age (lifetime) before the white people came into the country, which, in view of
                    the thoroughness of their organizations at the time the whites first came into
                    immediate contact with them, seems not improbable. In 1609 Champlain, while
                    accompanying a war party of Hurons and Algonquins on an expedition against the
                    Iroquois, fell in with the enemy on the lake to which he gave his name. European
                    firearms, with which the Iroquois then made first acquaintance, turned the scale
                    of victory against them. The interference of the French aroused in the
                    formidable confederacy a spirit of enmity which, relentlessly nourished, finally
                    arrested the progress of French colonization and French power in Canada, and
                    later secured the triumph of the English arms. Pursuing his explorations,
                    Champlain in 1615 again accompanied a hostile expedition of his allies,
                    penetrated to the very seat of the Iroquois power, and besieged their fortified
                    village or castle, but was compelled to retreat after an ineffectual attempt to
                    storm or fire the stockade. Thus within a few years after Hudson’s voyage the
                    French had discovered the great lakes and explored the river which separate the
                    territories of New York from Canada. The Iroquois sought an alliance with the
                    Dutch as a counterpoise to that of their Algonquin enemies with the Çrench. A
                    formal treaty (the covenant of Corlear) made in 1617 with the Amsterdam Company
                    was faithfully observed on both sides. By the name of Corlear (a Dutchman in
                    high honour with them) the Iroquois always addressed the governors of New York
                    in their treaties. Tradition alleges that this first treaty was made at the
                    mouth of the Tawasentha, the present site of the city of Albany. In 1664 a
                    treaty made by Cartwright at Fort Orange with the Iroquois sachems secured
                    similar advantages to the English. In 1688 this friendship was confirmed at a
                    conference held at Albany between the chiefs of the Five Nations and Governor
                    Andros, and again confirmed in 1689 after the accession of King William; it
                    continued unbroken until 1775. Compelled to choose between the revolted
                    colonists and their ancient ally, the Iroquois held fast to the “covenant chain”
                    with the English crown. The confederacy was at the height of its power about the
                    year 1700. In 1715 they were joined by the Tuscaroras, driven out from North
                    Carolina, and were afterwards known as the Six Nations. Until the conquest of
                    Canada by the English in 1763 they were in constant struggle with theiι ’ French
                    neighbours. The American revolution proved fatal to them. In 1779 their towns
                    were burned, their orchards and stores of grain destroyed. At this time their
                    civilization was at its height, their houses were of frame, some of elegant
                    construction, their gardens, orchards, and farm lands extensive and abundantly
                    supplied with fruit. From this terrible calamity they never recovered. Their
                    numbers have been estimated as 25,000 in 1650, and in 1750 about half that
                    number, of whom about 2500 were fighting men. Disregarded in the treaty of 1783,
                    their political existence terminated, and their lands were ceded to the State
                    with some small reservations. The last official State census (1875) reports the
                    total number of Indians in the State at 5117, chiefly the remains of the
                    Iroquois tribes. Of these 4707 were living on reservations.</p>
                <p>At what time, and by whom, the Bay of New York was first visited by European
                    voyagers is still in doubt. Verrazano is claimed to have entered it with the
                    “Dauphine” in 1524, and Gomez to have sailed along the coast to the latitude of
                    New York in 1525. Of the voyage of Henry Hudson (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hudson)</hi> there is no doubt. Hudson’s report of the picturesque grandeur of
                    the fine harbour and river, of the fertile country on its shores, of the kindly
                    disposition of the Indians, and of the abundance of fur-bearing animals in the
                    interior caused great excitement in Holland; and the United Netherlands, whose
                    independence had been acknowledged in the spring, asserted their claim to the
                    newly discovered country. In 1610 a vessel was despatched with merchandise
                    suitable for traffic with the savages. The Europeans were well received, and the
                    voyage resulted in profit. Other private ventures followed, and a lucrative
                    trade in peltry sprung up. In 1613 a few huts were built at the southern point
                    of Manhattan Island, and in 1615 a fortified trading house, to which the name of
                    Fort Nassau was given, was constructed on Castle Island near the present site of
                    Albany, and a factor permanently established there. No effort at colonization
                    was as yet made. Encouraged by the reports of their explorers, the merchants of
                    North Holland formed themselves into a company, which on the 11th day of October
                    1614 received from the states-general a special trading licence in which the
                    name of New Netherland first appears, the association styling itself the United
                    New Netherland Company. In 1618 the fort on Castle Island was abandoned, and in
                    1622 a new post, Fort Orange (now Albany), was established on the west bank of
                    the river, at the place where, according to tradition, the first formal treaty
                    between the Dutch and the Five Nations was made. On the expiration of the
                    charter of the United Netherland Company (October 1618) a renewal was refused by
                    the states-general, but private ventures -were authorized. The exploration of
                    the coast and rivers was actively continued, but special charters to the
                    discoverers were persistently refused. On the 3d June 1621 the states-general
                    granted to the West India Company a charter with full powers over New Netherland
                    for a period of twenty-four years. The territory was formally erected into a
                    province, and the management of its affairs assigned to the chamber of
                    Amsterdam. In the year 1622 they sent out trading vessels and took formal
                    possession of the country. It was not, however, until the 21st June 1623 that
                    the company, its rules and regulations being formally approved by the
                    states-general, closed their subscription books. Agricultural colonization had
                    been already begun in the spring of the same year. The ship “New Netherland,”
                    equipped by the company with thirty families, reached Manhattan early in May;
                    with them went Cornelis Jacobsen May, the first director of New Netherland. May
                    was succeeded in 1624 by William Verhulst. In 1626 the plans for the government
                    of the province by a director and council being perfected by the Amsterdam
                    chamber, Peter Minuit was sent out as director-general. His administration was
                    vigorous and successful. Manhattan Island was purchased of the Indians for the
                    West India Company, and a fort built which was named Fort Amsterdam. The charter
                    of the company provided for a form of feudal colonization under patτoons, such
                    colonies to consist of fifty adults, and the lands occupied to run 16 miles in
                    length on the one side of a navigable river or 8 miles if on both banks, but
                    only so far into the country as the occupiers should push their settlement. The
                    limits of the colonies might be increased in proportion to the number of
                    immigrants. The patroons had special privileges of trade, and magisterial
                    powers; leet courts were held upon their manors, and later their representatives
                    sat for them in the colonial assembly. Under these favourable conditions the
                    example of Minuit was eagerly followed; large tracts of land were acquired from
                    the Indians, and settlement made by the new proprietors. The jealousy caused by
                    these purchases and privileges brought about the recall of Minuit The little
                    colony was annoyed by the encroachments of the English of the New Plymouth
                    colony, and disturbed by the hostilities between the Indian tribes in their
                    immediate neighbourhood. In 1633 Wouter van Twilier succeeded Minuit as
                    director-general, and carried out the policy of commercial monopoly of his
                    principals. The Swedes now began aggressions on the southern border of the Dutch
                    province. Irregularities in administration caused the recall of Van Twiller in
                    1637, and in 1638 he was succeeded by William Kieft. During Kieft’s
                    administration, which was arbitrary and ill-advised, the colony was still
                    further molested by its English and Swedish neighbours, while its prosperity was
                    arrested by dissensions between the company and the patroons. The fatal mistake
                    was also made of supplying the Iroquois with firearms, which completed the
                    estrangement of all the other tribes. A collision occurred, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n488/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0488-0455"/> was the beginning of a bloody war which desolated
                    New Netherland for five years. At its close scarcely one hundred men besides
                    traders could be found in Manhattan, and the river settlements were nearly
                    destroyed. This disastrous administration was closed in the summer of 1646 by
                    the appointment of Peter Stuyvesant, who landed at Manhattan in May of the
                    succeeding year. Though of a proud and overbearing temper, and by nature
                    disposed to arbitrary rule, he proved the most satisfactory of the company’s
                    administrators. He closed the Indian difficulties, conciliating the friendly and
                    utterly destroying the hostile tribes. He negotiated a settlement of the
                    boundary disputes with the New England colonies (treaty of Hartford, 1650). In
                    his relations with his own people he was less fortunate, and by his opposition
                    to their demands for a larger freedom he alienated their affections and prepared
                    them for ready submission to a more generous rule. The province was already
                    shorn of its original limits, by English aggression and Dutch submission, before
                    the consent of the director and council to a general assembly could be had.
                    This, the first popular representative body of the province, met in April
                    1&gt;'64. Before the year closed the colony fell an easy conquest to the
                    English. The population of the province was now fully 10,000, that of New
                    Amsterdam 1500 persons.</p>
                <p>The English Government was hostile to any other occupation of the New World than
                    its own. In 1621 James I. claimed sovereignty over New Netherland by right of
                    “occupancy.” In 1632 Charles I. reasserted the English title of “first
                    discovery, occupation, and possession.” In 1654 Cromwell ordered an expedition
                    for its conquest, and the New England colonies had engaged their support. The
                    treaty with Holland arrested these operations, and recognized the title of the
                    Dutch. In 1664 Charles II. resolved upon a conquest of New Netherland. The
                    immediate excuse was the loss to the revenue of the English colonies by the
                    smuggling practices of their Dutch neighbours. A patent was issued to the duke
                    of York granting to him all the lands and rivers from the west side of the
                    Connecticut river to the east side of Delaware Bay. On the 29th August an
                    English squadron under the direction of Colonel Richard Nicolls, the duke’s
                    deputy-governor, appeared off the Narrows, and on September 8 New Amsterdam,
                    defenceless against the force, was formally surrendered by Stuyvesant. The
                    duke’s authority was proclaimed, and New Netherland became New York. The name of
                    Fort Orange was changed to Fort Albany, after the second title of the duke.
                    Nicolls proved an admirable ruler, and his successor Francis Lovelace continued
                    his policy,—autocratic government, arbitrary in form but mild in practice.
                    Religious liberty was as large as in England. In 1673 (August 7), war being
                    declared between England and Holland, a Dutch squadron surprised New York,
                    captured the city, and restored the Dutch authority and the names of New
                    Netherland and New Amsterdam. But in July 1674 a treaty of peace restored New
                    York to English rule. A new patent was issued to the duke of York, and Major
                    Edmund Andros was appointed governor. He proved a firm but moderate ruler; the
                    unsustained charge of maladministration made against him had its source in
                    religious prejudice. In 1683 Thomas Dongau succeeded Andros. The province
                    flourished under his excellent administration. A general assembly, the first
                    under the English rule, met on October 1683, and adopted a charter of liberties
                    which was confirmed by the duke. In August 1684 a new covenant was made with the
                    Iroquois, who formally acknowledged the jurisdiction of Great Britain, but not
                    subjection. By the accession of the duke of York to the English throne in 1685
                    the duchy of New York became a royal province. The charters of the New England
                    colonies were revoked, and together with New York and New Jersey they were
                    consolidated into the dominion of New England. Dongan was recalled, and Sir
                    Edmund Andros, λvho suggested the policy, was commissioned governor-general. He
                    assumed his viceregal authority at New York, August 11, 1688. The English
                    Revolution of 1688 had its faint counterpart in the colonies in an insurrection
                    of the militia, headed by one Jacob Leisler, which was not terminated till the
                    arrival from England in 1691 of a new governor, Sloughter, with whose
                    administration what may be called the second period of English rule begins.</p>
                <p>The assembly which James had abolished in 1686 was reestablished, and in May
                    declared the rights and privileges of the people, reaffirming the principles of
                    the repealed charter of liberties of October 30,1683; but religious liberty λvas
                    curtailed and the Test Act put in force as to Roman Catholics. In 1697 the lords
                    of trade, in a formal report, protested against the Act declaratory of the
                    rights and privileges of the people of the province of New York; and the
                    instructions of the king to Lord Bellomont, the newly appointed governor, were
                    sharply restrictive of the rights claimed as to courts and assemblies. The
                    government was to be ruled as a province by a governor and council,—the governor
                    having power to institute courts, appoint judges, disburse the revenues, veto
                    all laws, and prorogue or dissolve the assembly at pleasure. The provincial
                    legal authorities protested at once against this excess of prerogative.
                    Thenceforth the political history of the province records one continued struggle
                    between the royal governors and the general assembly,·—the assembly withholding
                    money grants, and the governors exercising the power to dissolve it at will. The
                    chief concern of the province was the defence of the northern frontier. The
                    quartering of British troops became a source of constant irritation between the
                    people and the officers, and the need of money by the authorities caused as
                    severe a struggle between the governors and the assembly. The conquest of Canada
                    in 1763 closed the long contest in which New York troops were constantly
                    engaged. The war left a heavy burden upon Great Britain, a part of which
                    parliament attempted to shift to the shoulders of the colonies. A general
                    congress of the colonies held in New York in 1765 protested against the Stamp
                    Act and other oppressive ordinances, and they were in part repealed. But
                    parliament maintained the principle upon which the legislation was based, the
                    supremacy of parliament and its right to tax the colonies without their
                    representation or consent. In 1769 the total exports of the province amounted to
                    £246,522. During this long political agitation New York, the most English of the
                    colonies in her manners and feeling, was in close harmony with the Whig leaders
                    of England. She firmly adhered to that principle of the sovereignty of the
                    people which she had inscribed on her ancient charter of liberties. Largely
                    dependent upon commerce, she was the first to recommend a non-importation of
                    English merchandise as a measure of retaliation against Great Britain, and she
                    was first also to invite a general congress of all the colonies. On the breaking
                    out of hostilities, New York immediately joined the patriot cause; the English
                    authority was overthrown, and the government passed to a provincial congress. In
                    May 1775, Forts Ticonderoga and Crown Point, which commanded, Lakes Champlain
                    and George, and secured the northern frontier, were captured by the Americans.
                    New York city became the headquarters of the continental army under command of
                    General Washington. On July 9,1776, the provincial congress reassembled at White
                    Plains, and formally took the name of the representatives of the State of New
                    York. The same day they proclaimed their adhesion to the Declaration of
                    Independence. The defeat of the Americans on Long Island, 27th August 1776, was
                    followed by the abandonment of the city, September 15, the army of Washington
                    retiring to the high ground at the northern end of the island. Next day a
                    conflict took place between the advanced troops where Manhattanville now stands.
                    The movement of Howe to White Plains, and his subsequent successful operations,
                    compelled the withdrawal of the Americans to New Jersey. In 1777 the advance of
                    Burgoyne from Canada was checked at Saratoga and his entire army captured; a
                    diversion attempted by St Leger by way of the Mohawk was likewise unsuccessful.
                    An attempt of Clinton to aid Burgoyne, in which he captured the forts at the
                    entrance to the Hudson Highlands, failed; West Point continued to command the
                    passage of this important line of communication. On April 20, 1777, the State
                    assembly adopted the first constitution. General George Clinton was elected
                    governor, and held the office till the close of the war. In 1779 (July 16) Stony
                    Point was captured by the Americans. In 1780 the failure of Arnold’s treason put
                    an end to the schemes of the British to command the river. The only other action
                    of importance on the soil of the State was the punishment of the Indians who had
                    aided Sir John Johnson in his incursions. Sullivan with 3000 men penetrated to
                    the heart of the Seneca country and destroyed the towns. In the summer of 1781
                    Rochambeau with French troops made a junction with Washington in Westchester
                    county, and New York city was threatened by the allied forces. News of the
                    approach of the fleet of De Grasse to Chesapeake Bay caused a transfer to
                    Virginia of the military operations. On the conclusion of the war New York was
                    evacuated, November 25, 1783. Freed from armed occupation, and its seaport
                    regained, the State made rapid progress. Its natural advantages, which the war
                    disclosed, attracted settlers from other States, and the western lands were
                    quickly taken up. In 1788 (July 26) New York adopted the Federal constitution,
                    became the most important member of the national union, and received popularly
                    the name of the Empire State. The seat of government was transferred from New
                    York city to Albany in 1797. The progress of the State met with no interruption
                    until the war with Great Britain in 1812, when its northern frontier became the
                    seat of operations by land and water. The treaty of Ghent put an end. to the
                    war, and important schemes for the development of the internal navigation to
                    bring the products of the State to tidal water were rapidly consummated.
                    Steamboat navigation began on the Hudson in 1807, and the canal system was
                    perfected in 1825 in the completion of the Erie Canal, which opened the country
                    from the lakes to the sea. This important artery of commerce has been recently
                    freed from toll by popular vote. The railroad system is still more perfect:
                    great lines traverse the State from its eastern to its western extremity, and a
                    network of minor lines connects every town and village of any importance in the
                    State with the central arteries.</p>

                    the settlement of that part of New Netherland which afterwards became New York
                    was confined to Manhattan, Long, and Staten Islands, and the banks of the
                    Hudson. Westward of these there were small trading stations on the line of the
                    Mohawk and other <pb break="no"

                    admirable natural channel of communication which by the Mohawk river and Wood
                    Creek connects the Hudson with the great lakes attracted immigration. The
                    fertile valley of the Mohawk was the first occupied. A settlement was made there
                    about 1722 by a colony from the Palatinate, who constituted almost the entire
                    population until the close of the Revolution. In 1756 there’were only ten county
                    divisions in the province, of which but two were west of the Hudson. At the time
                    of the Revolution there were fourteen counties, the most westerly of which lay
                    on the sides of the Mohawk, about 40 miles from Albany. The inhabitants were at
                    this time Dutch, French, English, Scotch, and Irish. The war brought the extreme
                    richness of the western lands to the notice of the troops, and they in turn
                    informed the people. After the war settlements spread with rapidity. The State
                    of New York ceding to Massachusetts about 10,000 square miles of territory,
                    there was before 1800 a large immigration from New England, which extended
                    itself over the interior of the State to its western boundary. This was
                    essentially an agricultural population. The military lands set apart as bounties
                    during the war, to the amount of 180,000 acres, were rapidly taken up by the
                    immigrants who flowed into the western country like a torrent, opening roads and
                    founding villages and towns. Between 1784 and 1800 two cities, three large
                    villages, and numerous smaller settlements were founded, and the population of
                    the State doubled in numbers. The foreign immigration of the last forty years
                    has chiefly settled on the lines of the great railroads, which present an almost
                    unbroken chain of industrial cities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Constitution.—</hi> The fundamental constitution of the State
                    adopted in 1777 was in its main features after the English model:—a chief
                    executive and two separate legislative chambers; justice administered through
                    local county courts, a probate judiciary, a high common law tribunal called the
                    supreme court, side by side with a court of chancery; final appellate
                    jurisdiction in law and equity vested in the State senate. This first
                    constitution of the State declared the people to be the only source of political
                    power. The secret ballot insured the independence of the vote. Religious liberty
                    to all was absolutely secured. In 1821 a new convention greatly simplified the
                    machinery of administration. Under this new constitution the people took to
                    themselves a large part of the powers before delegated to the assembly. The
                    elective franchise was extended by a removal of freehold qualification. In 1846
                    a new constitution made radical changes in the framework of government. The
                    elective franchise was further extended by diminution of residence
                    qualification; elective districts were established on the basis of population,
                    and shifted with the varying censuses. The elective principle, before confined
                    to part of the executive and legislative officers, was applied also to the
                    judiciary. A court of appeals of last resort was instituted. Local tribunals
                    were invested with the powers and jurisdictions of the supreme court of common
                    law and of the court of chancery. The separation of the legal and political
                    departments of government was complete. The question was again submitted to the
                    people in 1873, and the election of the judiciary maintained by a large
                    majority. Some slight amendments have been since made. The constitution, as
                    finally matured, completely carries out the principle of a government of the
                    people by its own directly chosen agencies. Elective restrictions upon negroes
                    and mulattoes were removed by degrees. Slavery was gradually abolished under an
                    Act passed in 1799. In 1811 the only discrimination was the requirement of a
                    certificate of freedom. The constitution of 1821 imposed both a residence and a
                    freehold qualification, restrictions which remained until removed in 1870 by the
                    fifteenth amendment to the Federal constitution, when suffrage to males became
                    absolutely free in the State. The constitution of 1777 forbade Acts of Attainder
                    after the close of the war, and provided that no Act should work corruption of
                    blood. Primogeniture and entail were for ever abolished. That of 1846 did away
                    with all feudal tenures of every description. Imprisonment for debt, before
                    limited by statute so far as females were concerned to sums over $50, was
                    entirely abolished in 1831. Married women were secured in their separate rights
                    to real and personal property by statute in 1848. Imprisonment of witnesses was
                    put an end to by Act of 1882.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The grant of the West India Company (1629) to
                    the planters of NewNetherland required the establishment of a school, and in
                    1644 the burgomasters of New Amsterdam made a municipal provision for school
                    purposes in the colony; but this proved nominal, and instruction received little
                    attention until after the arrival of Stuyvesant, when an academy and classical
                    school was established (1659). At the conquest in 1664 the English found this
                    institution in high repute, and in addition three public schools and a number of
                    private Dutch schools in the city alone. The academy or Latin school was
                    continued by the English authorities for a few years, but the Dutch schools
                    received no Government contribution. In 1702 a free grammar school was
                    established by Act of Assembly. In 1710 a school was founded by Trinity church,
                    and similar provisions by other religious denominations followed. In 1754 King’s
                    College (reorganized in 1784 as Columbia) was established by charter. Here many
                    of the men who became distinguished in the annals of the State received their
                    education. Its departments, were fully organized when the Revolution put an end
                    to all instruction, and the building became a military hospital. The legislature
                    of the State in 1795 granted an appropriation of $50,000 for five years for
                    common school purposes. A general school system was organized by commissioners
                    in 1812. District libraries were instituted in 1838, and a State normal school
                    established in 1844. In 1849 a free school law was enacted, but its unequal
                    operation caused, its repeal. In 1867 a free school law was again enacted. The
                    schools of the State are noted for their efficiency. All the common schools are
                    free, and are supported by the income of a school fund and by a State, city, and
                    district tax. A superintendent of public instruction has general supervision.
                    School commissioners elected by the people have charge in each district, and
                    there are boards of education in all the cities. The expenses for the fiscal
                    year ending September 30, 1880, were $11,181,986'55. The attendance for the same
                    year in public schools was 1,041,089 scholars, in normal schools 6156, and in
                    private schools 115,646.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    inhabitants of the State who were unable to read was reported at 166,625, or 4'2
                    per cent., of those unable to write at 219,600, a percentage of 5'5.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Charities. —</hi> The public charities were by Act of 1867
                    placed under the charge of a board of State commissioners of public charities,,
                    who are paid expenses but receive no salary. The institutions wholly or chiefly
                    maintained by the State are—asylums for the insane, inebriate, deaf and dumb,
                    blind, and idiots, and establishments for reform of juvenile delinquents. In the
                    counties, cities,, and towns there are public poorhouses and asylums, besides
                    hospitals, dispensaries, and homes in great variety. The official report of
                    January 1883 states the expenditures for the fiscal year ending September 30,
                    1882, for orphan asylums and homes for the friendless, at $4,486,204'21, the
                    total number of persons supported being 46,985,—of these 24,868 remained at the
                    close of the year. The expenditure for hospitals the same yearwas $1,503,283
                    '68, the number of patients treated 27,850. During the same period the
                    dispensaries treated 276,323 persons, at an expenditure of $102,834'20. There
                    were in the several asylums and almshouses, October 1, 1882, 10,443 insane
                    persons. The number of persons supported and temporarily relieved in the county
                    poorhouses and. almshouses during the year ending November 30, 1882, was 57,895;
                    in the city almshouses 69,875; total 127,770, of whom there remained at that
                    date 16,507. The amount expended for support and relief of the poor and other
                    charities was $4,715,065'62. Comparison with previous statements shows that
                    there had been no actual increase in pauperism in the State in twelve years, and
                    a decrease in proportion to the population. A State board of commissioners of
                    emigration has until recently had charge of the immigrants landed at the port of
                    New York. The arrivals in 1882. were 476,086. The expenses of this board were
                    met by a head-money tax, but, the Act under which it was levied having been
                    declared unconstitutional, its functions have virtually ceased. A resort to the
                    old system by which shipowners were compelled to give bonds to relieve the city
                    from the care of pauper immigrants-is the only alternative for State
                    appropriation.</p>

                    number of convicts confined 30th September 1882 at 2937, the total expenses at
                    $415,662'10, and the earnings at $421,916'95, showing a surplus of $6254 '85.
                    The strong and increasing jealousy of artisans^ has led to an abandonment of
                    some of the most profitable kinds of convict labour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wealth and Taxation.—</hi> The aggregate assessed valuation of
                    the· wealth of the State was in 1882 $2,821,549,963, of which amount
                    $2,482,012,682 was real and $339,537,281 personal. The amount of taxation was
                    $47,573,820'07, of which $3,757,971'47 was State, $30,429,458'62 county,

                    temporary suspensions of specie payment which preceded the civil war and the
                    long national suspension which^ followed its outbreak greatly contributed. The
                    total funded debt oi the State, 30th September 1882, was $6,385,556'30, over 6
                    millions of which represents the canal debt. The receipts of the State treasury
                    during the fiscal year ending at same period were. $17,735,761, and the payments
                    $13,898,198 '21, leaving a balance of $3,837,563'38. The rate of taxation for
                    the year 1882 was fixed at 2'45 mills on the dollar, which is estimated to yield
                    a revenue of $6,820,022'29. The revenues of the canals for the year ending
                    September 30, 1882, were $659,970'35, and the expenditure $653,510'01. The canal

                    first financial institution incorporated in the State. Banks continued to be
                    incorporated by special Acts of the legislature until 1838, when a general
                    banking law made the business free to all under certain restrictions. In 1829 a
                    safety fund system was established to secure the circulation of the banks
                    contributing to it, and commissioners were created to apply its provisions, but
                    the unequal operation and insufficiency of the system brought about its
                    abolition in 1843, and supervision was entrusted to the comptroller of the
                    State. In 1851 a banking department was created. The Act of the United States of
                    1865, to provide a national currency, in its requirement of a deposit of United
                    States bonds to secure the circulation issued to the banks by the Government
                    made a radical change in the entire banking system. If the policy of reduction
                    of the debt of the United States be continued, some other form of security must
                    be devised to take the place of the bonds of the United States. In 1867 the
                    State passed an Act enabling national banking associations to become State
                    banking associations. The national tax of 10 per cent, being in effect
                    prohibitory on other than national bank circulation, the State banks are banks
                    of discount and deposit only. On the 16th December 1882 there were seventy-seven
                    banks in operation under this Act. Their capital was $19,455,700. The mass of
                    the banking business of the State is done by the national banks, of which there
                    were on December 30, 1882, 307, with a capital of $86,313,692. Their deposits at
                    same date were $355,673,215’80, their loans and discounts $336,269,003-87, and
                    their issues of national bank circulation amounted to $45,979,914, secured by
                    United States bonds, deposited with the comptroller of the currency at
                    Washington, to the amount of $52,217,050. They held in specie $54,186,128-94,
                    and in legal tender notes of the United States $18,192,201. The first bank for
                    savings in the State was incorporated in 1819, since which time these beneficent
                    institutions have vastly increased. On the 1st January 1883 they numbered 127,
                    holding for 1,095,971 depositors the sum of $412,147,213. They are incorporated
                    by special Acts of the legislature, and the provisions for the security of their
                    investment are very stringent. Trust companies, of which there are several, are
                    also incorporated by special Act, and the security of their depositors is
                    guaranteed by deposits of public stocks or cash with the banking department of
                    the State. On the 1st October 1882 there were fourteen corporations for the safe
                    keeping and guardianship of personal property, with a capital of $2,676,900.</p>

                    its admirable land and water communication, enjoys a large proportion of the
                    national trade. In 1882 the State had in exports and imports of merchandize,
                    including specie and bullion, the sum of $894,430,636, or 56∣ per cent, of the
                    trade of the United States. Of the imports it received and distributed
                    $499,928,774, and it exported $394,501,862. The amount of internal trade can
                    only be estimated by the value of the tonnage moved. In the year ending 30th
                    September 1882 the arrivals at tide water were 3,068,152 tons, and the internal
                    movement reached 1,361,268, the total value of the property transported being
                    $147,918,907. The freight carried on railroads amounted to 47,350,174 tons,
                    which at the same rate of valuation as that given for canal traffic, $35 per
                    ton, may be set down at $1,657,256,090, a total value transported of
                    $1,805,174,997.</p>
                <p>The value of the freight carried through the Sound, the Hudson river, and the
                    lakes maybe estimated at $250,000,000, which would give an aggregate of over
                    $2,000,000,000. Deducting from this gross amount 900 millions, the value of its
                    foreign commerce (imports and exports), the sum of 1000 millions is arrived at
                    as an approximate valuation of the interna] trade of the State.</p>

                    and population, and, next to London, the most important commercial and financial
                    centre in the world, lies mainly on Manhattan Island, which is situated at the
                    upper end of New York Bay, between the Hudson River and East River, on the west
                    and east respectively, and the Harlem River and Spuyten Duyvil Creek, small

                    Farms, and Kingsbridge, the boundary on the N. being the city of Yonkers and on

                    is reached through the upper and lower bay, together constituting a harbour of
                    the first order. The upper bay has an area of 14 square miles and the lower bay
                    of 88 square miles of safe anchorage. The ship channels have from 21 to 32 feet
                    and from 27 to 39 feet of water according to the state of the tide. The Hudson
                    and East Rivers also afford the city 13J square miles of good anchorage. The
                    tide rises and falls on the average 43 inches. Manhattan Island, as well as the
                    adjacent country to the north and east, is composed mainly of rocks, chiefly
                    gneiss and mica schist, with heavy intercalated<pb break="no"

                    thinner layers of serpentine. These rocks have been usually supposed to be Lower
                    Silurian, but Professor Newberry holds that they have so great a similarity to
                    some portions of the Laurentian range in Canada that it is difficult to resist
                    the conviction that they are of the same period. The deep troughs through which
                    the Hudson and East Rivers now find their way through New York harbour to the
                    ocean are supposed by the same geologist to have been excavated in the late
                    Tertiary period, in which Manhattan Island and the other islands in New York Bay
                    stood much higher than they do now, when Long Island did not exist, and a great
                    sandy plain extended beyond the Jersey coast some 80 miles seaward. Manhattan
                    Island, for half its length from the southern point, slopes on each side from a
                    central ridge. On the upper half of the island the ground rises precipitously
                    from the Hudson River in a narrow line of hill, which again, on the eastern
                    side, sinks rapidly into a plain bordering on the Harlem and East Rivers, and
                    known as Harlem Flats. The surface is throughout rocky, with the exception of
                    this plain, and levelling on a great scale has been necessary in laying out
                    streets. The district beyond the Harlem river, which extends as far north as the
                    city of Yonkers, is traversed by lines of rocky hill running north and south,
                    and still thickly wooded. The original settlement out of which New York has
                    grown was made on the southernmost point of the island, and it has, since the
                    beginning of the 18 th century, spread due north and from river to river.</p>
                <p>The street called Broadway runs for nearly 3 miles along the crest of the island,
                    forming for that distance the central thoroughfare from which streets spread
                    with some regularity to the water on each side. The leading thoroughfares
                    originally followed the line of the shore, along which the earliest buildings
                    were chiefly erected, the central ridge being the last to be occupied, until the
                    city reached what is now known asWall Street, the site of which was marked by a
                    rampart and stockade extending from river to river across the island.</p>
                <p>Within this space the streets were laid out either as convenience dictated or as
                    old pathways suggested, without any general design or any attention to symmetry,
                    and were named, for the most part, after prominent settlers. The first regular
                    official survey of the city, tracing the line of the streets, was made in 1656,
                    when Wall Street was its northern limit. In 1807 the present plan of the city
                    was adopted, with its broad longitudinal avenues crossed by side streets at
                    right angles, beginning at a point about two miles from the Battery and running
                    the whole length of the island. The erection of buildings along these streets
                    has led to the levelling of the region below the Central Park, but in the park
                    the varied outline which once characterized the whole island is still retained.
                    The precipitous banks of the Hudson river at the upper end have also compelled a
                    treatment in which the original configuration of the ground is pre served, and
                    the streets and roadways are adapted to it. The city in its growth northward
                    absorbed several suburban villages known as Greenwich, Harlem, Manhattanville,
                    Fort Washington, Morrisania, and Kingsbridge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Aspect.—</hi> The appearance of New York everywhere but
                    in the leading thoroughfares is usually disappointing to strangers. The pavement
                    of all the streets, except Broadway and Fifth Avenue, is bad, and the street
                    cleaning in all but the principal streets is very defective. The lower part of
                    the city, which is the centre of trade, is generally well kept, and contains a
                    large number of imposing buildings. Wall Street in particular, which is now,
                    after Lombard Street, the most important haunt of moneyed men in the world, has
                    several banks of effective architecture, together with the United States
                    customhouse; while Broad Street, which runs off from it at right angles, besides
                    having the stock exchange, is being rapidly occupied at its upper end by
                    handsome buildings of vast proportions intended for the offices of merchants and
                    bankers. After the city had spread beyond Wall Street, the well-to-do portion of
                    the population and the leading retailers seem to have clung to Broadway as the
                    great line of traffic and trade. For one hundred years the wealthy residents
                    built their houses along it, or, if in the streets running off from it at right
                    angles, as near it as possible; and the shops followed them up closely. As
                    population grew during this period the private dwellings of the better class
                    simply moved up farther on Broadway and the adjacent streets, leaving the old
                    houses to be converted into shops. The farther from Broadway, and the nearer the
                    river on either side, the cheaper land was, and the poorer the class of houses
                    which sprang up on it. This fondness for Broadway in a great degree explains the
                    aspect of the city. About a mile and a half from the Battery, or southernmost

                    after local notables of the colonial period, become designated by numbers, and
                    are separated by equal intervals, known as “blocks,” of which twenty form a
                    mile. Up to Eighth Street, Broadway divides the streets which cross it into east
                    and west. After Eighth Street, Fifth Avenue, which begins at a handsome square,
                    known as the Washington Square, lying a short distance west of Broadway, becomes
                    the dividing line, and continues to be so out to the Harlem River, a distance of
                    8 miles. Broadway at Fourteenth Street runs into Union Square, which contains
                    statues of Washington (equestrian), La Fayette, and Lincoln, and is surrounded
                    by large shops; it then trends westerly towards the Hudson River, and thus
                    crosses Fifth Avenue (which runs due north) at Twenty-Third Street, where it
                    enters Madison Square, another open space, on the west side of which are
                    clustered several of the largest hotels in the city. Fifth Avenue has played for
                    the last forty years the same part, as the fashionable street, which Broadway
                    played in the preceding period. It was long the ambition of wealthy men to live
                    in it. It is lined from Washington Square to the Central Park, a distance qf 3
                    miles, with costly houses, mostly of brown stone and red brick, without much
                    architectural pretension, and producing from the preponderance of the brown
                    stone a somewhat monotonous effect, but perhaps unequalled anywhere as the
                    indication of private wealth. Fashion has long permitted, and of late has
                    encouraged, resort to the side streets as places of abode, but the rule is
                    nevertheless tolerably rigid that one must not go beyond Fourth Avenue, two
                    blocks on the east side, or Sixth Avenue, one block on the west side, if one
                    wishes to live in a good quarter. Within the district thus bounded the city
                    presents a clean and orderly appearance, but mainly owing to the exertions of
                    the householders themselves.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>When the present street plan was adopted, no arrangement was
                    made for back entrances to the houses as in Boston and Philadelphia, and the
                    consequence is that all ashes and refuse have to be removed by a front door, and
                    are placed in barrels on the sidewalk in the morning to await the arrival of the
                    municipal scavenger carts, which is very uncertain as to time. The streets,
                    consequently, are defaced for half the day by these unsightly accumulations. In
                    the better quarters the inhabitants avoid this by having their refuse removed at
                    their own cost by dustmen who enter the houses for it. They have the streets in
                    front of the houses swept in the same way to make up for the defects of the
                    municipal street cleaning. When we pass out of this favoured region we find the
                    garbage and ashes heaped in front of the doors, and the streets impeded by carts
                    and waggons which their owners, in disregard of the municipal ordinances, are
                    allowed to keep standing out of doors, thus saving themselves the expense of
                    coach-houses. Consequently, all that portion of New York which does not lie
                    within a quarter of a mile of Broadway or Fifth Avenue presents a spectacle of
                    dirt and disorder and bad pavement for which it would be difficult to find a
                    parallel in other great capitals. The fine and well-kept part of the city
                    nowhere touches on the rivers or approaches them, but runs in a long central
                    line north and south, and the river banks are lined by wooden wharves. Some part
                    of this neglect to beautify the city is due to the rapidity of its growth, some
                    to defects in the plan on which it io laid out, but more to the badness of the
                    municipal government.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Harbour Defence.—</hi> For
                    this the city depends on forts situated at the western entrance to Long Island
                    Sound, at the Narrows (a passage between the upper and lower bays), and in the
                    harbour, itself. All these are confessedly powerless against a fleet armed with
                    modern ordnance. The forts at the entrance of the Sound are Fort Schuyler,
                    situated on Throgg’s Neck, and a fort on Willett’s Point on the opposite shore.
                    The defences at the Narrows consist of Forts Wadsworth and Tompkins and several
                    detached batteries on the Staten Island shore, and of Fort Hamilton and several
                    batteries on the opposite Long Island shore. The forts in the bay are small and
                    weak structures, and comprise Fort Columbus, Castle William, and some batteries,
                    all on Governor’s Island, and Fort Gibson on</p>
                <p>Ellis Island. Fort La Fayette, made famous during the war of the rebellion as a
                    prison, was destroyed by fire in 1868, and Bedloe’s Island, on which stood Fort
                    Wood, is now given up for the reception of Bartholdi’s statue of Liberty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of the first Dutch settlements at
                    Manhattan, and of their transference to England, is sketched in the article on
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">New York State.</hi> Down to the Revolution the history of
                    the city is to all intents and purposes that of the province at large. The
                    population grew slowly but steadily, and so did the trade of the place, —the
                    Dutch language and influence, however, gradually giving way to the English.
                    During the Revolution the city, while containing a large body of loyalists,
                    shared in the main in the feelings and opinions of the rest of the country, but
                    was cut off from active participation in the struggle by being occupied at a
                    very early period of the war by the British troops, and it was the scene of
                    their final departure from American soil on November 25,1782. Since the
                    Revolution its history has been principally the record of an enormous material
                    growth, the nature and extent of which are described in other parts of this
                    article. It was the capital of the State of New York from 1784 to 1797, though
                    the legislature met several times during this period at Albany and Poughkeepsie.
                    From 1785 to 1790 it was the seat of the general Government, and there the first
                    inauguration of Washington to the presidency occurred on the 30th of April
                    1789.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population of New York, in spite of the
                    great attractions of the site, increased very slowly for the first century after
                    its settlement. When the Revolution began it amounted to less than 22,000, and
                    the city stood far below Boston and Philadelphia in importance. It was, too,
                    dominated to a degree unknown in the other Northern States by the landowners
                    whose estates lined the Hudson as far up as Albany, and who played the leading
                    part in society and politics. The original constitution of colonial society was
                    thoroughly aristocratic, and it was maintained almost intact until after the
                    Revolution, the large landed estates along the Hudson being still held by the
                    descendants of the original Dutch grantees, and let on tenures which were
                    essentially feudal in their character. In spite of the large influx of settlers
                    from New England and other parts of the country, the Revolution found the Dutch
                    elements in New York society still strong, if not dominant, and the political
                    ascendency of the territorial families on the Hudson on the whole but little
                    diminished. After the Revolution the growth of the city population became more
                    rapid, but it did not reach 100,000 until 1815, nor 160,000 until 1825. From
                    this date it grew by leaps and bounds until it reached, in 1880, 1,206,299,<note

                    York reside in Brooklyn or Jersey City, on the other side of the East and Hudson
                    Rivers respectively, or in the lesser suburbs, and are not included in the
                    census return. At the end of 1883 the population was estimated at 1,337,325. The
                    impetus which the population received in 1825 was due to the opening of the
                    canal connecting the Hudson with Lake Erie, which made New York the commercial
                    entrepot for a vast and fertile region such as lay behind no other port on the
                    eastern coast. The tendency of foreign trade to concentrate at New York, which
                    has since reduced many small but once flourishing ports along the Atlantic
                    coast, and has taken away from Boston and Philadelphia a good <pb break="no"

                    prosperity, at once began to show itself, and has apparently lost none of its
                    force since the railways came into use to supplement or supersede the
                    canals.</p>
                <p>In considering New York as a commercial port, the population of several suburbs
                    within 10 or 15 miles radius should be taken along with it. Including only that
                    of Brooklyn (556,663) and of Jersey City (120,722), the total would be
                    1,883,684. Of the 1,206,299 forming the population of the municipality of New
                    York proper in 1880, 478,670, or nearly one-third, were of foreign birth. Of
                    these 163,482 were Germans and 198,595 Irish, forming together by far the
                    largest and most important part of the foreign element. Of the total population,
                    336,137 are males above the voting age, and the females exceed the males by
                    about 25,000. In the native American population, amounting to 727,629, there are
                    647,399 natives of the State of New York, only 80,330 coming from other States.
                    New Jersey furnishes the largest contingent, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and
                    Connecticut following next, though every State and Territory in the Union
                    contributes something. There are no means of ascertaining the proportion of the
                    inhabitants born within the city limits; it is probably smaller than even in
                    London or Paris.</p>
                <p>The heterogeneous character of the population, however, so largely composed of
                    persons who come from widely different parts of the globe to seek their fortune,
                    while infusing great energy into commercial and industrial operations, has had
                    an unfortunate effect on the municipal life of the place. It has prevented the
                    growth of a healthy local pride among the successful men of business, many of
                    whom labour with the intention of passing their closing years elsewhere, a
                    sentiment particularly strong among the prosperous New Englanders, whose
                    affections are very apt to be fixed on the place of their birth. The result is
                    that, considering the very large fortunes which have been made in the city
                    during the last century, it has profited but little, compared with others in
                    America, by the gifts or endowments of its wealthy men. The same cause has
                    operated to some extent to prevent hearty co-operation in municipal affairs. The
                    inhabitants of the different nationalities live much apart, both in politics and
                    in society. The Germans, whose social life is very active, give but little
                    attention to local politics, although they form, owing to their intelligence,
                    order, and industry, a very valuable element in the population. Germans head a
                    good many of the principal banking and commercial houses. A considerable
                    proportion of those settled in New York are skilled artisans; cabinetmaking and
                    upholstering in particular are largely in their hands. They supply also most of
                    the music of the city, do nearly all its brewing and a considerable portion of
                    its baking, and furnish a very large contingent in the work of all the leading
                    manufactures. They supply comparatively few of the domestics of either sex, or
                    of the manual labourers. Difference of language, combined with the absence of
                    political training at home, keeps the Germans from taking a very active part in
                    politics, except to resist some of the attempts at restrictive legislation
                    directed against their beer drinking and Sunday amusements, which the American
                    temperance advocates frequently make. As a rule it may be said that the
                    prominent Germans in the city, like the Catholic Irish, belong to the Democratic
                    party.</p>
                <p>The port of New York is the great gateway for immigrants coming to the United
                    States. Of the 7,892,783 immigrants who have come to the country from the years
                    1855 to 1882 inclusive, 5,169,765 have landed at New York city. The largest
                    number landed there in one year was 476,086 in 1882. Germany sends the greatest
                    number, Ireland βoming next, England third, and Sweden fourth. From 1847 to 1881
                    inclusive the German immigrants arriving in New York have numbered 2,498,595;
                    the Irish, 2,171,982; the English, 834,328; and the Swedish, 208,505. The total
                    number of immigrants landed at New York during the years 1858 to 1862 inclusive
                    was 404,918; from 1863 to 1867 it was 1,009,641; from 1868 to 1872, 1,209,011;
                    from 1873 to 1877, 614,219; in 1878 it was 75,347; in 1879, 135,070; in 1880,
                    327,371; in 1881, 455,681; in 1882, 476,086; and in the first six months of 1883
                    it was 257,635. The Irish emigrants who settle in New York are to a considerable
                    extent a deposit left by the stream of emigration which enters the country at
                    that port. The more energetic and thoughtful, and those who have any money, push
                    on to the west; the penniless and the shiftless are apt to stay where they land,
                    and furnish the city with most of its unskilled labour, although of late years
                    they have been exposed to considerable competition from Italians, mainly from
                    southern Italy. The resource of a large number of the more pushing is apt to be
                    liquor dealing, which generally brings them influence in ward politics, and
                    secures recognition from the party leaders as a means of communicating with and
                    controlling the rank and file. The great body of the porters and waiters in the
                    hotels and second-class restaurants, of the carters and hackney-coach drivers, a
                    large proportion of the factory workers, and almost the entire body of household
                    servants are Irish also, and for the most part a saving and industrious
                    body.</p>
                <p>The social life of New York in the earlier days, and, in fact, down to 1825, took
                    its tone from the landholding aristocracy. Social traditions were, however,
                    principally Dutch, and were characterized by the simplicity and frugality of
                    that people. As the place grew in wealth and population, the ascendency of the
                    old Dutch families was gradually lost. The successful commercial men who came to
                    New York from all parts of the country became the real local magnates, and
                    business prosperity became the chief sign and cause of social distinction. This
                    state of things still exists. There is no other city in the United States in
                    which money gives a man or woman so much social weight, and in which it
                    exercises so much influence on the manners and amusements, and meets with so
                    little competition from literary, artistic, or other eminence. The luxury of
                    domestic life is carried to a degree unequalled in any other city. The
                    entertainments are numerous and costly, and the restaurants, of which
                    Delmonico’s is the chief, have achieved a world-wide fame. The number of horses
                    and equipages has greatly increased within twenty years under the stimulus given
                    by the opening of Central Park, the drives of which on fine afternoons in April
                    and May and the early part of June present a scene of great brilliancy. The city
                    is, however, almost completely deserted during the summer months by the wealthy,
                    who fly to country houses along the coast from New Jersey as far up as the
                    province of New Brunswick, or to the mineral springs of Saratoga, or to Europe.
                    Thirty years ago it was the ambition of rich men to own country houses along the
                    Hudson river, the scenery of which possesses great grandeur, but its banks have
                    of late been infested by malaria, and for this and other reasons the tide of
                    fashion has been turned to the seaside, and more particularly to Newport in
                    Rhode Island, which is now a city of marine villas. For people of small means
                    New York is slenderly provided with summer entertainments, except such as are
                    afforded by the beauty of the suburbs and by the many water-side resorts within
                    easy reach on the Hudson, the New Jersey coast, and Long Island Sound, and
                    especially at Coney Island, which is really a continuation of the sandy beach
                    that extends all <pb break="no"

                    extremity is distant from the Battery about 8 J miles in a straight line, and
                    its extreme length is about 5 miles. Since 1874, when capitalists suddenly woke
                    up to the capabilities of the spot, a number of favourite resorts have sprung up
                    on the island, with monster hotels, in one of which as many as four thousand
                    people can dine at once, conveniences for surf-bathing, and a great variety of
                    amusements. The island is reached by steam and horse cars, by steamboats, and by
                    carriages. The Germans have beer gardens on a grand scale, both on Manhattan
                    Island and elsewhere which they frequent in vast numbers. The Irish organize
                    picnics to groves and woods along the Hudson and East Rivers, which are let for
                    that purpose. Excursions by water down the harbour and up Long Island Sound are
                    very numerous. For this species of amusement there are few cities in the world
                    so well situated.</p>
                <p>New York has about thirty places of amusement using scenery, not including a few
                    small variety theatres of little importance; of all these the Metropolitan Opera
                    House is much the largest. Its stage is 96 feet wide, 76 feet deep, and 120 feet
                    high. There are seventeen outside entrances, six of them 10 feet wide; and the
                    whole structure is fire-proof. The chief foyer is 34 feet wide and 82 feet long,
                    with a parlour so connected that the foyer can be used as a lecture-room, the
                    parlour giving place for a stage. The seating capacity of the auditorium is
                    about three thousand. Of the other theatres the largest are Miner’s Bowery,
                    Miner’s Eighth Avenue, Academy of Music, M‘Kee Rankin’s, Niblo’s, Fourteen
                    Street Theatre (Haverly’s), Thalia, Criterion, London, Harrigan and Hart’s,
                    Cosmopolitan, Fifth Avenue, Star, Twenty-third Street, Union Square. Beside the
                    theatres there are two fine concert and lecture-rooms—Steinway Hall and
                    Chickering Hall.</p>
                <p>The clubs of New York may be divided into two classes, —the political and social,
                    and the purely social. To the former belong the Manhattan and the Union League;
                    to the latter the Century (1847), Harmonie (1852), Knickerbocker (1871), Lotus
                    (1870), New York, St Nicholas, Union (1836), and University (1865). The
                    Manhattan Club (with some 570 members) is the local club of the Democratic
                    party, founded during the closing years of the civil war, and reorganized in
                    1877. The Union League Club was founded in 1863, in order to give to the Federal
                    administration during the war the organized support of wealthy and influential
                    men in the city, and it has been ever since the Republican social organization
                    of the city. The Century Club represents literature, art, and the learned
                    professions, and owns a valuable collection of pictures and a well-selected
                    library. All the members of the Harmonie Club speak German. The original plan of
                    the Lotus Club looked <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> to a membership of literary
                    men and artists, and members of the musical and dramatic professions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The Dutch West India Company, which settled
                    the island of Manhattan, was bound by its charter to provide schoolmasters as
                    well as ministers for its colonists. The company consequently maintained schools
                    from the beginning, and private schools were also soon established, and drew
                    pupils even from other colonies. When the colony passed into the possession of
                    England, the schools of the city still continued in the hands of the Dutch
                    Church and ministers, and were supported by them, receiving little or no aid
                    from the Government. At a later period, the desire of the new rulers to hasten
                    the substitution of the English for the Dutch language in the colony led to an
                    attempt by the colonial Government to reserve to itself the appointment of the
                    schoolmasters, but it was not successful. Down to the middle of the 17th century
                    the bulk of the population remained Dutch, and the support and control of the
                    schools remained with the Dutch Church. The only outward sign of the growth of
                    English influence during this period was the establishment of the still existing
                    Trinity school, in 1710, in connexion with the Anglican Church. About the middle
                    of the century the tide of English emigration, which has never since ceased,
                    began to flow in, and English influence in educational matters began to gain the
                    ascendency. In 1754 King’s College, afterwards Columbia College, was
                    established, and, after a short struggle to preserve it from denominational
                    control, became distinctively an Anglican institution. Before the Revolution the
                    English language had practically carried the day, and taken possession of the
                    schools, colleges, and churches; but the political troubles which preceded the
                    outbreak of the war, and the occupation of the city by the royal army during the
                    war, closed them all, and for nearly ten years suspended all educational
                    progress.</p>
                <p>It was not until over ten years after the Revolution that the State legislature
                    took any steps for the establishment of a system of popular education in the
                    State at large. But within three years after the peace the beginnings were made
                    in New York in the form which has made the educational history of the city so
                    peculiar, namely, as a charitable organization. In 1785 the Manumission Society
                    established free schools for the poor coloured children of the city, and they
                    were continued under the same auspices until 1794. A Quaker society, known as
                    the “Female Association for the Relief of the Poor,” in like manner opened a
                    school for white girls in 1802, and the organization extended its operations and
                    continued them until 1846. It was the means of suggesting the formation in 1805
                    of the association known as the “Free School Society,” and afterwards as the
                    “Public School Society,” which has played so important a part in the education
                    in New York. These were both charitable societies, and at first only sought to
                    provide for children unconnected with the churches of various denominations, all
                    of which maintained schools of their own. Of the Free School Society the mayor,
                    recorder, aidermen, and assistant aidermen were made <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex-officio</hi> members, and membership was open to all citizens offering
                    contributions to the funds. This society was in 1826 converted into a still
                    larger and more powerful one with a new charter, called the Public School
                    Society, which continued to have charge of popular education in the city until
                    1853. It was supported in part by voluntary contributions, in part by
                    subscriptions from those who desired to share in its management, and in a small
                    degree by a contribution from the school fund of the State. For fifty years it
                    may be said to have done all that was done for popular education in New York
                    city, and its existence caused the exemption of the city for nearly thirty years
                    from the operation of the common-school system established in the rest of the
                    State, under which the schools were managed by trustees elected by the voters of
                    each school district. During its existence 600,000 children passed through its
                    schools, and it expended every year a large and increasing revenue, and λvhen
                    dissolved turned over $600,000 to the city. It gradually became plain, however,
                    that the work of popular education in a large city was too great to be carried
                    on by a charitable association, however able or energetic. In 1842 New York was
                    brought under the system prevailing in the rest of the State, but the Public
                    School Society was permitted to continue its existence and retain control of its
                    own schools. It was found, after a few years’ trial, that .the society could not
                    flourish in competition with the official organization, and in 1853 it was
                    voluntarily dissolved, and its schools and property handed over to the city
                    authorities, by whom the work of popular education has ever since been carried
                    on.</p>
                <p>The municipal board of education was at first composed of representatives elected
                    by the different wards, but in 1864 the city was divided into school districts
                    of equal school population, each of which sends three commissioners to the
                    board. The ward schools were left in the control of elected trustees, subject
                    only to a somewhat ill-defined power of supervision at the hands of a central
                    board. This was found to work so badly, owing to the low character of many of
                    the elected trustees, that in 1873 the whole system was reorganized. The power
                    of appointing the twenty-one commissioners of the board of education, and three
                    inspectors for each of the eight school districts, was given to the mayor, and
                    to the commissioners the power of appointing five school trustees for each ward.
                    The commissioners and inspectors hold office for three years, and trustees for
                    five. As an outgrowth of the common-school system there is a normal college for
                    the education of teachers, with a model school connected with it, and also the
                    college of the city of New York, which began in 1848 as a free academy for the
                    advanced pupils who had left the common schools. It was empowered to grant
                    degrees in 1854, and was formally converted into a university in 1866.</p>
                <p>The total number of scholars attending the city schools in 1882 was 289,917, and
                    the number of professors and teachers employed was 2544. An Act providing for
                    compulsory education was passed by the legislature in 1874, and came into
                    operation in the city in 1875. It compels every person in the control or charge
                    of any children between the ages of eight and fourteen to cause them to attend
                    some public or private school at least fourteen weeks in each year, eight weeks
                    of which are to be consecutive, or the pupils are to be instructed regularly at
                    home at least fourteen weeks in each year in spelling, reading, writing, English
                    grammar, and arithmetic. The law is enforced in the city by the city
                    superintendent, who has twelve assistants known as “agents of truancy.” <pb

                    connected officially with the Government are very numerous, beginning with
                    Columbia College, founded in 1754, and now the oldest university in the State,
                    and the richest in the United States. Though not formally denominational, it is
                    managed chiefly by members of the Protestant Episcopal Church. It has
                    well-equipped law, medical, and mining schools, besides its academic department,
                    a library of about 20,000 volumes, and a rapidly growing income from advance of
                    its property in the city. There are also several denominational colleges
                    belonging to Catholics, which offer a full course from the primary to the most
                    advanced stage; and two theological seminaries, one the Protestant Episcopal,
                    and the other the Union Theological Seminary, belonging to the Presbyterians.
                    The endowment of the non-sectarian University of the City of New York is small,
                    so that it makes but little figure in the educational field. There are also
                    numerous medical colleges, and a large number of private schools frequented by
                    children of the wealthier-classes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Libraries. —</hi> The principal public libraries are the Astor
                    Library, the Mercantile Library, and the New York Society Library, which have
                    been described in vol. xiv. pp. 535, 536.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Periodical Press.—</hi> There is probably nothing in which New
                    York more nearly occupies the place of a metropolis than in the position of its
                    periodical press towards that of the rest of the country. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Newspapers,</hi><hi rend="italic">supra,</hi> p. 434. The
                    modern American newspaper may indeed be said, to have originated in New York,
                    which is naturally the chief centre for foreign news, as well as the chief
                    financial and. commercial centre, and the chief entrepot of foreign goods. In
                    fact, as early as 1840 it had become plain that any one proposing to address the
                    whole country through the press could address it more effectively from New York
                    than from any other point. As population has spread and other cities have grown
                    in wealth and numbers, New York newspapers have of course lost more or less of
                    their early superiority, but they are still more widely read than any others,
                    and absorb more of whatever journalistic talent there may be in the country. In
                    the field of literary and artistic and musical criticism they are exposed to but
                    little competition, from any quarter. The periodical literature of the city is
                    now very large; there is hardly an interest or shade of opinion, religious or
                    political, which does not possess a New York organ, as the subjoined table will

                    trustworthy statistics are those of the City Missionary Society, which puts the
                    number of places of religious worship in the city, including halls, chapels, and
                    missions, at 489. Of these, 349 are churches properly so-called, each with a
                    fixed congregation, and a settled pastor and a building appropriated to its own
                    use. They are divided as follows anlong the various denominations:—Protestant
                    Episcopal, 72; Roman Catholic, 57; Methodist Episcopal, 48; Presbyterian, 41;
                    Baptist, 38; Jewish synagogues, 25; Lutheran, 21; Dutch Reformed, 20; African
                    Methodist Episcopal, 7; United Presbyterian, 6; Congregational,' 5;
                    Universalist, 4; Unitarian, 3; Quakers, 2; “miscellaneous,” 23. This last term
                    covers spiritualists and radicals of various shades, who, without having any
                    fixed creed, or definite object of worship, meet on -Sunday for speculative or
                    ethical discussion.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholic Church lays claim to 500,000 worshippers, or nearly half the
                    population, which is probably a considerable exaggeration, as its hold on the
                    natives is, beyond question, very slight, and the total foreign population of
                    the city does not reach 500,000. The Irish are almost wholly Catholic, as are
                    the majority of the Germans, and nearly all the French, Italians, and other
                    persons of foreign birth. The Catholic increase, too, is derived almost
                    exclusively from foreign immigration. The priests are mainly Irish and German,
                    the higher clergy being almost exclusively Irish either by birth or parentage.
                    There is, too, a considerable Catholic element in social life, composed of the
                    well-to-do French and German and Irish and Spanish, who, however, confine
                    themselves very much to the company of persons of their own creed.</p>
                <p>All the places of worship in the city of one sort or another, taken together, are
                    supposed to contain 375,000 sittings. The Protestant denominations lay claim to
                    83,400 communicants and 400,000 attendants or supporters. The value of all the
                    church buildings, including the ground on which they stand, is estimated at
                    $40,000,000. The annual church expenses, including the ministers’ salaries, are
                    supposed to be $3,000,000. There are connected with the churches 418 Sunday
                    schools, with an average attendance of 115,826 pupils. There are also in the
                    city 326 local charitable institutions, of which 261 are Protestant, 38 are
                    Roman Catholic, 18 are Jewish, and the rest are not classified. They disburse
                    annually about $4,000,000. The most remarkable and successful of these charities
                    is undoubtedly the Children’s Aid Society, which was founded in 1853 by Mr
                    Charles Loring Brace, the present secretary, for the purpose of helping
                    friendless street children, especially street boys, both by sending them to the
                    west and by opening schools and lodging-houses for them in the city. Since it
                    began its work 67,287 children have been, by its agency, sent away from the city
                    to country homes. During the year 1882 the society gave 14,122 boys and girls
                    230,968 lodgings in its six lodging-, houses, of which 173,152 were paid for by
                    the lodgers themselves; and it furnished them with 305,524 meals at low rates or
                    free. The income of the society has risen from $4,732’78 in 1853 to $237,624 in
                    1882 from subscriptions and endowments.</p>
                <p>The richest and most fashionable denomination is the Protestant Episcopal, and it
                    is the one which seems to grow most by accretion from the native population. On
                    the other hand, while the Baptists and Methodists have always flourished in New
                    York, the two denominations which owed their origin in the United States chiefly
                    to New England—the Unitarians and Congregationalists—have never taken deep root
                    in the city.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Municipal Charities.—</hi> The municipal charities are in the
                    hands of a department of the city government called the Commissioners of
                    Charities and Correction, consisting of three commissioners appointed by the
                    mayor, who have charge of all prisons for persons awaiting trial, of all city
                    hospitals, almshouses, workhouses, and lunatic asylums, and of the penitentiary
                    and city prisons. Most of these institutions are situated on small islands in
                    the East River, known as Blackwell’s, Ward’s, Randall’s, and Hart’s Islands, the
                    last-named containing a municipal industrial school.</p>
                <p>Two charities are, however, exempt from the control of the department. One, the
                    House of Refuge on Randall’s Island, which is the property of a private
                    corporation that receives vagrant and disorderly children, and gets its income
                    partly from the labour of the inmates, partly from the proceeds of theatrical
                    licences granted by the city, and partly from State grants. The other is the
                    Juvenile Asylum, which also is managed by a private association, and partly
                    supported by State grants. The influence of political partisanship on the
                    appointment of the officers under the control of the department of charities and
                    correction has been found to result in such serious defects of management, as
                    regards the hospitals and charities especially, that a voluntary association,
                    composed mainly of ladies, and known as the State Charities Aid Association, was
                    formed in New York some years ago, and has obtained from the legislature powers
                    of compulsory inspection. Its volunteer visitors are thus enabled to visit and
                    examine all the institutions belonging to the city, as well as those of the
                    State at large, and report on their condition both to the public and to the
                    superiors of the officers criticized. The emigrants, of whom by far the greater
                    portion pass through New York, are also placed in charge of Commissioners of
                    Emigration, appointed by the mayor, whose duty is to afford all information and
                    assistance which helpless strangers are likely to require on their first arrival
                    in a foreign country. Their duties include also the discovery on shipboard, and
                    detention for return to the country of their origin, of all paupers, cripples,
                    and insane persons or others who are likely to become a charge to the city.
                    These functions are discharged in a huge wooden structure known as Castle
                    Garden, on the southernmost point of Manhattan Island, at tjje lower end of
                    Broadway. Their magnitude varies from year to year. In 1883 about 405,000
                    emigrants of all ages and both sexes passed through the hands of the
                    commissioners.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government and Administration.—</hi> During the first stage of
                    the colony the government was to all intents and purposes a military one. The
                    governor, or director-general, appointed by the Dutch East India Company,
                    exercised virtually absolute power, subject, of course, to the distant control
                    of the directors in Holland. In 1652 the town received municipal magistrates
                    appointed for one year by the director-general. They held office at his will,
                    and were liable to have their decisions overruled by him on appeal; but, subject
                    to these conditions, they possessed the powers and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n502/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0502-0463"/> exercised the functions of corresponding officers
                    in the Dutch municipalities at home. This form of government continued μntil
                    after the conquest of the colony by the English, when the so-called “Duke’s
                    Laws” were proclaimed, and, on June 12, 1665, all the inhabitants of Manhattan
                    Island were declared a body politic and corporate. The first formal charter,
                    known as the Dongan charter, was bestowed on the city in 1686. The recorder,
                    mayor, aidermen, and assistants were to constitute the body corporate, but the
                    mayor, recorder, sheriff, and other superior officers were to be appointed
                    yearly by the lieutenant-governor of the province, while the aidermen and
                    assistants (who together with the mayor and recorder constituted the common
                    council) and the petty constables were to be elected by a majority of the
                    freemen and freeholders of each ward. In 1730 the charter was again amended, and
                    took the form known as the Montgomery charter, reserving the appointment of a
                    mayor and recorder still to the crown, and providing for the annual election by
                    the people of the aidermen and assistants, constables, assessors, and
                    collectors. The freedom of the city was purchasable from the corporation for
                    five pounds, and was necessary to the pursuit of any trade or handicraft within
                    its limits. This charter continued in force for nearly a century. It was
                    confirmed by the State constitution of 1777 adopted after the outbreak of the
                    Revolution, and again by the revised constitution of 1821, and has furnished, in
                    fact, the framework of the city government down to the present day. The power
                    which it gave the corporation of fixing the price of all articles sold in the
                    city market was exercised till the Revolution. It was not essentially altered
                    until 1831, when among other minor changes the common council was divided into
                    two boards. The appointment of the mayor remained in the hands of the governor
                    and council until the Revolution, when it was transferred by the State
                    constitution to the governor and council of appointment which shared with him
                    the appointing power. By the amended State constitution of 1821, the duty of
                    electing the mayor annually was imposed on the common council, and so continued
                    until 1834, when provision was made by statute for his election by a vote of the
                    qualified city electors. This charter continued in force without material
                    modification until 1857.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The legal title of the corporation is now the “Mayor, Aidermen, and
                    Commonalty of the City of New York," and the legislative branch consists of a
                    board of twenty-four aidermen, who constitute the common council, and are
                    elected by a majority vote, one from each electoral district, within the city
                    limits, which sends a member <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the State
                    assembly.</p></note></p>
                <p>The revised State constitution of 1846 introduced manhood suffrage, and its
                    effect on the city government during the first ten years gave considerable
                    dissatisfaction. It came into operation simultaneously with a great increase in
                    the stream of foreign immigration, most of which passed through New York on its
                    way westward, but not without leaving behind a sediment, composed of the
                    poorest, the most ignorant, and the most vicious. The result was that a very
                    inferior class of men began to find their way into the mayoralty and the common
                    council. The liquor dealers and others of a similar stamp, whose occupations
                    gave them access to, and influence over, the more ignorant voters, began to
                    assume increasing importance in municipal politics, becoming able to impose
                    conditions on candidates for office and to exercise considerable control over
                    the distribution of municipal patronage. The police force was gradually
                    converted into a refuge of political partisans, and was employed without scruple
                    in electioneering. Every political department of the city government suffered
                    more or less from the same causes. The great political club known as the Tammany
                    Society, which was formed in 1789 as a non-political patriotic organization,
                    professedly to counteract the aristocratic tendencies of the Order of the
                    Cincinnati, and which had long been the managing body of the Democratic party in
                    the city, was much strengthened by the increase of the immigrant vote, and its
                    government was also affected for the worse by the same influences to which the
                    city government was exposed. During these years, however, the Republican party,
                    as the opponent of slavery, was slowly rising into prominence in State and
                    Federal politics on the ruins of the old Whig party. By the year 1857 it had
                    gained a majority of the voters of the State outside of the city, secured the
                    control of the State legislature, and elected a governor. It was not very long
                    in power in the State at large before it determined to take the government of
                    the city of New York, to a certain extent, out of the hands of the local
                    majority by giving portions of it to commissions appointed by the governor.
                    There was perhaps reason enough for the experiment to be found in the condition
                    of the municipal administration, but it was unfortunate that it had to be made
                    by a political party to which the local majority did not belong. This gave it an
                    air of partisanship, and exposed it to the charge of being simply an attempt to
                    put the Republican party in possession of a portion of the city patronage, which
                    it could not get hold of in any other way, and to punish the city voters for
                    being Democratic and standing by the South in the slavery controversy. It was in
                    reality, however, an effort on the part of the native-born and the property
                    holders to escape the inevitable result of a sudden increase in the power of the
                    ignorant and poor in a great commercial city.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, in the spring of 1857, the charter was so modified by the
                    legislature as to give the construction of a park, known as the Central Park,
                    for which provision had just been made, to a commission appointed by the
                    governor. The police was in like manner taken out of the hands of the mayor and
                    given to a similar commission. The mayor then in office, Fernando Wood,
                    attempted forcible resistance to this change on the ground that the statute was
                    unconstitutional. He barricaded himself in the city-hall surrounded by his
                    policemen, and had to be ousted and arrested by the aid of the militia. Ever
                    since 1857 interference of the State in the city government has been frequent,
                    and alterations of the charter have been made or attempted almost every year
                    with the view mainly of effecting a new distribution of the city patronage,
                    sometimes as the result of a change in the majority of the legislature, and
                    sometimes as the result of a bargain between the Republican leaders in the
                    legislature and the Democratic leaders in the city. But the policy of
                    withdrawing or withholding power from the common council has through all these
                    changes been steadily adhered to on both sides, owing to distrust of the persons
                    now usually elected to that body.</p>
                <p>During the war, and for several years afterwards, the art of managing the city
                    voters of the Democratic party through the political club known as the Tammany
                    Society was continually improved under the leadership of William Μ. Tweed, who
                    had succeeded Fernando Wood as the municipal chief of his party. Before 1870 he
                    had brought the city majority under his control through a very perfect
                    organization, and had filled the mayoralty and all the leading administrative
                    offices as well as the common council with his creatures. He thereupon began an
                    elaborate system of plunder, of which the main feature was the presentation of
                    enormous bills for work done on a new court-house then in process of erection by
                    city tradesmen acting as his confederates. To these he paid a portion only of
                    their demands, retaining the balance, which he divided in certain proportions
                    with his principal followers. The total amount taken from the city treasury in
                    this and similar ways was never clearly ascertained, but the city debt, which
                    was apparently a little over $73,000,000 in 1870, was, when the liabilities were
                    fully ascertained in 1876, found to be nearly $117,000,000. These frauds, which
                    had been long suspected, were finally brought to light by the treachery of one
                    of the conspirators, who was dissatisfied with his share. But their success and
                    the length of time which had elapsed before their detection were, considering
                    the very large number of persons who had been made privy to them, and who had
                    been admitted as partners in their results, a remarkable illustration of the
                    perfection to which the system had been brought. The overthrow and punishment of
                    the leading perpetrators of them greatly purified the municipal administration,
                    and led to a watchfulness on the part of the public regarding municipal affairs
                    which promises, as long as it lasts, to make a repetition of them impossible. In
                    fact, they could not have been perpetrated without a combination which included
                    all the chief city officers; and this could not have been effected, and as a
                    matter of fact was not effected, without many years of careful, and, to a
                    certain extent, unobserved preparation. The great source of corruption in the
                    city government is the practice of treating places in the municipal service as
                    what are called party “spoils,” or, in other words, as rewards for
                    electioneering services. This practice, which has prevailed in the Federal as
                    well as in the State service all over the country, is of older growth in the
                    State of New York than elsewhere, having shown itself there very soon after the
                    Revolution. It has been much weakened, however, in New York by an Act of the
                    legislature, passed in 1873, which forbids the removal of any regular clerk or
                    head of bureau in the service of the city government, except for cause, and
                    after an informal trial. The police and fire departments are protected in a
                    similar way; but this does not relieve the elected officers from the necessity
                    of purchasing their nominations by such promises as still remain in their power
                    to carry out, such as contributions from their salaries, or the filling of
                    vacancies occurring within their departments, or the employment of labourers in
                    any public work of which they may have charge. A more recent Act of the
                    legislature (1883) prescribes competitive examination as a basis for appointment
                    to all State offices, and forbids, under heavy penalties, all assessments on
                    salaries for political purposes; but its application to the large cities as
                    regards competitive examinations is left optional with the mayor, and with the
                    heads of certain departments. As the charter stands at present, the legislative
                    power of the board of aidermen is restricted to the regulation of the traffic in
                    the streets, the granting of licences to street vendors, the opening of new
                    streets, and similar matters. Their confirmation is, however, necessary to the
                    mayor’s appointment to office. The amount of taxes for each year is fixed by the
                    board called the board of apportionment, composed of the mayor, the comptroller,
                    the president of the board of aidermen, and the president of the department of
                    taxes and assessments. The estimate so made is <pb break="no"

                    approval, but this is a mere form, for, if the aidermen refuse such approval,
                    the board of apportionment disregards the refusal and goes on to levy the taxes,
                    after having placed on file their reasons for so doing. Moreover, the aidermen
                    are expressly forbidden by the charter to impose taxes, or borrow money, or
                    contract debts, or lend the credit of the city, or to take or make a lease of
                    any real estate or franchise save at a reasonable rent and for a period not
                    exceeding five years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Taxation.—</hi> For purposes of taxation New York is a county
                    as well as a city, the two being conterminous. The city taxes, when settled by
                    the mayor, comptroller, president of the board of aidermen, and president of the
                    board of assessments and taxes, forming the board of apportionment, are levied
                    by the same officers, forming the board of county supervisors, upon all the real
                    and personal property in the county, and in this levy is included the amount
                    needed for State purposes, the city’s share of which is settled by a State
                    board. The rule on which the New York taxes are levied is that which prevails
                    with but little modification all over the United States, though applied with
                    much more rigour in some States than in others, viz., that every species of
                    property, visible and invisible, is liable to taxation. In New York city it is
                    the custom of the appraisers to tax land and houses at about two-thirds of their
                    market value. The amount assessed on personal property is generally increased in
                    successive years, until the owner gainsays the assessor’s guess, but his oath is
                    sufficient proof for its reduction. In other words, it may be said that the
                    attempt to tax personal property in the city, except in the case of
                    corporations, has failed. The city tax levy for 1881 amounted to $31,071,840’19,
                    and the rate of the tax was $2’62 per cent, on the valuation of all kinds of
                    taxable property. There is a steady increase in the valuation of land and
                    houses, but a nearly steady decrease in the valuation of personal property.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Courts and Police.—</hi> The city has three courts of record,
                    of which two, the superior court and court of common pleas, possess concurrent
                    jurisdiction with the supreme court of the State in all cases in which the cause
                    of action has arisen within the county, or in which the property or other thing
                    in dispute lies within the county, or in which the defendant is a resident. Each
                    court has six judges, elected by popular vote for a term of fourteen years. The
                    supreme court can, however, remove any cause from either of these courts by
                    order on notice, and take jurisdiction of them itself, but in that case the
                    trial must take place in another county. The third, formerly the marine court,
                    now the city court, consists also of six judges. Its jurisdiction, however, is
                    limited to cases not involving more than $2000 dollars in value, and to the
                    enforcement against real estate of mechanics’ liens, that is, of liabilities
                    incurred to contractors or labourers who have been engaged in the construction
                    of a house or other work of improvement on land. The only marine causes of which
                    the court has cognizance are suits brought by sailors for wages, or by any
                    person for assault and battery or false imprisonment on board a vessel. Below
                    these are ten district courts which are not courts of record, and whose
                    jurisdiction only extends to cases not involving over $250. The justice of each
                    court is elected by popular vote, and holds office for six years, and must be a
                    member of the bar. Appeals from his decisions, in certain cases specified by
                    statute, lie to the court of common pleas. The surrogate, who has charge of the
                    court of probate, is also elected, and holds office for six years.</p>
                <p>The criminal courts of the city begin with the court of oyer and terminer, which
                    consists of a single judge of the State supreme court belonging to the judicial
                    district within which the city lies, and tries all such cases sent to it by the
                    court of general sessions as it thinks proper to try, and is, in fact, intended
                    to furnish relief to the latter. The working criminal court of the city is the
                    court of general sessions, which consists of the recorder, the city judge, and
                    the judge of the court of general sessions, each of whom tries cases sitting
                    apart; but an appeal in all capital cases, and in all cases punishable with
                    imprisonment for life, lies from them to the supreme court and court of appeals.
                    All three judges are elected, and hold office for fourteen years. Below the
                    general sessions there is the court of special sessions, composed of any three
                    police justices, which tries all misdemeanours, unless the defendant prefers to
                    be tried by the court of general sessions, or is sent before that court for
                    trial by the special sessions. The police courts are held by eleven police
                    justices possessing the usual jurisdiction of police magistrates, and appointed
                    by the mayor, subject to the confirmation of the board of aidermen, for a term
                    of ten years.</p>
                <p>In addition to the courts of law there is an official arbitrator, appointed by
                    the governor of the State, who, with or without two assessors chosen by the
                    parties to the controversy, hears and decides, on short notice, all disputes
                    between members of the chamber of commerce. His judgments have all the force of
                    those of the courts of law, and are executed in the same manner, and are
                    rendered without formal pleadings, on the oral or written statements of the
                    litigants, and the submission of the necessary documents.</p>
                <p>The police department is in the control of four salaried commissioners, who are
                    nominated by the mayor and confirmed by the aidermen, and hold office for six
                    years. The total force performing actual police duties consists of 2237
                    patrolmen, 165 roundsmen, 143 sergeants, 78 doormen, 36 captains, 40 detective
                    sergeants, 4 inspectors, and 1 superintendent. The expenses of the department
                    for the year ending January 1, 1882, were $3,209,960’65. The city is divided
                    into thirty-five police precincts, each under the direction of a captain and
                    subordinate officers. There is, in addition, a steamboat squad, whose duties
                    confine them to the piers and the neighbourhood; a mounted squad, on duty in the
                    uptown avenues; a central-office squad, on duty at the department headquarters;
                    a special-service squad; a detective bureau; a sanitary company for the
                    inspection of steam-boilers and tenement houses; four inspection districts; and
                    six district-court squads.</p>
                <p>About half of those arrested for various offences in the city are natives of the
                    United States. The statistics of the police courts (including the court of
                    special sessions) show that in the year ending October 31, 1882, they disposed
                    of 66,867 prisoners, a decrease of 17,954-as compared with the year 1874.</p>
                <p>The fire department is under control of three salaried fire commissioners, who
                    are nominated by the mayor and confirmed by the aidermen. The working force of
                    the department consists of 826 uniformed men, who are divided into fifty-one
                    engine companies and nineteen hook-and-ladder companies. The city is thoroughly
                    equipped with a fire-alarm telegraph system. The number of fires in the city in
                    1883 was 2168, with a loss of $3,517,326. The expenditure of the department in
                    1883 was $1,464,850. The department has other duties besides that of
                    extinguishing fires. It has charge of the bureau which looks after the proper
                    construction of buildings, seeing that they are erected in compliance with the
                    Building Act, and that old buildings do not become in any way dangerous, and
                    supervises the storage of combustibles and explosive materials.</p>
                <p>An adjunct of the fire department, although under entirely independent control,
                    is the fire-insurance patrol. This is an organization authorized by an Act of
                    the legislature passed in 1865, and supported by the fire insurance companies
                    doing business in the city. Its object is not to assist in extinguishing fires,
                    but to remove goods from the burning buildings, and to protect them from damage
                    by water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vital Statistics.—</hi> The situation of the city, surrounded
                    as it is by tide water, renders the disposition of its sewage easy. This,
                    combined with its excellent supply of fresh water, tends to make the city a
                    healthy one. On the other hand its limited area causes an excessive crowding of
                    its inhabitants into tenement houses; and, as a majority of the tenement
                    population is foreign, with little appreciation of the value of cleanliness, the
                    death-rate among this class is very large. This is especially true of young
                    children in the very hot months. Quarantine inspection at the mouth of the
                    harbour, and vigilant sanitary inspection throughout the city itself, have been
                    very successful in warding off pestilence. Since 1822 there have not been more
                    than one hundred deaths from yellow fever in any one year. Since 1831 there have
                    been six outbreaks of cholera, but only two deaths occurred from that disease
                    from 1875 to 1882 inclusive.</p>
                <p>The sanitary condition of the city is in charge of a board of health, consisting
                    of the president of the police board, the health officer of the port, and two
                    commissioners of health, one of whom must have been a practising physician for
                    not less than five years preceding his appointment. In the health department are
                    two bureaus, one in charge of a sanitary superintendent, and the other in charge
                    of a registrar of records. The board has authority to frame and enforce a
                    sanitary code. The death-rate was 26’47 in 1880, 31 ∙08 in 1881, and 29 ‘64 in
                    1882.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce and Manufactures.—</hi> New York owed its first rise
                    in importance to the excellence of its situation as a seaport, and in this
                    respect still maintains its pre-eminence over all American cities. Nearly 57 per
                    cent, of all the foreign trade of the country passes through its harbour. Its
                    exports during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1882, amounted to $344,503,775
                    out of a total for the whole country of $750,542,257. Its imports during the
                    same period reached $493,060,891 out of a total of $724,639,574, but a very much
                    larger proportion of this trade is done in foreign vessels tlιtιn formerly.
                    There is no line of steamers to Europe sailing from the port under the American
                    flag. Its supremacy as a port naturally brought with it supremacy as an entrepôt
                    of foreign goods; of these New York has been for the last half century the
                    principal distributing agency, especially as regards dry goods. Of late this
                    branch of business has to some extent migrated to Chicago and other western
                    cities, owing to the growth of population west of the Mississippi; but east of
                    the Alleghanies, and all through the Southern States, the hold of New York on
                    the retail dealers is practically unshaken. New York is also the foremost city
                    of the Union in manufactures, and no other city, except Philadelphia, can make
                    any pretence of competing with it in this field.</p>

                    work, shirts, iron castings, oleomargarine, millinery and lace goods, jewellery,
                    all with annual production ranging from $10,000,000 to $5,000,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Docks.—</hi> Until 1870 the docks of the city were not confided
                    to the care of a special department of the city government, and there was no
                    adequate attempt made to put them in practical and durable shape, and to extend
                    the wharf line. In that year a separate dock department was authorized by the
                    legislature, and it is continued under the present charter. It is in charge of
                    three commissioners, nominated by the mayor and confirmed by the aidermen. They
                    hold office for six years, and receive an annual salary of $3000 each. The
                    bulkhead line of the city from the Battery to Sixty-First Street on the Hudson
                    River, according to the new plan, measures 25,743 feet, and from the Battery to
                    Fifty-First Street on the East River 27,995 feet. At the Battery a stone pier
                    was completed several years ago. This is the only stone pier on the water front.
                    The .system which the department is trying to carry out proposes the
                    construction of a new bulkhead wall, first along the Hudson River front, and
                    eventually along the East River, and the widening of the street along the Hudson
                    River to a width of 250 feet, and of that along the East River to a width of 150
                    feet in the lower part and of 100 feet in the upper part. A beginning of this
                    work has been made along the Hudson River, but it makes slow progress, partly
                    because the title to the water front in many places is disputed by private
                    individuals, and this results in much tedious litigation. It is the intention to
                    give 20 to 25 feet of water at every point along the new bulkhead. This bulkhead
                    is now completed at detached points on the Hudson River, as from West Tenth
                    Street to Canal Street, and from Jay Street to Warren Street, and the work is
                    going on at other points. The allotment of wharfs and places in the harbour to
                    vessels is not done by the dock or any other city department, but by the captain
                    of the port and eleven harbour masters, all of whom are nominated by the
                    governor of the State and confirmed by the State senate. The captain of the port
                    holds office for three years, and the harbour masters for two years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ferries.—</hi> As New York is on all sides surrounded by water,
                    ferryboats form the principal means of communication between it and the opposite
                    shores. The water-courses of its northern boundary— Harlem River and Spuyten Duy
                    vel Creek—are narrow enough to be bridged; but, until the opening of the
                    Brooklyn Bridge, steam ferry-boats supplied the only means of communication with
                    New Jersey and Long and Staten . Islands. These boats are arranged with cabins
                    for passengers on both sides, and a roadway for horses, waggons, cattle,
                    &amp;c., in the middle. They are worked by the railroad companies and other
                    private corporations. The principal ferries to New Jersey, running from the
                    Hudson Riverside, have their piers at the foot of the following streets
                    :—Liberty, Cortlandt, Barclay, Chambers, Desbrosses, Christopher, Twenty-Third,
                    and Forty-Second.. The principal ferries to Brooklyn, running from the East
                    River side, have their piers at the foot of the following streets :— Whitehall
                    (2), Wall, Fulton, Catharine, Roosevelt, Grand, and Houston. There are also two
                    ferry lines to Staten Island, four to Long Island City, one to Astoria, L. I.,
                    one to Blackwell’s Island, two to Greenpoint, L.I., and one to Governor’s
                    Island. The Brooklyn ferry-boats leave their piers every ten minutes (and those
                    from Fulton Street every five minutes) during the business hours, lessening
                    their trips afterwards to one every fifteen or twenty minutes. On the New Jersey
                    side they run at intervals of from ten to thirty minutes. During certain of the
                    busiest hours of the morning and evening the fare for each foot passenger on the
                    leading Brooklyn ferries is 1 cent; during the rest of the day it is 2 cents. On
                    the New Jersey ferries it is uniformly 3 cents.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Conveyances.—</hi> The rapid growth of the city in a long line
                    to the northward has naturally led to great difficulties of transportation. The
                    old omnibuses began to be supplemented in 1834 on all the leading longitudinal
                    lines of thoroughfare by tramway cars drawn by two horses, but, though running
                    in the most frequented routes at intervals of a minute, they became long ago
                    unequal to the demands on them. As the dwelling houses became farther and
                    farther separated from the business part of the city, the discomfort and delay
                    of this mode of travel, especially in winter weather, grew very serious, and
                    caused a considerable migration to Jersey City and Brooklyn of persons who would
                    have remained on Manhattan Island but for the difficulty of getting to and fro.
                    After a long period of clamorous discontent, the remedy was applied in 1878 by
                    the construction of what is known as the Elevated Railroad, worked by steam
                    locomotives on raised iron trestle work in four of the avenues, the Ninth,
                    Sixth, Third, and Second, and running from the Battery to the Harlem River every
                    three to four minutes, 10 cents being the ordinary fare for the entire distance
                    of 10 miles, but with “commission” trains at 5 cents between certain hours of
                    the morning and evening, for the accommodation of the working classes, the fare
                    in these having been fixed by the State commission which settled the conditions
                    of the charters. The result has been a very rapid increase of population in the
                    upper end of the island.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Works.—</hi> There are but few public buildings of much
                    architectural pretension. The principal are the city-hall, the general
                    post-office, the custom-house, the barge office at the Battery for the
                    accommodation of passengers landing from steamships, the new produce exchange,
                    and the Roman Catholic cathedral in Fifth Avenue. The two great public works of
                    the city are the Croton aqueduct and the suspension bridge, spanning the East
                    River, connecting New York with Brooklyn. The former, which carries the water
                    supply of the city over 40 miles from the Croton Lake in Westchester county, has
                    a capacity of 115,000,000 gallons daily, and is now delivering 90,000,000
                    gallons daily. It has for forty years supplied the inhabitants with water with a
                    profusion never seen elsewhere in the modern world, and with little or no
                    restriction on its use. Of late the supply has begun to be inadequate, and
                    provision has (1883) been made by the legislature for the construction of an
                    additional reservoir and aqueduct.</p>
                <p>The Brooklyn Bridge connecting New York with Brooklyn across the East River is
                    much the largest suspension bridge yet constructed, measuring 5989 feet in
                    length, while that at Kieff, the next largest, only measures 2562. The work on
                    it began in 1870, and it was opened for traffic on May 24, 1883. The bridge
                    consists of a central span 1595⅜ feet in length from tower to tower, two spans
                    of 930 feet each from the towers to the anchorage on either side, and the
                    approaches of ironwork and masonry, the one on the New York side being 1562f
                    feet, and that on the Brooklyn side 971 feet in length. The towers, between
                    which the central span extends, are 276⅜ feet above high water, and rest upon a
                    rock foundation 80 feet below the surface of the river and 40 feet below its
                    bed. The cables, four in number, supporting the spans, are 15f inches in
                    diameter, and 3757⅜ feet in length. They rest on movable “saddles” where they
                    pass over the towers, exerting here a vertical pressure only, the stress (or
                    lengthwise pull) being sustained wholly at the anchorages, masses of solid stone
                    masonry weighing 60,000 tons each, and rising 90 feet above the river’s edge.
                    Each cable contains 5282 galvanized steel wires in nineteen separate strands,
                    consisting of 278 lengths, each strand having over 200 miles of continuous wire.
                    The wires are laid parallel (not twisted), and packed as closely as possible,
                    the greatest care being necessary to secure perfect evenness of length, and are
                    covered with an outside spiral wrapping of wire. The deflexion of the cables
                    between the towers is 128 feet; the clear height of the bridge above high water
                    is 135 feet in the centre and 118 feet at the towers, giving a free passage to
                    shipping. The width of the bridge is 85 feet, divided between five passage ways.
                    In the centre is a footway 15⅛ feet wide and raised 12 feet above the other
                    passages, giving an open view on both sides; next this on each side are tracks
                    for cars, worked by cables from a stationary engine at the Brooklyn terminus;
                    and outside of these are waggon ways 19 feet wide. The entire cost of the
                    bridge, $15,500,000, was borne by the cities of New York and Brooklyn, the
                    latter paying two-thirds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hudson River Tunnel.—</hi> The width of the Hudson River along
                    the city’s front is so great that no engineer has yet proposed to bridge it
                    there; but an engineering feat almost as difficult is now in progress. This is
                    the excavation of a tunnel beneath the bed of the river large enough to permit
                    the running of steam trains in it. The work is in the hands of private
                    capitalists. The entrance of the tunnel in New York is at the foot of Morton
                    Street; in Jersey City it is at the foot of Fifteenth Street, near the Hoboken
                    line. Work was begun at the New Jersey entrance in 1874, and at New York
                    entrance several years later. There are in fact to be two tunnels, about 25 feet
                    apart, with connexions every 1000 feet. This mode of construction is easier than
                    to make one tunnel of double width. The river from bulkhead to bulkhead at this
                    point measures 5400 feet in width, and each entrance is about 60 feet back from
                    the bulkhead. The tunnels will measure, inside, 17 feet <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0505-0466"/> in width and 17 feet in height. From Jersey City
                    one tunnel had been, in August 1882, completed a distance of 1600 feet, and the
                    other a distance of 640 feet; from New York 170 feet of one tunnel only is
                    completed. Unfinished work has been pushed a considerable distance farther on
                    each side. The material through which the tunnel is cut has made its
                    construction very difficult—on the New Jersey side silt, and on the New York
                    side a light sandy soil, through both of which the overlying water percolates
                    freely, and it was necessary to keep this water out of the excavated sections as
                    the work proceeded. The plan adopted consisted of the sinking, at each mouth, of
                    a heavy caisson of timber to the required depth. In the river side of this, when
                    it was completed, a hole was cut corresponding with the mouth of the tunnel. The
                    caisson was air-tight, and into it the air was pumped until it reached a density
                    sufficient to prevent the entrance of the water. As soon as a short section is
                    excavated it is lined with iron plates firmly braced. The interior of the tunnel
                    will therefore consist of an outer lining of iron, and an inner lining of bricks
                    laid in mortar. Whenever one section is completed an iron bulkhead is moved to
                    its further end, and a new air-tight chamber is formed beyond the bulkhead. The
                    company has met with financial embarrassments, and the work has meanwhile been
                    suspended.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parks, Museums, and Galleries.—</hi> The city is well supplied
                    with parks and public gardens. There are in all thirty of these, including small
                    open squares. The principal are the Battery, at the southernmost point of
                    Manhattan Island, containing 21 acres; the City-Hall Park, containing 6;
                    Washington Square, 8; Union Square, 3|; Tompkins Square, loj; Madison Square,
                    6⅜; Reservoir Square, 4∣; Mount Morris Square, 20. The chief is, however, the
                    Central Park, lying nearly in the centre of the island, and containing 843
                    acres; it is 2⅜ miles long by half a mile wide. It was laid out in 1858, and is
                    considered a masterpiece of landscape gardening. It contains the building of the
                    Metropolitan Museum of Art, immediately in front of which stands the obelisk
                    brought in 1880 from Alexandria. Outside the Central Park, but within Manhattan
                    Square, a small addition recently made to it on the west side, stands also the
                    American Museum of Natural History, which, like the Museum of Art, is the
                    property of a private corporation.</p>
                <p>The National Academy of Design, situated at Fourth Avenue and Twenty-Third
                    Street, has a frontage of 80 feet and a depth of 98 feet 9 inches. The exterior
                    is Venetian; the material used is grey and white marble and blue stone. The
                    first and second stories contain offices, lecture-rooms, and rooms for art
                    schools. On the third are large exhibition rooms, lighted from above. Every year
                    one exhibition of oil paintings and one of water colours are given, and in later
                    years supplementary exhibitions have been added. The art schools are free, and
                    are open to both sexes.</p>
                <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art was chartered by the legislature in 1870. It is
                    managed by a board of officers, comprising the comptroller of the city, the
                    president of the department of public parks, the president of the National
                    Academy of Design, and certain private citizens who are members of its
                    corporation. The museum building, opened in 1880, was erected by the park
                    department, at a cost of about $500,000, and is situated in the Central Park,
                    near Fifth Avenue and Eighty-Tbird Street. It measures 218 by 95 feet. The
                    material is red brick with sandstone trimmings. Among its valuable possessions
                    are the Blodgett collection of pictures, the Cesnola collection of articles
                    taken from the Cypriote cities and tombs, two paintings by Rubens, two by Van
                    Dyck, and many other works of eminent masters. The museum is open to the public
                    free, on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. On the other days an
                    admission fee of 25 cents is charged.</p>
                <p>The American Museum of Natural History was incorporated by the legislature in
                    1869, and its present building was opened in 1877. It is situated in Manhattan
                    Square. The exterior is of red brick with yellow sandstone trimmings. It is four
                    stories high, and each of its halls measures 170 feet in length by 60 in width.
                    It is governed by a board of twenty-five trustees. The building was erected by
                    the park department, which has charge of it and the surrounding grounds. It is
                    open free. Among its possessions are the Veneaux collection of natural history
                    specimens, the museum of Prince Maximilian of Neuwied, the Elliot collection of
                    the birds of North America, the Jay collection of shells, the James Hall
                    collection of geological specimens of New York State, the Bement specimens of
                    the Stone Age of Denmark, the De Morgan collection of stope implements from the
                    valley of the Somme in France, and the Squire and Davis collection from the
                    Mississippi valley.</p>
                <p>The Cooper Institute, or “Union for the Advancement of Science and Art,” occupies
                    a huge brown stone building at the junction of Third and Fourth Avenues, the
                    gift of Peter Cooper, who erected it in 1857 at a cost of over $600,000, and
                    further endowed the union with $200,000 for the support of a library,
                    reading-room, and schools of science and art, all of which are free, and are
                    largely attended by .young men and young women of the working classes. Its
                    evening schools are attended by over 3000 students annually, and in the women’s
                    art school instruction is given gratuitously to 350 pupils yearly. The library
                    contains 15,000 volumes, a notable feature being a complete and fully indexed
                    set of the reports of the United States patent office. The reading-room is
                    supplied with about 300 periodicals and newspapers, and is frequented daily by
                    over 2500 readers. No one instrumentality is doing more than the Cooper Union
                    for the instruction of the working classes in the city.</p>
