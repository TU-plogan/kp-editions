                <p><label type="entry">NUBIA</label>, a country of north-east Africa, bounded on the
                    N. by Egypt, on the S. by Abyssinia, Senaar, and Kordofan, and on the E. and W.
                    by the Red Sea and the Libyan Desert respectively. It thus comprises the whole
                    of the Nile valley, from Assuan (Oswân, Syene) near the first cataract
                    southwards to Khartüm (Khartoum) at the confluence of the White and the Blue
                    Niles, stretching in this direction for about 560 miles between 16° and 24° N.
                    lat., and for nearly the same distance east and west between 31° and 39° E.
                    long. But Nubia has at no time formed a strictly political, ethnical, or even
                    administrative expression. Unless it can be identified with the Nob or Nub— that
                    is, “Gold ”—region of the hieroglyphic records, the term was unknown to the
                    ancients, by whom everything south of Egypt was vaguely called Ethiopia, the
                    land of the dark races. It is first associated historically, not with any
                    definite geographical region, but with the Nobatae, a negro people removed by
                    Diocletian from the western oasis to the Nile valley above Egypt
                    (Dodecaschoenus), whence the turbulent Blemmyes had recently been driven
                    eastwards. From Nùba, the Arabic form of the name of this people, comes the
                    modern Nubia, a term about the precise meaning of which no two writers are of
                    accord. Locally it is restricted to a comparatively small district, the Wâdy
                    al-Nùba, reaching from Sebιi <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> along the Nile
                    southwards to the north frontier of Dongola. Officially it finds no recognition
                    as an administrative division of the khedive’s possessions, the region commonly
                    understood by Nubia, as above roughly defined, being completely absorbed for
                    administrative purposes, partly in the government of Upper Egypt, but mainly in
                    that of Egyptian or Eastern Südan (Soudan).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Behm in <hi rend="italic">Bevölkerung der Erde</hi> for
                    July 1882.</p></note> Within these two governments it comprises the whole of the
                    four mudiriehs (provinces) of Berber, Tâkà, Dongola (Donkola), and Suâkin (more
                    correctly Sawâkin), besides parts of Massowah, Khartüm, and Esneh (Upper Egypt),
                    with a total area of about 345,000 square miles, and a population vaguely
                    estimated (1878, 1882) at from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000.</p>
                <p>But, apart from political and ethnical considerations, Nubia is physically a
                    sufficiently intelligible expression. Merging westwards in the sands of the
                    Libyan desert, and limited eastwards by the Red Sea, it comprises the whole of
                    the rugged and mainly arid steppes and plateaus through which the united White
                    and Blue Niles, after their junction at Khartüm, force their way down to Upper
                    Egypt. In this section, which may be regarded as the upper course of the Nile
                    proper, there occurs a continuous series of slight falls and rapids, including
                    all the historical “six cataracts,” beginning a few miles below Khartüm (the
                    sixth at J. Garri), and terminating at Philae, close to the Egyptian frontier.
                    Between these extreme points the total fall in a distance of 1150 miles is about
                    760 feet (from 1160 feet above sea-level at Khartüm to 400 at Philae). Here the
                    river describes two great bends, the first, from Khartüm to Merawi (Napata)
                    below the fourth cataract, comprising the Bahiüda desert on the west, the
                    second, thence to Egypt, comprising the Nubian desert on the east,-—the two
                    roughly corresponding to the conventional divisions of Upper and Lower Nubia
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole of this section the Nile receives no affluents on its left
                    bank, and on its right one only, the Atbara, which joins it from Abyssinia just
                    above Al-Meshérif (Berber). Hence all Nubia west of the Nile, and most of the
                    region east of the Nile—that is, from the Atbara confluence to Egypt—are mainly
                    arid wastes, rocky in the east, sandy in the west, relieved on both sides by
                    some grassy steppe lands, and by a few small oases. Of the Nubian, which is
                    sometimes called the Korosko, desert, and the northern section of which is named
                    from its nomad Bïshâri inhabitants, the prevailing features are bare or scrubby
                    sandstone plains broken by moderately high rugged granite hills and ranges, such
                    as the J. Jerfa, J. Elbe', J. Kawewad, and J. Shikr, and intersected in many
                    places by numerous small “khôrs” or wadies running in various directions across
                    the plateau. The wells and oases occurring along these depressions afford the
                    only means of communication across this region, as well as in the more sandy
                    Bahiüda wilderness on the opposite side of the Nile. Thus are formed all the
                    great caravan routes, of which the most important are—(1) from Derr and Korosko
                    across the Ababdeh country by the Hurat wells southwards to Abu Hâmid, 230
                    miles, shorter by about one-third than the long and difficult water journey
                    between these two points; (2) from Ambukül to Khartüm, which describes an arc of
                    200 miles to the southern curve enclosing the Bahiüda desert; (3) from Berber
                    eastwards to the Red Sea at Suâkin, 280 miles, difficult, with little fodder and
                    rare <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n668/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0668-0611"/> wells, but of vital strategic and commercial
                    importance as affording the most direct access from the coast to the interior,
                    and the shortest highway from the Nile to Suâkin, the only outport of Nubia; (4)
                    a better but much longer route from Tokar below Suâkin by the Khôr Barka
                    southwards to Kassala on the Mareb, a tributary of the Atbara, and thence
                    through the Shukurieh country westwards to Khartum. This route, which has been
                    recently explored by G. Casati,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Esploratore</hi> for August 1883, and <hi

                    traverses the province of Tâkâ, the most fertile and productive region in the
                    whole of Nubia. Tâkâ, being well watered by the Atbara, Mareb, and other streams
                    from Abyssinia, is a true African tropical land, covered in some places with
                    dense forest, in others with extensive pastures and arable tracts. Hence this
                    route has lately been proposed in preference to that from Suâkin to Berber for
                    the projected line of railway from the coast to the interior.</p>
                <p>Besides Tâkâ the only other fertile and permanently inhabitable region is the
                    valley of the Nile itself. But this valley, expanding above Khartιim into open
                    alluvial plains, is in Nubia proper confined mainly to very narrow limits, with
                    a mean breadth of scarcely more than half a mile (Burckhardt). The river is here
                    almost everywhere hemmed in between granite and sandstone hills, which approach
                    at some points to the very banks, at others run transversely to it, thus giving
                    rise to the continuous windings and rapids which characterize its course
                    throughout Nubia. Nor does the Nile now flood its banks to the same extent as
                    formerly in this region, as appears from the “nilometer” discovered by Lepsius.
                    But it is a mistake to suppose, as is often stated, that no rising takes
                    place.</p>
                <p>In Tâkâ much humus and alluvial soil overlie the older crystalline beds and later
                    sedimentary rocks. Elsewhere throughout Nubia these rocks are now mostly
                    denuded, and consist mainly of new sandstones, with large masses of granite,
                    porphyry, and trachyte cropping out in many places. The extensive syenite range
                    on the Egyptian frontier is pierced for 80 miles by the Nile, and runs thence
                    interspersed with sandstones eastwards to the Red Sea, where it forms the bold
                    headland of Ras Benâs, projecting round the Gulf of Berenice. Westwards the same
                    system develops the J. Kukur, beyond which it extends to about 25° E. long, in
                    the direction of the Libyan desert. Higher up, at the second or “Great” cataract
                    of Wâdy Halfâ, the sandstone is broken through by huge masses of granite and
                    diorite rising 500 feet above the river-bed. Still farther south sandstones also
                    prevail throughout Dongola, where the Nile presents the aspect of a mountain
                    stream rushing for 250 miles over rapids. At Batn-al-Hajar the granite hills
                    attain an altitude of 2000 feet above the river, and in this district the
                    sandstone mostly disappears under the eruptive basalts, trachytes, diorites,
                    phonoliths, and large beds of shale.</p>
                <p>None of the porphyries appear to be metalliferous, and the only gold mines
                    hitherto discovered are those in the east about Mount Elbe', which were worked
                    by the ancient Egyptians, and even during mediaeval times, but which are now
                    abandoned, although apparently not yet quite exhausted (Linant de Bellefonds).
                    This auriferous district of Nob or Nub, which according to some authorities has
                    given its name to the whole country, lies close to the Red Sea in 22° N., nearly
                    opposite Jidda. The only other minerals of economic importance are salt and
                    alum, occurring at various points on the plateaus. The granites and syenites
                    afford magnificent building materials, largely utilized by the ancient
                    Egyptians.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the land lies almost within the rainless zone, for the
                    tropical rains are now arrested about the latitude of Khartum (Petherick),
                    beyond which point very little moisture is precipitated in any part of the Nile
                    basin. Hence the Nubian climate, while intensely hot (108° to 114 Fahr, in the
                    shade in May on the eastern plateau) is excessively dry and not unhealthy. The
                    plague, formerly endemic in Egypt, never originates in Nubia; nor does the
                    cholera penetrate up the Nile valley beyond Wâdy Halfâ. North of this point,
                    however, the riverain parts are often rendered dangerous, especially to
                    strangers, by the exhalations from the stagnant pools left after the subsidence
                    of the Nile waters. It is noteworthy that here the right bank being periodically
                    flooded is much more fertile than the left, although all the finest ruins lie on
                    the left side. The contrast is probably due to the Libyan sands continually
                    moving eastward and encroaching on the narrow arable zone along the great
                    artery.</p>
                <p>Except in Taka, the natural flora is very poor, all the arable districts being
                    required for the cultivation of useful plants. Amongst these the most important
                    are the dom palm, durra <hi rend="italic">{Sorghum vulgare),</hi> of which
                    several varieties have the stalk from 7 to 10 feet high, maize, dokhn (panicum),
                    barley, lentils, tobacco, beans, and melons. Cotton and the vine flourish in
                    several places, and the dates of Ibrym and Sokkot are much prized. The banks of
                    the Nile are often fringed with the mimosa; senna abounds in moist, the tamarind
                    in sandy places; several varieties of gum trees occur in the south, and symka is
                    common, its seed yielding oil, its leaves good camel fodder.</p>
                <p>Wild animals are rare except in the Taka forests, where the elephant, lion,
                    panther, rhinoceros, giraffe, hyaena, and wild boar are met with. The crocodile
                    and hippopotamus infest all the streams; many species of large and small snakes
                    occur, but few are poisonous; the stork, wild goose, partridge, ibis, are
                    amongst the chief representatives of the local avifauna. There is a good breed
                    of horses; the camel and ass are used as mounts, the ox and buffalo (not
                    numerous) as pack animals and in irrigation, of which there are two methods (as
                    in Egypt),—the sakiya, worked by oxen and liable to a tax of £3, and the shâdùf,
                    a hand lever and bucket, rated at 30s. (Petherick).</p>
                <p>The population being almost exclusively agricultural and pastoral, the industries
                    are unimportant, and limited mainly to coarse cottons and woollens, pottery, and
                    household utensils made of the date tree. The exports also are confined to
                    senna, some grain, leeches, musk, and honey. But although the local traffic is
                    small there is a very large transit trade, carried on chiefly by caravans
                    between Central Africa and Egypt. In this way considerable quantities of ivory,
                    gold dust, ostrich feathers, and slaves have from the remotest times been
                    brought down from the interior through Nubia to the seaports on the
                    Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Of late years the slave trade had been almost
                    entirely suppressed.</p>
                <p>Few ethnological questions are beset with greater difficulties than those
                    connected with the origin and affinities of the Nubian race; and, although much
                    light has recently been thrown on the subject by Lepsius in the learned
                    introduction to his <hi rend="italic">Kubische Grammatik,</hi> there are several
                    points which still remain matter of conjecture. As an ethnical expression the
                    term Nuba or Nubian itself has become equivocal. Rejected by the presumable
                    descendants of Diocletian’s Nobatae, who now call themselves Berber, Barabiiâ,
                    it has become synonymous in the Nile valley with “slave,” or “Negro slave.” This
                    is due to the large number of slaves drawn by the Arab dealers in recent times
                    from the Nιiba tribes of Kordofan, who appear to constitute the original stock
                    of the race. On the other hand, the expression has never at any time been
                    applied to all the inhabitants of the region we now call Nubia. At present this
                    region is occupied by peoples of three distinct stocks—the comparatively recent
                    Semitic Arab intruders, mainly in Upper Nubia; the Hamitic Ababdeh and Beja
                    (Bishârin), everywhere between the Nile and the Red Sea; and the Negro or
                    Negroid Nùbas (Barâbira), in Lower Nubia, where they are now almost exclusively
                    confined to the banks of the Nile, from Assuan southwards to Dongola.</p>
                <p>That these Nilotic Nùbas are closely allied to those of Kordofan may now be
                    regarded as placed beyond reasonable doubt. And, as the latter are admittedly of
                    Negro stock and speech, it follows that the former also, hitherto affiliated by
                    some to the Fulahs of west Sudan, by others to the Hamitic Beja, must henceforth
                    be regarded as essentially a Negro people. But, whereas the Kordofan Nubas have
                    preserved their racial purity, those of the Nile, while preserving their Negro
                    speech intact, have in their new homes become physically modified, mainly by the
                    admixture first of Hamitic (Beja), then of Semitic (Arab), and even of European
                    blood. Ethnologically the modern Nubians are therefore to be considered as a
                    very mixed people, forming the transition between the three great Hamitic,
                    Semitic, and Negro branches of the human family who converge in the Nile basin.
                    Their ultimate affiliation to the last-named rather <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n669/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0669-0612"/> than to either of the two others is determined
                    partly by their physical appearance, which is still fundamentally of a Negro
                    type, and partly by their language, which differs dialectically only from the
                    Negro speech of the Kordofan Nubas.</p>
                <p>This conclusion, based on physical and linguistic grounds, is fully confirmed by
                    what is known of the earliest migrations and history of the Nilotic peoples. The
                    first inhabitants of the region beyond Egypt appear to have been the Uaua, whose
                    name occurs in an inscription on a tomb at Memphis of the VIth Dynasty (about
                    2500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and again constantly in subsequent
                    inscriptions down to the time of the Ptolemies, as the leading Negro race to the
                    south of Syene. It thus appears that throughout the historic period down to the
                    arrival of the Bomans the Nile above Egypt was occupied by a Negro people.
                    Egyptian monuments are found as far south as Mount Bai kal (Napata), but no
                    Egyptian settlements beyond Syene. Hence these Uaua Negroes probably remained
                    unaffected, or very slightly affected, by foreign elements until about the 3d
                    century of our era, when their domain began to be encroached upon from the east
                    by the Hamitic Blemmyes, who have been clearly identified with the present Beja
                    or Bishàrfn of the Nubian desert. It was owing to the incessant raids of these
                    troublesome marauders that Diocletian withdrew the Roman garrisons above the
                    cataracts, and called in the warlike Nobatae to protect the Egyptian frontier
                    from their attacks. These Negro Nobatae, originally from Kordofan, as is now
                    evident, had advanced to the Great Oasis of Khargeh in Upper Egypt, whence they
                    passed into the Nile valley between the cataracts. Here they absorbed the older
                    Uaua of kindred stock, and ultimately came to terms with the Blemmyes. The two
                    races even became intermingled, and, making common cause against the Romans,
                    were defeated by Maximinus in 451 (Priscus). Thus were the Nilotic Nιibas in the
                    first instance affected by Hamitic elements.</p>
                <p>Then came the conversion (545) of this new Negroid race to Christianity, and the
                    growth of the Nubian political power in the upper Nile basin. Silko, founder of
                    the famous Christian kingdom of Dongola, so named from its capital, called
                    himself king of the Nobads and of all Ethiopians, that is, of the Nilotic Nùbas
                    and Hamitic Blemmyes. But the latter remaining pagan were soon after driven from
                    the Nile valley eastwards to the kindred Megabares, Memnons, and other Hamitic
                    nomads, who, with the Troglodytes, had from time immemorial held the whole
                    steppe region between the Nile and the Red Sea from Axum to Egypt. Here their
                    most collective name was Bugaitae (Βουγαειταί), as appears from the Axumite
                    inscription, whence the forms Buja, Beja, which occur in the oldest Arab
                    records, and by which they are still known.</p>
                <p>Soon after overrunning Egypt (639) the Arabs themselves penetrated into Lower
                    Nubia, where the two Jawabareh and Al-Gharbfya tribes became powerful, and
                    amalgamated with the Nubas of that district. But their further progress was long
                    arrested by the Dongolawi kings, who even reduced them for a short time. At
                    length, however, after flourishing for 700 years, this native Christian state
                    was in the 14th century overthrown by the Arabs, aided by a detachment of
                    Bosnians sent from Turkey by Sultan Selim (Burckhardt). These Bosnians (Kalaji,
                    as they called themselves) also settled in the country and intermarried with the
                    Arabs and Nubians, their descendants still holding sundry tracts between Assuan
                    and Derr. Hence it is that the Nubians of this district, fairest of all the
                    race, still claim Arab and 0smanli (Bosnian) descent. And thus were the Nilotic
                    Nιibas affected in the second instance by Semitic and European elements.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless the type remains essentially Negro, being characterized by a very
                    dark complexion, varying from a mahogany brown and deep bronze to an almost
                    black shade, with tumid lips, large black animated eyes, dolichocephalous head
                    (index Nos. 73, 72), hair often woolly or strongly frizzled, and scant beard
                    worn under the chin like the figures of the fugitives (Uaua ?) in the
                    battlepieces sculptured on the walls of the Egyptian temples. At the same time,
                    the nose is much larger and the zygomatic arches less prominent than in the
                    full-blood Negro. The features are at times almost quite regular, with a
                    decidedly Egyptian cast (Lepsins); and the Nilotic Nubians are on the whole a
                    strong muscular people, essentially agricultural, more warlike and energetic
                    than the Egyptians, whom they also greatly excel in moral qualities. Many find
                    employment as artisans, small dealers, porters, and soldiers in Egypt, where
                    they are usually noted for their honesty, and frank and cheerful temperament.
                    Since the overthrow of the native Christian state all have become Mohammedans,
                    but not of a fanatical type. Although a native of Dongola, the present (1884)
                    Mahdi has found his chief support, not amongst his countrymen, but amongst the
                    more recently converted Kordofan Negroes and the nomad Arabs and Beja. Nor do
                    they appear at any time to have displayed a love of letters, and it remains
                    uncertain whether to the Nubians or to their Hamitic neighbours are to be
                    attributed the numerous still undeciphered rock inscriptions occurring along the
                    Nile valley from Philae to Khartum. On the other hand, the colossal ruins
                    reaching as far south as Meroe date almost exclusively from the Egyptian
                    period.</p>
                <p>The Nuba language itself does not appear to have ever been cultivated, or even
                    committed to writing until recently, although Eutychius of Alexandria (930)
                    includes the “Nubi” among the six kinds of writing which he mentions in a
                    somewhat doubtful passage as current amongst the Hamitic peoples. There is no
                    present native literature, and most of the men speak Arabic as well as their
                    mother tongue, which is very sonorous and expressive. Its distinctly Negro
                    character is betrayed in the complete absence of grammatical gender, in its
                    primitive vowel-system and highly-developed process of consonantal assimilation,
                    softening all harsh combinations, lastly, in the peculiar infix <hi
                    rend="italic">j</hi> inserted between the verbal root and the plural pronominal
                    object, as in <hi rend="italic">ai</hi><hi rend="italic">tokki-j-ir —</hi> I
                    shake them. As in Bantu, the verb presents a multiplicity of forms, including
                    one present, three past and future tenses, with personal endings complete,
                    passive, interrogative, conditional, elective, negative, and other forms, each
                    with its proper participial inflexions. In Lepsius’s grammar the verbal paradigm
                    fills altogether 110 pages.</p>
                <p>Of the Nilotic as distinguished from the Kordofan branch of the Nιiba language
                    there are three distinct dialects current from Assuan along the Nile southwards
                    to Meroe, as under :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nor thern</hi>: Dialect of <hi rend="italic">Bani
                    Kenz</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mattokki,</hi> from the first cataract to Sebrι'
                    and Wady al-'Arab, probably dating from the Diocletian period.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Central</hi>: The <hi rend="italic">Mahai</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Marist,</hi> from Korosko to Wady Haifa (second cataract). Here
                    the natives are called Saidokki, in contradistinction to the northern
                    Mattokki.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Southern:</hi><hi rend="italic">Dongolaτvi,</hi>
                    throughout the province of Dongola from the second cataract to J. Déjà near
                    Meroe, on the northern frontier of the Arab district of Dâr-Shâikiya (Sheghya).
                    By the Mahasi people it is called Biderin Banuid, “language of the poor,” or,
                    collectively with the Kenz, Oshkirin Bannid, * ‘ language of slaves.”</p>
                <p>The northern and southern varieties are closely related to each other, differing
                    considerably from the central, which shows more marked affinities with the
                    Kordofan Nuba, possibly because the Saidokki people are later arrivals from
                    Kordofan.</p>
