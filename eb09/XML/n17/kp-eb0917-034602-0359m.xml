                    youngest child of Francesco Neri, a lawyer of that city, and his wife Lucrezia
                    Soldi, a woman of higher birth than her husband, and descended from a family
                    whose members had held important public offices in the time of the republic.
                    They were both devout persons, and Francesco was accustomed to intercourse with
                    the monastic bodies in Florence, notably with the Dominicans. The child was
                    carefully brought up, and displayed from infancy a winning, gentle, intelligent,
                    playful, and yet obedient disposition, which earned him the title of the “good
                    Pippo” <hi rend="italic">(bon Pippo')</hi> amongst his young companions. He
                    received almost his earliest teachings from the friars at San Marco, the famous
                    Dominican monastery in Florence, and was accustomed in after life to ascribe
                    most of his progress to the teaching of two amongst them, Zenobio de’ Medici and
                    Servanzio Mini. When he was about sixteen years old, a fire destroyed nearly all
                    his father’s property, and it became therefore expedient to seek some means of
                    recruiting the family fortunes. His father’s brother Romolo, a merchant at San
                    Germano, a Neapolitan town in the Terra di Lavoro, near the base of Monte
                    Cassino, was wealthy and childless, and to him Philip was sent in 1531, to
                    assist him in his business, and with the hope that he might inherit his
                    possessions. So far as gaining Romolo’s confidence and affection, the plan was
                    entirely successful, but it was thwarted by Philip’s own resolve to adopt the
                    ecclesiastical calling, a determination at which he arrived in the course of
                    frequent visits to a solitary chapel on a rock overlooking the Bay of Gaeta. In
                    1533 he left San Germano, and betook himself to Rome, where he found shelter,
                    food, and protection in the house of a Florentine gentleman named Galeotto
                    Caccia, to whose two children he became tutor, continuing in that post for
                    several years, and pursuing his own studies independently, while also practising
                    habitual austerities, and beginning those labours amongst the sick and poor
                    which gained him in later life the title of “Apostle of Rome,” besides paying
                    nightly visits for prayer and meditations to the basilican churches of the city,
                    and to the catacombs. In 1538 he entered on that course of home mission work
                    which was the distinguishing characteristic of his life, and which bears in much
                    of its method a curious resemblance to the manner in which Socrates was
                    accustomed to set the Athenians thinking, in that he traversed the city, seizing
                    opportunities of entering into conversation with persons of all ranks, and of
                    leading them on, now with playful irony, now with searching questions, and again
                    with words of wise and kindly counsel, to consider the topics he desired to set
                    before them.</p>
                <p>In 1548 he founded the celebrated confraternity of the Santissima Trinità de’
                    Pellegrini e de’ Convalescente, whose primary object is to minister to the needs
                    of the thousands of poor pilgrims accustomed to flock to Rome, especially in
                    years of jubilee, and also to relieve the patients discharged from hospitals,
                    but still too weak for labour. In 1551 he passed through all the minor orders,
                    and was ordained deacon, and finally priest on May 23. He settled down, with
                    some companions, at the hospital of San Girolamo della Carità, and while there
                    tentatively began, in 1556, the institute with which his name is more especially
                    connected, that of the Oratory, after a plan he had formed of proceeding as a
                    missionary to India was abandoned at the instance of shrewd advisers, who saw
                    that there was abundant work to be done in Rome, and that he was the man to do
                    it. The scheme of the Oratory at first was no more than a series of evening
                    meetings in his own room, at which there were prayers, hymns, readings from
                    Scripture, from the fathers, and from the <hi rend="italic">Martyrology,</hi>
                    followed by a lecture, or by discussion of some religious question proposed for
                    consideration. It afterwards was developed further, and the members of the
                    society were employed in various kinds of mission work throughout Rome, notably
                    in preaching sermons in different churches every evening, a wholly novel agency
                    at that time. In 1564 the Florentines, who regarded themselves as having a
                    special claim upon him as their fellow-citizen, requested him to leave San
                    Girolamo, and to take the oversight of their peculiar church in Rome, San
                    Giovanni dei Fiorentini, then newly built. He was at first reluctant, but the
                    pope (Pius IV.) was induced to enjoin him to accept, permitting him, however, to
                    retain the charge of San Girolamo, where the exercises of the Oratory were still
                    kept up. At this time the new society included amongst its members Caesar
                    Baronius the ecclesiastical historian, Tarrugi, afterwards archbishop of
                    Avignon, and Paravicini, all three subsequently cardinals, and also Gallonius,
                    author of a well-known work on the <hi rend="italic">Sufferings of the
                    Martyrs,</hi> Ancina, Bordoni, and other men of ability and distinction.</p>
                <p>The Florentines, however, built in 1574 a large oratory or mission-room for the
                    society contiguous to San Giovanni, in order to save them the fatigue of the
                    daily <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0360-0347"/> journey to and from San Girolamo, and to provide
                    a more convenient place of assembly, and the headquarters were transferred
                    thither. As the community grew, and its mission work extended, the need of
                    having a church entirely its own, and not subject to other claims, as were San
                    Girolamo and San Giovanni, made itself felt, and the offer of the small parish
                    church of Santa Maria in Vallicella, conveniently situated in the middle of
                    Rome, was made and accepted. The building, however, as not large enough for
                    their purpose, was pulled down, and a splendid church erected on the site. It
                    was immediately after taking possession of their new quarters that Filippo Neri
                    formally organized, under permission of a bull dated July 15, 1575, a community
                    of secular priests, entitled the Congregation of the Oratory. The new church was
                    consecrated early in 1577, and the clergy of the new society at once resigned
                    the charge of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, but Neri himself did not migrate from
                    San Girolamo till 1583, and then only in virtue of an injunction of the pope
                    that he, as the superior, should reside at the chief house of his congregation.
                    He was at first elected for a term of three years (as is usual in modern
                    societies), but in 1587 was nominated superior for life. He was, however,
                    entirely free from personal ambition, and had no desire to be general over a
                    number of dependent houses, so that he desired that all congregations formed on
                    his model outside Rome should be autonomous, governing themselves, and without
                    endeavouring to retain control over any new colonies they might themselves send
                    out,—a regulation afterwards formally confirmed by a brief of Gregory XV. in
                    1622. Much as he mingled with society, and with persons of importance in church
                    and state, his single interference in political matters was in 1593, when his
                    persuasions induced the pope, Clement VIII., to withdraw the excommunication and
                    anathema of Henry IV. of France, and the refusal to receive his ambassador, even
                    though the king had formally abjured Calvinism. Neri saw that the pope’s
                    attitude was more than likely to drive Henry to a relapse, and probably to
                    rekindle the civil war in France, and directed Baronius, then the pope’s
                    confessor, to refuse him absolution, and to resign his office of confessor,
                    unless he would withdraw the anathema. Clement yielded at once, though the whole
                    college of cardinals had supported his policy; and Henry, who did not learn the
                    facts till several years afterwards, testified lively gratitude for the timely
                    and politic intervention. Neri continued in the government of the Oratory until
                    his death, which took place on May 26, 1595, in the eightieth year of his age.
                    There are many anecdotes told of him which attest his possession of a playful
                    humour, united with shrewd mother-wit, often urging him to acts with a ludicrous
                    aspect, but which were well calculated to serve his purpose of divesting
                    religion of the hyperprofessional garb it wore in his day, and bringing it
                    within the area of ordinary lay experience. This, rather than the atmosphere of
                    supernaturalism with which he is surrounded in the various biographies of him
                    which have appeared, and that to a much greater degree than is common in similar
                    writings, is the true key to his popularity, and to the fact that his name
                    figures often in the folk-lore of the Roman poor, whom he loved so well and
                    served so long. He was beatified by Paul V. in 1600, and canonized by Gregory
                    XV. in 1622.</p>
                <p>“Practical commonplaceness,” to cite the words of Frederick William Faber in his
                    panegyric of Philip Neri, was the special mark which distinguishes his form of
                    ascetic piety from the types accredited before his day. “He looked like other
                    men . . . . he was emphatically a modern gentleman, of scrupulous courtesy,
                    sportive gaiety, acquainted with what was going on in the world, taking a real
                    interest in it, giving and getting information, very neatly dressed, with a
                    shrewd common sense always alive about him, in a modern room with modern
                    furniture, plain, it is true, but with no marks of poverty about it,—in a word,
                    with all the ease, the gracefulness, the polish of a modern gentleman of good
                    birth, considerable accomplishments, and a very various information.”
                    Accordingly, he was ready to meet the needs of his day to an extent and in a
                    manner which even the versatile Jesuits, who much desired to enlist him iu their
                    company, did not rival; and, though an Italian priest and head of a new
                    religious order, his genius was entirely unmonastic and unmediaeval; he was the
                    active promoter of vernacular services, frequent and popular preaching,
                    unconventional prayer, and unsystematized, albeit fervent, private subjective
                    devotion.</p>
                <p>Philip Neri was not a reformer, save in the sense that in the active discharge of
                    pastoral work he laboured to reform individuals. He had no difficulties in
                    respect of the teaching and practice of his church, being in truth an ardent
                    Ultramontane in doctrine, as was all but inevitable in his time and
                    circumstances, and his great merit was the instinctive tact which showed him
                    that the system of monasticism could never be the leaven of secular life, but
                    that something more homely, simple, and everyday in character was needed for the
                    new time.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, the institute he founded is of the least conventional nature, rather
                    resembling a residential clerical club than a monastery of the older type, and
                    its rules would have appeared incredibly lax, nay, its religious character
                    almost doubtful, to a Bruno, a Stephen Harding, a Francis, or a Dominic. It
                    admits only priests aged at least thirty-six, or ecclesiastics who have
                    completed their studies, and are ready for ordination. The members live in
                    community, and each pays his own expenses, having the usufruct of his private
                    means,—a startling innovation on the monastic vow of poverty. They have indeed a
                    common table, but it is kept up precisely as a regimental mess, by monthly
                    payments from each member. Nothing is provided by the society except the bare
                    lodging, and the fees of a visiting physician. Everything else —clothing, books,
                    furniture, medicines—must be defrayed at the private charges of each member.
                    There are no vows, and every member of the society is at liberty to withdraw
                    when he pleases, and to take his property with him. The government, strikingly
                    unlike the Jesuit autocracy, is of a republican form; and the superior, though
                    first in honour, has to take his turn in discharging all the duties which come
                    to each priest of the society in the order of his seniority, including that of
                    waiting at table, which is not entrusted in the Oratory to lay brothers,
                    according to the practice in most other communities. Four deputies assist the
                    superior in the government, and all public acts are decided by a majority of
                    votes of the whole congregation, in which the superior has no casting voice. To
                    be chosen superior, fifteen years of membership are requisite as a
                    qualification, and the office is tenable, as all the others, for but three years
                    at a time. No one can vote till he has been three years in the society; the
                    deliberative voice is not obtained before the eleventh year. Each house can call
                    its superior to account, can depose, and can restore him, without appeal to any
                    external authority, although the bishop of the diocese in which any house of the
                    Oratory is established is its ordinary and immediate superior, though without
                    power to interfere with the rule. Their churches are non-parochial, and they can
                    perform such rites as baptisms, marriages, &amp;c., only by permission of the
                    parish priest, who is entitled to receive all fees due in respect of these
                    ministrations. The Oratory chiefly spread in Italy, but a branch established in
                    Paris by Cardinal de Bérulle in 1611 had a great success and a distinguished
                    history. It fell in the crash of the Revolution, but was revived by Père
                    Pététot, cure of St Roch, in 1852; while an English house, founded in 1847, is
                    celebrated as the place at which Cardinal Newman fixed his abode after his
                    submission to the Roman Catholic Church. The society has never thriven in
                    Germany, though a few houses have been founded there, in Munich and Vienna.</p>
