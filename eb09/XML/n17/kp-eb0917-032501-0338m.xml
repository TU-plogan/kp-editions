                    cylindrical in transverse section. Even the comparatively shortest species and
                    genera can always be termed elongate, the broadest and shortest of all being the
                    parasitic <hi rend="italic">Malacobdella</hi> and the pelagic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pelagonemertes.</hi> There are no exterior appendages of any kind. The colours
                    are often very bright and varied. They live in the sea, some being common
                    amongst the corals and algae, others hiding in the muddy or sandy bottom, and
                    secreting gelatinous tubes which ensheath the body along its whole length.
                    Formerly, they were generally arranged amongst the Platyelminthes as a suborder
                    in the order of the Turbellarians, to which the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhynchoccda</hi> was applied, the other suborders being the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dendrocoela</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rhabdoccda.</hi> With the advance of
                    our knowledge of these lower worms it has been found desirable to separate them
                    from the Turbellarians and to look upon the <hi rend="italic">Nemertea</hi> as a
                    separate phylum of Platyelminthes. Lately the interest in their morphology has
                    increased, since it has been advanced (6, 8)<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    without doubt the proboscis. With very few exceptions <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Malacobdella, Akrostomum,</hi> where it has fused with the mouth to a single

                    the proboscis is seen shooting backwards and forwards, sometimes with so much
                    force that both its interior attachments are severed and it is entirely expelled
                    from the body. It then often retains its vitality for a long time, apparently
                    crawling about as if it were itself a worm, a phenomenon which is at least
                    partially explained by the extraordinary development of nervous tissue, equally
                    distributed all through the walls of the proboscis, and either united (10) into
                    numerous longitudinal nerve-stems <hi rend="italic">(Drepanophorus,
                    Amphiporus)</hi> or spread out into a uniform and comparatively thick layer <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cerebratulus,</hi> sp.). This very effective and elaborate
                    innervation, which has been directly traced (6) to the brain, whence strong
                    nerves (generally two) enter the proboscis, renders it exceedingly probable that
                    the most important functions of the proboscis are of a sensi-ferous, tactile
                    nature, a supposition which is again strengthened by the fact that amongst the
                    Rhabdocoel Turbellarians an organ which may be called the forerunner of
                    theNemertean proboscis has been proved (3) to be the morphological equivalent of
                    the foremost tip of the body, which, as an organ of delicate touch, has acquired
                    the property of folding inwards. In Nemertines the everted proboscis is
                    retracted in the same way as the tip of a glove finger would be if it were
                    pulled backwards by a thread situated in the axis and attached to the tip. The
                    comparison may be carried still further. The central thread just alluded to is
                    represented in the Nemertean proboscis by that portion -which is never everted,
                    and the tip of the glove by the boundary between the evertible and non-evertible
                    portion of the proboscis—a boundary which in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hoplonemertini</hi> is marked by the presence of a pointed or serrated stylet.
                    This stylet is thus situated terminally when the proboscis has reached its
                    maximum eversion. It adds a decisively aggressive character to an organ the
                    original significance of which, as ∙we have seen, was tactile. This aggressive
                    character has a different aspect in several genera which are destitute of a
                    central stylet, but in which the surface that is turned outwards upon eversion
                    of the proboscis is largely provided with nematocysts, sending the urticating
                    rods of different sizes in all directions. In others this surface is beset with
                    thick, glandular, adhesive papillae.</p>
                <p>The comparison with the glove-finger is in so far insufficient as the greater
                    portion of the non-evertible half of the proboscis is also hollow and clothed by
                    glandular walls. Only at the very hindermost end does it pass into the so-oalled
                    retractor-muscle (fig. 2), which is attached to the wall of the space
                    (proboscidian sheath) in which the proboscis moves about. This retractor-muscle,
                    indeed, serves to pull back with great rapidity the extruded proboscis, and is
                    aided in its action by the musculature of the head. The extrusion itself depends
                    entirely upon contraction of the muscular walls of the space just mentioned
                    (proboscidian sheath). As it is (1) closed on all sides, and (2) filled with a
                    corpuscular fluid, the contractions alluded to send this fluid to impinge
                    against the anterior portion, where the proboscis, floating in its sheath, is
                    attached with it to the muscular tissue of the head (fig. 3). Partial extrusion
                    lessening the resistance in this region inevitably follows, and when further
                    contractions of the walls of the sheath ensue total extrusion is the
                    consequence. It is worthy of notice that in those Nemertines which make a very
                    free use of their proboscis, and in which it is seen to be continually protruded
                    and retracted, the walls of the proboscidian sheath are enormously muscular. On
                    the other hand, they are much less considerably or even insignificantly so in
                    the genera that are known to make a rather sparing use of their proboscis.</p>
                <p>The proboscis, which is thus an eminently muscular organ, is composed of two or
                    three, sometimes powerful, layers of muscles—one of longitudinal and one or two
                    of circular fibres. In the posterior retractor the longitudinal fibres become
                    united into one bundle, which, as noticed above, is inserted in the wall of the
                    sheath. At the circular insertion of the proboscis in front of the brain the
                    muscular fibres belonging to the anterior extremity of the body and those
                    connected with the proboscis are very intimately interwoven, forming a strong
                    attachment.</p>
                <p>The proboscis broken off and expelled is generally reproduced, the posterior
                    ribbon-like end of this reproduced portion again fusing with the walls of the
                    sheath (11). There is reason to suppose that, when a wound is inflicted by the
                    central stylet, it is envenomed by the fluid secreted in the posterior
                    proboscidian region being at the same time expelled. A reservoir, a duct, and a
                    muscular bulb in the region (fig. 4) where the stylet is attached serve for this
                    purpose. The significance of two or more (in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drepanophorus</hi> very numerous) small sacs containing so-called “reserve”
                    stylets resembling in shape that of the central dart is insufficiently
                    known.</p>
                <p>The proboscidian sheath, which by its transverse contractions serves to bring
                    about eversion of the proboscis in the way above traced, and the muscular walls
                    of which were similarly noticed, is attached to the musculature of the head just
                    in front of the ganglionic commissures (fig. 3). In nearly all Nemertines it
                    extends backwards as far as the posterior extremity, just above the anus; in <hi
                    rend="italic">Carinella</hi> it is limited to the anterior body-region. The
                    corpuscles floating in the fluid it contains are of definite shape, and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cerebratulus urticans</hi> they are deep red from the presence of
                    haemoglobin. Internally the muscular layers are lined by an epithelium. In the
                    posterior portion this epithelium in certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schizonemertea</hi> has a more glandular appearance, and sometimes the interior
                    cavity is obliterated by cell-proliferation in this region. Superiorly the
                    sheath either closely adheres to the muscular body-wall, with which it may even
                    be partly interwoven, or it hangs freely in the connective tissue which fills
                    the space between the intestine and the muscular body-wall.</p>

                    their highly refracting contents, of a more or less rod-like shape, directly to
                    the exterior. They appear to be the principal source of the mucus these animals
                    secrete. In Schizonemertines these elements are separated by a thin homogeneous
                    basement membrane (fig. 8) from the following,—that is, from a layer in which
                    longitudinal muscular fibres are largely intermixed with tortuous glands, which
                    by reason of their deeper situation communicate with the exterior by a much
                    longer and generally very narrow duct. The pigment is also principally localized
                    in this layer, although sometimes it is present even deeper down within the
                    musculature. The passage from this tegumentary layer to the subjacent
                    longitudinal muscular one is gradual, no membrane separating them. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Carinella, Cephalothrix, Polia,</hi> and the Hoplonemertines the
                    two tegumentary layers with their different glandular elements are fused into
                    one; a thick layer of connective tissue is situated beneath them (instead of
                    between them) and keeps the entire cutaneous system more definitely separate
                    from the muscular (figs. <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, 8).</p>

                    layers by which the body-wall is constituted have been very differently and to
                    some extent confusingly described by the successive authors on Nemertean
                    anatomy. There is sufficient reason for this confusion. The fact is that not
                    only have the larger subdivisions a different arrangement and even number of the
                    muscular layers, but even within the same genus, nay, in the same species,
                    well-marked differences occur. Increase in size appears sometimes to be
                    accompanied by the development of a new layer of fibres, whereas a difference in
                    the method of preparation may give to a layer which appeared homogeneous in one
                    specimen a decidedly fibrous aspect in another. Nevertheless there are three
                    principal types under which the different modifications can be arranged. One of
                    them is found in the two most primitively organized genera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carinella</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cephalothrix, i.e.,</hi> an outer
                    circular, a longitudinal, and an inner circular layer of muscular fibres</p>
                <p>(fig. 7). The second is common to all the Schizonemertines as well as to <hi
                    rend="italic">Polia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Valencinia,</hi> and also
                    comprehends three layers, of which, however, two are longitudinal, viz., the
                    external and the internal one, there being a strong circular layer between tnem
                    (fig. 9). To the third type all the <hi rend="italic">Hoplonemertea</hi>
                    correspond; their muscular layers are only two, an external circular and an
                    internal longitudinal one (fig. 8).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Schizonemertea</hi> thus appear to have developed an extra
                    layer of longitudinal fibres internally to those which they inherited from more
                    primitive ancestors, whereas the <hi rend="italic">Hoplonemertea</hi> are no
                    longer in possession of the internal circular layer, but have on the contrary
                    largely developed the external circular one, which has dwindled away in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Schizonemertea.</hi> In only one instance has the present writer
                    met with a thin exterior circular layer in a very large specimen of <hi

                    show it. It is noticeable that Keferstein (9) also observed four layers
                    similarly arranged in one of the specimens of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cerebratulus</hi> which he investigated. The situation of the lateral
                    nerve-stems in the. different genera with respect to the muscular layers lends
                    definite support to the interpretation of their homologies here given.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Carinella, Cephalothrix,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polia,</hi> as well as in all Hoplonemertines, the basement membrane of the
                    skin already above alluded to is particularly strong and immediately applied
                    upon the muscular layers. In the Schizonemertines there is a layer in which the
                    cutaneous elements are largely represented below the thin basement membrane
                    (fig. 8), between it and the bulk of the outer longitudinal muscles. The
                    difference in the appearance of the basement membrane—sometimes wholly
                    homogeneous, sometimes eminently fibrillar—can more especially be observed in
                    differently preserved specimens of the genus <hi rend="italic">Polia.</hi></p>
                <p>The connective tissue of the integument and basement membrane imperceptibly
                    merges into that which surrounds the muscular bundles as they are united into
                    denser and definite layers, and this is especially marked in those forms <hi
                    rend="italic">(Akrostomum)</hi> where the density of the muscular body-λvall has
                    considerably diminished, and the connective tissue has thus become much more
                    prominent. It can then at the same time be observed, too, that the compact mass
                    of connective tissue (“reticulum,” Barrois) which lies between the muscular
                    body-wall and the intestine (1) is directly continuous with that in which the
                    muscular layers are imbedded. Nuclei are everywhere present. The omnipresence of
                    this connective tissue excludes the idea of any true body cavity in
                    Nemertines.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Polia</hi> the connective tissue enclosed in the external
                    muscular layer is eminently vacuolar,—all the intermediate stages between such
                    cells in which the vacuole predominates and the nucleus is peripheral and those
                    in which the granular protoplasm still entirely fills them being; moreover
                    present.</p>
                <p>In addition to the musculature of the proboscis and proboscidian sheath,
                    longitudinal muscular fibres are found in the walls of the oesophagus, whilst
                    transverse ones are numerous and united into vertical dissepiments· between the
                    successive intestinal caeca, thus bringing about a very regular internal
                    metamerization (4). The genitaî products develop in intermediate spaces
                    similarly limited by these dissepiments and alternating with the digestiver
                    caeca.</p>
                <p>(d) <hi rend="italic">Nervous System and Sense Organs.—</hi> The nervous system
                    of Nemertines presents several interesting peculiarities. As central organs we
                    have to note the brain-lobes and the longitudinal lateral cords which form one
                    continuous unsegmented mass of fibrous and cellular nerve-tissue. The fibrous
                    nerve-tissue is more dense in the higher differentiated, more loose and spongy
                    in the lower organized forms; the cellular nerve-tissue is similarly less
                    compact in the forms that are at the base of the scale. No ganglionic swellings
                    whatever occur in the course of the longitudinal cords. The brain must be looked
                    upon as the anterior thickening of these cords, and at the same time as the spot
                    where the two halves of the central nerve system intercommunicate. This is
                    brought about by a double commissure, of which the ventral portion is
                    considerably thicker than the dorsal, and which, together with the brain-lobes,
                    constitutes a ring through which both proboscis and proboscidian sheath, pass.
                    The brain-lobes are generally four in number, a ventral and a dorsal pair,
                    respectively united together by the above-mentioned commissures, and moreover
                    anteriorly interfusing with each other, right and left. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carinella</hi> this separation into lobes of the anterior thickenings of the
                    cords has not yet commenced, the ventral commissure at the same time being
                    extremely bulky. There is great probability that the central stems, together
                    with the brain, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n341/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0341-0328"/> must be looked upon as local longitudinal
                    accumulations of nervous tissue in what was in more primitive ancestors a less
                    highly differentiated nervous plexus, situated in the body-wall in a similar way
                    to that which still is found in the less highly organized Ccelenterates. Such a
                    nervous plexus indeed occurs in the bodywall of all Schizonemertines (7),
                    sometimes even as a comparatively thick layer, situated, as are the nerve stems,
                    between the external longitudinal and the circular muscles (fig. 9). In <hi
                    rend="italic">Carinella,</hi> where the longitudinal nerve-stems are situated
                    exteriorly to the muscular layers, this plexus, although present, is much less
                    dense, and can more fitly be compared to a network with wide meshes. In both
                    cases it can be shown to be in immediate continuity with the coating of
                    nerve-cells forming part of the longitudinal cords.</p>
                <p>It stretches forward as far as the brain, and in <hi rend="italic">Carinella</hi>
                    is again continued in front of it, whereas in the Schizouemer-tines the
                    innervation of the anterior extremity of the head, in front of the brain, takes
                    the form of more definite and less numerous branching stems. The presence of
                    this plexus in connexion vitlι the central stems, sending out nervous filaments
                    amongst the muscles, explains the absence, both in Palaeo-and Schizonemertines,
                    of separate and distinct peripheral nerve stems springing from the central stems
                    innervating the different organs and body-regions, the only exceptions being the
                    nerves for the proboscis, those for the sense organs in the head, and the strong
                    nerve pair (n. <hi rend="italic">vagus)</hi> for the oesophagus. At the same
                    time it renders more intelligible the extreme sensitiveness of the bodywall of
                    the Nemertines, a local and instantaneous irritation often resulting in
                    spasmodic rupture of the animal at the point touched.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Hoplonemcrtea,</hi> where the longitudinal stems lie
                    inside the muscular body-wall, definite and metamerically placed nerve branches
                    spring from them and divide dichotomously in the different tissues they
                    innervate. A definite plexus can here no longer be traced. In certain
                    Hoplonemertines the lateral stems have been noticed to unite posteriorly by a
                    terminal commissure, situated above the anus, the whole of the central nervous
                    system being in this way virtually situated above the intestine. In others there
                    is an approximation of the lateral stems towards the median ventral line <hi
                    rend="italic">{Drepanophorus};</hi> in a genus of Schizonemertines <hi
                    rend="italic">(Langia),</hi> on the other hand, an arrangement occurs by which
                    the longitudinal stems are no longer lateral, but have more or less approached
                    each other dorsally (6).</p>
                <p>In addition to the nerves starting from the brain-lobes just now especially
                    mentioned, there is a double apparatus which can hardly be treated of in
                    conjunction with the sense organs, because its sensory functions have not been
                    sufficiently made out, and which will therefore rather be considered along with
                    the brain and central nervous system. This apparatus is usually known under the
                    name of the lateral organs. To it belong <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> superficial
                    grooves or deeper slits situated on the integument near the tip of the head, (⅛)
                    nerve lobes in immediate connexion with the nervous tissue of the brain, and (c)
                    ciliated ducts penetrating into the latter and communicating with the former.
                    Embryology slιows that originally these different parts are separately started,
                    and only ultimately become united into one. Two lateral outgrowths of the
                    foremost portion of the (esophagus, afterwards becoming constricted off, as well
                    as two ingrowths from the epiblast, contribute towards its formation, at least
                    as far as both Hoplo-and Schizonemertines are concerned. As to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palaeonemcrtea,</hi> their embryology has not yet been studied,
                    and in the most primitive genus, <hi rend="italic">Carinella,</hi> we do not
                    find any lateral organs answering to the description above given. What we do
                    find is a slight transverse furrow on each side of the head, close to the tip,
                    but the most careful examination of sections made through the tissues of the
                    head and brain shows the absence of any further apparatus comparable to that
                    described above. Only in one species, <hi rend="italic">Carinella
                    inexpectata,</hi> a step in advance has been made, in so far as in connexion
                    with the furrow just mentioned, which is here also somewhat more complicated in
                    its arrangement, a ciliated tube leads into the brain, there to end blindly
                    amidst the nervecells. No other intermediate stages have as yet been noticed
                    between this arrangement and that of the <hi rend="italic">Schizonemertca,</hi>
                    in which a separate posterior brain-lobe receives a similar ciliated canal, and
                    in which the oesophageal outgrowths have made their appearance and are coalesced
                    with the nerve-tissue in the organ of the adult animal. The histological
                    elements of this portion remain distinct both by transmitted light and in actual
                    sections.</p>
                <p>These posterior brain-lobes, which in all Schizonemertines are in direct
                    continuity of tissue with the upper pair of principal lobes, cease to have this
                    intimate connexion in the <hi rend="italic">Hoplonemcrtea</hi>; and, although
                    still constituted of (1) a ciliated duct, opening out externally, (2) nervous
                    tissue surrounding it, and (3) histological elements distinctly different from
                    the nervous, and most probably directly derived from the oesophageal outgrowths,
                    they are nevertheless here no longer constantly situated behind the upper brain
                    lobes and directly connected with them, but are found sometimes behind,
                    sometimes beside, and sometimes before the brain-lobes. Furthermore, they are
                    here severed from the principal lobes and connected with them by one or more
                    rather thick strings of nervefibres. In some cases, especially when the lobes
                    lie before the brain, their distance from it, as well as the length of these
                    nervous connexions, has considerably increased.</p>
                <p>With the significance of these parts we are still insufficiently acquainted.
                    There appear to be analogous organs amongst Platyelminthes, but a careful
                    comparative study is wanted. A partial comparison has been hazarded (8) with the
                    anterior oesophageal outgrowths in <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Amplιioxus,</hi> and for the Schizonemertines arguments have been
                    adduced (6) to prove that here they have the physiological significance of a
                    special respiratory apparatus for the central nervous tissue, which in all these
                    forms is strongly charged with haemoglobin. The haemoglobin would, by its
                    pre-eminent properties of fixing oxygen, serve to furnish the nerve system,
                    which more than any other requires a constant supply, with the necessary oxygen.
                    Such could hardly be obtained in any other way by those worms that have no
                    special respiratory apparatus or delicately ramifying blood-vessels, and that
                    live in mud and under stones, where the natural supply of freshly oxygenated
                    sea-water is practically limited. Whether in the Hoplonemertines, where the
                    blood fluid is often provided with haemo-globiniferous disks, the chief
                    functions of the side organs may not rather be a sensory one must be further
                    investigated.</p>
                <p>The exterior opening of the duct has been several times alluded to. In the
                    Hoplonemertines it is generally situated towards the middle of a lateral
                    transverse groove on either side of the head, as was noticed for <hi
                    rend="italic">Carinella,</hi> and as is also present in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polia.</hi> Generally a row of shorter grooves perpendicular to the first, and
                    similarly provided with strong cilia, enlarges the surface of these furrows
                    (fig. 14). In <hi rend="italic">Valencinia</hi> there is nothing but a circular
                    opening without furrow. In all Schizonemertines there is on each side of the
                    head a longitudinal slit of varying length but generally considerable depth, in
                    the bottom of which the dark red brain is very plainly visible by transparency.
                    These slits are continued into the ciliated duct, being at the same time
                    themselves very strongly ciliated. In life they are commonly rhythmically opened
                    and shut by a wavy movement. They are the head slits (cephalic fissures,
                    “Kopfspalten”) so characteristic of this subdivision (figs. 10 and 13).</p>
                <p>With respect to the sense organs of the Nemertines, we find that eyes are of
                    rather constant occurrence, although many Schizonemertines living in the mud
                    appear to be blind. The more highly organized species have often very numerous
                    eyes <hi rend="italic">(Amphiporus, Drepanophorus),</hi> which are provided with
                    a spherical refracting anterior portion, with a cellular “vitreous body,” with a
                    layer of delicate radially arranged rods, with an outer sheath of dark pigment,
                    and with a separate nerve-twig each, springing from a common or double pair of
                    branches which leave the brain as <hi rend="italic">n.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >optici,</hi> for the innervation of the eyes. Besides these more highly
                    differentiated organs of vision, more primitive eyes are present in others down
                    to simple stellate pigment specks without any refracting apparatus.</p>
                <p>Organs of hearing in the form of capsules containing otoliths have only been very
                    rarely observed, apparently only in <hi rend="italic">Hopl onemertea.</hi></p>
                <p>As to the organ of touch, the great sensitiveness of the body has already been
                    noticed, as well as the probable primary significance of the proboscis. Small
                    tufts of tactile hairs or papillae are sometimes observed in small number at the
                    tip of the head (11); sometimes longer hairs, apparently rather stiff, are seen
                    on the surface, very sparingly distributed between the cilia, and hitherto only
                    in a very limited number of small specimens. They may perhaps be considered as
                    sensory.</p>
                <p>(e) <hi rend="italic">Digestive System.—</hi> The anterior opening, the mouth, is
                    situated ventrally, close to the tip of the head and in front of the brain in

                    brain in the other Nemertines. In most Schizonemertines it is found to be an

                    moreover, serves for the extrusion of the proboscis, which emerges by a separate
                    dorsal opening just inside the mouth. The oesophagus is the anterior portion of
                    the digestive canal; its walls are folded longitudinally, comparatively thick,
                    and provided with longitudinal muscular fibres. Two layers are specially obvious
                    in its walls,—the inner layer bordering the lumen being composed of smaller
                    ciliated cells, the outer thicker one containing numerous granular cells and
                    having a more glandular character. Outside the wall of the oesophagus a vascular
                    space has been detected (11) which is in direct continuity with the longitudinal
                    blood-vessels. In certain cases, however, the walls of the oesophagus appear to
                    be very closely applied to the muscular body-wall, and this vascular space
                    thereby considerably reduced.</p>
                <p>The posterior portion of the intestine is specially characterized by the
                    appearance of the intestinal diverticula horizontally and symmetrically placed
                    right and left and opposite to each other. Sometimes this region, into which the
                    oesophagus leads, stretches forwards under the oesophagus (Hoplonemertines) for
                    a certain distance, anteriorly terminating by a cul-de-sac. Cases of asymmetry
                    or irregularity in the arrangement of the caeca, though sometimes occurring, are
                    not normal. At the tip of the tail, where the growth of the animal takes place,
                    the caeca are always eminently regular. So they are throughout the whole body in
                    most of the Hoplonemertines. In <hi rend="italic">Carinella</hi> they are
                    generally deficient and the intestine straight; in young specimens of this
                    species, however, they occur, though less regular and more in the form of
                    incipient foldings by λvhich the digestive surface is increased. The inner
                    surface of the intestinal caeca is ciliated, the caeca themselves are
                    sometimes—especially in the hindermost portion of the body—of a considerably
                    smaller lumen than the intermediate genital spaces; sometimes, however, the
                    reverse is the case, and in both cases it is the smaller lumen that appears
                    enclosed between and suspended by the transverse fibres constituting the
                    muscular dissepiments above mentioned.</p>
                <p>The anus is situated terminally, the muscular body-wall through which the
                    intestine must find its way outwards probably acting in this region the part of
                    a sphincter. The lateral nerve stems mostly terminate on both sides in closest
                    proximity to the anus; in certain species, however, they interfuse by a
                    transverse connexion <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the anus. The longitudinal
                    blood-vessels do the same. The question has been raised whether the regular
                    intestinal caeca of Nemertines might not be compared with those intestinal
                    diverticula of the embryo <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> which ultimately
                    become the mesoblastic somites of the adult (8). This view would be a further
                    extension of the views concerning the ccelom first propounded by Huxley.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(∕) Circulatory Apparatus.—</hi> This consists of three
                    longitudinal trunks, a median and two lateral ones. They are in direct connexion
                    with each other both at the posterior and at the anterior end of the body. At
                    the posterior end they communicate together by a T-shaped connexion in a simple
                    and uniform way. Anteriorly there is a certain amount of difference in the
                    arrangement. Whereas in the Hoplonemertines an arrangement prevails as
                    represented in fig. 18, the lateral stems in the Schizonemertines, while
                    entirely uniform all through the posterior portion of the body, no longer
                    individually exist in the oesophageal region, but here dissolve themselves into
                    a network of vascular spaces surrounding this portion of the digestive tract
                    (11). The median dorsal vessel, however, remains distinct, but instead of
                    continuing its course beneath the proboscidian sheath it is first enclosed by
                    the ventral musculature of this organ, and still farther forwards it even bulges
                    out longitudinally into the cavity of the sheath. Anteriorly it finally
                    communicates with the lacuuae just mentioned, which surround the cesophagus,
                    bathe the posterior lobes of the brain, pass through the nerve ring together
                    with the proboscidian sheath, and are generally continued in front of the brain
                    as a lacunar space in the muscular tissue, one on each side.</p>
                <p>Special mention must be made of the delicate transverse vessels regularly
                    connecting the longitudinal and the lateral ones. They are metamerically placed,
                    and belong to the same metamer as the digestive caeca, thus alternating with the
                    generative sacs. The blood fluid does not flow in any definite direction; its
                    movements are largely influenced by those of the muscular body-wall. It is
                    colourless, and contains definite corpuscles, which are round or elliptical, and
                    in many Hoplonemertines are coloured red by haemoglobin, being colourless in
                    other species. The circulatory system of <hi rend="italic">Carinella</hi> is
                    considerably different, being more lacunar and less restricted to definite
                    vascular channels. Two lateral longitudinal lacuuae form, so to say, the
                    forerunners of the lateral vessels. A median longitudinal vessel and transverse
                    connecting trunks have not as yet been detected. There are large lacunae in the
                    head in front of the ganglia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(&lt;?) Nephridia.—</hi> Although these organs were already
                    very well known to Max Schultze (14), their presence in Nemertines was
                    repeatedly and seriously disputed until Von Kennel (10) definitely proved their
                    existence and gave details concerning their histology. With the exception of a
                    few genera where they have not as yet been discovered (&lt;7αrwιeZZα), one pair
                    of nephridia appears to be very generally present. They essentially consist of a
                    complex coiled tube, one on each side of the oesophagus (fig. 1), communicating
                    with the exterior by a duct piercing the body-wall. The two openings of the
                    nephridia are situated sometimes more towards the ventral, at other times more
                    towards the dorsal side. Even in the larger Schizonemertines these pores are
                    only a feλv millimetres behind the mouth region. Internal funnel-shaped
                    openings, although sought for, have as yet not been detected. The coiled tubes
                    extend both forwards and backwards of the external opening, by far the greater
                    portion being situated backwards. The anterior coils reach forwards till in the
                    immediate vicinity of the posterior brain-lobes. The coils are tubiform, with an
                    internal lumen, only one layer of rather large cells constituting the walls.
                    These cells are ciliated; in some transparent species the internal ciliary
                    movement can be observed during lite. In transverse sections the nephridia can
                    be shown to be generally situated in the region limited by (1) the proboscidian
                    sheath, (2) the upper wall of the intestine, (3) the muscular body-wall. No
                    trace of nephridia is found posterior to the cesophagus.</p>
                <p>(Λ) <hi rend="italic">Generative System.—</hi> In the Nemertines the sexes are
                    separate, with only very few exceptions (12) (<hi rend="italic">Tctrastemma
                    hermaphroditica,</hi> Marion). The generative products are contained in separate
                    pouches placed metamerically in the way noticed above in treating of the
                    digestive system. They are conveyed outwards along narrow canals, one pair for
                    each metamer piercing the muscular body-wall, and visible on the outside in
                    mature individuals as minute lightcoloured specks. The ova and spermatozoa, when
                    mature, present no peculiarities. As the ova are in many species deposited in a
                    gelatinous tube secreted by the body-walls, in which they are arranged (three or
                    more together) in flask-shaped cavities, impregnation must probably take place
                    either before or at the very moment of their being deposited. The exact mode has
                    not yet been noticed. Another point not yet sufficiently settled is the
                    oogenesis in Nemertines. In several cases the ova appear to originate directly
                    as the lining of the generative pouches, but the exact part which the
                    mesoblastic connective tissue plays, both with regard to these pouches and to
                    the generative products themselves, remains yet to be settled.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Development.</hi> —The embryology of the Nemertines offers
                    some very remarkable peculiarities. Our knowledge of the development of the most
                    primitive forms is very scanty. Of that of <hi rend="italic">Carinella</hi>
                    absolutely nothing is known. On <hi rend="italic">Cephalothrix</hi> we have
                    observations, in certain respects contradictory. Both <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schizo-</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hoplonemertea</hi> have been more
                    exhaustively studied, the first, as was noticed above, <pb break="no"

                    second developing without metamorphosis.</p>
                <p>The larva of <hi rend="italic">Cerebratulus</hi> is called the pilidium. In
                    exterior shape it resembles a helmet with spike and earlobes, the spike being a
                    strofig and long flagellum or a tuft of long cilia, the ear-lobes lateral
                    ciliated appendages (fig. 19). It encloses the primitive alimentary tract. Two
                    pairs of invaginations of the skin, which originally are called the prostomial
                    and meta-stomial disks, grow round the intestine, finally fuse together, and
                    form the skin and muscular body-wall of the future Nemertine, which afterwards
                    becomes ciliated, frees itself from the pilidium investment, and develops into
                    the adult worm without further metamorphosis (2, 13).</p>
                <p>The eggs of these species are not enveloped by such massive gelatinous strings as
                    are those of the genus <hi rend="italic">Lineus.</hi> In the latter we find the
                    young Nemertines crawling about after a period of from six to eight weeks, and
                    probably feeding upon a portion of this gelatinous substance, which is found to
                    diminish in bulk. In accordance with these more sedentary habits during the
                    first phases of life, the characteristic pilidium larva, which is so eminently
                    adapted for a pelagic existence, appears to have been reduced to a close-fitting
                    exterior layer of cells, which is stripped off after the definite body-wall of
                    the Nemertine has similarly originated out of four ingrowths from the primary
                    epiblast. To this reduced and sedentary pilidium the name of “larva of Desor”
                    has been given (1).</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Hoplonemertea,</hi> as far as they have been
                    investigated, a direct development without metamorphosis has been observed. It
                    appears probable that this is only a further simplification of the more
                    complicated metamorphosis described above.</p>
                <p>As to the development of the different organs, there is still much that remains
                    doubtful. The hypoblast in some forms originates by invagination, in others by
                    delamination. The proboscis is an invagination from the epiblast; the
                    proboscidian sheath appears in the mesoblast, but is perhaps originally derived
                    from the hypoblast. The origin of the lateral organs has already been noticed;
                    that of the nerve system is essentially epiblastic.</p>
