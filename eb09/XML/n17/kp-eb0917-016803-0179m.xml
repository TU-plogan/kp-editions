                <p><label type="entry">NAMES</label>. Names, and the study of proper names of
                    persons and places, are not without scientific and historical importance, but,
                    on the whole, are perhaps rather matter of curious interest. It stands to reason
                    that, even in the earliest societies of “articulate speaking men,” all known
                    persons, places, and groups of human beings must have had names by which they
                    could be spoken of and by which they were recognized. The study of these names
                    and of their survival in civilization enables us in some cases to ascertain what
                    peoples inhabited districts now tenanted by persons of far different speech.
                    Thus the names of mountains and rivers in many parts of England are Celtic, —for
                    example, to take familiar instances, Usk, Esk, and Avon. There are also local
                    names (such as Mona, Monmouth, Mynwy, and others) which seem to be relics of
                    tribes even older than the Celtic stocks, and “vestiges of non-Aryan people,
                    whom the Celts found in possession both on the Continent and in the British
                    Isles.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Elton, <hi
                    rend="italic">Origins of English History,</hi> p. 165; Rhys, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lectures on Celtic Philology,</hi> 181, 182.</p></note> These are affairs of
                    somewhat dubious conjecture, but it is certain enough that the Celtic names,
                    with their mysterious and romantic sounds, do linger in English valleys like the
                    last echoes of Arthur’s horn among the hollows of the hills. And it is no less
                    certain that the English name is sometimes the mere translation, perhaps
                    unconscious, of the earlier Celtic appellation, often added to the more ancient
                    word. Penpole Point in Somerset is an obvious example of this redoubling of
                    names. As to the meaning and nature of ancient local names, they are as a rule
                    purely descriptive. A river is called by some word which merely signifies “the
                    water”; a hill has a name which means no more than “the point,” “the peak,” “the
                    castle.” Celtic names are often of a more romantic tone, as Ardnamurchan, “the
                    promontory by the great ocean,” an admirable description of the bold and steep
                    headland which breasts the wash of the Atlantic. As a general rule the surviving
                    Celtic names, chiefly in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, all contain some wide
                    meaning of poetic appropriateness. The English names, on the other hand,
                    commonly state some very simple fact, and very frequently do no more than denote
                    property, such and such a town or hamlet, “ton” or “ham,” is the property of the
                    Billings, Uffings, Tootings, or whoever the early English settlers in the
                    district may have been. The same attachment to the idea of property is exhibited
                    in even the local names of petty fields in English parishes. Occasionally one
                    finds a bit of half humorous description, as when a sour, starved, and weedy
                    plot is named “starvacre”; but more usually fields are known as “Thompson’s
                    great field,” “Smith’s small field,” “the fouracre,” or the like. The name of
                    some farmer or peasant owner or squatter of ancient date survives for centuries,
                    attached to what was once his property. Thus the science of local names has a
                    double historical value. The names indicate the various races <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n180/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0180-0169"/> (Celtic, Roman, and English in Great Britain) who
                    have set in the form of names the seal of their possession on the soil. Again,
                    the meanings of the names illustrate the characters of the various races. The
                    Romans have left us names connected with camps (castra, chesters) and military
                    roads; the English have used simple descriptions of the baldest kind, or have
                    exhibited their attachment to the idea of property; the Celtic names (like those
                    which the red men have left in America, or the blacks in Australia) are musical
                    with poetic fancy, and filled with interest in the aspects and the sentiment of
                    nature. Our race carries with it the ancient names of an older people into every
                    continent, and titles perhaps originally given to places in the British Isles by
                    men who had not yet learned to polish their weapons of flint may now be found in
                    Australia, America, Africa, and the islands of the furthest seas.</p>
                <p>Local names were originally imposed in a handy local manner. The settler or the
                    group of cave-men styled the neighbouring river “the water,” the neighbouring
                    hill “the peak,” and these terms often still survive in relics of tongues which
                    can only be construed by the learned. The history of personal names is longer
                    and more complex, but proceeds from beginnings almost as simple. But in personal
                    names the complexity of-human character, and the gradual processes of tangling
                    and disentangling the threads of varied human interest, soon come in, and
                    personal names are not imposed once and for all. Each man in very early
                    societies may have many names, in different characters and at different periods
                    of his life. The oldest personal names which we need examine here are the names
                    which indicate, not an individual, but a group, held together by the conscious
                    sense or less conscious sentiment of kindred, or banded together for reasons of
                    convenience. An examination of customs prevalent among the most widely separated
                    races of Asia, Africa, Australia, and America proves that groups conceiving
                    themselves to be originally of the same kin are generally styled by the name of
                    some animal or other object (animate or inanimate) from which they claim
                    descent. This object is known as the “totem,” from the Red-Indian word <hi
                    rend="italic">dodhaim.</hi> Of this topic it must here suffice to say that the
                    earliest and most widely spread class and family names among uncivilized people
                    are totemistic. The groups of supposed kin, however widely scattered in local
                    distribution, are known as wolves, bears, turtles, suns, moons, cockatoos,
                    reeds, and what not, according as each group claims descent from this or that
                    stock, and wears a badge representing this or that animal, plant, or natural
                    object. Unmistakable traces of the same habit of naming exist among Semitic and
                    Teutonic races, and even among Greeks and Romans. The origin of this class of
                    names cannot well be investigated in this place, but it may be observed that the
                    names chosen are commonly those of objects which can be easily drawn in a rude
                    yet recognizable way, and easily expressed in the language of gesture. In
                    addition to the totem names (which indicate, in each example, supposed
                    blood-kindred), <hi rend="italic">local</hi> aggregates of men received local
                    names. We hear of the “hill-men,” “the cave-men,” <hi rend="superscript">
                    il</hi> the bush-men,” “the coast-men,” the “men of the plain,” precisely as in
                    the old Attic divisions of Aktaioi, Pediaioi, and so forth. When a tribe comes
                    to recognize its own unity, as a rule it calls itself by some term meaning
                    simply “the men,” all other tribes being regarded as barbarous or inferior.
                    Probably other neighbouring tribes also call themselves “the men” in another
                    dialect or language, while the people in the neighbourhood are known by an
                    opprobrious epithet, as <hi rend="italic">Rakshasas</hi> among the early Aryan
                    dwellers in India, or <hi rend="italic">Eskimo</hi> (raw-eaters') in the. far
                    north of the American continent.</p>
                <p>Leaving tribal for personal names, we find that, among most uncivilized races, a
                    name (derived from some incident or natural object) is given at the time of
                    birth by the parents of each new-born infant. Occasionally the name is imposed
                    before the child is born, and the proud parents call themselves father and
                    mother of such an one before the expected infant sees the light. In most cases
                    the name (the earliest name) denotes some phenomenon of nature; thus Dobrizhofer
                    met in the forests a young man styled “Gold flower of day,” that is, “Dawn,” his
                    father having been named “Sun.” Similar names are commonly given by the natives
                    of Australia, while no names are more common among North-American Indians than
                    those derived from sun, moon, cloud, and wind. This simple historical fact is
                    very damaging to the mythological theories which resolve into solar or elemental
                    myths all legends where the names of the characters can be philologically
                    twisted into descriptions of natural phenomena. It is concluded that these myths
                    originally described incidents in the life of clouds, winds, and tides, whereas
                    names like those on which the theory depends are commonly applied by savage
                    peoples to ordinary human beings. Marshal Saxe was not the sun because his
                    mistress was named “Aurore,” and Cephalus and Procris were real persons to those
                    who heard their story, although by a series of logical jumps their names may be
                    interpreted as synonyms of the sun and the dew.</p>
                <p>The names of savage persons are not permanent. The name first given is ordinarily
                    changed (at the ceremony answering to confirmation in church) for some more
                    appropriate and descriptive nickname, and that, again, is apt to be superseded
                    by various “honour-giving names” derived from various exploits. The common
                    superstition against being “named” has probably produced the custom by which
                    each individual is addressed, when possible, by some wide term of
                    kinship—“brother,” “father,” and the like. The bad luck which in Zulu customs as
                    in Vedic myths attends the utterance of the real name is evaded by this system
                    of addresses. Could we get a savage—an Iroquois, for example—to explain his
                    titles, we would find that he is, say, “Morning Cloud” (by birth-name), “Hungry
                    Wolf” (by confirmation name), “He that raises the white fellow’s scalp” (by
                    honour-giving name), of the Crane totem (by family and hereditary name, as
                    understood by ourselves). When society grows so permanent that male kinship and
                    paternity are recognized, the custom of patronymics is introduced. The totem
                    name gives place to a gentile name, itself probably a patronymic in form; or, as
                    in Greece, the gentile name gives place to a local name, derived from the deme.
                    Thus a Roman is called Caius; Julius is his gentile name (of the Julian clan);
                    Caesar is a kind of hereditary nickname. A Greek is Thucydides (the name usually
                    derived from the grandfather), the son of Olorus, of the deme of Halimusia.</p>
                <p>This system of names answered the purposes of Greek and Roman civilization. In
                    Europe, among the Teutonic races, the stock-names (probably totemistic in
                    origin) survive in English local names, which speak of the “ton” or “ham” of
                    "the Billings or Tootings. An examination of these names, as collected in
                    Kemble’s <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxons,</hi> proves that they were originally
                    derived, as a rule, from animals and plants. Our English ancestors had for
                    personal names compound words, as “Noble Wolf” (Ethelwulf), “Volf of War,” and
                    so forth, and these names certainly testify to a somewhat primitive and fierce
                    stage of society. Then came more vulgar nicknames and personal descriptions, as
                    “Long,” “Brown,” “White,” and so forth. Other names are directly derived from
                    the occupation or craft (Smith, Fowler, Sadler) of the man to whom they were
                    given, and yet other names were derived from places. The noble and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n181/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0181-0170"/> landowner was called “of” such and such a place
                    (the German <hi rend="italic">von,</hi> and French <hi rend="italic">de),</hi>
                    while the humbler man was called not “of” but “at” such a place, as in the name
                    “Attewell,” or merely by the local name without the particle. If we add to these
                    patronymics formed by the addition of “son,” and terms derived from Biblical
                    characters (the latter adopted after the Reformation as a reaction against the
                    names of saints in the calendar), we have almost exhausted the sources of modern
                    English and European names. A continual development of custom can be traced, and
                    the analysis of any man’s family and Christian names will lead us beyond history
                    into the manners of races devoid of literary records. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
