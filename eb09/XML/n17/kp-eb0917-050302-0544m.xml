                    the Ingul with the Bug, at the head of the <hi rend="italic">liman,</hi> or
                    estuary, of the Bug, and is the natural outlet for the basin of that river. The
                    estuary, which is 23 miles long, enters that of the Dnieper; and Nikolaieff, 42
                    miles distant from the Black Sea, thus combines the advantages of a good seaport
                    with those of an inland town. The entrance to the double est nary of the Bug and
                    Dnieper is protected by the fortress of Otchakoff and by the fort of Kinburn,
                    erected on a narrow headland opposite, while several forts surround Nikolaieff
                    on both sides of the Bug and protect it from an attack by land. The town, which
                    occupies two flat peninsulas between the Bug and the Ingul, extends up the banks
                    of the latter, while its suburbs spread still farther into the steppe, the whole
                    covering an area of 6 square miles. Immense unoccupied spaces separate the
                    houses, which are mostly one-storied, and border on spacious streets. The bank
                    of the Ingul is taken up with shipbuilding yards, docks, slips, and various
                    workshops of the admiralty for the construction of armour-plates, guns, boilers,
                    &lt;fcc. On the river there is a floating dock for armoured ships, but
                    Nikolaieff has this drawback that fully armoured ships are unable to pass the
                    bar, which is only 18 to 21 feet deep. Before the Crimean War the activity of
                    the dockyards was very great, ships of 130 guns being built in them; the
                    suburbs—which belong to the admiralty—were bound to supply the necessary hands
                    to the number of 3000 every day, and all the inhabitants had to perform
                    compulsory service. Special bodies of militarily organized workmen were trained
                    in shipbuilding, and thus Nikolaieff became a great school for all branches of
                    navigation and naval architecture. The population, numbering 35,000, was mainly
                    dependent on these sources; but when the activity of the admiralty was brought
                    to a stop for fourteen years by the treaty of Paris the inhabitants had to seek
                    other means of support. By a branch of the Balta-Krementchug Railway, starting
                    from Znamenka (147 miles), Nikolaieff has been brought into connexion with the
                    Russian railway system, and its grain exports now equal those of Riga, while it
                    is the chief market for a region comprising the governments of Kherson, Poltava,
                    Kharkoff, Ekaterinoslaff, and parts of Kieff and Podolia. In 1878 it reached the
                    maximum of 2,665,000 quarters (9,660,000 cwts. in 1881). Large storehouses,
                    capable of holding 2,000,000 quarters, stand close to the commercial port, two
                    miles distant from the town, at Popova Balka on the Bug. The export of timber,
                    skins, tallow, and cattle is steadily increasing. The population, which is
                    growing rapidly, now amounts, including the suburbs, to upwards of 70,000 (45
                    per cent, of them military, and 7000 Jews). The sanitary conditions are bad, and
                    the mortality reaches 40 per thousand. The educational institutions of
                    Nikolaieff are more numerous and better than in many capitals of Russian
                    governments. They include a gymnasium, an artillery school, and a dozen schools
                    for boys and girls, an astronomical and meteorological observatory (46° 58' N.
                    lat. and 31° 38' E. long.), four museums and libraries, and a hydrographical
                    institute. Among the public buildings, the cathedral, which contains some good
                    Italian pictures, the theatre, the admiralty and several other state buildings
                    are worthy of mention. The manufactures in the hands of private individuals
                    include a shipbuilding yard and several tallow-melting houses and tobacco works.
                    Since 1870 the Nikolaieff admiralty has resumed activity, especially in the
                    construction of armoured ships and torpedo boats, though not to such an extent
                    as before the Crimean War. Though a district town of the government of Kherson,
                    Nikolaieff is under an independent military governor.</p>

                <p>The remains of the well-known Greek colony Olbia have been discovered close to
                    the confluence of the Ingul with the Bug at the Sto-Moghily (Hundred Graves). In
                    mediaeval times the country was under the Lithuanians, and subsequently under
                    the Zaporogian Cossacks. Russian colonists settled in the locality about the end
                    of the last century, and after the fall of Otchakoff Prince Potemkin established
                    a wharf on the Ingul which received the name of Nikolaieff. The further
                    development of the town is due almost entirely to the efforts of the Russian
                    Government to make it an important naval station.</p>
