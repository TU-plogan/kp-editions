                    members of the Inns of Court entertained William III. after his accession, Nash
                    was chosen to conduct the pageant. This duty he performed so much to the
                    satisfaction of the king that he was offered knighthood, but he declined the
                    honour, unless accompanied by a pension. As the king did not take the hint, Nash
                    found it necessary to turn gamester. The pursuit of his calling led him in 1704
                    to Bath, where he had the good fortune almost immediately to succeed Captain
                    Webster as master of the ceremonies. His qualifications for such a position were
                    unique, and under his conventional authority reforms were introduced which
                    rapidly secured to Bath a leading position as a fashionable watering-place. He
                    drew up a new code of rules for the regulation of balls and assemblies,
                    abolished the habit of wearing swords in places of public amusement, induced
                    gentlemen to adopt shoes and stockings in parades and assemblies instead of
                    boots, reduced refractory chairmen to submission and civility, and introduced a
                    tariff for lodgings. Through his exertions a handsome assemblyroom was also
                    erected, and the streets and public buildings were greatly improved. Nash
                    adopted an outward state corresponding to his nominal dignity. He wore an
                    immense white hat as a sign of office, and a dress adorned <pb break="no"

                    six greys, laced lackeys, and French horns. Notwithstanding his vanity and
                    impertinence, the tact, energy, and superficial cleverness of Nash won him the
                    patronage and notice of the great, while the success of his ceremonial rule, as
                    shown in the increasing prosperity of the town, secured him the gratitude of the
                    corporation and the people generally. When the Act of Parliament against
                    gambling deprived him of an easy though uncertain means of subsistence, the
                    corporation granted him a pension of six score guineas a year, which, with the
                    sale of his snuff boxes and other trinkets, enabled him to support a certain
                    faded splendour till his death on February 3, 1761. He was honoured with a
                    public funeral at the expense of the town.</p>
