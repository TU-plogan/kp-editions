                <p><label type="entry">NICARAGUA</label>, one of the five states of Central America,
                    between 10° 30 ’ and 15° N. lat. and 83° IT and 87° 40' W. long., forms an
                    irregular equilateral triangle wedged in between Honduras and Costa Rica north
                    and south, with base stretching for 280 miles along the Caribbean Sea from Cape
                    Gracias à Dios southwards to the San Juan delta, and apex at the Coseguina
                    volcano, Gulf of Fonseca, which separates it on the Pacific side from San
                    Salvador. The frontier towards Honduras, as laid down by the treaty of 1870,
                    runs from the Gulf of Fonseca in a north-westerly direction along the Cordillera
                    de Dipilto to 85° W., and thence a little north of and nearly parallel with the
                    Rio Coco (Wanks) to the Atlantic above Cape Gracias à Dios. The still contested
                    Costa Rica frontier may be taken as practically defined by the course of the San
                    Juan river and the south side of Lake Nicaragua to within 14 miles of the
                    Pacific, where it is marked by a conventional line drawn across the isthmus from
                    the mouth of the Sapoa river to Salinas Bay on the Pacific. Within these limits,
                    and including the Reserva Mosquita (Mosquito territory), the state comprises a
                    total area of 58,500 square miles, with a population usually estimated at
                    400,000, but by the census of 1882 reduced to 275,816, and distributed over ten
                    departments, as under :—</p>

                <p>The low monotonous and swampy Mosquito Coast is broken by the two lagoons of
                    Pearl Cay and Bluefields, and is fringed by a few cays (islets) and reefs, such
                    as Great and Little Corn, Longreef, and Tangweera, which shelter no harbours,
                    and serve only to obstruct the navigation. Here the only port is Grey town (San
                    Juan del Norte), formed by the northern branch of the San Juan delta, and now
                    nearly choked with sand. But the bold and rocky west coast, which extends for
                    about 200 miles from Coseguina Point to Salinas Bay, although destitute of
                    islands, presents a few convenient harbours, of which the chief are San Juan del
                    Sur, Brito, and especially Realejo, which is designed as the terminus of Captain
                    Bedford Pirn’s Transatlantic route, and which Dunlop declares to be “as good a
                    port as any in the known world,” although of somewhat difficult access.</p>
                <p>In Nicaragua the great geographical feature is the remarkable depression
                    stretching for about 300 miles north-west and south-east parallel with the
                    Pacific coast, and transversely to the Central American plateau, which it almost
                    completely interrupts. This depression, which lies at a mean elevation of
                    scarcely 100 feet above the sea, is now flooded by the two great lakes Managua
                    and Nicaragua (Cocibolca), which collect nearly all the drainage of the western
                    provinces, discharging it through the desaguadero (outlet) of the Rio San Juan
                    to the Atlantic. About midway between Lake Nicaragua and the Caribbean Sea, the
                    San Juan entirely pierces the main chain of the Cordillera de los Andes, which
                    here sweeps round the east side of the lacustrine basin at a mean height of 4000
                    or 5000 feet northwards to the Honduras highlands. Towards the lakes the descent
                    is very precipitous; but on the opposite side the land falls in broad terraced
                    plateaus down to the Mosquito coast.</p>
                <p>Throughout its entire length the depression is traversed by a remarkable volcanic
                    chain of isolated cones, which north of the lakes takes the name of the
                    Maribios, terminating in the extreme north-west with Coseguina (4000 feet), and
                    in the extreme south-east with the low wooded archipelagos of Solentiname and
                    Chichicaste near the head of the desaguadero. Between these two extremes the
                    chief cones, proceeding southwards, are—the Maribios chain, comprising El Viejo
                    (6000 feet), Santa Clara, Telica, Orota, Las Pilas, Axosco, Momotombo (7000
                    feet, highest point in the state), all crowded close together between the Gulf
                    of Fonseca and Lake Managua; Masaya or Popocatepec and Mombacho (5700 feet),
                    near Granada; lastly, in Lake Nicaragua the two islands of Zapatera and Ometepec
                    with its twin peaks Ometepec (4100 feet) and Madera (4190 feet). Several of
                    these are still active, or at least quiescent, and in 1835 Coseguina was the
                    scene of one of the most tremendous eruptions on record. The outbreak lasted
                    four days, during which sand fell in Jamaica, Mexico, and Bogota. After a long
                    repose Ometepec also burst into renewed activity on June 19, 1883, when the
                    lavas from a new crater began to overflow, and continued for seven days to
                    spread in various directions over the whole island. The eruption was accompanied
                    by incessant rumblings and earthquakes, in consequence of which the whole
                    population took refuge on the mainland. Mud, ashes, lavas, and rocks now cover
                    the mountain slopes, which had been under uninterrupted cultivation for many
                    centuries. In the Maribios district also occur several volcanic lakelets, such
                    as that of Masaya, besides numerous “infernillos,” low craters or peaks still
                    emitting sulphurous vapour and smoke, and at night often lighting up the whole
                    land with bluish flames. The <hi rend="italic">malpais,</hi> or barren
                    lava-fields, here extend for miles in some directions, and no other region of
                    equal extent probably betrays so many or so marked traces of igneous action as
                    that portion of Nicaragua intervening between its lakes and the Pacific
                    (Squier). Here the departments of Rivas and Granada are traversed by a low range
                    sometimes spoken of as the Coast Range, which seldom rises above 2000 feet, and
                    merges northwards in the magnificent plains of Leon and Conejo, that is, in the
                    northern section of the lacustrine depression. It is crossed by three low and
                    easy passes—at its southern extremity along the Costa Rica frontier, again
                    between the ports of La Virgen on Lake Nicaragua and S. Juan del Sur on the
                    Pacific, and in the north between Lake Managua near Nagarote and Tama-rinda Bay,
                    while it disappears altogether south of Leon, where the depression reaches the
                    coast at Realejo. Four alternative routes are thus afforded for the interoceanic
                    canal which is destined one day to connect the two seas through this great
                    depression (see vol. iv. p. 793).</p>
                <p>No rivers of any size flow westwards to the Pacific, the western provinces
                    discharging, as already stated, mainly through the San Juan emissary to the
                    Caribbean Sea. Yet Lake Managua, which lies 16 feet above Lake Nicaragua, and
                    150 (1) above sea-level, may now be regarded almost as a land-locked basin.
                    Although nearly 50 miles long by 25 broad, with a mean depth of 30 feet, it
                    seldom sends any overflow through the natural outlet of the Estero <pb

                    16 miles long, with a fall of 7 inches per mile, and a depth of 6 to 12 feet
                    during the rains, but at other times often quite dry. Other writers have
                    represented it as completely interrupted by a break or ridge 4 miles wide in the
                    centre, over which no water now ever flows from the upper lake (Boyle, i. p.
                    249). Fröbel also states that since the earthquake of 1835 the channel has been
                    closed, although J. Μ. Caceres, a native of Nicaragua, positively asserts that
                    the two basins still communicate <hi rend="italic">{Centro-America,</hi> Paris,
                    1880, p. 60).</p></note> down to the lower basin. It does not appear to have
                    undergone any perceptible change of level since the conquest; but some of its
                    former feeders have probably been displaced by the violent earthquakes, of which
                    this region is a chief centre. Thus the present inflow, except during high
                    floods, is mainly carried off by evaporation. But the larger lake continues to
                    receive the important Rio Frio from Costa Rica at its south-eastern extremity,
                    besides numerous perennial streams, especially from the western slopes of the
                    Cordillera de los Andes. Hence there is an abundant discharge through the Rio
                    San Juan, a deep, sluggish stream 128 miles long, from 100 to 400 yards broad,
                    10 to 20 feet deep, but unfortunately obstructed by five dangerous rapids
                    presenting insuperable obstacles to steam navigation.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is often asserted that these rapids were
                    artificially formed by the Spaniards themselves to prevent the buccaneers from
                    penetrating to Lake Nicaragua. But Herrera <hi rend="italic">{Dec.</hi> iii.,
                    book 2, chap. 3) speaks of the ’ ‘ great rocks and falls” which prevented
                    Cordova, the first circumnavigator of the lake, from descending the San Juan in
                    1522. On the other hand, the English traveller Gage tells us that in his time
                    (17th centitry) vessels reached Granada direct from Spain. Nevertheless there
                    can be little doubt that the rapids are natural obstructions, representing all
                    that now remains of the Cordilleras which have at this point been pierced by the
                    San Juan.</p></note> The lake itself is the largest fresh-water basin between
                    Michigan and Titicaca, being nearly 100 miles long by 40 broad and 240 feet deep
                    in some places, but shoaling considerably, especially towards the outlet, where
                    it falls to 6 or 8 feet. Under the influence of the intermittent trade winds it
                    rises and falls regularly towards the south side, whence the popular notion that
                    it was a tidal lake. It is also exposed to the dangerous Papagayos tornadoes,
                    caused by the prevailing north-easterly winds meeting opposite currents from the
                    Pacific.</p>
                <p>The little-known region of rugged plateaus and savannas occupying fully one-half
                    of the state between the lacustrine depression and the Mosquito Coast is watered
                    by several unnavigable streams, all draining from the Cordilleras eastwards to
                    the Atlantic, and all distinguished by a perplexing nomenclature. The chief are,
                    coming southwards, the Coco (Wanks or Segovia, known in its upper course as the
                    Telpaneca), the Warna (Sisin Creek), the Rio Grande (Great River or Amaltara),
                    the Escondida (Bluefields, Blewfields, Rio del Désastre).</p>
                <p>From the general relief of the land, as above set forth, its geological
                    constitution is sufficiently obvious. In the west we have the lavas, tufas,
                    sulphurs, pumice, and other recent volcanic formations of the Maribios system.
                    These are succeeded east of the lacustrine basin by andesite rocks, trachytes,
                    greenstone, and metalliferous porphyries of the Cordilleras, abounding in
                    auriferous and argentiferous quartz, especially in Chontales and the uplands of
                    northwest Segovia. Then come the older plutonic upheavals, crystallized schists,
                    dolerites, &amp;c., apparently stretching down to the Mosquito Coast region,
                    where they appear to underlie the comparatively modern sedimentary formations
                    and alluvia of the streams flowing eastwards to the Caribbean Sea. The Chontales
                    gold mines, which have been intermittently worked for many years past, lie about
                    midway between the Atlantic and Pacific between ll <hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi> and 13° N. lat. and 85° and 86° W. long., and the mining industry is
                    centred chiefly about Libertad, capital of Chontales, and Santo Domingo in the
                    Matagalpa district.</p>
                <p>There is very little gold washing in any of the eastern streams, the metal being
                    found almost exclusively in the quartz lodes, which run generally east and west
                    in close parallel lines, varying in thickness from 2 or 3 to 20 feet, and in
                    productiveness from a few pennyweights to 2 or 3 ounces per ton. The chief
                    silver mines are those of Matagalpa and Dipilto towards the Honduras frontier,
                    but the total annual yield of the precious metals seldom exceeds £40,000.</p>
                <p>Lying at a mean elevation of 2000 to 3000 feet above sea-level, the Chontales and
                    Segovian uplands enjoy a mild climate, generally healthy and well-suited for
                    European constitutions. But elsewhere the climate is distinctly tropical, with
                    two seasons—wet from May to November, dry throughout the winter months—and a
                    mean annual temperature of about 80° Fahr., falling to 70° at night and rising
                    to 90° at noon in summer. Nicaragua comes within the zone of the wet north-east
                    trade winds, which sweep inland from the Atlantic, unintercepted by any great
                    elevations till they reach the lofty Ometepec and Madera peaks. Hence the
                    heaviest rainfall occurs along the west side of the lacustrine basin, with an
                    annual mean at Rivas of 102 inches. Elsewhere the summer rainfall is about 90,
                    the winter from 8 to 10 inches. The flat, low-lying Mosquito region being
                    exposed to the inundations of the numerous streams from the Cordilleras, and to
                    the exhalations from the stagnant waters of the coast lagoons, is very
                    malarious, and the fever here endemic is especially fatal to Europeans.</p>
                <p>In the volcanic western provinces the soil is extremely fertile, yielding, where
                    cultivated and irrigated, magnificent crops of sugar, cotton, rice, tobacco,
                    coffee, cocoa, and maize. Much indigo was produced here formerly from an
                    indigenous variety, the <hi rend="italic">Indigofera disperma,</hi> L., but this
                    industry has been neglected since the revolution. Sugar yields two or three
                    crops, and maize as many as four, this cereal supplying a chief staple of food.
                    Plantains, bananas, beans, tomatoes, yams, arrowroot, pine-apples, guavas,
                    citrons, and many other tropical fruits are also cultivated, while the extensive
                    primeval forests of the central provinces abound in mahogany, cedars, rosewood,
                    ironwood, caoutchouc (uZe), gum copal, vanilla, sarsaparilla, logwood, and many
                    other dye-woods, medicinal plants, and valuable timbers. Conspicuous amongst the
                    forest trees is the splendid Coyol palm <hi rend="italic">{Cocos butyracea,</hi>
                    L.), with feathery leaves 15 to 20 feet long and golden flowers 3 feet, and
                    yielding a sap which when fermented produces the intoxicating <hi rend="italic"
                    >chicha</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vino de Coyol.</hi> In Chontales occurs the
                    remarkable <hi rend="italic">Herrania purpurea,</hi> a ‘ ‘ chocolate tree,”
                    whose seeds yield a finer-flavoured chocolate than the cocoa itself. The forest
                    growths are on the whole inferior in size to those of corresponding latitudes in
                    the eastern hemisphere; the tropical vegetation, especially about Nindiri and
                    elsewhere in the west, is unsurpassed for beauty, exuberance, and variety.</p>
                <p>The Nicaraguan fauna differs in few respects from that of the other
                    Central-American states. Here the jaguar, puma, and ocelot still infest all the
                    wooded districts, alligators swarm in the lakes and in the San Juan and other
                    rivers, while the vulture, buzzard, toucans, humming birds, and howling monkeys
                    are almost everywhere familiar sights. Amongst the endless species of reptiles
                    occur the harmless boba or “chicken snake,” python, and black snake, the
                    venomous corali, taboba, culebra de sangre, and rattlesnake, iguanas of great
                    size, scorpions, edible lizards, and others said to be poisonous (Boyle). Of
                    useful animals by far the most important are the horned cattle, large herds of
                    which are bred on the savannas of the central and northern provinces. Their
                    hides form one of the staples of the export trade, the other chief items of
                    which are gold and silver bullion, coffee, and gums, amounting to a yearly sum
                    of about £400,000, against £300,000 imports, mainly European and United States
                    manufactured goods.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    exports in 1880 amounted to £411,500, the imports to £295,000. For the same year
                    the revenue was £487,000, the expenditure rather more; the public debt was
                    £700,000.</p></note></p>
                <p>From the numerous sepulchral mounds, monumental ruins, and other remains thickly
                    strewn over Chontales and all the western provinces, as well as from the direct
                    statements of the early Spanish writers, it appears that most of Nicaragua was
                    densely peopled at the time of the conquest. In many districts colossal
                    monolithic statues of men and gods, crumbling temples, cairns, and tombs of all
                    sizes are met in every direction, and in some places the inhabitants still
                    supply themselves with pottery from the vast quantities of fictile vessels
                    preserved below the surface, or piled up <pb break="no"

                    One explorer speaks of “mountains of earthenware,” and another tells us that
                    “around Libertad the tombs are in thousands, offering every possible variety of
                    form, size, and thickness.” Monuments of this sort have been found ranging from
                    20 to over 170 feet in length and 120 in breadth, built of huge stones piled up
                    5 feet in thickness, which must have been brought from great distances. Managua
                    appears to have had a population of 40,000; mention is made of other cities four
                    miles in extent; and when Gil Gonzalez penetrated into the country in 1522 he
                    found in one district a cluster of six considerable towns all less than two
                    leagues apart. But ‘ ‘ a few years of Spanish rule sufficed to turn whole tracts
                    of flourishing country into uninhabited wilds” (H. H. Bancroft), and, after
                    making every allowance for the defective character of the last census returns,
                    the present population of the whole state cannot be estimated at more than
                    400,000. A calculation based on the partial census of 1846 gave 300,000, of whom
                    about 100,000 were pure-blood Indians, 150,000 half-castes (Mestizoes, Zambos,
                    &amp;c.), 20,000 Negroes, and 30,000 whites. Throughout the present century the
                    whites appear to have shown a general tendency to diminish, and the indigenous
                    element is by some now estimated at fully one half of the whole population.</p>
                <p>With the exception of some wild tribes in the interior of Mosquitia, nearly all
                    the natives are now in a more or less civilized state, and have generally
                    adopted the Spanish language. At the time of the conquest Herrera tells us that
                    five distinct languages were current in Nicaragua :—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caribisi</hi> (Carib) on the east coast, now represented by the Rama, Toaca,
                    Poya, and Waikna (Mosco); the <hi rend="italic">Chontai</hi> of Chontales,
                    Segovia, and parts of West Honduras and Salvador, now represented by the Woolwa
                    in Chontales and Mosquitia; the <hi rend="italic">Chorotegan</hi> (Dirian),
                    mainly between Lake Managua and the Pacific and thence north to Honduras, now
                    extinct; the <hi rend="italic">Orotiiian</hi> between Lake Nicaragua and the
                    Pacific (department of Rivas) and thence south to the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa
                    Rica, also extinct; the <hi rend="italic">Cholutec</hi> (Niquiran), a pure Aztec
                    dialect spoken in the large islands of Lake Nicaragua, and about Masaya,
                    Granada, and other districts, especially along the north-west side of the lake,
                    where it still survives among a few scattered communities. The presence of Aztec
                    settlements in this region, and at one time even amongst the Chontales of the
                    opposite side of the lake, is abundantly established by this survival, by the
                    archaeological remains found in the islands and adjacent mainland, and
                    especially by the Aztec geographical nomenclature widely diffused throughout the
                    whole of West Nicaragua; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Popogatepee =
                    Popocatepetl, the local name of the Masaya volcano; Ometepec or Ometepet =

                    Mexico itself, and are important as showing that the Cholutecs are comparatively
                    recent intruders from the Anahuac plateau, not the original stock of the Aztec
                    nation, as has been suggested by some ethnologists.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It should be noted in this connexion that
                    Buschmann has clearly traced a distinct Aztec geographical terminology
                    throughout the whole of Centn.1 America from Guatemala to Comayagua in Honduras
                    on the one hand, and on the other through San Salvador and West Nicaragua nearly
                    to the Costa Rica frontier. The Pipil, an Aztec dialect rather more divergent
                    than the Cholutec ∙f Nicaragua, is still current in parts of Guatemala and San
                    Salvador, but no evidence of Aztec settlements has been discovered either in
                    Yucatan or in Costa Rica <hi rend="italic">(Ueber die</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Besides the Caribisi, or continental Caribs of Herrera, the Mosquito Coast is
                    occupied by other Carib communities, which are descended from the Caribs removed
                    thither from the island of St Vincent by the English in 1796. To these alone the
                    name of Carib is now applied, although they are not pure-blood Indians, but
                    Zambos, in whom the Negro features greatly predominate. The Woolwas of the
                    interior of Mosquitia and Chontales are divided into a great number of tribes
                    collectively known as Bravos, that is, wild or uncivilized, who live chiefly on
                    hunting and fishing, and are practically independent of the Nicaraguan
                    Government. The term Bravo itself is the exact Spanish equivalent of the Aztec
                    Chontai, Chondal, that is, “barbarian,” which at the time of the discovery was
                    applied by the Cholutecs to all the tribes dwelling east of the great lakes and
                    on the Cordillera de los Andes as far north as Honduras and San Salvador. Here
                    they seem to have supplanted a still more ancient race, who had attained a high
                    state of civilization, as attested by the already-mentioned monuments and stone
                    sculptures of Chontales, which are of a different type both from the Aztec and
                    the Maya-Quiché remains of Yucatan and Guatemala.</p>
                <p>According to the electoral law of 1858 Nicaragua forms a democratic republic
                    modelled on that of the United States, with a legislative assembly of eleven
                    members, a senate of ten, and a president elected for four years and assisted by
                    a cabinet of four ministers. The seat of government, formerly Granada and Leon,
                    has since 1858 been Managua on the south-west side of Lake Managua. Although
                    Roman Catholicism is still recognized as the state religion, the free exercise
                    of all others is guaranteed, together with freedom of the press and of
                    education. Public instruction, which is provided for by one university, three
                    colleges, two hundred schools, and an annual grant of £10,000, is still in a
                    very backward state. The total attendance at the national schools in 1882 was
                    5000, or less than 8 per cent, of the whole population. The criminal charges in
                    the same year were 1938, or 5 per 1000, showing a slight improvement on previous
                    years. There are no railways, and very few good roads even between the large
                    towns and seaports. But the telegraph system (800 miles) was completed in 1882,
                    and in the same year Nicaragua joined the Universal Postal Union. The telegraph
                    despatches forwarded through twenty-six offices numbered 81,000; letters and
                    packages of all sorts, l,119,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>First discovered and coasted by Columbus during his fourth and last voyage in
                    1502, Nicaragua was not regularly explored till 1522, when Gil Gonzalez Davila
                    penetrated from the Gulf of Nicoya to the western provinces and sent his
                    lieutenant Cordova to circumnavigate the great lake. The country takes its name
                    from Nicaragua (also written Micaragua), a powerful Cholutec chief, ruling over
                    most of the land between the lakes and the Pacific, who received Davila in a
                    friendly spirit, and accepted baptism at his hands. Nicaragua’s capital seems to
                    have occupied the site of the present town of Rivas over against Ometepec, and
                    soon afterwards the Spaniards overran the country with great rapidity, both from
                    this centre northwards, and southwards from the Honduras coast. The occupation
                    began with sanguinary conflicts between the two contending waves of intrusion,
                    and down to the present day this region has had little respite from external
                    attack and internal convulsions. Granada was founded in 1524 on the isthmus
                    between the two lakes as the capital of a separate government, which, however,
                    was soon attached as a special intendence to the general captaincy of Guatemala,
                    comprisiiιg the whole of Central America and the present Mexican state of
                    Chiapas. Hence, during the Spanish tenure, the history of Nicaragua is merged in
                    that of the surrounding region. Of its five earliest rulers “the first had been
                    a murderer, the second a murderer and rebel, the third murdered the second, the
                    fourth was a forger, the fifth a murderer and rebel” (Boyle). Then came the
                    hopeless revolts of the Indians against intolerable oppression, the abortive
                    rebellions of Hernandez de Contreras and John Bermejo (Bermudez) against the
                    mother country (1550), the foundation of Leon, future rival of Granada, in 1610,
                    and its sack by Dampier in 1685, and, lastly, the declaration of independence
                    (1821), not definitively acknowledged by Spain till 1850.</p>
                <p>In 1823 Nicaragua joined the Federal Union of the five Central American states,
                    which was finally dissolved in 1833. While it lasted Nicaragua was the scene of
                    continual bloodshed, caused partly by its attempts to secede from the
                    confederacy, partly by its wars with Costa Rica for the possession of the
                    disputed territory of Guanacaste between the great lake and the Gulf of Nicoya,
                    partly also by the bitter rivalries of the cities of Leon and Granada,
                    respective headquarters of the Liberal and Conservative parties. During the
                    brief existence of the Federal Union “no fewer than three hundred and ninety-six
                    persons exercised the supreme power of the republic and the different states”
                    (Dunlop’s <hi rend="italic">.Report).</hi> Since then the independent government
                    of Nicaragua has been distinguished almost beyond all other Spanish-American
                    states by an uninterrupted series of military pronunciamientos, popular revolts,
                    partial or general revolutions, by which the land has been wasted, its former
                    industries destroyed, and the whole people reduced to a state of moral
                    debasement scarcely elsewhere paralleled in Christendom. Conspicuous amongst the
                    episodes of this sanguinary drama was the filibustering expedition of General
                    Walker, who was at first invited by the democrats of Leon to assist them against
                    the aristocrats of Granada, and who, after seizing the supreme power in 1856,
                    was expelled by the combined forces of the neighbouring states, and on venturing
                    to return was shot at Truxillo on September 25, 1860. A truce to these
                    internecine troubles has been recently brought about by mutual exhaustion; and,
                    should any of the schemes of interoceanic canalization be carried out, it may be
                    hoped that a national revival will take place under more favourable prospects
                    for the future.</p>
                <p>One source of serious embarrassment has been removed by the settlement of the
                    Mosquito reserve question. This territory, which stretches along the Caribbean
                    coast from the Sisin Creek to the Rama river (from 10° 30' to 13° N. lat.) and
                    for about 40 miles inland, had enjoyed a semi-independent position under the
                    nominal protection of Great Britain from 1655 to 1850. By the Clayton-Bulwer
                    treaty of 1850, England resigned all claims to the Mosquito Coast, and by the
                    treaty of Managua in 1860 ceded the protectorate absolutely to Nicaragua. The
                    local chief was induced to accept this arrangement on the condition of retaining
                    his administrative functions and receiving a yearly subvention of £1000 from the
                    suzerain state for the ten years ending in 1870. But he died in 1864, and
                    Nicaragua has never recognized his successor. Nevertheless the reserve continues
                    to be ruled by a chief elected by the natives, and assisted by an administrative
                    council, which assembles at Bluefields, capital of the territory.</p>
