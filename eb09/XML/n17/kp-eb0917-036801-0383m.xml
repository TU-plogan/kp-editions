                    notable for the fact that there is an apse above the crypt and another at the
                    opposite end of the building. To the north of the nave rises a massive but
                    highly-decorated tower. Of higher architectural interest as a remarkable
                    specimen of the Romanesque style of Auvergne is the church of St Étienne,
                    consecrated at the close of the 11th <pb break="no"

                    Cluny. The ducal palace at Nevers (now occupied by the courts of justice and a
                    ceramic museum) was built in 1475 by J. de Clamecy, count of Nevers, and is one
                    of the principal feudal edifices in central France. A middle tower, containing
                    the great staircase, has its windows adorned by sculptures relating to the
                    history of the house of Cleves. In front of the palace lies a wide open space
                    with a fine view over the valley of the Loire. The Porte de Croux, dating from
                    the end of the 14th century, is the only remnant of the old fortifications; it
                    now contains a collection of sculptured stones and some Roman antiquities. The
                    modern triumphal arch (18th century), the townhouse and library, the almshouses,
                    and the mother-house •of the Nevers sisters of charity may also be mentioned.
                    The Loire is crossed by a fine stone bridge of fifteen arches, and a cast-iron
                    railway bridge. Up to 1880 there was at Nevers a navy cannon foundry which,
                    furnished with eight blast-furnaces capable of melting 40 tons at once, used to
                    turn out 250 pieces per annum. It has now been combined with the foundry at
                    Ruelle (Charente); and the works are transformed into a practical school for
                    such branches as boiler-making and engine-fitting. The town also contains
                    private engineering establishments, potteries and porcelain works, chemical
                    works, pit-cable factories, file-works, oil-works, tanneries, and wool-spinning
                    mills. Commercially it has the advantage of being a large railway junction,
                    communicating with Paris and Orleans by Gien, with Bourges, Moulins, and Dijon
                    by Chagny, and with Auxerre by Clamecy. Population in 1881, 23,846.</p>
                <p>Noviodunum, or (later) Nevirnum, derived its name from two Celtic words <hi
                    rend="italic">nov,</hi> a river, and <hi rend="italic">dun,</hi> a hill. The
                    quantities of medals and other Roman antiquities found on the site indicate the
                    importance of the place at the time when Caesar chose it as a military dépôt for
                    corn, money, and hostages. It had counts of its own as early as 987, and
                    obtained a charter in 1194. Subject for a time to the dukes of Burgundy, it next
                    passed to the German house of Cleves. In 1538 Francis I. erected the Nivernais
                    into a ducal peerage, which, becoming in 1565 the property of the Gonzaga of
                    Mantua, was purchased from them by Cardinal Mazarin, and remained in his family
                    till the Revolution. For a short time in the 14th century the town was the seat
                    of a university, afterwards transferred to Orleans.</p>
