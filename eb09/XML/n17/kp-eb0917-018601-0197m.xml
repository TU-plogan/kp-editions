                <p><label type="entry">NAPIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir William Francis
                    Patrick</hi></label> (1785-1860), the third son of Colonel and Lady Sarah
                    Napier, and brother of Sir Charles and Sir George Napier, was born at
                    Cellbridge, near Dublin, on the 17th of December 1785. He became an ensign in
                    the Royal Irish Artillery in 1800, but at once exchanged into the 62d, and was
                    put on halfpay in 1802. He was afterwards made a cornet in the Blues by his
                    uncle the duke of Richmond, and exchanged into the 52d regiment. He obtained a
                    company in a West India regiment, but exchanged again into the 43d when it was
                    being trained at Shorncliffe under Sir John Moore, who took Napier into special
                    favour, and won his everlasting gratitude. He served in Denmark, and was present
                    at the engagement of Kioge, and, his regiment being shortly afterwards sent to
                    Spain, he bore himself nobly through the retreat to Corunna. In 1809 he became
                    aide-de-camp to his uncle in Ireland, but joined the 43d when ordered again to
                    Spain. With the light brigade (the 43d, 52d, and 95th), under the command of
                    General Craufurd, he marched to Talavera in the famous forced march which he has
                    described in his <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> and had a violent attack of
                    ])leurisy on the way. He, however, refused to leave Spain, was wounded on the
                    Coa, and shot near the spine at Cazal Nova. His conduct was so conspicuous
                    during the pursuit of Masséna after he left the lines of Torres Vedras that he
                    as well as his brother George was recommended for a brevet majority. He became
                    brigade major, was present at Fuentes d’Onor, but had so bad an attack of ague
                    that he was obliged to return to England. In England he fell in love with and
                    married Caroline Fox, the daughter of General Henry Fox, with whom Moore had
                    been in love in Sicily. Three days after his marriage he again started for
                    Spain, and was present at the storming of Badajoz, where his great friend
                    Colonel M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Leod was killed. In the absence of the
                    new lieutenant-colonel he took command of the 43d regiment, and commanded it at
                    the battle of Salamanca. After a short stay at home he again joined his regiment
                    at the Pyrenees, and did his greatest military service at the battle of the
                    Nivelle, where, with instinctive military insight, he secured the most strongly
                    fortified part of Soult’s position, practically without orders. He served with
                    his regiment at the battles of the Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse. For his services
                    he was made brevet lieutenant-colonel, and one of the first C.B.’s. Like his
                    brother Charles he then entered the military college at Farnham. He commanded
                    his regiment in the army of occupation in France until 1819, when he retired on
                    halfpay. As it was impossible for him to live on his half-pay with a wife and
                    family, he determined to become an artist, and took a house in Sloane Street,
                    where he studied with George Jones, the academician. The years he had spent in
                    France he had occupied in improving his general education, for it will hardly be
                    believed that the author of the <hi rend="italic">History of the War in the
                    Peninsula</hi> could not spell or write respectable English till that time. But
                    his career was to be great in literature, not in art. The tendency appeared in
                    an able review of Jomini in 1821, and in 1823 Mr Bickersteth, afterwards Lord
                    Langdale, suggested to him the expediency of writing a history of the Peninsular
                    War. For some time he did not take kindly to the suggestion, but at last
                    determined to become an author in order to defend the memory of Sir John Moore,
                    and to prevent the glory of his old chief being overshadowed by that of
                    Wellington. The duke of Wellington himself gave him much assistance, and handed
                    over to him the whole of Joseph Bonaparte’s correspondence which had been taken
                    at the battle of Vittoria; this was all in cipher, but Mrs Napier, with great
                    patience, discovered the keys. In 1828 the first volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> appeared, and it was at once seen that the great deeds of the
                    Peninsular War were about to be fitly commemorated. The excitement which
                    followed the publication of each volume is proved by the innumerable pamphlets
                    issued by those who believed themselves to be attacked, and by personal
                    altercations with many distinguished officers. But the success of the book was
                    proved still more by the‘absence of competition than by these bitter
                    controversies. The histories of Southey and Lord Londonderry fell still-born,
                    and Sir George Murray, who had determined to produce <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                    history, gave up the attempt in despair. This success was due to a combina tion
                    of qualities which have justly secured for Napier the title of being the best
                    military historian England has produced. The best military histories have always
                    been written by eye-witnesses. It is impossible for a new generation to analyse
                    the military combinations and understand the minute facts which account for the
                    winning or losing of a battle, though it may often unravel political intrigues
                    which were veiled to the eyes of contemporaries. Napier added to this
                    qualification a wonderful insight into the nature of war, and was able to
                    describe and understand the movements and feelings of the French as well as of
                    the army in which he himself served. But neither contemporary knowledge nor
                    military ability could have made his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> memorable
                    without a peculiarly appropriate literary style. He knew well how to mingle
                    passages relating to individuals with descriptions of military movements, and
                    how to relieve the dryness of details by an occasional glance at more extended
                    subjects. He possessed an enthusiastic admiration for nearly all the heroes
                    whose deeds he touched on. His admiration for Napoleon was only second to that
                    for Moore, and he could feel for Soult in defeat as well as for Wellington in
                    the hour of victory. When in 1840 the last volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> was published, his fame not only in England but in France and
                    Germany was safely established. His life during these years had been chiefly
                    absorbed in his <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> but he had warmly sympathized
                    with the movement for political reform which was agitating England. The Radicals
                    of Bath pressed him to sit for their city, and it was commonly reported that if
                    the reformers had found it necessary to resort to force Colonel Napier would
                    have been their commander-in-chief. In 1842 he was promoted major-general, and
                    had given him the lieutenant-governorship of Guernsey. Here he found plenty of
                    occupation in controlling the relations between <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0198-0187"/> the soldiers and the inhabitants, and also found
                    time to propound a complete scheme of reform for the government of the island.
                    While he was at Guernsey his brother Charles had conquered Sind, and the attacks
                    made on the policy of that conquest brought William Napier again into the field
                    of literature. In 1845 he published his <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Conquest of</hi><hi rend="italic">Scinde,</hi> and in 1851 the corresponding <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Administration of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Scinde</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> books which in style and vigour rivalled
                    the great <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> but which, being written for
                    controversial purposes, are not likely to maintain such an enduring popularity.
                    In 1847 he resigned his governorship, and in 1848 was made a K.C.B., and settled
                    at Scinde House, Clapham Park. His time was fully occupied in defending his
                    brother, in revising the numerous editions of his <hi rend="italic">History</hi>
                    which were being called for, and in writing letters to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Times</hi> on every conceivable subject, whether military or literary. His
                    energy is the more astonishing when it is remembered that he never recovered
                    from the effects of the wound he had received at Cazal Nova, and that he often
                    had to lie on his back for months together.</p>
                <p>His domestic life was shadowed by the incurable affliction of his only son, and
                    when his brother Charles died in 1853 the world seemed to be darkening round
                    him. He devoted himself to writing the life of that brother, which appeared in
                    1857, and which is in many respects his most characteristic book. In the end of
                    1853 his younger brother, Captain Henry Napier, R.N., the historian of Florence,
                    died, and in 1855 his brother Sir George. Inspired by his work, he lived on till
                    the year 1860, when, broken by trouble, fatigue, and ill-health, he died (on
                    February 12) at Clapham.</p>
                <p>As a military historian Sir William Napier is incomparably superior to any other
                    English writer, and. his true compeers are Thucydides, Caesar, and Davila. All
                    four had been soldiers in the wars they describe; all four possessed a peculiar
                    insight into the mainsprings of action both in war and peace; and all four
                    possessed a peculiar and inimitable style. Napier always wrote as if he was
                    burning with an inextinguishable desire to express what he was feeling, which
                    gives his style a peculiar spontaneity, and yet he rewrote the first volume of
                    his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> no less than six times. His descriptions of
                    sieges and of battles are admirable by themselves, and his analyses of the
                    peculiarly intricate Spanish intrigues are even more remarkable, while the
                    descriptions and analyses are both lit up with flashes of political wisdom and
                    military insight. It is to be noted that he displays the spirit of the partisan,
                    even when most impartial, and defends his opinions, even when most undoubtedly
                    true, as if he were arguing some controverted question. If his style was
                    modelled on anything, it was on Caesar’s commentaries, and a thorough knowledge
                    of the writings of the Roman general will often explain allusions in Napier. The
                    portraits of Sir John Moore and Colonel M*Leod, and the last paragraphs
                    descriptive of the storming of Badajoz, may be taken as examples of the great
                    natural eloquence which arose from the loving recollection of friends, or the
                    deep impression made by a most terrible scene upon his vivid imagination.</p>
                <p>For Sir William Napier’s life, see his <hi rend="italic">Life and Letters,</hi>
                    edited by the Right Honourable H. A. Bruce (now Lord Aberdare), 2 vols., 1862.
                    The dates of his books are given above. The edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> published in 1851 is the best, and contains the answers to various
                    criticisms which sum up the controversies arising from statements in the work.
