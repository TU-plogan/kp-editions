                    to leave the south-east of the city more open to attack than any other part. The
                    principal ruin mounds within the walls are that of Kuyιinjik, north of the
                    Khausar, and that of the prophet Jonah (Nebi Υύ-nus) south of that stream. The
                    latter is the traditional site of Jonah’s preaching, and is crowned by an
                    ancient and famous Mohammedan shrine. The systematic exploration of these ruins
                    is mainly due to Layard (1845- 46), whose work has been continued by subsequent
                    diggers. These researches leave no doubt as to the correctness of the local
                    tradition. Not only have magnificent remains of Assyrian architecture and
                    sculpture been laid bare, but the accompanying cuneiform inscriptions throw much

                    23, the entrance to which towards the town was flanked by colossal man-headed
                    bulls and winged human figures. For the structure and art of the palaces see

                <p>Nineveh proper was only one of a group of cities and royal residences whose ruins
                    still mark the plain between the Tigris, the Great Zâb, and the Kliâzir. The
                    chief of these are at Khorsab&lt;id or Khurustâbâd, five hours by caravan
                    north-east of Mosul, on a tributary of the Khausar, and at Nimrùd, on the left
                    bank of the Tigris, eight caravan hours (18 miles) south-east from Kuyhnjik∙ The
                    former site was mainly explored by the Frenchmen Botta and Place. The city was
                    almost square, each face of the wall a little more than a mile in length. The
                    vast T-shaped palace of Sargon (722-705 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> whose
                    name the town bore (Dur-Sarrukin), stood near the northern angle. Its main
                    frontage was nearly a quarter of a mile long; it had thirty-one courts and more
                    than two hundred apartments.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There is some evidence that Syriac tradition connected these
                    ruins with the name of Sargon; though our authority Yâkùt, in giving the alleged
                    old name of Khurustâbâd, has corrupted Sarglnin into Sar'ün. by writing £ for A
                    = 3. Another Syriac tradition connects Khurustâbâd with Resen, finding the name
                    Resen in the neighbouring Râs al-'Ain (Rësh 'Aina). See Hoffmann, <hi

                <p>The ruins of Nimrud, identical with the ruin Athιir of Arabic geographers (Yi⅛ht,
                    <hi rend="italic">s.vv.</hi> “Athùr,” “Salâmiya”), and first excavated by
                    Layard, represent the ancient city of Kalhu, the Biblical Calah. The enclosure,
                    protected on the west by the old bed of the Tigris, is, according to Layard’s
                    measurements, a quadrangle of 2331 yards by 2095 at the widest part, and was
                    surrounded by walls with towers and moats. The chief architectural remains
                    belong to a group of palaces and temples which occupied the south-west quarter
                    of the city. The principal palace (north-west palace) was built by
                    Assur-nasir-pal (885-860 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and beside it he
                    raised a temple with a great tower (falsely called the tomb of Sardanapalus)
                    built in narrowing stages. The so-called central palace is that of his son
                    Shalmaneser II.; the unfinished south-west palace was the work of Esarhaddon. Of
                    the so-called south-east palace the chief part is really a temple of Nebo; a
                    statue of the god from this temple is in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>The main points in the history of these three great cities which are held to be
                    established by monumental evidence are these. The ancient capital of Assyria was
                    Assur (KaΓa Sherkat) on the Tigris, 5θ miles south of Mosul. Assur-nasir-pal
                    transferred the residence to Calah, a city which he tells us upon an inscription
                    had been originally founded by Shalmaneser I. (c. 1300 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), but had subsequently fallen into decay. Calah seems to have been
                    the chief seat of the kings till Sargon the captor of Samaria founded his
                    residence at Khorsabad; the glory of Nineveh proper begins with Sennacherib, but
                    the city existed earlier, for his inscribed bricks represent him only as
                    rebuilder of the walls. It is even averred that kings of the 19th and 15th
                    centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> built temples at Nineveh, but the
                    remoter dates of Assyrian history must be received with caution.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The legend of Ninus and
                    Semiramis in classical authors appears to be of late origin and quite
                    uuhistorical. Ninus is merely the eponym hero of Nineveh.</p></note> From the
                    time of Sennacherib down to the fall of the capital and empire—an event the date
                    of which is still uncertain, the ancient accounts varying between 626 and 608
                    B.c.—Nineveh proper, that is, the city on the Tigris and Khausar, appears to
                    have been the chief seat of empire. But when the book of Jonah speaks of Nineveh
                    as a city of three days’ journey, or when Ctesias in Diodorus ii. 3 describes
                    its circuit as 480 stadia, it is plain that these conceptions imply an extension
                    of the name to the whole group of cities between the Tigris and the Zâb. In this
                    connexion the words of Gen. X. 11 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> are remarkable;
                    for, on the most natural view, the clause “this is the great city” applies not
                    to Resen alone but to the four cities of Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, and Resen.
                    Rehoboth Ir and Resen are still untraced; the Syriac tradition which connects
                    the latter with Rêsh 'Ainâ, that is, with Khorsâbad, does not agree with the
                    text, which says expressly that Resen was between Nineveh and Calah, and indeed
                    the verses in Genesis appear to be older than the foundation of the city of
                    Sargon. The description would suit the mound of Salâmiya a little above Nimrud,
                    but in fact the whole district is studded with ruins.</p>
