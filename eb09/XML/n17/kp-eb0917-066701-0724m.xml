                <p><label type="entry">NUTRITION</label></p>
                <p>BY the term nutrition, employed in its widest sense, is understood the process,
                    or rather the assemblage of processes, concerned in the maintenance and repair
                    of the living body as a whole, or of its constituent parts or organs. The term
                    has, however, usually been limited in systematic treatises on physiology to a
                    study, mainly statistical, of the relations which exist between a living being
                    and the medium which it inhabits, embracing a determination of the gains and
                    losses of the organism under the different conditions to which it may be
                    exposed. Such a statistical study has already been pursued in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dietetics,</hi> and we shall therefore in the present article,
                    restricting our attention to the animal kingdom, consider nutrition in the more
                    general sense above referred to, including—(1) a study of the function of
                    digestion; (2) a sketch of the processes concerned in the absorption of matter

                <p>With the exception of the chemical processes concerned in respiration, which will
                    be treated of at length under that head, this article will therefore include a
                    short discussion of the chemical operations of the body generally, and
                    particularly as they are exemplified in the case of man.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Introductory Considerations.—</hi> There is no
                    conception which we can form in reference to a living being, however rudimentary
                    its structure, which is so general as the following a living animal, so long as
                    it manifests those attributes which characterize it as living, is the seat of
                    continual transformations of potential into kinetic energy.</p>
                <p>Such transformations are connected with oxidation of organic matters which,
                    primarily derived from the vegetable kingdom, have been <hi rend="italic"
                    >assimilated, i.e.,</hi> have been converted into the substance of the animal,
                    and are effected through the agency of oxygen gas introduced into the body in
                    the process of respiration. The act of living is an act of combustion in which
                    the animal body actually burns, and the energy at the disposal of the body, and
                    which is employed in raising its temperature or effecting the movements which
                    are essential to its continued life, is energy which was potential in the
                    organic constituents burned. The main products of the combustion of the body are
                    carbonic acid and water, besides certain other less completely oxidized
                    substances, which are the analogues of the sooty and tarry products of
                    combustion in a furnace. Of these products some, as carbonic acid and a part of
                    the water formed, are removed from the body almost as soon as they are formed,
                    while others are thrown off at intervals.</p>
                <p>It follows from what has been stated that the act of living necessarily implies
                    not only transformation of energy but actual waste of the matter of the body,
                    and that if an animal is continuously to manifest the phenomena of life it must
                    be supplied with oxidizable organic matter to take the place of that which has
                    been oxidized. Accordingly, animal life is impossible unless the creature,
                    besides receiving continual supplies of oxygen gas, receives at intervals
                    supplies of food. The food of an animal consists (1) of oxidizable organic
                    matters which, although they may have been derived in part or wholly from some
                    other animal body, have primarily been built up through the instrumentality of
                    vegetable organisms,—these organic matters belong to a few well-defined groups:
                    (2) of mineral matters, including large quantities of water, which form an
                    important part of the substance of the body, and the presence in and passage of
                    which through the organism is essential to the physical processes which have
                    their seat in it.</p>
                <p>In brief, the animal body is the seat of processes of disintegration associated
                    with the manifestation of kinetic energy, and of processes of integration in
                    which oxidizable matters take the place of the oxidized constituents. If life is
                    to continue, in a sense, indefinitely it is essential that the processes of
                    integration and disintegration should balance, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that
                    the receipts of the body in assimilable oxidizable matter should balance the
                    expenditure of the body both in matter and energy. There are, it will be
                    observed, very close analogies between an animal and such a mechanism as a
                    steam-engine, the energy at the disposal of both being primarily derived from
                    the oxidation of combustible matters. Some of the most salient points of
                    difference must, however, not be lost sight of. (1) The waste of the essential
                    parts of such a machine as a steam-engine is insignificant, and bears no
                    definite relation to the work done. The kinetic energy of the machine is
                    primarily due to oxidation processes taking place in the furnace, and in no
                    respect to changes in the substance of the machine. The animal, on the other
                    hand, wastes continuously in all its parts and organs, and much of its energy is
                    derived immediately from material which has become part and parcel of the
                    various mechanisms. (2) Any substance capable of being rapidly oxidized
                    (burned), and thus of generating heat, may be used as fuel for a steam-engine,
                    provided its combustion admits of being conducted with safety in its furnace,
                    whilst the substances which can form the food of animals belong to a limited
                    number of groups, which include but a comparatively small number of bodies. The
                    constituents of food have not only to supply energy to the body, but they must
                    further be capable of prior conversion into the very substance of the animal
                    body, into its very “flesh and blood.”</p>
                <p>Moreover, the constituents of food must be free from all traces of the peculiar
                    substances which we term “poisons,” and which by their presence have the power
                    of impairing and arresting the action of various organs of the body.</p>
                <p>I.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Function of Digestion.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hunger and
                    Thirst.—</hi> These terms are used to express peculiar sensations which are
                    produced by and give expression to general wants of the system, satisfied
                    respectively by the ingestion of organic solids containing substances capable of
                    acting as food, and by water or liquids and solids containing water.</p>
                <p>Hunger is a peculiarly indefinite sensation of craving or want which is referred
                    to the stomach, but with which is often combined, always indeed in its most
                    pronounced stages, a general feeling of weakness or faintness. The earliest
                    stages are unattended with suffering, and, leading the animal to wish and seek
                    for food, are characterized as “appetite for food.” Hunger is normally appeased
                    by the introduction of solid or semi-solid nutriment into the stomach, and it is
                    probable that the almost immediate alleviation of the sensation under these
                    circumstances is in part due to a local influence, perhaps connected with a free
                    secretion of gastric juice. Essentially, however, the sensation of hunger is a
                    mere local expression of a general want, and this local expression ceases when
                    the want is satisfied, even though only liquid and no solid food is introduced
                    into the stomach, or even though no food be introduced into the stomach, the
                    needs of the economy being satisfied by the introduction of food through other
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n725/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0725-0668"/> channels, as, for example, when food which admits
                    of being readily absorbed is injected into the large intestine.</p>
                <p>Thirst is a peculiar sensation of dryness and heat localized in the tongue and
                    throat. Although thirst may be artificially produced by drying, as by the
                    passage of a current of air over the mucous membrane of the above parts,
                    normally it depends upon an impoverishment of the system in water. And, when
                    this impoverishment ceases, in whichever way this be effected, the sensation
                    likewise ceases. The injection of water into the blood, the stomach, or the
                    large intestine appeases thirst, though no fluid is brought in contact with the
                    part to which the sensation is referred.</p>
                <p>The sensations the causes of which we have briefly attempted to trace lead us, or
                    when urgent compel us, to take food and drink into the mouth. Once in the mouth,
                    the entrance to the alimentary canal, the food begins to undergo a series of
                    processes, the object of which is to extract from it as much as possible of its
                    nutritive constituents. It cannot be sufficiently emphasized that food in the
                    alimentary canal is, strictly speaking, outside the confines of the body; as
                    much so as the fly grasped in the leaves of the insectivorous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dionea</hi> is outside of the plant itself. The mechanical and chemical
                    processes to which the food is subjected in the stomach and intestines are
                    processes which have their seat and conditions outside the body which it is
                    destined to nourish, though unquestionably the body is no passive agent, and
                    innumerable glands have to come into action in order to supply the chemical
                    agents which shall dissolve and render assimilable those constituents of the
                    food which are capable of being absorbed into the organism, and of forming part
                    and parcel of its substance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure of the Organs of Digestion in Relation to their
                    Function.—</hi> The processes to which the food is subjected, though manifold,
                    are divisible into two great groups: (1) the food must be subjected to the
                    action of certain juices which dissolve insoluble alimentary matters, and modify
                    these no less than certain of the soluble alimentary substances; and (2) it must
                    be mechanically mixed with those juices, and propelled more or less slowly from
                    beginning to end of the alimentary canal. In accordance with this twofold
                    function the alimentary canal is divisible into two distinct but intercalated
                    anatomical tubes,—(1) an internal tube of mucous membrane, and (2), investing
                    this closely, an external muscular tube.</p>
                <p>The musculo-membranous double tube thus formed is not, indeed, regularly tubular
                    throughout. At the beginning it forms the irregular cavity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">mouth,</hi> which contains the <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> and
                    the masticatory <hi rend="italic">teeth.</hi> Thence it passes through the <hi
                    rend="italic">fauces</hi> and beneath the pendulous <hi rend="italic">uvula</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">soft palate</hi> into the <hi rend="italic">pharynx.</hi>
                    Afterwards it proceeds as a regular tube, the <hi rend="italic">oesophagus,</hi>
                    or gullet, until the level of the diaphragm is reached,—the muscular partition
                    between the thorax and the abdomen. Having passed through this structure, the
                    narrow tube of the oesophagus suddenly dilates at the cardiac orifice into the
                    bag called the <hi rend="italic">stomach,</hi> at the further or <hi
                    rend="italic">pyloric orifice</hi> of which the tube resumes its narrow uniform
                    calibre, and forms successively the <hi rend="italic">duodenum,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">jejunum,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">ileum,—</hi> parts of the
                    small intestine, of which, in man, the duodenum takes up twelve fingers’
                    breadth, the ileum the lower three-fifths, and the jejunum the remainder of the
                    total length of 20 feet. The small intestine diminishes somewhat in calibre from
                    duodenum to ileum, and at the lower end of the latter opens suddenly into the
                    much wider large intestine, which it joins, not at the extreme end, which is a
                    cul-de-sac, the <hi rend="italic">caput</hi><hi rend="italic">caecum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">coli,</hi> but at a point a little lower down. The margins of the
                    aperture by which the small opens into the large intestine point or project into
                    the latter in such a manner that, while they readily permit the passage of
                    matters from small to large intestine, any backward movement of the contents of
                    the large intestine would have the effect of compressing the lips of the opening
                    and closing it; this arrangement constitutes the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >itio-caecal</hi><hi rend="italic">valve.</hi> Connected with the <hi

                    is a small diverticulum like a narrow glove finger, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vermiform appendage.</hi> The first and greater part of the large intestine is
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">colon,</hi> the last as the <hi rend="italic"

                    the <hi rend="italic">anus.</hi></p>
                <p>Both muscular and membranous (mucous) tubes are continuous from mouth to anus,
                    and at these, the superior and inferior orifices, the mucous membrane which
                    constitutes what we have hitherto termed the membranous tube is continuous with
                    the skin which covers the general surface of the body. This mucous membrane is
                    covered throughout at its free surface by an epithelium, and gives lodgment to
                    glands, whose characters differ in different parts of the tube in accordance
                    with the function of the part. Below the epithelium is a connectée tissue
                    analogous to the <hi rend="italic">cutis vera</hi> of the skin, which in parts
                    has the character of ordinary fibro-areolar tissue, but in all parts from the
                    stomach downwards has the character of so-called adenoid connective tissue, as
                    it is found in the follicles of lymphatic glands. Its meshes support a τich
                    supply of fi ne blood-vessels,lymphatic vessels, and doubtless also of delicate
                    nervous filaments.</p>
                <p>Besides these elements there are found numerous small bundles, or in parts even
                    sheets, of involuntary muscular fibres, which probably give to the mucous
                    membrane the power of limited self-contraction, of such a nature as to further
                    the flux and reflux of fluids in the myriad lymphatic vessels of the part, and
                    perhaps to influence in no small degree the outpouring of the secretion of
                    certain of the glands. To the fairly continuous tract or sheet of
                    involuntarymuscle which lies at the base or deepest part of the mucous membrane
                    or <hi rend="italic">mucosa</hi> the term of <hi rend="italic"
                    >muscularis</hi><hi rend="italic">mucosae {tunica)</hi> is applied.</p>
                <p>In addition to the glands which lie embedded in and open upon the surface of the
                    mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, others of larger size and not in
                    immediate relation with its walls communicate with the interior of the tube by
                    ducts which open into it, and which pour into it their secretion; such glands
                    are the salivary glands, the pancreas, and the liver.</p>
                <p>The muscular tube in the greater part of its extent consists of two layers of
                    involuntary, non-striated, pale, muscular fibres,—an inner layer whose fibres
                    encircle the tube, and an outer one whose fibres run parallel to the long axis
                    of the tube. But this is not the arrangement of every part. There is an apparent
                    rather than a real exception in the stomach, where some layers of fibres of the
                    circular coat course over the dilated walls of the alimentary tube in an oblique
                    direction, giving rise to an oblique layer. In the oesophagus or gullet, besides
                    the typical circular and longitudinal layers, there is at the upper part a
                    second longitudinal layer which takes up a position internal to—that is, nearer
                    the mucous membrane than—the circular layers. In the upper part of the gullet
                    also the muscular fibres are not unstriped, but, although certainly involuntary,
                    are striated like voluntary muscles.</p>
                <p>In the mouth the muscular tube is most irregular and most defective, for the
                    mucosa is in parts directly applied to the bony boundaries, as over the hard
                    palate and gums; in another part it invests the muscular prominence of the
                    tongue; whilst in other regions it lies upon the constrictors of the pharynx and
                    the inner aspect of certain other muscles, as those of the cheeks, lips, and
                    floor of the mouth. The membranous tube is united to the muscular tube by a
                    loose layer of connective tissue containing many blood-vessels and lymphatic
                    vessels and nerves for the supply of the mucosa; it is often called the <hi
                    rend="italic">submucosa.</hi></p>
                <p>The mucous membrane is the seat of various secreting glands, which lie embedded
                    in its substance and open upon its surface,— simple or branched tubular recesses
                    running through the depth of the layer, lined by epithelium, continuous with,
                    though not always resembling, that of the surface, and opening at the surface by
                    minute pores. In the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus those form the <hi
                    rend="italic">acinous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">racemose</hi> glands, which,
                    according to certain subordinate features which they present, and also according
                    to certain of the characters of the fluids which they secrete, are separated
                    into mucous and serous glands. In the stomach they are represented <pb

                    In the duodenum we find them as simple tubular deep sockets, the glands or <hi

                    compound acinous glands of Brunner, which dip below the level of the mucosa and
                    lie in the submucosa. In the jejunum, ileum, and large intestine they appear
                    again as the crypts or follicles of Lieberkühn.</p>
                <p>The membranous tube is not everywhere exactly concentric and conterminous with
                    the muscular tube. In the mouth and pharynx it is almost entirely so, but at the
                    gullet the muscular tube so tightly encloses the membranous that the latter is
                    forced into longitudinal plications to find room for itself. In the stomach the
                    membranous layer is raised into ridges or <hi rend="italic">rugse,</hi> which
                    intersect and give the surface a honeycombdike aspect. In the upper part of the
                    small intestine the membranous tube is raised into deep annular or, more
                    correctly, crescentic folds, running across the direction of the gut like
                    incomplete diaphragms, or a series of membranous ledges; these are the <hi
                    rend="italic">valvulae</hi><hi rend="italic">conniventes.</hi> In the colon the
                    two tubes are so disposed as to form a regular series of saccules or pouches,
                    adding largely to the capacity of the gut. All these foldings greatly increase
                    the superficies of the membranous tube. A further enlargement is effected in the
                    small intestine in an exceedingly interesting fashion; the surface of the mucosa
                    is thickly studded with innumerable fine short projections resembling the pile
                    of velvet. These are invested by surface epithelium, and amongst them, at their
                    feet, open the before-mentioned crypts of Lieberkuhn. They are the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">villi.</hi> Each contains a lymphatic vessel, blood-vessels, and
                    involuntary muscular fibres, all supported by adenoid connective tissue like
                    that of the mucosa below; the lymphatic is in the axis of the villus, the
                    muscles form the next layer, and the blood-vessels lie immediately beneath the
                    epithelium. When the muscular layer of the villus contracts it must of necessity
                    compress the lymph-vessel, whilst causing no impediment to the flow of
                    blood.</p>
                <p>We have described the mucosa of the stomach and intestines as containing a
                    framework of adenoid reticular tissue like the tissue of lymphatic follicles. It
                    is, indeed, identical with this,—a network of branched cells with oval nuclei,
                    the meshes of which are crowded with lymph-corpuscles with round nuclei At
                    certain points in the intestines the adenoid tissue of the mucosa presents local
                    nodular enlargements; the mucosa at these points becomes so much thicker that it
                    swells up at the free surface beneath the epithelium into rounded eminences
                    about as large as millet-seeds or the heads of small pins; and at the under
                    surface of the mucosa it dips into the submucous tissue in a similar manner. At
                    the base of this nodule of adenoid tissue in the submucosa there is usually a
                    network of wide, thin-walled, lymphatic vessels. Many of these rounded masses
                    are scattered irregularly over the small and large intestines as the <hi
                    rend="italic">solitary follicles</hi> or <hi rend="italic">glands,</hi> but at
                    the lower end of the ileum they form little colonies, often covering an area an
                    inch or more in length, situated at that part of the intestine which is remote
                    from the attachment of the mesentery. They then constitute the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">Peyer s patches.</hi></p>
                <p>Nodular adenoid masses are, however, not limited to the adenoid mucosa of the
                    intestines. They are occasionally, though rarely, found in the stomach; they
                    exist beneath the mucous membrane of the tongue, and a colony of them forms the
                    mass of the tonsil on each side,—the almond-shaped body situated between the
                    posterior and anterior pillars of the fauces.</p>
                <p>The intrinsic nerves of the alimentary tube consist of two systems of nervous
                    networks with ganglion-cells lying at the nodes; one is found in the submucous
                    layer <hi rend="italic">{plexus of Meissner'),</hi> the other lies between the
                    longitudinal and circular muscles <hi rend="italic">{plexus of Auerbach,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">plexus</hi><hi rend="italic">myentericus).</hi></p>
                <p>The whole of the intestines, and the stomach as well, are sustained in the
                    abdominal cavity by sheets of delicate membrane, formed by folds of peritoneum,
                    and called, in the case of the intestinal portion of the tube, the <hi
                    rend="italic">mesentery.</hi> Between the layers of the mesentery run the
                    vessels and nerves for the supply of the bowel. In addition to blood-vessels
                    there are numerous thin-walled lymphatic vessels called <hi rend="italic"
                    >lacteals,</hi> which are fed by the rich network of lymphatic vessels of the
                    mucosa and submucosa, and which run in the mesentery to the back of the
                    abdominal cavity. Here they are collected into a large lymphatic reservoir, the
                    <hi rend="italic">receptaculum chyli,</hi> from which a duct, the <hi
                    rend="italic">thoracic duct,</hi> proceeds along the side of the vertebral
                    column to open into the venous system at the junction of the subclavian and
                    jugular veins on the left side of the neck. The lacteal and lymphatic vessels,
                    whose course has been briefly sketched, are interrupted at many points by the
                    presence of lymphatic glands. These may be simply regarded as labyrinthine
                    systems of vessels into which the simple afferent lymphatic or lacteal vessels
                    open, and each of which is surrounded and penetrated by adenoid connective
                    tissue, like that of the intestinal mucosa. After a meal the lacteal vessels are
                    filled with a milky fluid, the <hi rend="italic">chyle.</hi> They were
                    discovered by Aselli in the year 1626.</p>
                <p>It must not be thought that the glands of the mucous membrane of the alimentary
                    canal are alone engaged in the preparation of the solvent digestive fluids.
                    Other organs there are lying away from the alimentary canal which pour their
                    secretions into it by ducts at various points. In the neighbourhood of the mouth
                    there are three pairs of <hi rend="italic">salivary glands.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">parotid</hi> glands lie outside the cheek over the lower jaw, just
                    in front of the meatus of the ear. The ducts of this pair course along the
                    cheeks and pierce them opposite the second upper molar tooth on each side; these
                    are the two ducts of Stenson. A second pair of glands, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >submaxillary,</hi> lies beneath the ramus of the lower jaw and beneath the
                    floor of the mouth; their ducts run forward to open beneath the tongue; these
                    are the ducts of Wharton. The third pair, the <hi rend="italic">sublingual,</hi>
                    lies on the floor of the mouth, beneath the mucous membrane anterior to the
                    openings of the duets of Wharton.</p>
                <p>The ducts of these glands are numerous and open by many apertures on the floor of
                    the mouth, some opening into the ducts of Wharton. These constitute the ducts of
                    Rivinus.</p>
                <p>About three or four inches below the pylorus the ducts of two large glands open
                    into the small intestine by a common orifice; these are the ducts of Wirsung, or
                    <hi rend="italic">pancreatic ducts,</hi> from the pancreas on the left, and the
                    common bile-duct from the liver on the right.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Movements of the Alimentary Canal.—</hi> When food is
                    introduced into the mouth it is submitted to the operation of mastication. The
                    incisors or cutting teeth divide it into portions of suitable size, which are
                    thrust under the broad faces of the molar or grinding teeth by the alternate
                    movements of tongue and cheeks. Softer portions of food are crushed between
                    tongue and hard palate, especially such as are taken for their sapid properties
                    to please the palate and increase the flow of saliva. Mastication consists of
                    movements of the lower jaw upon the upper, viz., (1) vertical movements brought
                    about by the temporal and the internal pterygoid and masseter muscles on the one
                    hand, and by the digastric, mylo-hyoid, and other depressor muscles attached to
                    the lower jaw on the other; (2) horizontal movements, forwards and backwards,
                    effected by the external pterygoid muscles; when one of these muscles alone
                    contracts, the forward movement of the chin is changed to a forward and lateral
                    movement by the rotation of the jaw around the opposite condyle as a pivot;
                    after being moved forward the jaw is retracted by the horizontal fibres of the
                    temporal muscle; (3) grinding movements effected by a combination of the various
                    muscles already mentioned.</p>
                <p>That the tongue and cheeks are not frequently nipped between the teeth is an
                    indication of the perfect co-ordination of a very complex series of movements.
                    The controlling sensations are chiefly conveyed along the fibres of the fifth
                    cranial nerve. The motor fibres of the same nerve supply the chief but not all
                    the muscles of mastication.</p>
                <p>After the food has been reduced to a proper consistency by the combined influence
                    of the mechanical movements of the jaws, tongue, and cheeks, and the action of
                    the saliva, it is rolled into a mass or bolus ready for swallowing. The bolus is
                    pushed on the dorsum of the tongue, which is hollowed into a shallow trough to
                    receive it. It is easy to conceive how this shape of the tongue is brought about
                    when we consider that the tongue is provided with vertical fibres, with
                    horizontal antero-posterior fibres, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n727/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0727-0670"/> with horizontal lateral fibres, in addition to
                    its extrinsic muscles. The tip of the tongue is then raised against the hard
                    palate in such a manner as to form an angle in which the bolus lies. By the
                    approximation of the tongue to the palate the angle is lessened and the bolus
                    is, in consequence, driven backwards. This constitutes the first stage in the
                    act of swallowing, and is a voluntary act, At the end of the first stage the
                    morsel of food has passed beyond the level of the anterior pillars of the
                    fauces. The acts of the second stage are very complicated, and probably are
                    entirely involuntary. The posterior pillars of the fauces approach one another
                    in the middle line, and the uvula falls into the space left between them. The
                    fleshy curtain thus extemporized is then drawn up towards the hind wall of the
                    pharynx, which is drawn a little forwards and upwards to meet it. Thus the
                    passage into the nose is completely shut. Meanwhile the vocal cords of the
                    larynx draw near to one another; the epiglottis is pushed backwards over the
                    larynx, and the whole larynx is drawn suddenly upwards and forwards beneath the
                    root of the tongue. In this manner the entrance into the respiratory passages is
                    protected. Finally, the anterior pillars of the fauces are made to meet over the
                    tongue in order to prevent the regurgitation of the food. There is but one way
                    open to the bolus; the sudden drawing forward of the larynx and the base of the
                    tongue in fact “cuts the ground” from under the ball of food, which thereupon
                    falls into the grasp of the “constrictors” and enters upon the third and final
                    stage in the act of deglutition. This, even more certainly than the second
                    stage, is purely involuntary. The constrictors contract from above downwards and
                    force the morsel of food into the upper portion of the oesophagus. Once in the
                    gullet, the mass of food is driven downwards by the so-called “peristaltic”
                    movements of the tube—the circular fibres contract one after another from above
                    downwards, lessening the calibre of the tube in successive stages, whilst the
                    longitudinal fibres seem to have the function of drawing the tube over the bolus
                    as a stocking is drawn over the foot.</p>
                <p>Deglutition is a reflex act, in so far as it is involuntary, the centre for which
                    lies in the medulla oblongata; destruction of this centre implies incapacity to
                    swallow. The centre, though normally under the influence of the higher centres,
                    may, however, act quite independently of these, as is evidenced by the fact that
                    animals in which the cerebral hemispheres were absent have occasionally survived
                    for a short time, and have still been able to suck and swallow. Although the
                    excised gullet often exhibits a true peristalsis, which doubtless depends upon a
                    local nervous mechanism, the normal movements in the body seem to be regulated
                    from the medulla oblongata.</p>
                <p>At the entrance of the stomach the food meets the barrier opposed by the
                    contracted cardiac orifice; the contraction must be overcome before the food can
                    gain admittance. The relaxation is certainly an active process under the control
                    of the medulla oblongata through the vagus nerve, since section of the vagi
                    causes a block to the progress of food from the oesophagus into the stomach.</p>
                <p>In the stomach the food is detained for a period which varies very greatly with
                    its digestibility, but which in the human subject is not often longer than four
                    or five hours. It is subjected to a rubbing and rolling action of the
                    stomach-walls and a modified peristalsis, which causes the food to move slowly
                    from the cardiac orifice along the greater curvature to the pylorus, whence it
                    returns along the small curvature to the cardiac end again, The gastric
                    movements are slight at first, but gradually increase in vigour. The pylorus is
                    tightly closed at the beginning of a meal, but becomes more and more relaxed as
                    digestion proceeds, so that, whilst at first only the finer parts of the gastric
                    contents can pass, afterwards the coarser parts and even solid lumps of
                    imperfectly-digested aliments are permitted to escape into the duodenum. We
                    possess little accurate knowledge as to the nervous mechanism of the stomach.
                    Are the movements caused immediately by the local nervous ganglia situated in
                    its walls? Or does the impulse to move descend directly from the encephalic
                    centre along the pneumogastric nerves <hi rend="italic">1</hi> All that we know
                    is ( 1 ) that movements of an excised stomach are induced with great difficulty,
                    (2) that stimulation of the vagus will often cause movements of the stomach, and
                    (3) that section of the vagi impedes the passage of food out of the stomach. The
                    movements of the stomach have been said to cease altogether during sleep.</p>
                <p>When the gastric contents, to which the term chyme is often applied, pass through
                    the pylorus into the duodenum, they begin to move onward by the pure peristaltic
                    action of the small intestines. The powerful annular fibres contract one after
                    another, driving the food onward, as water may be squeezed along an india-rubber
                    tube by the compression of the hand. The longitudinal fibres contract in such a
                    manner that the intestine is drawn over the advancing mass. The movements always
                    occur (in health at least) in a direction from the stomach to the ileo-caecal
                    valve; here they stop and never pass as a continuous wave to the large
                    intestine.</p>
                <p>Peristalsis may be exhibited by an excised intestine independently of any
                    extrinsic nervous apparatus. Stimulation of the vagus nerve, as a rule, excites
                    the intestinal movements, while excitation of the splanchnic nerves tends to
                    still them. When the blood stagnates in the intestinal vessels active
                    peristalsis ensues. As the splanchnic nerves are also the vaso-motor nerves of
                    the intestines, excitation of them produces constriction of the blood-vessels
                    and comparative bloodlessness.</p>
                <p>After passing through the ileo-caecal valve the intestinal contents, which have
                    been very greatly diminished in amount owing to the process of absorption that
                    has gone on, quickly assume the characteristic appearance of faeces. The
                    undigested and insoluble parts of the food, mixed with mucus, with epithelial
                    débris, and with some substances derived from the secretions of the alimentary
                    canal, notably with some biliary products, must be cast out; this is effected by
                    the act of defecation. The anus is normally kept firmly closed by the
                    contraction of two sphincter muscles,—the external, which is one of the skeletal
                    muscles, and the internal, which is formed by a special development of the
                    lowest rings of the circular layer of muscles of the intestine. In the act of
                    defecation these sphincters are relaxed, while the contraction of the rectum
                    forces its contents downwards. The levatores ani are brought into play by the
                    will and exert an action similar to that previously referred to as performed by
                    the longitudinal fibres of the intestine. Of special influence in aiding the
                    expulsion of the contents of the bowel is the contraction of the abdominal
                    muscles which follows a preliminary fixation of the diaphragm by a deep
                    inspiration.</p>
                <p>The act of defecation is essentially a reflex act. The centre which presides over
                    the sphincters of the anus lies in the lumbar portion of the spinal cord. This
                    centre is under the control of the brain, under the influence of which its
                    activity is either increased or inhibited.</p>
                <p>Vomiting, or the ejection of the contents of the stomach through the mouth, is an
                    act of considerable complexity; (1) the cardiac orifice of the stomach is
                    relaxed or, to be accurate, thrown open by the operation of some reflex nervous
                    mechanism with which the vagus is connected; (2) contraction of the muscular
                    coat of the stomach occurs; (3) the abdominal walls are powerfully compressed,
                    and the diaphragm is at the same time strongly fixed by closure of the glottis.
                    As concurrent phenomena in ordinary vomiting may be mentioned the sense of
                    nausea and the free flow of saliva which occurs during and indeed before the
                    act.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n728/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0728-0671"/>
                <p>Vomiting may, within certain limits, be inhibited by taking a series of deep and
                    rapid inspirations at a time when the sense of nausea is becoming
                    unbearable.</p>
                <p>True vomiting seems to be impossible without the aid of the abdominal muscles,
                    as, for example, when the abdomen is laid open. In such conditions emetics cause
                    active opening of the cardiac orifice and movements of the stomach-walls, but
                    not the full and free expulsion of the contents. Vomiting is usually a reflex
                    act, the centre for which lies in the medulla oblongata near the centre for
                    respiration, though it is reasonable to suppose that it may occur not only as a
                    reflex act but as a result of direct stimulation of the centre or centres
                    associated with it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Secretions of the Alimentary Canal.—Production of the
                    Alimentary Juices.—</hi> We have described the movements of the alimentary tube
                    by which the food is triturated and agitated, and finally propelled from mouth
                    to anus. One object of these movements is to mix together the food and certain
                    solvent juices which are poured upon the food at various points. We have now to
                    give an account of these juices and their properties. They are produced in, or
                    by the agency of, the epithelium cells lining the interior of glands which are
                    either situated in the walls of the alimentary canal or which empty their
                    secretion into it. Though these cells derive the materials necessary to their
                    metabolic activity from the blood, the substances which they elaborate and which
                    are characteristic of the secretions that they help to form are not found in the
                    blood, but are products of the activity of the protoplasm of the cells
                    themselves. The act of secretion is a function of the living cell, and not a
                    mere act of filtration or diffusion through the vascular walls to the
                    cell-substance. It often involves the elaboration of entirely new substances.
                    The act of secretion is, or may be, under the control of the nervous system; it
                    may be started, inhibited, and the products of the secretion may be variously
                    modified, by the stimulation of distant nerves. In some glands certainly, and
                    possibly in all, the elaboration of the specific secretion of the gland takes
                    place in two well-defined stages, and the two stages are indicated by
                    differences in the anatomical appearances of the gland-cells.</p>
                <p>The characteristic constituents of the several juices which are specially
                    concerned in the chemical changes of the alimentary canal are certain so-called
                    “unorganized” ferments, which we shall, following the suggestion of Kühne,
                    denominate <hi rend="italic">enzymes.</hi> Like all ferments, these are capable,
                    under suitable circumstances, of initiating specific changes in certain bodies
                    with which they are brought into contact, changes which may be incommen-surably
                    great when contrasted with the magnitude of the mass of the ferment engaged.
                    “Unorganized” or, as they have also been called, “unformed” ferments differ,
                    however, from the “organized” or “formed” in that, whilst they are the products
                    of the activity of living cells, when once formed they cease to be living, are
                    unconnected with any organized form, and have no power of reproduction or
                    increase.</p>
                <p>The enzymes for the most part exert their action unimpaired in the presence of
                    certain bodies which kill the great majority of organized ferments; thus
                    salicylic acid does not hinder peptic and tryptic digestion, whilst it prevents
                    the putrefactive changes which are very apt to occur in the latter case, and
                    which are connected with the development of organized ferments. Certain enzymes,
                    as the diastatic ferment of saliva and pancreatic juice, are, however, destroyed
                    by salicylic acid.</p>
                <p>As will be shown in detail in the sequel, the secreting cells of glands which
                    produce enzymes exhibit marked differences corresponding to different states of
                    activity. In the case of the secreting cells of the pancreas the cells appear to
                    produce and store up for a time a body, a <hi rend="italic">zymoyen,</hi> from
                    which subsequently the tryptic enzyme <hi rend="italic">trypsin</hi> is set
                    free. The progress of research may perhaps establish the existence of zymogens
                    corresponding to the other enzymes.</p>
                <p>Usually the glandular organs which produce the alimentary juices contain stored
                    up within them their characteristic enzymes, which may be extracted by digesting
                    the comminuted organ in water, or still better in glycerin, which dissolves them
                    nearly all, and furnishes solutions which preserve their activity long
                    unimpaired. Enzymes are all insoluble in strong alcohol, so that the tissues
                    from which they are to be extracted may be first dehydrated by digestion in
                    absolute alcohol and afterwards extracted with glycerin. Solutions of enzymes
                    are rendered inactive by boiling or by exposure to a temperature above 70° C.
                    The principal enzymes of the alimentary canal belong either to the group of <hi
                    rend="italic">proteolytic</hi> or to that of <hi rend="italic">diastatic</hi> or
                    amylolytic ferments: the enzymes of the first group (pepsin and trypsin)
                    dissolve proteids and effect their more or less perfect decomposition; the
                    enzymes of the second class (as ptyalin and the diastatic ferment of the
                    pancreas) dissolve starch and produce from it a series of bodies which will be
                    discussed in reference to the action of saliva on starch.</p>
                <p>Besides the proteolytic and amylolytic ferments, there occur in the alimentary
                    canal a <hi rend="italic">curdling</hi> ferment, an <hi rend="italic"
                    >inverting</hi> ferment, and perhaps a <hi rend="italic">fat-decomposing</hi>
                    ferment.</p>
                <p>All enzymes exert a more energetic action at a moderately high than at a low
                    temperature, though the influence of a rise in temperature is more marked in
                    some cases than in others. The reaction of the medium in which they are placed
                    influences remarkably the activity of certain enzymes; thus pepsin, the
                    proteolytic ferment of the stomach, is inactive in neutral or alkaline
                    solutions, the presence of a free acid being essential to its activity, whilst
                    trypsin, the proteolytic ferment of the pancreas, acts with feebleness in
                    solutions which are neutral or faintly acid, since it needs for the full
                    exercise of its powers a decidedly alkaline medium. The enzymes appear to
                    possess the power of rapidly inducing, at the temperature of the animal body, in
                    bodies subjected to them similar chemical operations to those which can be
                    brought about with great slowness by prolonged heating with dilute mineral
                    acids, or by the prolonged action of boiling water or superheated steam. These
                    operations are of the nature of <hi rend="italic">hydrolytic</hi>
                    decompositions, that is to say, such as are connected with the union of the
                    elements of water with the decomposing body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Salivary Glands and Secretion of Saliva.—</hi> There are no
                    secreting glands in the body which have been subjected to so elaborate a study
                    as the salivary glands, whether we consider their structure or the circumstances
                    which influence or accompany the act of secretion. We shall therefore give the
                    results of researches on these glands at much greater length than those
                    referring to the other glands concerned in the preparation of the alimentary
                    juices.</p>
                <p>As has been already said, the saliva is secreted by several glands of which the
                    ducts pour their secretion into the cavity of the mouth, where it is mingled and
                    constitutes the “mixed saliva.” The chief of these glands are the parotid, the
                    submaxillary, and the sublingual glands, though their secretion is mixed with
                    that of small glands (mucous and serous) scattered through the mucous membrane
                    of the mouth and tongue, which are included under the term “buccal” glands.</p>
                <p>The salivary glands all belong to the group of acinous or compound racemose
                    glands. According to the researches of Heidenhain, they may, however, be divided
                    into two groups, which he has denominated serous or albuminous and mucous
                    glands, according to the structure of the cells of their acini, their chemical
                    characters, and the nature of the secretion which they elaborate.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n729/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0729-0672"/>
                <p>To the group of serous glands belong the parotid of man and the majority of
                    animals, the submaxillary gland of the rabbit, and some of the glands of the
                    tongue; to that of mucous glands belong the submaxillary and sublingual glands
                    in most animals, some of the glands of the tongue, and the oesophageal glands.
                    Glands belonging to the former of these classes secrete a fluid containing some,
                    though it may be only a small quantity, of a proteid coagulable by heat, and
                    resembling, if not identical with, serumalbumin; the mucous glands, on the other
                    hand, as their name implies, secrete a liquid free from albumin, but containing
                    more or less mucin.</p>
                <p>In the serous glands the epithelium lining the acini is composed of comparatively
                    small, rounded, or polygonal cells, of which the outlines are not very distinct
                    until acted upon by certain reagents. No cell-wall is present; the protoplasm,
                    which is not coloured by carmine, presents many dark granules, and surrounds an
                    irregularly saccular or rounded nucleus which is coloured by carmine.</p>
                <p>In the mucous glands the characteristic (mucous) cells of the alveoli are large
                    and clear, very faintly granular, with a rounded or oval nucleus near their
                    periphery surrounded by a trace of protoplasm. They possess a cell-wall, and a
                    strongly refracting process which springs from the cell in the neighbourhood of
                    the nucleus.</p>
                <p>In addition to the characteristic mucous cells there are found in the alveoli of
                    most mucous salivary glands when examined in a state of rest, situated at some
                    parts of the periphery, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> lying more internal than,
                    or nearer to, the membrana propria than the mucous cells, half-moon-shaped
                    aggregations of small cells, possessed of a round nucleus easily stained with
                    carmine, and containing albumin; to these aggregations the term of <hi
                    rend="italic">demilunes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lunulae</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gianuzzi</hi> has been applied. In some cases we find alveoli in
                    which these small cells are not arranged in demilunes, but form a row of cells
                    lying external to the mucous cells, and completely encircling them (see fig.
                    3).</p>
                <p>As has been said, in certain mucous glands the mucous cells are supplemented by
                    the cells of the demilunes, though there are other mucous glands, as those of
                    the tongue, where the typical mucous cells alone occur. There are glands, and
                    the submaxillary of man is an example, which are termed mixed glands, inasmuch
                    as some of the acini have all the characters of serous, others of mucous glands.
                    The submaxillary gland of the guinea-pig possesses, according to Klein, a
                    structure undistinguishable from that of the pancreas.</p>
                <p>We shall not enter, in this place, into a detailed description of the innervation
                    of any one of the salivary glands, but shall confine ourselves to the following
                    statements.</p>
                <p>Each salivary gland is supplied by at least three classes of fibres, viz.,
                    secretory, vaso-constrictor, and vaso-dilator fibres, of which the first and the
                    third are conveyed to the glands in branches of cerebral nerves; these are, the
                    chorda tympani for the submaxillary and sublingual, and the auriculo-temporal
                    (which, however, derives them through communications with the otic ganglion from
                    the glossopharyngeal nerve) for the parotid. The second class, the
                    vaso-constrictor or vaso-motor fibres, run in sympathetic trunks. When,
                    therefore, one of the cranial branches supplying a gland is stimulated there
                    occur two acts, viz., secretion and simultaneous dilatation of blood-vessels;
                    that these two acts are not absolutely interdependent is proved by the fact that
                    certain drugs paralyse the one set of fibres, but leave the other intact. When,
                    on the other hand, the sympathetic filaments supplying the gland are stimulated,
                    the blood-vessels of the gland contract, and there is produced a small quantity
                    of saliva differing in physical characters and chemical composition from that
                    obtained under the circumstances first referred to. Accord ing to Heidenhain,
                    however, in each of the two kinds of nerves supplying a salivary gland there
                    exist, besides the vascular nerve-fibres, secretory and trophic fibres, though
                    the number of one or other of these classes may be insignificant,— the secretory
                    predominating in the cranial nerve branches, the trophic in the sympathetic.
                    Stimulation of secretory fibres leads, according to Heidenhain, to an increased
                    flow of water, stimulation of the trophic to an increased secretion of specific
                    substances and to an increased production of protoplasm.</p>
                <p>When a salivary gland passes from the state of rest into that of activity it is
                    at once the seat of an increased blood flow, which is associated with the
                    dilatation of the bloodvessels of the organ. Under these circumstances, the
                    blood leaving the gland presents a florid arterial colour, instead of the venous
                    colour which characterizes the blood of the organ when at rest. This vascular
                    dilatation is explained by the coming into action of the before-mentioned
                    vasodilator fibres; it is independent of the act of secretion.</p>
                <p>As was shown in a now classical investigation of Ludwig, when the salivary glands
                    are thrown into activity there is a rise in temperature, so that the temperature
                    of the saliva leaving the submaxillary gland may exceed by l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 5 C. that of the blood flowing to the gland. This
                    rise in temperature cannot be explained by a study of the chemical characters of
                    the salivary secretion, but is doubtless the result of the increased metabolic
                    changes which necessarily accompany the act of secretion in the gland-cells, and
                    which chiefly affect their protoplasm.</p>
                <p>That the secretion of saliva (and indeed secretion in general) is not a mere act
                    of filtration was proved by Carl Ludwig when he showed that saliva can be
                    secreted <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0730-0673"/> by a gland though the pressure within it is many
                    times higher than that of the blood circulating through the arteries which
                    supply it. On many grounds it may be positively asserted that the secreting
                    cells are the primary agents in the withdrawal from the blood of the water
                    necessary for the secretion, though the exact nature of the process is yet
                    unknown; similarly, on the grounds stated below, we know that within the
                    protoplasm of the glandcells are formed the characteristic soluble constituents
                    of the secretion.</p>
                <p>The researches made during the last few years by Heidenhain, and fully confirmed
                    by a large number of observers, have demonstrated that in the salivary glands,
                    as indeed in all secreting glands, structural and perfectly obvious microscopic
                    changes occur, which stand in close relation to the different conditions of
                    functional activity.</p>
                <p>The resting gland-cell is large, but possesses comparatively little protoplasm,
                    and therefore comparatively little matter which can be stained by colouring
                    bodies, especially by carmine; it contains instead a store of material which has
                    been elaborated in, or at the expense of, the protoplasm. This material does not
                    constitute the specific matter of the secretion, but is its antecedent. That it
                    differs chemically in the case of the mucous glands is proved by the fact cited
                    by Heidenhain, and discovered by Watney and Klein, viz., that, whilst mucin is
                    stained by haematoxylin, its antecedent (mucigen) is not affected by that
                    colouring matter; in all otheι∙ respects the two bodies are identical. When,
                    however, a gland passes into a state of activity, as, for example, by the
                    irritation of its so-called secretory (trophic?) nerves, the gland-cells undergo
                    the following changes, which may proceed simultaneously though not necessarily
                    so :—the stored-up matter previously referred to is converted into soluble
                    constituents of the secretion, and at the same time there occurs a growth of the
                    protoplasm of the cells, at the expense doubtless of the richer supply of lymph
                    which during the secretory act bathes the gland.</p>
                <p>The period of activity in so far as the gland-cell is concerned is indeed a
                    period of removal of ready-made constituents of secretion, in some cases, as in
                    the mucusbearing cells of the mucous glands, a period of destruction of cells
                    laden with such constituents; but at the same time in all cases a period in
                    which the protoplasmic constituents of the cells generally increase, and active
                    proliferation of secreting cells occurs.</p>
                <p>Whilst -we have in a few sentences sketched the general characters of the changes
                    which glands undergo during secretion, our picture is wanting in all details,
                    and the reader is referred for further information to works on histology and
                    physiology.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Glands of the Stomach and Secretion of Gastric Juice.—</hi> In
                    vol. vii. p. 225 a brief description has been given of two kinds of glands which
                    are found embedded in the mucous membrane of the stomach, and which are
                    concerned in the preparation of the secretion of this organ, the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">gastric juice.</hi> The first kind of glands, the “mucous glands
                    of the stomach,” so called from their having been formerly erroneously supposed
                    to be engaged in the secretion of mucus only, are situated chiefly at the
                    pyloric end (figs. 4, 5) of the stomach. The second kind, the so-called “peptic
                    glands,” owe their name to the view that they alone secreted the digestive
                    gastric juice, and are found in most animals in the mucous membrane of other
                    parts of the stomach than the pylorus. The pyloric glands are tubular glands,
                    simple or compound, composed of a basement membrane lined by two kinds of
                    epitheliumcells, (1) cylindrical epithelium-cells confined to the neck of the
                    gland, (2) cylindrical or cubical epithelium-cells lining the part of the tube
                    below the neck, and which, though not very different in form from the cells of
                    the neck, possess an entirely different function. The peptic glands of the older
                    writers, now usually called “glands of the fundus,” present three varieties of
                    epithelium-cells. I heir neck is lined by cylindrical epithelium similar to that
                    of the neck of the pyloric glands. The deeper part of the glands is lined by
                    small cubical “central” cells, below which and interposed between them and the
                    basement membrane is a discontinuous layer of large ovoid “border” cells, the
                    so-called “peptic cells” of older writers.</p>
                <p>During active digestion the cubical cells of both pyloric glands and glands of
                    the fundus become swollen and granular; after a period of rest they return to
                    their original size and assume a comparatively clear appearance. The ovoid cells
                    also swell during digestion, but in other respects remain unchanged.</p>
                <p>When the stomach is inactive, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in the fasting
                    condition, its mucous membrane is pale and the organ contains no fluid; the
                    mucous membrane in the pyloric region presents an alkaline reaction. When,
                    however, food enters the stomach, or the mucous membrane is subjected to
                    mechanical stimulation, an acid juice, the so-called gastric juice, is poured
                    out, the act of secretion being accompanied by a reddening of the mucous
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>Evidence appears to be most conclusive in support of the view that the three
                    kinds of epithelium-cells found in the stomach and its glands possess entirely
                    separate functions. The epithelium-cells which line the interior of the stomach,
                    and which, like those of the neck of both kinds of glands, are cylindrical in
                    shape, appear to be mucusforming cells. The cubical cells which are found in the
                    deeper parts of the pyloric glands appear functionally to be identical with the
                    central cells of the glands of the fundus, both being engaged in forming the
                    chief ferment of the gastric juice, viz., pepsin, whilst the ovoid cells of the
                    glands of the fundus are the sole elaborators of the acid of the gastric juice.

                <p>No accurate estimate can be formed of the amount of gastric juice secreted during
                    twenty-four hours. It has been calculated to be between 20 and 30 pints.</p>
                <p>Secretion of the gastric juice may occur after all the nerves going to the
                    stomach have been divided, though it is for a time arrested after division of
                    the pneumogastric nerves. It is probable that the process of gastric digestion
                    is essentially under the control of an intrinsic nervous mechanism situated in
                    the mucous membrane, though this is normally influenced by the higher nerve
                    centres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Liver and Secretion of Bile.—</hi> The structure of the liver
                    has already been sufficiently described (vol. vii. p. 229 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.),</hi> and need not be further alluded to in this place. The secretion of
                    the liver, the bile, is being continually formed, though not always at the same
                    rate. In animals possessed of a gall-bladder it is stored in the intervals of
                    digestion in this reservoir. When food is taken into the stomach the bile begins
                    to be secreted in larger quantities, the maximum being reached about six hours
                    after the meal. As the so-called acid “chyme,” to be afterwards referred to,
                    passes the opening of the bile-duct in the duodenum, it is probable that a
                    stream of bile is poured upon it by the reflex contraction of the gall-bladder.
                    During the time when bile is being secreted much heat is evolved in the liver.
                    The bile, as will be shown in the sequel, should be looked upon as a liquid
                    containing only certain, for the most part useless, by-products resulting from
                    great chemical operations going on in the liver. Little is known as yet of the
                    exact changes which occur in the liver-cells during activity, nor of the manner
                    in which the nervous system influences the secretion of bile.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pancreas and the Secretion of Pancreatic Juice.—</hi> The
                    pancreas possesses a structure which presents great resemblance to that of
                    serous salivary glands, and its alkaline secretion was until lately looked upon
                    as closely resembling the saliva.</p>
                <p>The secreting cells of the pancreas, which differ but little microscopically from
                    those of such a salivary gland as the parotid, exhibit very marked differences,
                    which correspond to different states of functional activity. During a period of
                    glandular repose the cellscon-tain innumerable granules, which are congregated
                    at that side of the cell which lies towards the centre of the acini(fig. 6, B).
                    The outer or peripheral portion of the cells —the smaller part of the resting
                    cell—is clear. After a period of glandular activity the granular half of each
                    cell is found to have diminished greatly (fig. 6, A); the whole cell is clear
                    and distinctly smaller than before, and its behaviour towards colouring matters
                    is very different. The pancreas, when perfectly fresh and just removed from the
                    yet warm body of an animal which is killed, does not contain, ready formed, all
                    ferments which will in the sequel be referred to as characterizing the
                    pancreatic juice. If we treat the gland, for instance, with glycerin, which
                    possesses the power of extracting and dissolving all the ferments, we fail to
                    obtain a solution which possesses the power of digesting ρroteids; but, instead,
                    we find a substance in the solution from which, by the addition of a little
                    acetic acid, the proteolytic ferment may be formed.</p>
                <p>The cells of the pancreas thus elaborate a substance which is the antecedent of
                    the proteolytic ferment, and which yields it when it passes into the pancreatic
                    ducts; it is customary to speak of this body as <hi rend="italic">zymogen</hi>
                    or fermentformer, because it gives rise to one of the chief enzymes or ferments
                    of the juice. The secretion of pancreatic fluid is slight except during
                    digestion. After the taking of a full meal the secretion is suddenly exalted,
                    reaching its maximum two or three hours afterwards. The secretion then
                    diminishes until a period which extends from the fifth to the seventh hours,
                    when a rise occurs, which lasts to between the ninth and eleventh hours after
                    food. The secretion then gradually sinks, until it absolutely ceases.
                    Stimulation of the gastric mucous membrane starts the secretion of pancreatic
                    juice; it is arrested during nausea and vomiting, as also when the central end
                    of the divided pneumogastric is stimulated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Intestinal Glands and their Secretion.—</hi> The mucous
                    membrane of both the small and the large intestine contains embedded in its
                    substance innumerable simple tubular glands, the so-called crypts or glands of
                    Lieberkühn, which are lined by a single layer of cylindrical epithelium
                    continuous with and resembling that covering the exposed surface of the
                    intestine. Very little is known as to the function of these glands, whose office
                    is probably widely different in different sections of the intestinal tube,
                    particularly in the large as distinguished from the small intestine. We do know
                    that the epithelium-cells of these glands are capable of forming mucus, and that
                    in the small intestine they are doubtless the source whence is derived the
                    so-called intestinal juice or “succus entericus” which is poured into the
                    intestine in large quantities under particular circumstances, as, for instance,
                    when all the nerves supplying the gut are divided.</p>

                <p>The mixed saliva of man is, when perfectly fresh, a clear, transparent, viscid
                    liquid, which, on microscopic examination, is found to contain cells of squamous
                    epithelium derived from the mouth, besides certain globular cells derived from
                    the salivary glands and called “salivary corpuscles.” Its reaction is alkaline;
                    it has a specific gravity of about l ’ 003, and contains about five or six parts
                    per thousand of solid matters. Its solid constituents consist (1) of certain
                    saline matters transuded from the blood and, in addition, of a small quantity of
                    a soluble <hi rend="italic">sulphocyanide,</hi> detected by the reddish tinge
                    caused by the addition of solution of ferric chloride to the saliva; (2) small
                    quantities of <hi rend="italic">soluble proteids,</hi> coagulable by heat; (3)
                    <hi rend="italic">mucin,</hi> to which saliva owes its viscidity, and which is
                    thrown down when the liquid is acidulated with acetic acid; (4) a ferment or
                    enzyme called <hi rend="italic">ptyalin, salivary diastase,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">the diastatic ferment of saliva.</hi> The last-mentioned is the
                    most important constituent. It possesses the power of rapidly rendering cooked
                    starch soluble, though its action on raw starch is but very slight. Not only
                    does it dissolve starch, but it progressively decomposes the complex starch
                    molecules into isomeric bodies of less complexity. Starch has a chemical
                    composition which may be represented by the empirical formula (C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 10</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi>, the exact value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> being yet a matter of doubt. The salivary diastase, under suitable
                    conditions, as has been said, first converts insoluble into soluble starch
                    (hence it is sometimes termed an amylolytic ferment) which, it has been
                    surmised, probably has the composition (C <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi

                    10</hi>. This soluble starch, like the insoluble body, gives a beautiful blue
                    colour with iodine. By the further action of the ferment the soluble starch
                    yields a series of dextrins which are isomeric with starch, though they possess
                    smaller molecular weights and different<pb break="no"

                    from its identity with that which is produced in the process of malting of
                    barley, is called “maltose,” and which, though possessing many of the reactions
                    of grape-sugar, is an isomer of cane-sugar; when crystallized it has the
                    composition C <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 22</hi> O

                <p>The changes which are brought about by the action of the salivary ferment on the
                    starchy constituents of food are hastened by a temperature near that of the
                    mammalian body. Boiling destroys the diastatic power, as also does the presence
                    of strong acids or alkalies. A very feeble acid reaction does not absolutely
                    stop the characteristic action.</p>
                <p>Whilst the saliva of man and some few animals possesses the remarkable diastatic
                    ferment just referred to, this is absent from the saliva of the majority of
                    animals, so that we are forced to conclude that the saliva is an alimentary
                    juice which subserves mechanical rather than essential chemical functions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gastric Juice.—</hi> This is a thin colourless or
                    straw-coloured liquid of strongly acid reaction, and of a mawkish taste. Its
                    specific gravity varies between 1 ’ 001 and l ’ 010, and it contains from ∣ to 1
                    per cent, of solid matters.</p>
                <p>The gastric juice contains (1) free hydrochloric acid, (2) certain mineral
                    matters, and (3) a ferment or enzyme called pepsin. It has been much disputed
                    whether the gastric juice contains the hydrochloric acid in a free condition,
                    but the question may be considered to have been settled in the affirmative by
                    many facts, amongst which one of the most striking is that the gastric juice
                    behaves towards certain organic colouring matters as only liquids do which
                    contain free mineral acids. The pepsin, which has never been separated in a pure
                    condition, is soluble in water, weak spirit, and glycerin, and confers upon all
                    these solvents its characteristic property, viz., that of dissolving, in the
                    presence of a dilute free acid, and at a suitable temperature, insoluble
                    proteids, and of converting these into soluble and diffusible modifications
                    termed peptones. Peptones differ from other albuminous or proteid bodies in
                    their greater diffusibility, as well as in their much higher solubility in pure
                    water. They are not coagulated by heat or by nitric acid, and are not thrown
                    down by many mineral salts which precipitate other soluble proteids.</p>
                <p>Gelatin under the same conditions is converted into an ungelatinizable
                    modification, the so-called gelatin-peptone. Boiling destroys the activity of
                    solutions of pepsin. If their reaction ceases to be acid, and, further, if the
                    acid reaction be not due to a free acid, no action is exerted upon proteids. A
                    temperature approximately the same as that of the mammalian body is that most
                    favourable to gastric digestion. The accumulation of the products of gastric
                    digestion, viz., peptones, hinders the continued activity of the juice. Pepsin,
                    though probably containing nitrogen, is not a proteid body.</p>
                <p>In addition to pepsin the gastric juice contains an entirely independent ferment
                    which is called the “curdling ferment” or the “rennet ferment,” because of its
                    power of rapidly inducing at the temperature of the body the coagulation of the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Bile.—</hi> Bile is a bitter liquid of golden-red colour in man
                    and carnivorous animals, but green in herbivorous animals. It is commonly viscid
                    owing to admixture with mucus derived from the walls of the gall-bladder and
                    hepatic ducts. Its reaction is neutral or faintly alkaline. It contains about 14
                    per cent, of solid constituents. (1) It includes the sodium salts of certain
                    so-called bile-acids, which in man are glycocholic and taurocholic acids. The
                    former has the formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 26</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    43</hi> NO <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, and is readily decomposed into glycin,

                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and into cholic acid. (2) It contains bile-colouring
                    matters, of which the chief is a red one termed bilirubin, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 18</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, with which is closely connected the
                    green colouring matter of the bile of herbivores, termed biliviridin, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 18</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; bilirubin is unquestionably derived
                    from the decomposition of the blood-colouring matter or haemoglobin. (3) It has
                    fats, and a body called cholesterin, which belongs to the class of alcohols and
                    has the composition C <hi rend="subscript"> 90</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    44</hi> O + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. (4) It includes saline matters
                    which are rich in sodium salts. Whilst the bile-acids and the bile-colouring
                    matters are formed in the liver itself, the cholesterin of the bile is probably
                    derived entirely from the blood, which obtains it from the nervous organs, in
                    the white matter of which it is abundantly present.</p>

                <p>The amount of bile secreted by man has been estimated at from about 136 grains to
                    about 309 grains per kilogramme (2 ’ 20 lb) of body-weight; but in certain
                    cases, through abnormal circumstances, the total amount of bile secreted in
                    twenty-four hours has been found to be less than this, viz., to vary between
                    about 16 and 21 oz.</p>
                <p>The action of the bile in digestion, it must be admitted, seems trifling and out
                    of proportion to the size of the gland and the amount of the secretion. It is a
                    weak solvent for fats; it has the power of emulsifying fats, especially,
                    perhaps, when added to the pancreatic juice; and it may help the passage of fat
                    through animal membranes. At least it is certain that, when filter-paper is
                    wetted with bile, oils filter through it more readily than when it is wetted
                    with water. The most important use of the bile is, however, as an adjuvant to
                    pancreatic digestion. The pancreatic juice, as will be stated more particularly
                    below, contains a ferment which is either a proteid body or inseparably
                    connected with a proteid body. Strangely, though this ferment possesses the
                    power of dissolving proteids under suitable circumstances, in the presence of
                    pepsin and any free acid it is itself destroyed. It would then be acted upon by
                    the pepsin passing into the duodenum from the stomach if the conditions were
                    favourable. To prevent this untoward accident the alkaline bile is poured over
                    the acid contents of the stomach as they pass the duodenum; these are
                    neutralized, and a precipitate is thrown down which mechanically entangles the
                    pepsin that may be in the mixture. Although the definable uses of the bile are
                    small, the part which it plays in the economy is of essential importance.
                    Animals whose bile is allowed to escape externally soon grow lean and
                    ill-conditioned. The <pb break="no"

                    canal remains in part in the faeces, which acquire a peculiar putrescent
                    odour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pancreatic Juice.—</hi> If we except the gastric juice, the
                    chemical action exerted by the pancreatic juice is the most potent and useful of
                    any of the digestive secretions.</p>
                <p>When freshly secreted and perfectly normal, the pancreatic juice is a clear
                    viscid liquid of strongly alkaline reaction and highly coagulable by heat. Its
                    solid constituents may reach the proportion of 10 per cent.</p>
                <p>It contains (1) water, (2) various albuminous bodies which cause the liquid to be
                    coagulable by heat, and of which one is intimately connected, or indeed perhaps
                    identical, with the ferment trypsin, (3) a number of ferments, (4) traces of
                    products of digestion, as leucin and tyrosin, (5) salts. The ferments of the
                    pancreatic juice are the following :—(1) a proteolytic ferment termed trypsin,
                    (2) a diastatic ferment, (3) a ferment which acts on fats, (4) a curdling
                    ferment (?).</p>
                <p>The first-named ferment, unlike pepsin, which is quite inactive under this
                    condition, acts most energetically in solutions which contain a free alkali or
                    an alkaline carbonate, although it possesses some action when the reaction is
                    neutral or even faintly acid. Like pepsin, trypsin dissolves insoluble proteids
                    and converts them into peptones; it possesses, however, an activity which
                    surpasses that of pepsin, inasmuch as it splits up certain of the peptones
                    formed into simpler bodies, such as leucin, C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 13</hi> NO <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>, and tyrosin, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 9</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 11</hi> NO <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 3</hi>, the former of which is an organic body allied to the fatty acid group,
                    and the latter to the aromatic group. According to the views of Kühne, the
                    molecule of an albuminous or proteid body is capable of being broken up under
                    the influences of such ferments as pepsin and trypsin into the allied bodies of
                    smaller molecular weight, the peptones, which, though possessing general and
                    common reactions, may by their behaviour towards certain chemical agents as well
                    as towards ferments be subdivided into two groups, a Aeww-group and an
                    αn∕i-group. Kühne believes that both pepsin and. trypsin decompose the proteids
                    with the production of so-called <hi rend="italic">hemi-peptones</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">anti-peptones,</hi> and that, whilst neither pepsin nor trypsin
                    can further decompose anti-peptones, trypsin possesses the power of splitting up
                    hemi-peptones into simpler bodies.</p>
                <p>The amylolytic or diastatic ferment of the pancreatic juice resembles that of the
                    saliva in its action. Whilst the saliva of most animals contains no such
                    ferment, the pancreatic juice of all animals is very rich in diastatic ferment,
                    so that the action of the pancreatic juice on starch is much greater than that
                    of saliva.</p>
                <p>The fat-decomposing ferment—sometimes, though erroneously, called the
                    “emulsifying ferment ”—of the pancreas is present in exceedingly small quantity
                    and is very readily destroyed, so that its existence has sometimes, though
                    erroneously, been denied. It breaks up the neutral fats in part into their
                    respective fatty acids and glycerin. This slight acidification unquestionably
                    facilitates the formation of an emulsion of the remaining fats.</p>
                <p>All these ferments are influenced by temperature in nearly the same manner as the
                    ferments of saliva and gastric juice. Boiling destroys them absolutely, cold
                    retards their activity, the body temperature is very favourable to them. The
                    most suitable medium for them is the alkaline juice in which they occur, and the
                    alkalinity of which is due to sodium carbonate.</p>

                    it not only contains a small quantity of a diastatic ferment but probably also a
                    so-called inverting ferment, possessing the power of converting cane-sugar into

                    and which are also not amenable to the influences of the digestive juices, we

                    addition to these may be mentioned allied bodies, cellulose, pectin, arabin,
                    mucilage, &amp;c., which in some animals, or in some conditions, are certainly
                    digestible. In a subdivision of the same group we may place the various
                    vegetable acids, lactic, acetic, citric, malic, &amp;c., which are essentially
                    foods.</p>
                <p>It may be premised that the fate which befalls a given example of ingested food
                    does not depend solely upon the theoretical power of the digestive juices to act
                    upon it. Thus digestible food may be imperfectly digested owing to being passed
                    into the stomach in lumps and masses, which the juices cannot permeate and the
                    stomach' cannot crush; or starch may be so incorporated and encapsuled with fat
                    that the saliva and even the pancreatic juice may fail to reach it <hi
                    rend="italic">; or</hi> digestion from one cause or another may be so prolonged
                    that fermentative changes, to which most samples of food are inevitably liable
                    from containing organized ferments or “germs/’ may have time to begin and to
                    alter materially the sequence of events. Hence we shall feel no surprise that
                    much food escapes altogether the action of digestion. The most perfect and
                    economical feeding is that in which the least quantity of food is passed through
                    the alimentary canal unchanged. When, however, the just quantity is taken, and
                    the digestive organs are sound, the following is the order of the changes which
                    occur.</p>
                <p>Food placed in the mouth at once excites the flow of mixed saliva and mucus.
                    Solid food is broken up, rubbed together with the juices of the mouth and
                    entangled air-bubbles, and rolled into a slimy bolus. Soluble constituents of it
                    thus have an opportunity of becoming dissolved at once; sugar, dextrin,
                    vegetable acids, and many inorganic salts would, in part at least, pass into
                    solution in the mixed saliva. The process of mastication, besides triturating
                    the food and mixing it with the alkaline saliva, permits it to become raised
                    nearly to the body-temperature, in which condition the dextrin and the starches
                    readily fall a prey to the ptyalin, and begin to be converted into dextrins and
                    maltose. This change is very rapidly effected —it begins instantly if the starch
                    is already boiled; so that, unless the food is “bolted,” a considerable quantity
                    of soluble dextrin and sugar is formed before the bolus is swallowed. The act of
                    deglutition passes the softened bolus into the stomach, where already a certain
                    quantity of acid gastric juice is ready to receive it. The presence of food in
                    the stomach is a greater stimulus to the gastric flow than its presence in the
                    mouth: the juice is more rapidly secreted, but still it is comparatively poor in
                    pepsin <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n734/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0734-0677"/> and still more so in free acid; but after a time,
                    as more food is added, and as the first-coming food begins to be dissolved and
                    absorbed, the proportion of pepsin is increased. The movements of the stomach
                    mix intimately the acid juice and the alkaline food; the first effect of this is
                    a neutralization of the mass, but, as the secretion of juice goes on for some
                    time after the last portion of an ordinary meal has been swallowed, the mass
                    becomes more and more acid. The amylolytic action of the swallowed saliva is
                    gradually checked, and the still unchanged starch remains unchanged so long as
                    it lingers in the stomach.</p>
                <p>Such saline and other dissolved matters as are still soluble in slightly acid
                    solutions remain dissolved, and, with the water which is swallowed, may pass at
                    once into the blood-vessels by absorption. Other salts, as the carbonates and
                    phosphates of the alkaline earths, become dissolved in the presence of an acid.
                    The gelatigenous tissues—connective tissue holding together in its meshes fibres
                    of muscle, globules of fat, strands of nerve, Ac.—are dissolved. The skins or
                    pellicles of the fat-vesicles suffer the same fate. The elastic sarcolemma is
                    now thought to be similarly affected. As a consequence the proteid and fatty
                    portions of the organs referred to escape and fall into smaller fragments.
                    Muscular fibres readily split into fibrillae and disks, and are then in the very
                    best physical condition for the free play of the gastric juice. The fat escapes,
                    flows together to form larger globules, but is otherwise unchanged. Cane-sugar,
                    which is of no use to the organism until it is converted into maltose or
                    glucose, finds in some slight degree the condition for this conversion in the
                    combined action of the gastric juice and the gastric mucus, although we are
                    still in great doubt as to where the greatest conversion takes place. The
                    all-important change which the food undergoes in the stomach is, however, the
                    change of its proteid element into the more diffusible form of peptones, about
                    which it will be enough to say that it is not a mere solution of proteid in a
                    dilute acid, although this may be the first step in the operation, but probably
                    a decomposition of the original proteid molecule. The obvious effect of gastric
                    digestion is to reduce the food to a grey pulpy mass called chyme, in which
                    condition it passes into the duodenum along with more refractory or less
                    perfectly digested portions of food such as may still remain in the stomach at
                    the end of the normal period of gastric digestion.</p>
                <p>The presence of food in the stomach, as has been remarked, is of itself a
                    stimulus to the secretion of bile and pancreatic fluid; by the time, therefore,
                    that the chyme passes into the duodenum, a considerable quantity of the fresh
                    juices is prepared for it. Not only so; the contact of the acid chyme with the
                    duodenal membrane at once brings on a reflex contraction of the ducts and
                    gall-bladder of the liver, by which a sharp stream of alkaline fluid is at once
                    poured out, wherewith the chyme is drenched. So far as the mixture is made
                    perfect and the point of neutralization is reached, a precipitate of
                    parapeptones and peptones is formed, carrying down with it the active pepsin.
                    But the acidity of the chyme is not at once overcome; not until the middle of
                    the small intestine is reached does the acid reaction entirely disappear; and we
                    may therefore assume that a kind of exotic gastric digestion may go on in the
                    parts of chyme which still remain acid. But whenever the reaction ceases to be
                    strongly acid the pancreatic juice takes up the work of digestion. Proteids are
                    changed into soluble peptones, and the conversion of starch into dextrin and
                    maltose begins again with redoubled vigour. Fats are seized upon, resolved into
                    glycerin and their fatty acids, and emulsified both by bile and by pancreatic
                    fluid. The resulting fatty acids combine with the alkalies of the mass to form
                    soaps, which in turn aid the process of emulsification. The chyme, which, from
                    being grey, became of a golden-orange colour when saturated with bile, acquires
                    a decidedly cream-like appearance from the emulsion that is formed.</p>
                <p>It is still an interesting question whether pancreatic proteolysis ever, in
                    health, goes beyond the formation of peptones, as it may certainly do in
                    artificial digestion in the laboratory. Some leucin and tyrosin undoubtedly
                    appear in the small intestine; but, inasmuch as they are bodies which, if
                    formed, would be rapidly absorbed, it is impossible to say whether any
                    considerable amount of proteid matter sutlers this fate, or whether leucin and
                    tyrosin are formed, as it were, accidentally, from the too long staying of an
                    excess of proteid in the alimentary canal. Leucin and tyrosin are never found in
                    the faeces.</p>
                <p>As the remnant of food passes down the intestine, changes allied to putrefaction
                    invariably occur. Lactic acid is always to be detected in the small intestine,
                    and the amount of it increases as the ileo-caecal valve is approached. Possibly
                    the butyric acid fermentation likewise occurs as a constant, if not an
                    essential, phenomenon of intestinal digestion. At least the gases of the small
                    intestine always contain a small amount of hydrogen; but if we are to gauge the
                    butyric acid fermentation by the amount of hydrogen detected, we must assume it
                    to be of very small proportions. We are so ignorant of the nature of the enteric
                    or intestinal juice that we need not here speculate as to the changes in the
                    remnant of food which the addition of it may bring about. Let it suffice to say
                    that the intestinal contents pass through the ileo-caecal valve with none of the
                    odour and little of the appearance of faecal matter. While in the large
                    intestine they become reduced in bulk, and approach a solid consistency by the
                    abstraction of water from them. Their reaction becomes distinctly acid once
                    more; but now, from inward processes of putrefaction and fermentation which were
                    started already in the small intestine, putrefactive gases may arise, light
                    carburetted hydrogen, carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, nitrogen, and
                    hydrogen. The faeces themselves are commonly acid; besides the indigestible
                    parts of food, such as horny matter and cellulose (the denser sorts at least),
                    and the undigested but digestible overplus of starch, proteid, &amp;c., they
                    contain derivatives from the bile which cause the characteristic colour, and
                    some final decomposition products of elements of food, such as indol.</p>
                <p>II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Absorption of Nutritive Matters into the
                    Blood.</hi></p>
                <p>The complex processes of digestion result in the conversion of insoluble and
                    indiffusible food-stuffs into soluble and diffusible sugars and peptones. These,
                    with the soluble saline matters, the finely-divided or emulsified fats and
                    water, are (if we except the small quantity of soaps formed in the course of
                    pancreatic digestion, and the small amount of soluble leucin and tyrosin evolved
                    in the same process) the only contents of the alimentary canal capable of
                    entering the organism from the outer world. They are not indeed the only soluble
                    and absorbable bodies in the intestine; a large part of the digestive juices
                    themselves are reabsorbed, and may possibly do duty over again in their
                    respective secretions. But these are not foods. How, it may now be asked, do
                    these soluble or finely-divided substances pass the confines of the body? F rom
                    what has already been said about the organs of digestion it will be evident
                    that, from the stomach downwards, the alimentary cavity is separated from an
                    infinite number of thin-walled vessels by a delicate layer of columnar
                    epithelium and a filmy basement membrane. There seems at first sight to be no
                    difficulty in understanding how water and dissolved and diffusible matters may
                    pass these barriers with the greatest readiness by physical processes of
                    diffusion which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0735-0678"/> are so simply imitated in the laboratory. We know
                    also that, in fact, solutions do with the greatest ease and rapidity pass
                    through such a membrane as the conjunctiva, by the readiness with which the
                    pupil may be dilated on putting a drop of atropinized fluid beneath the eyelid.
                    But it is by no means clear that the process is so simple in the living
                    intestine. A fresh specimen of epithelium scraped from the interior of the mouth
                    of a pig may be bathed in a solution of colouring matter and yet admit no trace
                    of the colour into the substance of its cells so long as they remain alive. It
                    is only when they cease to be living protoplasm that the physical processes of
                    diffusion come into play and that the cell-substance takes up the colour. Guided
                    by this simple observation we shall hesitate to assume, because we have water
                    containing soluble sugars, salts, and peptones on one side of the epithelium of
                    the alimentary tract, while on the other we have fluids differently constituted,
                    that therefore we must needs have a process of transfusion tending to the
                    passage of the dissolved substances from one side to the other. This
                    “absorption” of matters, even simple saline solutions, at the surface of the
                    intestine may be, and most probably is, a vital operation. Be the nature of the
                    process what it may, it is easy to conceive how fluids at least arrive at the
                    interior of the blood and the lymph capillaries of the alimentary mucous
                    membranes. The case of the particles of emulsified fat presents more difficulty;
                    but even here there are only two possibilities open to us. Either the fine
                    globules pass <hi rend="italic">through</hi> the columnar cells, or they pass
                    <hi rend="italic">between</hi> them; if they pass through them they must
                    traverse the thick striated inelastic end of the cells in a manner λvhich it is
                    somewhat difficult for us to picture; if they only pass between the cells it is
                    difficult to explain why so many of the acutest observers have described the
                    occurrence of fat-particles within the epithelial cells of recent preparations
                    of intestinal mucous membranes.</p>
                <p>Once through the epithelial layer the absorbed matters pass into the
                    blood-vessels or the lymphatics in some way the details of which are as yet mere
                    matters of speculation, The axial lymphatic vessels of the villi—the so-called
                    lacteal radicles—have a special interest, since villi are pre-eminently the
                    absorbent rootlets of the body. As soon as they become filled, the layer of
                    muscular fibres investing them contracts and empties the contents of the lacteal
                    towards the deeper vessels of the mucosa. The subsequent expansion of the
                    radicle will evidently favour the refilling of it.</p>
                <p>It is very disputable where absorption takes place. The filtrate obtained from
                    the contents of the stomach yields very little peptones, the inference being
                    that much has already become absorbed by the gastric capillaries, haemic or
                    lymphatic. There seems to be no reason why water, salines, and dissolved sugars
                    should not also be taken up at the same place. In the large intestine water at
                    least is absorbed, for the contents become drier as they pass along the bowel.
                    But it is the small intestine chiefly which is the scene of most extensive
                    absorption of digested products; here fats are demonstrably taken into the
                    organism; and here, doubtless, more than elsewhere, peptones, sugars, and other
                    soluble bodies suffer the same fate.</p>
                <p>Blood-vessels and lymph-vessels are both sharers of the work, though to what
                    extent each is employed is a matter of surmise rather than of observation. The
                    lacteals certainly absorb the largest part of the fat, though, as the relative
                    amount of fat in the portal vein increases after a meal, fat must also be
                    absorbed by the blood-capillaries, The material absorbed into the portal vein is
                    at once submitted to the smaller circulation of the liver and the activity of
                    the liver-cells; that absorbed into the lacteals traverses many lymphatic glands
                    before it reaches the thoracic duct and the general circulation at the root of
                    the neck. Thus in both ways of absorption the raw material is immediately passed
                    into certain organs before it reaches the common stock of blood. That changes
                    are effected in the constitution of the just-received food-stuffs during their
                    stay in these organs there is every reason to believe; for, on the one hand, the
                    blood issuing from the liver in the hepatic veins differs from the blood
                    entering it by the portal vein; and, on the other, the contents of the thoracic
                    duct differ from the contents of vessels nearer the absorbent radicles, as, for
                    example, the contents of the mesenteric lacteals. The nature of these changes
                    must be discussed in the next section.</p>
                <p>III.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemical Processes in the Tissues and Organs of the
                    Body.</hi></p>
                <p>While it is probable that the liver modifies the recently-digested raw material
                    of food before it reaches the common stock of the blood, it is quite unknown
                    what (or, indeed, if any) difference exists between the action of the liver on
                    blood laden with raw material immediately after a meal and its action on blood
                    traversing its capillaries during a fast. Does the liver exert an action on
                    recently-imported fat, peptones, and sugar in any sense different from the
                    action it exerts on fatty, albuminous, and sugary matters as they exist in the
                    common stock of blood? Or—which is the same question—do the fats, albuminous
                    matters, and sugars of the portal blood differ at all from the fats, albuminous
                    matters, and sugars of ordinary blood? While this question remains unanswered it
                    will be well to consider the liver as like any other tissue drawing on the
                    common source of nutriment, the blood, for its own particular purposes, and not
                    as an organ akin to the special digestive organs, devoted to the elaboration of
                    food for the benefit of the other tissues.</p>
                <p>It need not be so, however, with the lymphatic structures with which the chyle of
                    the lacteals comes into contact before it is poured into the blood. Chyle from
                    the thoracic duct at its entrance into the veins is of course mixed with the
                    general lymph of the body,—the juice of the tissues which is collected in the
                    lymph-vessels and carried back to the blood. It is a milky fluid which
                    coagulates on standing, the clot of which after some time becomes tinted red at
                    the surface from the presence of immature red corpuscles. The coagulum consists
                    of fibrin resembling that of the blood. Other constituents of chyle are white
                    corpuscles, oil-globules coated with albuminous matter, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> emulsified, and exceedingly fine fatty granules usually spoken of as
                    the “molecular basis of chyle.” Chyle obtained from vessels nearer the
                    intestines has very little fibrin, very few white corpuscles, and no red
                    corpuscles. It is probable, therefore, that the raw matters of digested food are
                    undergoing a process of manufacture into blood during their passage through the
                    lymphatic glands to reach the thoracic duct.</p>
                <p>When once they arrive at the blood, the imported materials of food are lost
                    beyond our power to follow them individually. The question now becomes one of
                    the interchanges between the blood generally and the tissues. That such an
                    interchange occurs there can be no doubt; for if all food be withheld from an
                    animal the tissues rapidly grow less in quantity, while the blood maintains a
                    fairly constant composition. If such an animal be fed, the tissues regain their
                    former weight, and may even store up an overplus of matters, while again the
                    blood remains of approximately constant composition. The tissues can both take
                    away from the blood and give to the blood such matters as are necessary. But the
                    matters taken from the blood are not in the same form as the matters given up to
                    the blood. When blood is made to circulate through living tissues of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n736/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0736-0679"/> whatever kind the blood entering the tissue
                    always has a different composition from the blood which leaves it. The tissues,
                    therefore, are laboratories in which materials abstracted from the blood are
                    transformed. To these chemical operations of transformation which occur in
                    living tissues the term “metabolic” has been applied, a term first used by
                    Schwann, and happily reintroduced by Michael Foster.</p>
                <p>What now becomes of the products of the metabolic activity of the tissues? We
                    have hitherto considered the tissues as taking matter from the blood, changing
                    the form of it, and giving it back to the blood; but this is far from being the
                    true account of the process. It does indeed represent all that we know of the
                    metabolism of many tissues. In muscle, for example, matters are drawn from the
                    blood, converted to other shapes within the tissue, and sooner or later cast out
                    into the blood-current again. The same may be said of nerve-tissue and possibly
                    of some other tissues. In secreting glands the case is different. Some only of
                    the products of tissue-metabolism are returned to the blood; others are poured
                    into the ducts of the glands as the glandular secretion, and so leave the body
                    altogether. This happens, for example, in the digestive glands, the milk-glands,
                    and the kidneys. In a third order of tissues the case is different again, for
                    here some of the products of metabolism may be retained in the tissue for an
                    indefinite time. This occurs in certain tissues which have been called storage
                    tissues, and of which fat is a typical example. Lastly, the liver is a complex
                    organ whose metabolic products are disposed of in all three ways,—part being
                    cast at once into the blood, part being accumulated in the tissue itself as
                    glycogen and passing into the blood at intervals as the body needs it, and a
                    third part being poured into the biliary ducts in order that it may escape into
                    the intestine. It will be well, therefore, to recognize three methods of the
                    disposal of metabolic products, and to classify the tissues accordingly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metabolism of Muscular Tissue.—</hi> To arrive at a knowledge
                    of the chemico-vital changes occurring in any tissue we must compare the matters
                    entering the tissue with the matters issuing from it. It is only from such a
                    comparison that we can infer the changes which go on within the tissue. In the
                    case of muscle there is yet another method by which we can obtain inferences as
                    to the nature of the metabolic changes. We have reason to believe that the
                    tissue-changes of active muscles are simply the exaggerated form of changes
                    which constantly occur. If we may assume this, a comparison of the chemical
                    composition of muscle before and after a period of activity will help us to a
                    knowledge of the changes that occur in muscular action, and, by implication, a
                    knowledge also of the common metabolic changes of the tissue. Now a comparison
                    of muscle before and after action shows that during activity the quantity of CO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> becomes very largely increased; at the same time
                    the muscle becomes of acid reaction from the development of lactic acid; the
                    amount of bodies soluble in water decreases, while the amount of bodies soluble
                    in alcohol increases; the amount of glycogen decreases, while that of sugar
                    increases; and, finally, bodies develop which have a strong affinity for oxygen.
                    If we compare the matters entering and issuing from muscular tissue we shall
                    find that muscle gives up much CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> during activity,
                    that the issuing blood is rich in reducing substances, and that it acquires
                    sarcolactic acid. The circumstance of most importance in this comparison is that
                    carbon dioxide is liberated in large amount without the immediate interaction of
                    oxygen; the CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is produced from some body in the
                    muscle which already contains within itself the O necessary for its formation.
                    The fact of next important^ is the absence of all indications of a large
                    expenditure of nitrogen. Relying on these discoveries, physiologists have
                    supposed that the metabolic changes of muscle follow some such course as the
                    following. Non-nitrogenous organic material, along with oxygen, is absorbed into
                    the tissue from the blood. In the tissue-cells it is elaborated with nitrogenous
                    matter already in the tissue into a complex body called <hi rend="italic"
                    >inogene substance,</hi> containing a nitrogenous factor linked to carbon,
                    hydrogen, and oxygen. During the life of the tissue, and to a much greater
                    extent during muscular activity, this inogene substance is split up into a
                    nitrogenous portion and a non-nitrogenous portion, of which the former is
                    retained in the tissue to be again worked up into inogene substance, while the
                    latter is resolved into more stable bodies which escape. The full number of the
                    effete bodies is not at present known to us; it doubtless includes more than
                    carbon dioxide and sarcolactic acid, but these are the only bodies whose
                    existence has been definitely determined.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metabolism of Glandular Organs.—</hi> Of late years very much
                    light has been shed on the processes of glandular cells, but it has been chiefly
                    on their anatomical aspect. We know very little, indeed, of the nature of the
                    chemical changes going on within the glandular cells, because, although we can
                    ascertain approximately the composition of those products of the changes which
                    escape into the glandular duct, we as yet know so little of those products which
                    escape into the blood. We know, however, that mucin is capable of being formed
                    in the interior of epithelial cells out of some non-mucous antecedent. We also
                    have some reason for supposing that the gastric glandular cells—the
                    border-cells—select phosphate of sodium and sodium chloride from the blood, and
                    these bodies have been shown to be capable of interacting in such a way as to
                    yield free hydrochloric acid. In the secretion of milk it is tolerably certain
                    that the fat and the casein are both formed out of proteid matter within the
                    glandular cells. Even the milk-sugar has been thought to be elaborated out of
                    some non-saccharine substance, or even out of some substance that is not a
                    carbohydrate. In the case of the pancreas we know nothing of the actual chemical
                    decompositions that occur, but we do know that they occur in two well-marked
                    stages. In the first a body is formed which is stored in the gland-cells, as the
                    inogene substance is supposed to be stored in muscle; in the second this body is
                    resolved into other but still complex bodies, of which the trypsin ferment of
                    the secretion is one. Among the glandular organs we may mention the kidney,
                    respecting whose secretive activity it is far from certain that it entirely
                    consists of physical filtration or powers of mere selection. No doubt many of
                    the constituents of urine are simply filtered off from the blood, while others
                    are undoubtedly abstracted owing to some peculiar attraction which the renal
                    cells exert upon them. But there is some reason to think that others may be
                    formed within the kidney-tissues as products of cell-metabolism. As yet we have
                    no definite knowledge concerning the nature of the metabolic changes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metabolism in the Storage Tissues.—</hi> Of these the first
                    that we shall describe is adipose tissue or fat. Fat appears to be accumulated
                    in ordinary connective-tissue corpuscles. What metabolic changes occur in
                    connective-tissue corpuscles which are not accumulating fat we do not know; but
                    under certain conditions of overfeeding the metabolism is so varied that fat is
                    deposited within the cell. At first it appears in the form of fine granules;
                    these soon coalesce to globules, which afterwards enlarge by the confluence of
                    granules subsequently formed. The exact changes of which this fat is the
                    outcome, or one of the products, are entirely obscure. It is enough if we can
                    establish the probability that fat may be derived from the proteid
                    protoplasmic<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n737/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0737-0680"/> matter of the fat-cell. We are not here guided,
                    as in the case of muscle, by analysis of the blood approaching the adipose
                    tissue and the blood leaving it. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that fat
                    may be derived from the proteid elements of food through the activity of living
                    tissue-cells. That proteid matter readily lends itself to a decomposition of
                    which fat is one product is seen in the formation of fat-like “adipocere” in the
                    nitrogenous tissues of dead bodies which have been for some time buried or
                    immersed in water; and it is likewise seen in the process of “ripening” in
                    cheese, in which the fat increases while the albuminous matter diminishes. But
                    in addition to these general facts, suggestive though they are, there are not
                    wanting proofs of a more particular kind that fat may result from proteid
                    decompositions. If dogs are fed on starch and fat with no proteid food at all,
                    the carbon stored up in the body can all be accounted for by reference to the
                    fat of the food and the proteid matter of the body which, in the state of
                    starvation, came to be disintegrated. In many other cases it seems clear that
                    the fat stored up by animals during fattening unquestionably comes in part from
                    the nitrogenous matters of food. But a consideration of the relative amount of
                    carbon and nitrogen contained in proteids and in urea, which is the final
                    product of the oxidation of proteid matter, would alone lead us strongly to
                    suspect such an origin of fat. If all its nitrogen reappeared in the form of
                    urea, 300 grains of proteid would give rise to 100 grains of urea. But 100
                    grains of urea contain but 20 grains of carbon, whereas 300 grains of proteid
                    matter yield 159 grains of carbon. What has become of the deficit of carbon <hi
                    rend="italic">Ί</hi><hi rend="italic">If</hi> it has not been burnt off as
                    carbon dioxide, it must remain within the body in Some non-nitrogenous form.</p>
                <p>If fat may be derived from proteids in the body, it is now equally certain that
                    in some animals at least fat may come from carbohydrates of the food. Lawes and
                    Gilbert have conclusively shown that as much as 40 per cent, of the stored-up
                    fat in well-fattened pigs could not possibly have come from the nitrogenous
                    parts of the food, and that it must have been derived from the
                    carbohydrates.</p>
                <p>All these facts render it very probable that the fat-forming tissues pick out
                    from the blood albuminous or non-nitrogenous matter, transform it, retain the
                    fatty element and discharge the rest. But it must not be forgotten that fat of
                    food may, on finding itself in the blood, be taken up by appropriate
                    tissue-cells and stored up without undergoing further change. Even this,
                    although it seems so probable, may not at once be assumed to occur in such a
                    simple manner. It is true that, if an animal be fed on fat resembling the fat of
                    its own tissues, it might be assumed that the fat which it stores is simply
                    absorbed by the tissue-corpuscles as an amoeba absorbs its food. But if this
                    were really the manner of the process we should expect that allied fats
                    substituted for the natural fat would be equally well taken up and stored, This,
                    however, is not at all the case. Dogs fed on a mixture of palmitin and olein,
                    but no stearin, are found on analysis to have stearin in their body-fat; just as
                    dogs fed on palmitin and stearin, but no olein, are found to have an abundance
                    of olein stored up. And, even when fed on spermaceti, a dog was found to present
                    mere traces of it in the fat accumulated in its tissues during the experiment.
                    In short, all facts go to show that the accumulation of fat does not take place
                    without some display of formative or transformative energy.</p>
                <p>The last tissue whose metabolism we shall discuss is the hepatic tissue of the
                    liver. Hitherto we have considered the liver as a digestive gland secreting the
                    bile for the purposes of digestion; but the liver has other functions which
                    overshadow entirely its function as a digestive organ. It seems to have the
                    power of accumulating amyloid material very much as adipose tissue accumulates
                    fat, It would probably be a mistake to regard these two functions of the liver
                    as altogether independent of one another, although it is necessary to state that
                    a direct dependence has not yet been established, There can, however, be little
                    doubt that the hepatic tissue draws to itself a variety of matters from the
                    blood flowing into it by the portal vein and hepatic artery, and elaborates
                    these constituents into various products, some of which escape into the blood
                    again, others of which appear as the bile, while a third order remain in store
                    within the substance of the liver. But, although these products are probably
                    associated more or less intimately in their origin, they have, in the natural
                    development of physiology, been studied independently of one another for the
                    most part,</p>
                <p>If an animal be richly fed on starchy or saccharine food it is found, within a
                    short time of the digestion of the food, that the liver contains a large
                    quantity of a starchy body called glycogen (C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi rend="subscript">
                    n</hi>. In order to obtain glycogen from liver-substance it is necessary to make
                    use of the tissue of an animal just killed, for the starchy body undergoes an
                    extremely rapid <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> conversion into a sugar.
                    Liver taken quickly from the still warm body of a rabbit is rapidly divided into
                    small pieces and plunged at once into briskly boiling water. The high
                    temperature prevents the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> change and leaves
                    the glycogen in a condition to be separated. The pieces of liver may then be
                    pounded with sand and water, and the mixture acidulated and filtered. From the
                    filtrate the glycogen may be precipitated by alcohol, and the precipitate may be
                    purified by boiling in caustic potash and afterwards neutralizing and
                    reprecipitating with alcohol. Or the albuminous matters may be thrown down by a
                    solution of mercuric iodide in iodide of potassium before precipitating the
                    glycogen with alcohol. Glycogen so prepared is a white amorphous powder
                    resembling starch in chemical composition; it is colourless and tasteless. Its
                    aqueous solution is milky, and generally opalescent.</p>
                <p>Other tissues and organs besides the liver have been found to contain glycogen.
                    For example, muscles contain some glycogen, which diminishes during muscular
                    activity, while it has been detected in the tissues of embryos and of young
                    animals, as well as in newly-formed pathological growths.</p>
                <p>There can be little doubt that glycogen is manufactured mainly out of
                    carbohydrates conveyed to it in the portal vein. If a rabbit be starved for some
                    days, the whole of the glycogen disappears from the liver; but the store is at
                    once, in the course of a few hours, replenished if starch or sugar of whatever
                    sort (cane, grape, or milk) be introduced into the alimentary canal, The
                    metabolic powers of the liver-cells in respect of glycogen-production are not,
                    however, limited to starches or sugars. If glycerin be injected into the
                    intestines the amount of glycogen in the liver is at once increased. But some
                    preparation of the glycerin is necessary before the liver-cells are able to
                    appropriate it; and this preparation is accomplished in the true digestive
                    organs, since glycerin introduced into the blood by subcutaneous injection does
                    not bring about any increase in the glycogen of the liver. Even albuminous
                    bodies, such as fibrin and albumin, freed from all trace of amyloid matter, seem
                    in the case of carnivorous animals to yield glycogen in the laboratory of the
                    hepatic tissue. The same may be said of gelatin. Now it is easy to form a
                    chemical conception of the manner in which such a body as grape-sugar leads to
                    the storing of glycogen, for the dehydration of the sugar would be all the
                    change required for the conversion. But we can at present form no picture of the
                    operation in the case of glycerin and of the albuminous matters; and the fact
                    that these substances also are amenable to the livercells should make us
                    hesitate to assume at once that in the case of sugar the process is the simple
                    one of dehydration, We must wait for further light to be shed upon the
                    interdependence of what we may for the moment call the biliary metabolism and
                    the glycogenic metabolism of liver - cell before we speculate as to the exact
                    nature of the changes.</p>
                <p>The liver has, beyond a doubt, the faculty of manufacturing an amyloid body out
                    of various raw matters brought within the range of its activity, and of storing
                    it up for future use. The use to which it is put has been the subject of much
                    speculation and experimental inquiry. The amyloid matter when drawn upon may
                    leave the liver in the form in which it exists there, or it may be converted
                    into some other modification and afterwards transferred to the blood. The fact
                    that other tissues besides the liver contain glycogen and the fact that some, as
                    muscle, seem to make use of glycogen in the act of contraction, have been
                    thought to s⅛ιpport the hypothesis that the glycogen is conveyed by the blood to
                    their tissues and then consumed. According to this theory the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0738-0681"/> hepatic metabolism ends in the production of
                    glycogen, which merely waits to be cast out into the blood-current at the call
                    of the body generally. Against this hypothesis, as a complete explanation of the
                    use of liver-glycogen, it may be urged that the glycogen of muscle at least
                    disappears on starvation long before the store of glycogen in the liver has been
                    used up. Moreover, the glycogen of muscle is by no means invariably present, and
                    is certainly not indispensable to the activity of the tissue. λVe may therefore
                    conclude that the use of glycogen by the tissues (when we judge of it by the
                    case of muscle) is not constant enough or important enough to account for the
                    large store of glycogen in the liver. But, if the hepatic glycogen does not
                    leave the liver as such, it must undergo some other change in the liver; and the
                    circumstance above referred to, that glycogen so readily becomes converted into
                    sugar <hi rend="italic">post mortem,</hi> at once leads us to inquire whether a
                    similar conversion is not normally effected during life. The inquiry becomes of
                    especial value when we remember that the blood contains a constant proportion of
                    sugar in its composition, which argues such a constancy of supply as could not
                    be due to the direct importation of sugar during the irregular periods of the
                    daily meals. As the amount of sugar in the blood is constant, the periodic
                    introduction of carbohydrate into the organism must be followed by some
                    temporary storing of it in some organ from which it may be constantly, and
                    without intermission, doled out. Now the body contains in many parts the means
                    of the conversion of starches into sugar. The salivary or pancreatic juices with
                    the utmost readiness at the body-temperature change glycogen into a sugar. Many
                    tissues, as well as blood, are said to effect the same conversion, although it
                    is denied that the blood does so unless the bloodcorpuscles have been first
                    destroyed. The liver itself, as we have already seen, may bring about the same
                    change, at least after death; but the activity of the converting substance may
                    be prevented by subjecting it to a temperature of boiling water. If the liver
                    contain the ferment-like body during life, unless its activity be restrained in
                    some way or other, the glycogen λvhich is formed in the liver will be speedily
                    changed into sugar. In regard to the existence of this starch-converting body it
                    is significant that, while it certainly may arise in the blood when the
                    blood-corpuscles are destroyed, the liver is known to be the seat of an
                    extensive destruction of blood-corpuscles. Considerations of this sort, however,
                    are of little cogency; it would be a strong presumption of the existence of the
                    ferment in question if sugar could be proved to be normally present in the
                    hepatic tissue during life, but the experimental proof of this is beset by great
                    difficulties, and discordant results have been obtained by the different
                    observers. Claude Bernard, to whose researches we owe so much of our knowledge
                    on this interesting question, detected small but perceptible quantities of sugar
                    in quite fresh liver-substa nee; but other observers, among whom Dr Pavy is to
                    be reckoned the first, have failed to find even a trace. Further, Bernard was
                    able to make out a decided difference between the amount of sugar contained in
                    the portal vein and the hepatic vein respectively when there was no starch or
                    sugar in the food to load the portal vein. In such circumstances the blood
                    issuing from the liver by the hepatic vein was found to contain a small quantity
                    of sugar in excess of the blood entering the portal vessels. The most accurate
                    and reliable investigations have, however, conclusively proved that this
                    difference does not exist. The matter, therefore, still awaits some crucial test
                    not yet devised. In the meantime we may accept the hypothesis of a conversion of
                    liver-glycogen into soluble sugar as one which, however probable, is not
                    supported by sufficient evidence. Amongst those who have rejected this
                    hypothesis some have had recourse to qjher assumptions to account for the fate
                    of glycogen in the body; and it has been suggested that glycogen undergoes
                    conversion into fat either in the liver itself or partly there and partly in
                    some other tissue. This suggestion has little direct evidence to support it. It
                    is true that animals, especially the pig, have the poλver of storing up fat in
                    their bodies which they cannot have obtained otherwise than from the
                    carbohydraceous constituents of their food. It is also true that the hepatic
                    tissue is often found to contain fat in considerable quantities. But it is easy
                    to see how these facts admit of simple explanation without assuming a conversion
                    of glycogen into fat within the liver-cells. The chemical nature of such a
                    conversion is difficult to imagine; but it would be rash to assume that the
                    metabolic powers of animal protoplasm are not sufficient to accomplish it.</p>
                <p>With regard to the metabolism of liver-tissue which leads to the production of
                    bile we possess but little direct knowledge. The secretion of bile is not a mere
                    act of filtration of already-formed matters from the blood; but we have at
                    present no conception of the chemical changes which occur in the interior of the
                    liver-cells in the elaboration of bile. There is strong reason to think that the
                    bile-pigments are derived from the colouring matter of blood, not only from the
                    circumstance of the large destruction of blood-corpuscles which takes place in
                    the liver but also from the resemblance or identity of bilirubin and
                    haematoidin, a body derived from extravasated blood. A large number of facts
                    point very clearly to the conclusions (1) that the liver is an organ in which
                    chemical changes of great magnitude and importance have their seat, (2) that
                    their operation consists in great part in decomposition of proteids.</p>
                <p>The high temperature of the blood which leaves the liver, and which is the
                    hottest blood of the body, is the chief proof of the correctness of the first of
                    these conclusions, whilst the second rests upon many considerations. The
                    bile-acids unquestionably do not exist in the blood, but are the results of
                    proteid metabolism within the liver-cells. There are strong grounds for
                    believing that urea, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> N <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, as well as uric acid, has its principal
                    origin in the liver, which is equivalent to localizing the chief seat of proteid
                    metabolism in this organ.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diabetes.—</hi> In connexion with the glycogenic function of
                    the liver it is necessary to refer to a disease which is of special interest to
                    physiologists, from the ease with which the symptoms may be artificially
                    reproduced. The disease itself may be defined as the appearance of large
                    quantities of sugar in the urine, while the total amount of the urine excreted
                    is also increased. Now diabetes of a temporary nature may be produced in animals
                    in a variety of ways. If certain fibres of the medulla oblongata near what is
                    known as the vaso-motor centre be divided, as they may be by means of a special
                    instrument, without producing any serious abnormal motor or sensory symptoms,
                    there follows very speedily the excretion of large quantities of sugar in the
                    urine. It is evident that this result is due in some way to an abnormal
                    influence of the nervous system. The path by which the abnormal influence is
                    transmitted has been carefully traced down the spinal cord to the first thoracic
                    sympathetic ganglion; if this path be interrupted at any point symptoms follow
                    similar to those caused by the local injury to the medulla oblongata. The
                    circumstance that interruption of this nervous pathway at any point causes the
                    appearance of sugar in the urine at once leads to the suspicion that the escape
                    of sugar is not directly caused by the shock of the operation or injury. We are
                    rather brought to the conclusion that the natural absence of sugar from the
                    urine is due to a restraining influence of the nervous system acting continually
                    in a manner to be discussed hereafter, and that the division of the path by
                    which the continual restraint is exercised merely intercepts the inhibitory
                    influence. This is confirmed by the observation that the medulla is in
                    communication with certain afferent nerves, through which also the restraint may
                    be removed. These nerves are the vagi; division of them leads to a transient
                    appearance of sugar in small amount in the urine; but stimulation of their
                    cerebral ends brings about the escape of sugar to a remarkable degree. This
                    clearly can only be due to an inhibition by afferent nerves very similar to the
                    inhibition of the heart which follows stimulation of the cerebral end of the
                    abdominal sympathetic nerve in the frog.</p>
                <p>The intercepting of this hypothetical restraint by the anatomical section of
                    nerves is not the only way of artificially bringing about diabetes. Sugar may
                    appear in the urine during the action of curare and after a suitable dose of
                    morphia, and also after the injection of dilute saline solutions into the
                    blood-vessels. The probable relationship of these various methods of causing
                    diabetes will be referred to later.</p>
                <p>There can be no question that diabetes is a disease affecting the glycogenic
                    function of the liver. In many cases of natural or pathological diabetes, if all
                    carbohydrates be withheld from the patient, the urine becomes free or almost
                    free from sugar; and in like manner, if an animal be starved until there is
                    every reason to suppose that its liver has become free from glycogen, and
                    afterwards it be subjected to the operation for producing artificial diabetes,
                    no sugar appears in the urine. Similarly, if an animal be drugged with arsenic,
                    which leads to a rapid loss of all the glycogen of the liver, and afterwards
                    poisoned with curare, the latter drug no longer brings about diabetes. In short,
                    if the liver contains no glycogen no sugar can appear in the urine. This being
                    so, in what special way is the glycogenic function modified in diabetes? If we
                    assume that the function of the liver is to seize upon all sugar passing along
                    the portal veins from the intestinal canal and store it up as glycogen, in order
                    that it may be piecemeal returned to the blood to be burnt off’ in distant
                    organs, we can easily review the various conceivable ways in which diabetes
                    might be caused. It must, in the first place, be premised that the blood is
                    unable to contain more than a certain percentage of sugar. When this percentage
                    is overtopped the excess of sugar escapes in the urine. Of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n739/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0739-0682"/> this there is direct experimental proof in the
                    facts that if sugar be <hi rend="italic">slowly</hi> injected into the jugular
                    vein, no escape of it by the kidneys takes place, because the organism can make
                    use of a small excess of sugar; but if it be injected <hi rend="italic"
                    >quickly</hi> diabetes ensues from the too rapid accumulation of it in the
                    blood. Accepting this, we can readily see that diabetes might be caused (1) by
                    the failure of the liver to pick out the sugar in the portal vein in order to
                    store it, (2) by an unusually large escape of glycogen from the liver in the
                    form of sugar, (3) by the failure of the distant organs whose function it is to
                    burn off the daily quantum of sugar.</p>
                <p>It is not improbable that there may be different sorts of diabetes arising from
                    different causes. Thus it has been said that the diabetes of curare-poisoning
                    appears even when the liver has previously been emptied of glycogen by starving
                    the animal. When we reflect that muscles are the organs especially affected by
                    curare, the fact (if it be a fact) just mentioned at once suggests that the
                    sugar which appears in the urine during curare-poisoning is due to some defect
                    in the muscular tissue, in consequence of which the glycogen normally used up by
                    it fails to be used and passes back into the blood. Further, the failure of
                    glycogen-using organs may be due to no disqualification of theirs for tlιe work
                    of utilizing normal glycogen, but to some abnormal constitution of the glycogen
                    (or the sugar) offered to them. Again, the diabetes caused by copious injection
                    of dilute saline solutions into the blood-vessels may be due to the large
                    destruction of blood-corpuscles which follows such injections, and the
                    consequent production of a large quantity of the starch-converting substance
                    which is known to arise in the disintegration of blood-cells. But the common
                    form of artificial diabetes —“puncture diabetes,” as it is sometimes called—the
                    diabetes of anatomical nervous lesions, is undoubtedly due to defects in the
                    hepatic apparatus brought about by the injury. Thus the puncture of the medulla
                    oblongata is of no avail to cause diabetes if the liver has first been deprived
                    of its glycogen by starving the animal experimented upon. It is, however, far
                    from necessary to suppose that the puncture diabetes is due to any incapacity of
                    the livercells for their usual metabolic changes; this may be the cause of some
                    kinds of pathological diabetes, but it is almost certainly not the cause of the
                    traumatic variety, and for the following reason. If sugar be freely administered
                    to an animal in which the diabetic nervous lesion has been established, although
                    it is impossible to load the liver with glycogen as, in such conditions, it
                    would become loaded during health, yet a certain amount of glycogen does become
                    stored in the liver. The liver seems still to possess the power of converting
                    the sugar of food into a store of starch, but not the fulness of opportunity
                    which it has in health.</p>
                <p>The conditions which deprive the liver of the opportunity of storing glycogen are
                    to be sought in an altered vaso-motor mechanism. The circumstance that the
                    “diabetic centre” in the medulla coincides with part of the general vaso-motor
                    centre at once leads to the vaso-motor theory of diabetes; but it may be
                    admitted that this consideration is almost the strongest support of the theory.
                    How a vaso-motor paralysis brings about diabetes λve have as yet no clear
                    picture. Perhaps it is by permitting such a rapid current of blood through the
                    vessels that there is not time enough for the usual transmutations. If we may
                    assume this to be the method by which diabetes is produced, then the vaso-motor
                    theory receives much support from the following consideration. Inasmuch as
                    diabetes is caused by a local (hepatic) dilatation of blood-vessels leading to a
                    superabundant torrent of blood, if means be taken to provide other channels for
                    the blood and so relieve the superabundance, diabetes should be prevented. This
                    may be done by dividing the splanchnic nerves and dilating the enormous vascular
                    tracts of the abdominal organs. In these circumstances the diabetic puncture
                    makes but a trivial change in the circulation of the liver compared with that
                    which it makes when the blood-pressure is normal; and, as might have been
                    foretold from the vaso-motor theory, no diabetes follows. If diabetes from
                    nervous lesions is a vaso-motor phenomenon, other forms of artificial diabetes
                    are not so. Arsenic and antimony seem to destroy the power of the hepatic cells
                    to manufacture glycogen; sugar ingested with the food passes, in consequence of
                    the failure, directly into the blood and out of it into the urine. Ligature of
                    the bile-duct also rapidly leads to profound disorganization of the hepatic
                    tissues, in consequence of which imported sugar passes the portal system
                    unheeded and escapes by the kidneys.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metabolism of the Blood.—</hi> We have hitherto regarded the
                    blood as subordinately related to the great processes of the body, as playing
                    the mechanical part of a carrier, and as if it had no <hi rend="italic"
                    >direct</hi> interest in the metabolic operations themselves; the reader,
                    however, need scarcely be reminded that, but for the respiratory exchanges
                    between the blood on the one hand and the anatomical elements of the tissues on
                    the other, all metabolic processes would be impossible. In the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Respiration,</hi> and in treating the particular section “the
                    respiration of the tissues,” the influence of those exchanges on metabolism will
                    be carefully considered.</p>
                <p>The older physiologists regarded the blood as the very seat of the chemical
                    changes of the body,—a view which is almost entirely opposed to that which we
                    now hold, and which is disproved by many facts.</p>
                <p>We have little or no evidence that the blood exhibits transformations of matter
                    such as we have been discussing in the case of the tissues generally. There are
                    few such transformations known to us in which carbonic acid is not one of the
                    most abundant end-products of the change, and therefore, when we find that blood
                    removed from contact with the tissues and freed from carbon dioxide produces
                    very little of this body, although an abundance of oxygen be supplied to it, we
                    have the right to suspect strongly that it is due to the absence of any active
                    metabolism.</p>
                <p>It is not certain that blood (or lymph), without the intervention of some other
                    tissue, has even the power of converting non-coagulating albumins fresh from the
                    digestive organs into the characteristic fibrin-formers. It is true that when
                    lactate or caprate of soda is injected into the blood of an animal it is readily
                    oxidized; but this may easily be due to the operation of some organ through
                    which the blood passes, and which finds the bodies referred to suitable to its
                    own metabolic processes; and this view of the case is further strengthened when
                    we find that formiate of sodium, which also is a readily oxidized body, passes
                    through the same ordeal unchanged.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the blood is to a certain extent an active living tissue. The white
                    corpuscles, at least, are definite living structures whose life-history, could
                    we but decipher it, would be found to be a history of constant metabolic
                    processes. Towards these elements of the blood the fluid plasma must behave as
                    towards any other tissue-element, supplying them with raw material, and
                    receiving from them the end-products of their internal chemical decomposition;
                    and therefore the blood, as a whole, must be classed among the metabolic
                    tissues. The production of the anatomical elements of the blood does not concern
                    us here; it may suffice to say that the white cells are added to the blood or
                    lymph from certain structures of which the spleen, thymus body, lymphatic
                    glands, and mucosa of the alimentary canal are the chief, and that probably the
                    red corpuscles are developed from the white ones. It may also be pointed out
                    that there are certain parts of the body— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    spleen, liver, marrow of bones, &amp;c.—where there is evidence to show that red
                    corpuscles undergo rapid and wholesale destruction, either for the production of
                    some secretion, or possibly because the corpuscles have become old and unfit for
                    work, and their invaluable constituent, iron, is wanted for younger and more
                    active corpuscles.</p>
                <p>IV.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Processes of Excretion.</hi></p>
                <p>The blood, as has been more than once said, is subject to continual additions and
                    subtractions on the part of the tissues. The subtractions effected by the
                    tissues are made good in part by the importation of fresh material of food from
                    the alimentary canal. The analogous counterbalancing operations which serve to
                    check the accumulation of used-up tissue-substance in the blood take place in
                    certain organs called <hi rend="italic">excretory.</hi> In a strict sense, all
                    organs which cast out material from the body are excretory; the digestive
                    glands, for example, pour their secretions into the alimentary canal, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> outside the strict limits of the body. But so much of
                    their constituents are reabsorbed before the alimentary canal is traversed that
                    they may, for practical purposes, be regarded as never having left the body.
                    Even the constituents of tears, when these do not fall over the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n740/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0740-0683"/> cheeks or escape at the nose, are reabsorbed from
                    the nasal mucous membrane. With respect to the alimentary secretion, it is
                    merely a small proportion of the bile which remains in the faeces that is to be
                    regarded as truly excretory in the sense of being utterly lost to the organism.
                    If excreta are those substances which the body rejects utterly, then we may
                    reckon as excreta (1) the urine, (2) the sweat and oily secretions of the skin,
                    (3) the milk, (4) certain elements of bile contained in the faeces, (5) the
                    gaseous and watery losses at the lungs, (6) the exuviated horny scales of skin
                    and nails and hair, (7) the products of the generative organs, but not those
                    constituents of faeces which are but the undigested remains of food. Among these
                    (if we except the milk and the generative secretions whose elaboration is so
                    peculiar and exceptional) the urine and the excretory products of the lungs and
                    skin are those of paramount importance. The excretion from the lungs will be
                    treated under <hi rend="smallcaps">Respiration</hi>; we shall therefore here
                    concern ourselves with the excretion of kidneys and skin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kidneys and their Excretion.—</hi> Urine is a clear
                    ambercoloured fluid, somewhat acid in reaction, with a peculiar aromatic odour
                    and bitter saline taste. Its specific gravity varies, consistently with health,
                    within wide limits, being affected very greatly (a) by the quantity of liquid
                    consumed by the individual in a given time, (6) by the greater or less activity
                    of the secretion of sweat. Whilst the average specific gravity may be stated to
                    be about 1Ό20, it is often temporarily much lower and occasionally considerably
                    higher. As a rule the specific gravity is higher in summer than in winter. The
                    average quantity of urine passed by a healthy adult may be reckoned at 52 fluid
                    ounces, though it is affected by the same causes as those which influence the
                    specific gravity no less than by individual peculiarity and other
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>The urine is essentially a watery solution of certain organic matters, of which
                    much the most abundant and important is urea, and of mineral salts, of which the
                    most abundant is common salt (sodium chloride).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Urea.—</hi> A well-nourished man passes, on an average, about
                    33 grammes (500 grains) of urea in twenty-four hours. This body, which has the
                    composition CH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, is
                    looked upon by chemists as carbamide, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is the

                    ammonium cyanate. This body represents the chief product of the metamorphosis of
                    albuminous or proteid substances in the body.</p>
                <p>Even during starvation the destruction of proteid matter continues, and the
                    amount of urea may reach about 230 to 310 grains. The quantity is, however,
                    specially and directly affected by the amount of proteid matter contained in the
                    food <hi rend="italic">; so</hi> that, for instance, by consuming a sufficient
                    quantity of meat certain persons have excreted as much as 1540 grains of urea.
                    The excretion of urea, which is a measure of the metamorphosis of proteids in
                    the body, is not, as was formerly supposed, <hi rend="italic">directly</hi>
                    influenced by the amount of mechanical work done by the body, the greater
                    activity of the muscles not being <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> accompanied
                    by their greater waste; <hi rend="italic">indirectly,</hi> however, the
                    excretion of urea is increased by bodily exertion, inasmuch as man and other
                    animals appear instinctively to desire and to need a larger quantity of proteid
                    food when much work is to be done than when the body is comparatively at
                    rest.</p>
                <p>It was formerly believed that urea was a direct result of the oxidation of
                    proteids in the body. The view actually held is, that it is the product of a
                    synthesis occurring in the body in which a body or bodies resulting from the
                    oxidation of the proteids take part. It has recently been shown that when salts
                    of ammonia are introduced into the system the nitrogen of the ammonia is
                    excreted as urea; in this case it is obvious that a synthesis must have occurred
                    in which the ammoniacal salt introduced has taken a part no less than some other
                    body. It has, for instance, been surmised that in the oxidation of the proteid
                    molecule cyanic acid arises, and that in the presence of ammonia ammonium
                    cyanate is formed, which in the organism, as outside, may be changed into urea;
                    or, again, that cyanic acid is formed, which, uniting with the elements of
                    water, gives rise to urea, carbonic acid being separated in the reaction.</p>

                    however, also excreted in the urine considerable quantities of phosphates and
                    sulphates. The two latter salts represent in part similar salts introduced as
                    such into the system, but in part they are the products of oxidation of organic
                    bodies which contain sulphur and phosphorus respectively; to the former belong
                    the proteids, to the latter certain phosphorus - containing fatty bodies of
                    great complexity, which occur widely diffused throughout the body, but
                    particularly in the white matter of the great nerve-centres and in the
                    nerves.</p>
                <p>The changes which urine undergoes after it is passed may be briefly referred to.
                    The faint acid reaction proper to freshly-drawn urine is increased, probably in
                    consequence of an acid-fermentation process started by the mucus accidentally
                    present. The visible effect of this is the deposit of acid urates or free uric
                    acid. In a short time, especially if the urine be kept at a warm temperature,
                    the acid-fermentation is overwhelmed by a fermentation for which organic germs
                    are needed, and which leads to the resolution of urea into carbonate of ammonia.
                    The reaction becomes alkaline, and the smell strongly ammoniacal. Precipitates
                    of ammonia, urate, and ammonio-magnesian phosphate are deposited, the odour
                    becomes putrefactive and multitudes of micro-organisms develop whose germs have
                    been derived from the surrounding air.</p>

                    tubes of basement membrane lined with cells of peculiar attributes and
                    surrounded by capillaries for blood and lymph, which allow their fluids to come
                    into close communication with the secreting cells. The complex disposition of
                    the tubes, of which there are hundreds in each kidney, has been traced after an
                    infinite amount of patient research. An account of the arrangement of the tubuli
                    uriniferi falls beyond the scope of the present article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Excretion of Urine.—</hi> A review of the constituents of the
                    urine discloses that the function of the kidneys is to separate from the blood
                    chiefly (1) nitrogenous crystalline bodies which are undoubtedly the
                    end-products of the oxidation of nitrogenous bodies, and (2) inorganic salts and
                    water. We have now to describe the probable manner in which this separation is
                    effected. Ever since the whole course and form of the renal tubules became
                    mapped out, and the existence of a double system of capillaries was established,
                    it has been the habit of physiologists to regard the excretion of urine as a
                    twofold operation. Sir William Bowman, so long ago as 1842, in the course of a
                    histological investigation of the structure of the kidney, came to the
                    conclusion that the watery portions of the urine are excreted in the capsule,
                    while the solid parts are removed from the blood surrounding the lower parts of
                    the renal tubule. Ludwig, about the same time, advanced the theory that the
                    whole of the urine is separated from the blood in the glomeruli, but that it is
                    separated in an extremely λvatery condition, the object of the complicated renal
                    tubules being to permit of the reabsorption of the water, and to bring the urine
                    into a suitable state of concentration for removal from the body. The progress
                    of investigation has completely vindicated the theory proposed by Bowman, which
                    now rests not merely on inference from anatomical structure, but upon a sound
                    basis of physiological facts.</p>
                <p>Not only is the process twofold in respect of the two classes of constituents
                    secreted; it may be twofold also in respect of the processes of the act. There
                    is at least much reason for thinking that the water is separated from the blood
                    mainly, though not entirely, by a physical process of filtration, while some, if
                    not all, of the specific' elements of the urine are secreted by a peculiar
                    selective or elaborative action of living epithelial cells. The reason for
                    supposing that the excretion of water is mainly a process of filtration is the
                    simple one that the flow of urine seems, in a general way, to obey the same laws
                    of pressure as the flow of water through a filter. For example, whatever tends
                    to increase the blood-pressure in the branches of the renal artery tends to
                    increase the flow of urine in a given time. If the heart beats more quickly than
                    usual more urine is excreted. If cold contracts the superficial vessels of the
                    skin, and drives a larger quantity of blood upon the kidney, or if the same
                    result ensues from moderate stimulation of the splanchnic nerves, the
                    blood-pressure in the renal artery becomes raised, and an enlarged secretion
                    follows. If the spinal cord be divided in the lower part of the cervical region,
                    the great fall of blood-pressure which results is associated with suppression of
                    the excretion of urine. Further, if the pressure in the ureters be allowed to
                    reach the value of 10 to 40 mm. (’ 3937 to 1 ’ 5748 inches) of mercury the
                    transfusion of fluid from the blood is prevented. Now the blood-pressure in the
                    renal artery is about 120 to 140 mm. (4 ’ 7244 to 5 ’ 5118 inches) of mercury.
                    Secretion stops, therefore, long before the pressure in the glandular ducts
                    reaches that of the glandular vessels,—a relationship between pressure and
                    secretion the very reverse of that which obtains in the case of the salivary
                    gland. These facts sufficiently justify the conclusion that the secretion of
                    water in the kidney is a process of filtration. But there are other facts which
                    demand the assumption that even the separation of -water is in part an act of
                    living protoplasm. The free ingestion of water by drinking is one of the most
                    certain ways of producing a copious flow of urine; and yet there is no evidence
                    to show that in most cases this effect is brought about by a raising of the
                    blood-pressure. On the contrary, if one animal be bled into the veins of another
                    there is no increase produced in the amount of urine excreted, and it is
                    difficult to imagine that the bloodpressure may be more easily raised by the
                    drinking of water, however freely, than by introducing into the bloodvessels of
                    one animal the quantity of blood proper to two. In such cases we must assume
                    that the outflow of water from the blood is due to the activity of living cells
                    aiding the normal influence of pressure.</p>
                <p>While the secretion of water cannot wholly be ascribed to physical processes,
                    there is no doubt that the secretion of some other bodies is a selective act of
                    living protoplasm taking place independently of, or it may be in opposition to,
                    physical processes. The first substance whose secretion was experimentally
                    proved to be due to the renal epithelium was sulphindigotate of soda, or
                    indigo-carmine. If this substance be injected into the blood-vessels of an
                    animal in which the blood-pressure has been so far lowered by division of the
                    spinal cord below the medulla that the flow of urine has stopped altogether, it
                    can be traced in a short time into the epithelium of the renal tubules, and
                    through them into the lumen of the duct. The absence of the usual flow of water
                    has left the granules stranded at the place where they entered the renal system
                    of tubes. No trace of the substance was found by the original observer,
                    Heidenhain, in the glomeruli or capsules; but it may be stated that later
                    experimenters have succeeded, by injecting the drug freely and pursuing it over
                    longer intervals, in tracing it into the glomerular cells also.</p>
                <p>Sulphindigotate of soda is not a normal constituent of the urine; but there is
                    little doubt that what happens in the case of this body happens also in the case
                    of some of the usual constituents. Thus, uric acid has been detected within the
                    epithelium of the renal tubules; and by a comparatively new and beautiful
                    observation it is placed beyond doubt that urea also enters the secretion at the
                    same cells rather than through the glomeruli. This proof was rendered
                    practicable by the discovery that in the frog the kidney is supplied with blood
                    from two separate and distinct sources. The renal artery supplies the glomeruli
                    with blood, while the so-called renal portal vein, a branch from the femoral
                    vein which runs along the outer border of the kidney, supplies the capillary
                    network surrounding the uriniferous tubules. If the renal artery be tied and the
                    blood-supply shut off from the glomeruli, sugar when introduced into the
                    circulation is not excreted with urine, although it readily is when the vascular
                    supply of the kidney is untouched. But in the same circumstances, when the
                    action of the glomeruli is eliminated, urea is readily excreted. Urea and sugar
                    are therefore removed from the blood by different organs; or at least the renal
                    epithelium of the tubules can excrete urea, although it cannot excrete sugar. At
                    the same time that urea is being excreted a copious flow of water is determined,
                    which most presumably escapes at the point where the urea is excreted. This fact
                    is significant when we remember that ligature of the renal artery usually stops
                    the flow of water, and that sulphindigotate of soda injected into the
                    circulation when the glomeruli are tied out of it may be traced into the same
                    epithelium, but gives rise to no flow into the bladder.</p>
                <p>The renal epithelium, then, has the power of attracting to itself and removing
                    from the blood certain elements which the latter already contains. It may now be
                    asked whether the kidney has the power of elaborating any of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n742/mode/1up"

                    forms which it obtains from the blood. In other words, is the kidney a simple
                    separating or straining mechanism, or are the constituents of the urine, like
                    the constituents of bile or saliva, elaborated in the course of metabolic
                    changes going on within the secreting epithelium?</p>
                <p>This question has already been touched in discussing the metabolism of
                    liver-cells. There is little doubt that the kidney exhibits some metabolic
                    activity. Inasmuch as the blood of herbivorous animals contains no trace of
                    hippuric acid, this must presumably be formed within the kidney. If blood
                    containing sodium benzoate and glycocin be passed through the vessels of a fresh
                    kidney, hippuric acid arises. The kidney, therefore, must be assumed to be
                    capable of elaborating hippuric acid out of simpler antecedent forms. But it is
                    not certain that it has any further power. With regard to urea, it appears
                    certain that the activity of the kidney is confined to straining it of! from the
                    blood. Normal blood contains about 1 part of urea in 4000, while the blood of
                    the renal vein contains less than this. Urea, therefore, is separated from the
                    blood in the kidney. If the kidneys be extirpated, or if their blood-vessels be
                    ligatured so as to exclude them from the circulation, or if the ureters be tied
                    (the effect of which is speedily to unfit the kidney-epithelium for the work of
                    excretion), then the amount of urea increases in the blood up to 1 part in 300
                    or 400, while much urea is voided in the fluids ejected from the stomach and
                    intestines during such experiments. Similar experiments in birds have led to
                    similar results in the case of uric acid. All these facts point to the
                    conclusion that urea and the allied bodies in urine are derived proximately from
                    the blood rather than elaborated in the kidney itself. We are therefore
                    justified in regarding the kidneys as almost exclusively an apparatus for
                    purifying the blood from the injurious products of the cell-metabolism of other
                    organs and tissues.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Excretions of the Sweat-Glands.—</hi> The second great
                    excretory system is that of the skin, which supplements in important particulars
                    the excretory functions of the kidneys. This function of the skin is effected in
                    great measure by certain glands, called sweat-glands, opening on the surface of
                    the skin. There are, indeed, other glands besides the sweat-glands connected
                    with the skin, viz., the sebaceous glands, which open chiefly into the sacs of
                    hair-follicles and secrete an oily material which keeps the surface of the skin
                    supple and water-tight. The sebaceous secretion resembles in its formation the
                    secretion of milk. Inasmuch as it is not reabsorbed, it is a true excretion; but
                    there is reason to believe that the material removed from the blood is
                    elaborated out of complex fat-yielding molecules contained in the blood very
                    much as the milk is secreted. We know very little either of the nature of the
                    bodies excreted or of the processes of their formation. The chief excretory
                    products of the skin are furnished by the sweat-glands, and constitute sweat. In
                    addition, hotvever, there is constantly being thrown off from the skin a certain
                    quantity of carbonic acid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nature of Sweat.—</hi> It is impossible to collect sweat for
                    analysis under perfectly normal conditions; either the body must be subjected to
                    great heat to adduce a copious flow, or a part of the body must be enclosed in
                    an airtight bag of india-rubber. In both cases the conditions are abnormal. So
                    far as can be ascertained, sweat is a colourless clear fluid of acid reaction
                    and characteristic odour. The odour varies with the part of the skin from which
                    the sweat is obtained. It consists of water containing 1 ’ 81 per cent, of
                    solids. The solids are (1) sodium chloride and other inorganic salts, (2) urea
                    and other nitrogenous bodies, (3) fats and cholesterin (which are not altogether
                    due to contamination with sebaceous matter), (4) fatty acids (formic, acetic,
                    butyric, &lt;fcc., but not lactic), (5) a trace of pigment. In addition to these
                    bodies the skin excretes a small amount of carbon dioxide. Although the
                    excretion of the skin is small in amount (if we except the water), if the escape
                    of it be prevented by varnishing the skin death very quickly ensues. This is
                    probably due to the retention of some poisonous substance, the nature and
                    production of which are very little understood.</p>
                <p>In concluding these remarks on excretory organs it may be pointed out that the
                    lungs (looked at as excretory organs), the kidneys, and the skin are all engaged
                    in the great task of ridding the system of its superfluous matters, and that
                    each supplements the action of the others. The lungs are the great excretors of
                    carbonic acid, which is the chief oxidation product of the body, though they
                    share with the kidneys and skin the task of getting rid of water. The kidneys
                    have thrown upon them the task of removing from the system nearly the whole of
                    the nitrogenous waste products and the superabundant salts, besides being the
                    greatest excretors of water. The skin, on the other hand, looked upon as an
                    excretory organ, is second in importance to the kidneys as a remover of water,
                    and comes next to the lungs in separating carbonic acid. The skin, it must be
                    remembered, however, has many functions besides those of an excretory organ,
                    for, besides being an organ of sense, it takes the chief part in regulating the
                    temperature of the animal body.</p>

                    objects of the external world, and, though even then ultimately transformed into
                    heat, this is not heat which is available for the purposes of the body. There
                    can be no doubt, however, that a large portion of the total heat evolved in the
                    body is the immediate result of chemical operations, and has not in the first
                    instance taken the form of mechanical work.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Dietetics</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υf</hi>
                    attention has been drawn to the amount of energy which is stored up in the
                    organic matters constituting the food of animals, and which can approximately be
                    estimated by determining the amount of heat which the organic matters evolve
                    when burned in a calorimeter. An approximate estimate is thus formed of the
                    energy which is at the disposal of the animal or man whose diet is subjected to
                    study. Thus it has been calculated that the available energy derived from the
                    oxidation of the organic matters of the food of a well-fed man amounts to about
                    2,700,000 units of heat, the unit chosen being the amount required to heat 1
                    gramme of water 1 C. When the man is doing no external work this energy ⅛
                    dissipated from the body almost entirely as heat, and, according to the
                    calculations of Helmholtz, the losses of heat are approximately distributed as
                    follows :—</p>

                <p>The total income and expenditure of energy of an average man in twenty-four hours
                    is thus calculated to correspond to the amount of heat required to raise 595 lbs
                    of water from the temperature of melting ice to that of boiling water.</p>
                <p>Where, it will be asked, does this transformation of energy chiefly have its
                    seat? The answer to this question is that it is firstly in the muscles, then in
                    the glands of the body. At all times, whether in rest or activity, heat is
                    evolved, but the quantity increases in the case both of glands and of muscles as
                    they pass from the former into the latter condition. In the resting body, it has
                    been remarked, the losses of energy are represented by the loss of heat, for the
                    mechanical work done within it takes the form of heat within the body itself. It
                    is difficult, nay, impossible, to calculate the amount of energy which in the
                    first instance takes the form of mechanical work in the body, and which is
                    always transformed into heat. The case of the heart is one in which, however, an
                    approximate calculation can be made. Upon fairly reliable data it has been
                    calculated that the work expended by the heart of a man in twenty-four hours
                    amounts to not less than 627,768 foot-pounds, an amount of work which is
                    equivalent to nearly 45 poundunits of heat, and which represents the energy
                    evolved as heat in the complete combustion of about 386 grains of carbon.</p>
                <p>These calculations enable one to form some idea of the magnitude of the nutritive
                    processes which have their seat in the muscular substance of the heart; and to a
                    less degree the same is the case with all the other muscles which are engaged in
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">opus</hi><hi rend="italic">vitale,</hi> that is, in
                    the performance of internal work absolutely essential to the continuance of the
                    life of the organism.</p>
                <p>The proportion of the total energy of the body which takes the form of mechanical
                    work varies within very wide limits. Assuming that the conversion of potential
                    into kinetic energy in equal times were a constant quantity, it would follow
                    that all external work done diminished the amount of heat set free from the
                    body. To a certain extent it is probable that such a relation exists. It is,
                    however, to be remembered that when external work has to be done there is
                    invariably an increased consumption of organic constituents of food, and
                    therefore an increased store of available energy. The working animal consumes
                    more O and produces more CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> than the resting
                    animal. Different animals, like steam-engines of different construction, vary in
                    the proportion borne by the external work they are capable of performing to the
                    total energy which becomes kinetic. Experiments made with the separate muscles
                    of animals, no less than observations on the relation between the external
                    mechanical work done by and the total heat evolved in the body of animals, have,
                    however, shown that animals are more economical machines than the most perfect
                    steam-engines. Whilst the latter cannot convert more than one-eighth of their
                    available energy into work, the animal may yield as much as one-fifth of its
                    energy in the form of available external work.</p>
                <p>VI.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Growth, Decay, and Death.</hi></p>
                <p>In the adult body in a state of health the income of matter balances as nearly as
                    possible the expenditure, and therefore the weight of the body and its
                    dimensions remain nearly constant, and the same is approximately true of the
                    different organs and tissues which compose the body, as well as of the
                    anatomical elements which enter into their formation. Even when the conditions
                    to which the organism is subjected undergo great variations—as, for instance,
                    when from a state of rest it passes into a state of great activity, or when the
                    temperature of the medium which it inhabits undergoes great changes—and when, to
                    meet these variations in external circumstances, the rate of the exchanges of
                    matter has to undergo great fluctuations, the weight of the body remains nearly
                    constant. This remarkable result is one which doubtless depends upon a great
                    many factors which are for the most part hidden from us.</p>
                <p>In the growing body matters are, however, very different; in it normally the
                    income must be always so much in excess of the expenditure that an accumulation
                    of capital may occur, and that the body may increase in weight and in
                    dimensions. The growing body is always the seat of a more active exchange of
                    matter than the fully-developed body, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> weight for
                    weight, it requires more food and oxidizes it more rapidly.</p>
                <p>The increase of weight and of dimensions occurs in part by addition of matter to,
                    and increase in weight and in dimensions of, individual organs and their
                    constituent anatomical elements; in part, however, it is due to an actual
                    multiplication of anatomical elements occurring at a rate which greatly exceeds
                    that which occurs in the adult body. To what an extent this multiplication
                    occurs and how it gradually diminishes is evident when we reflect that the whole
                    organism was originally derived from a single cell, the ovum.</p>
                <p>Upon what depends this tendency to multiplication of anatomical elements, and
                    this tendency to increase in size of individual anatomical elements or of
                    organs, until a certain approximate limit has been attained, is absolutely
                    unknown. We know to a certain extent that the process of <hi rend="italic"
                    >growth</hi> depends upon and is influenced by certain circumstances, as amount
                    of food, temperature, blood-supply to the particular organ, and so on, but yet
                    the knowledge is wanting which would tell us why, when a certain limit has been
                    attained, the processes of income and expenditure balance and growth ceases.</p>
                <p>That the nervous system has a great influence upon nutrition and therefore upon
                    growth is certainly known, and in great measure explicable. By its control over
                    the blood-supply to organs and tissues the nervous system exerts a remarkable
                    influence, as well as by its relations more or less direct upon the anatomical
                    elements through nerve-fibres, which, inasmuch as they appear to influence in a
                    direct manner the nutrition of anatomical elements, have been surmised to exist,
                    and have received the name of “trophic fibres.” Yet, even apart from the
                    influence exerted by the nervous system, it appears to be a property of
                    individual anatomical elements that, consistently with health, they shall only
                    develop at a certain rate and attain a certain magnitude.</p>
                <p>Scarcely less mysterious than the primary causes of growth is the fact that every
                    organism having arrived at maturity remains in a state of apparent structural
                    and functional integrity for a term which possesses an approximately constant
                    mean value for each species, and then sooner or later necessarily passes into a
                    condition of gradually lessening efficiency, which ultimately terminates in
                    death. Were the animal organism a machine undergoing a constant though very slow
                    process of waste, its decay and ultimately its death would be more obvious than
                    they actually are. The organism, however, differs from the machine in that its
                    matter is continually the seat of change, and that during long periods (⅛.e.,
                    during healthy adult life) the processes of gain and loss of matter appear to be
                    going on with perfect evenness and equality. Why, then, the ultimate
                    deterioration resulting in waste and then in death? The answer is that the organ
                    as a whole unquestionably does suffer by work, and, though at first the degree
                    of impairment is so slow as to be imperceptible, it doubtless is a continuous
                    process.</p>

                    into old age is evidenced (1) by a diminished rate in the exchange of matter of
                    the body; (2) by a diminished power manifested by the organism as a whole, as
                    well as by each of its individual organs, to accomplish work; (3) by a general
                    loss of weight of the body and of its essential tissues and organs, though the
                    weight of the body as a whole may increase by the development and storage of
                    fat; (4) by a tendency to structural change of organs or parts of organs whose
                    proper function is essential to life, as, for example, of the circulatory,
                    respiratory, and nervous apparatuses; (5) by a readiness to be injuriously
                    affected by external circumstances, which at an earlier period produce no
                    obvious effect upon the body or only temporary impairment of its functions. The
                    gradual and general deterioration of the organism thus evidenced is usually
                    interrupted by the supervention of some process impairing so greatly the
                    functions of a vital organ that the organism as a whole ceases to perform the
                    functions which characterize it as living, and death results. Whatever the
                    remote cause of death, the proximate cause is in every case an arrest of the
                    circulation of the blood, putting an end to the exchanges of matter and energy
                    which are the most characteristic of the accompaniments of life. <hi
