                    arrondissement in the department of Aude, lies 5 miles from the Mediterranean,
                    on the Robine Canal, a branch of the Canal du Midi, w-hich connects it with the
                    port of La Nouvelle, and on the railway from Toulouse to Cette, 93 miles
                    east-south-east of the former city, at the point where the line for Barcelona
                        <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Perpignan breaks off. The Robine Canal divides
                    Narbonne into two distinct portions, <pb break="no"

                        rend="italic">cité.</hi> The latter is one of the oldest and most
                    interesting of French towns. The cathedral (St Just) is the third on the site,
                    and dates from the close of the 13th century, when the choir (130 feet high) was
                    built. Two towers were added in the 15th century. An unusual effect is produced
                    by a double row of crenella-tion taking the place of balustrades on the roof of
                    the choir chapels and connecting the pillars of the flying buttresses. Among the
                    sepulchral monuments in the chancel may be noticed the alabaster tomb of
                    Cardinal de Briçonnet, minister of state under Charles VIII. The chapter-house,
                    of the 15th century, has a vaulted roof supported on four free pillars. From the
                    top of the towers, 19-4 feet high, a magnificent view is obtained over the
                    Narbonne plain, the valley of the Aude, the Montagne Noire, the Cevennes, the
                    hills of La Clape, which lie between the city and the sea, the Canigou, and the
                    Corbières. The apse of the cathedral was formerly joined to the fortifications
                    of the archiépiscopal palace, and the two buildings are still connected by a
                    mutilated cloister of the 14th and 15th centuries. On the front of the palace
                    are. three square towers of unequal height. Between the Tour des Télégraphes
                    (1318), crenellated and turreted at the corners, and that of St Martial (1380),
                    machicolated and pierced by Gothic openings, a new façade was erected in the
                    style of the 15th century after the plans of Viollet-le-Duc. This portion of the
                    building now serves as hôtel de ville, and its upper stories are occupied by the
                    Narbonne museum, one of the best outside of Paris, containing pictures, pottery,
                    nearly three thousand medals, and (in the old guard-room) a rich variety of
                    Greek, Carthaginian, and Roman antiquities. The palace garden also contains many
                    fragments of Roman work once built into the now dismantled fortifications; and
                    the Musée Lapidaire in the Lamourguier buildings (formerly a Benedictine
                    convent) has six hundred and twenty bas-reliefs and three hundred and
                    twenty-three ancient inscriptions. The church of St Paul, though partly
                    Romanesque, is in the main a striking and for the south of France a rare example
                    of a building of the first half of the 13 th century in the Gothic style of the
                    north. It possesses some ancient Christian sarcophaguses and fine Renaissance
                    wood carving. Narbonne has a good trade, especially in wine and spirituous
                    liquors,— the surrounding country growing (at the rate of 120 gallons per acre)
                    strong alcoholic wines, largely in demand for “fortifying” weaker vintages. As a
                    matter of course this gives employment to large numbers of coopers; and besides
                    there are in the town several verdigris factories, a sulphur refinery, and
                    tanneries. The honey of Narbonne is famed throughout Europe. The population in
                    1881 was 28,134.</p>
                <p>Long before the Roman invasion of Gaul Narbonne was a flourishing city. It was
                    there that the Romans in 118 B.c. founded their first colony in Gaul; and they
                    constructed great works to protect the city from inundation and to improve its
                    port. The seat of a proconsul and a station for the Roman fleet, Narbo Martius
                    became the rival of Massilia. But in 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> it
                    suffered greatly from a conflagration, and the division of Gallia Narbonensis
                    into two provinces lessened its importance as a capital. Alans, Suevi, Vandals,
                    each held the city for a brief space, and at last, in 413, it was more
                    permanently occupied by the Visigoths. In 719, after a siege of two years, it
                    was captured by the Saracens, and by them its fortifications were restored and
                    extended. Charles Martel, after the battle of Poitiers, and Pippin the Short, in
                    752, were both repulsed from its walls; but on a new attempt, after an
                    investment of seven years, and by aid of a traitor, the Franks managed again to
                    force their way into Narbonne. Charlemagne made the city the capital of the
                    duchy of Gothia, and divided it into three lordships—one for the bishop, another
                    for a Frankish lord, and the third for the Jews, who, occupying their own
                    quarter, possessed schools, synagogues, and a university famous in the Middle
                    Ages. The viscounts who succeeded the Frankish lord sometimes acknowledged the
                    authority of the counts of Toulouse, sometimes that of the counts of Barcelona.
                    In the 13th century the crusade against the Albigenses spared the city, but the
                    archbishopric was seized by the pope’s legate Amaury, who took the title of duke
                    of Narbonne. Simon de Montfort, however, deprived him of this dignity, receiving
                    from Philip Augustus the duchy of Narbonne along with the county of Toulouse. By
                    his expulsion of the Jews Philip the Fair hastened the decay of the city; and
                    about the same period the Aude, which had formerly been diverted by the Romans,
                    ceased to flow towards Narbonne and the harbour was silted up, to the further
                    disadvantage of the place. United to the French crown in 1507, Narbonne was
                    enclosed by a new line of walls under Francis I., but having ceased to be a
                    garrison town it had the last portions of its ramparts demolished in 1870.</p>
