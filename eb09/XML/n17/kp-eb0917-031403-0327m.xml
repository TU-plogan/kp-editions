                <p><label type="entry">NEGLIGENCE</label> is in one aspect the correlative of
                    diligence (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Diligence),</hi> in another of intention. It
                    is the absence of diligence or the absence of intention. All definitions imply
                    this. Negligence is a term difficult to define for more than one reason. It is
                    used not only to denote a mental state, but the consequences resulting from a
                    mental state. Again, the term bears a somewhat different meaning as applied to
                    civil or criminal liability. “The meaning of negligence, in the common use of
                    language,” says Mr Justice Stephen <hi rend="italic">(History of the Criminal
                    Lazo,</hi> vol. ii. p. 123), “is very general and indefinite. It is practically
                    synonymous with heedlessness or carelessness, not taking notice of matters
                    relevant to the business in hand, of which notice might and ought to have been
                    taken. This meaning is no doubt included in the legal sense of the word, but in
                    reference to criminal law the word has also the wider meaning of omitting, for
                    whatever reason, to discharge a legal duty, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    omission by a medical man to exercise that skill which it is his duty to
                    exercise.” The vagueness of the standard by which negligence is tested is
                    another and more serious practical difficulty. The standard is the average
                    prudent action of the average citizen, and the defendant fails to reach this
                    standard at his peril. This is the standard implied by such definitions as that
                    of the New York Penal Code, “the terms ‘ neglect,’ <hi rend="superscript">
                    t</hi> negligence,’ ‘ negligent,’ and ‘ negligently ’ . . . . import a want of
                    such attention to the nature or probable consequences of the act or omission as
                    a prudent man ordinarily bestows in acting in his own concerns,” and that of
                    Sirey <hi rend="italic">(Code</hi><hi rend="italic">Pénal,</hi> § 319), “the
                    omission or forgetfulness of a precaution dictated by prudence.” The connexion
                    between negligence and intention is illustrated by a passage in the judgment of
                    Baron Alderson in Blyth <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> The Birmingham Water Works
                    Company (1856). “The definition of negligence,” says that learned judge, “is the
                    omitting to do something that a reasonable man would do, or the doing something
                    that a reasonable man would not do; and an action may be brought if thereby
                    mischief is caused to a third party not intentionally.” The intention is of
                    great importance in criminal law. Thus as a general rule it may be said that
                    what is manslaughter where there is negligence becomes <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n328/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0328-0315"/> murder where there is intention. But the
                    negligence may in some cases be of such a nature as to lead to the presumption
                    of legal malice. In the same way in cases where the liability is civil it is
                    important to notice that the phenomena of negligence often accord closely with
                    those of intention. Thus in one case Lord Justice James speaks of “wilful
                    negligence which leads the court to conclude that the person is an accomplice in
                    the fraud.” The phenomena of negligence and of dishonest intention may be
                    similar to such an extent that the court may regard them as the same, since the
                    legal consequences resulting from them are the same.</p>
                <p>It is the general view that there are three degrees of negligence, corresponding
                    to three degrees of diligence. This is illustrated by the case of bailment.
                    Where the bailment is for the benefit of the bailor, the bailee is bound to use
                    only slight diligence, and is liable only for gross negligence; λvhere the
                    bailment is for the benefit of bailor and bailee alike, each is bound to use
                    ordinary diligence, and is liable for ordinary negligence; where the bailment is
                    for the benefit of the bailee, he is bound to use great diligence, and is liable
                    for slight negligence. The soundness of this position, alleged to be founded on
                    the Roman law, is open to question. Romau law probably only recognized two
                    degrees of <hi rend="italic">culpa,</hi> the term which most nearly approaches
                    negligence. And the term “gross negligence” has been objected to as misleading
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Diligence).</hi> The truth is that it is impossible to
                    make any useful legal distinction of degrees of negligence, when the question of
                    negligence is mainly a question of fact. In English law it is for the jury to
                    say, subject to certain rules of evidence, whether a particular defendant has in
                    a particular case fallen below the standard of the average citizen. Each case
                    must depend to a large extent upon its own merits, aided by the consideration of
                    a series of previous cases in which certain facts have been held by the court to
                    be or not to be <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi>
                    evidence of negligence to go to the jury.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Contributory Negligence.—</hi> As a general rule it is a
                    defence to an action that the injury was caused by conduct of the injured
                    person, without which the injury would not have happened. But, though a
                    plaintiff may have been guilty of negligence which may have actually contributed
                    to the injury, yet if the defendant could by the exercise of ordinary care and
                    diligence have avoided the mischief the plaintiff’s negligence will not excuse
                    him. Contributory negligence of a person other than the plaintiff is no excuse
                    for the negligence of the defendant except in the case of the legal
                    identification of the plaintiff with the negligent third party; <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a passenger in a train of A company is so far
                    identified by the law with his driver that he cannot recover against B company
                    for an injury caused by an accident to which the negligence of A company’s
                    driver contributed. So a child cannot recover for an injury to which the
                    negligence of the adult in charge of the child contributed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nature of the Remedy.—</hi> The person injured may have either
                    a civil or a criminal remedy, or both. In most cases where the act of negligence
                    is criminally punishable, the plaintiff may recover damages in addition. The
                    question as to what amount or kind of negligence will bring a person within the
                    criminal law is one by no means easy to answer. In certain cases criminal
                    proceedings are authorized by statute, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> against
                    parish authorities for refusing to call vestries (1 &amp; 2 Will. IV. c. 60),
                    and against persons neglecting to transmit election writs (53 Geo. III. c. 89).
                    The question of criminal negligence arises most commonly in cases of homicide.
                    The rule as to the functions of the jury cannot be better put than in the words
                    of Mr Justice Stephen, <hi rend="italic">ιιbi supra:—</hi> “in order that
                    negligence may be culpable, it must be of such a nature that the jury think that
                    a person who caused death by it ought to be punished.” The same high authority
                    proceeds to point out that cases of manslaughter by negligence may be imagined
                    in which there is no carelessness. In one matter the prisoner or defendant in
                    criminal proceedings is under a disadvantage as compared with the defendant in
                    an action. He cannot, as the latter can, set up contributory negligence as a
                    defence. To this extent only is the criminal remedy wider than the civil. Where
                    the question of contributory negligence does not arise, it may generally be said
                    that, if an indictment will lie for negligence, <hi rend="italic">a
                    fortiori</hi> an action will lie upon the same facts. (J. W.+)</p>
