                    the Oise a mile farther down. The old cathedral of Notre Dame, constructed
                    during the latter half of the 12th century, is a fine example of the mixture of
                    Romanesque and Gothic architecture. In plan it is a Latin cross, with a total
                    length from east to west of 343 feet, and from north to south of 66. The west
                    front has a porch, added in the 14th century, and two unfinished towers, their
                    upper portions dating from the 13th century; its decorations have been greatly
                    mutilated. The nave (167 feet long and 66 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n667/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0667-0610"/> broad) consists of eleven bays, including those
                    of the west front, which, in the interior, forms a kind of transept. In the
                    windows of the aisles, the arches of the triforium, and the windows of the
                    clerestory the round type is maintained; but double Pointed arches appear in the
                    lower gallery; and the vaults of the roof, originally six-ribbed, were rebuilt
                    after the fire of 1293 in the prevailing Pointed style. Side chapels were added
                    in the north aisle in the 14th century and in the south aisle in the 15th and
                    the 16th, one of the latter (15th) is especially rich in decorations. The flying
                    buttresses of the building are at present (1884) being restored in the style of
                    the 12th century. From the north-west corner of the nave runs the western
                    gallery of a fine cloister, erected in 1230; and next to the cloister is the
                    chapter-house of the same date, with its entrance adorned with statues of the
                    bishops and other sculpture. The bishops’ tombs within the cathedral were
                    destroyed during the Revolution. The chapel of the bishops’ palace is an example
                    of the Early Pointed style; the second bishops’ palace is a brick and stone
                    structure in the Renaissance style; the canons’ library was built of wood in the
                    15th century; and the town-house (Gothic and Renaissance) dates from 1485-1523.
                    Among the town manuscripts is the Red Book or communal charter of Noy on.
                    Remains of the Roman walls may be traced in the foundations of various houses.
                    Noyon has a good trade, and contains large sugar-refineries, chemical-works,
                    tanneries, and cotton-spinning mills. The population of the commune and that of
                    the city were respectively 6268 and 5236 in 1872, and 6252 and 5780 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Noyon, the ancient Novioιnagus Veromanduorum, was Christianized by St Quentin at
                    the close of the 3d century; and in 531 St Medard, bishop of the district of
                    Vermandois, transferred his see thither from St Quentin. The episcopate of St
                    Eligius (640-648), the burial of Chilperic II., the coronation of Pippin the
                    Short in 752, and on the same occasion the coronation of his infant son Carloman
                    with tfιe title of king of Noyon, the coronation of Charlemagne in 771, the
                    plunder of the town by the Normans in 859 and 880, the expulsion of the
                    castellan by the inhabitants, and in 997 the recognition of the overlordship of
                    the count of Flanders are the chief points in the history of Noyon down to the
                    10th century. In the 11th the city, passing under the French crown, became one
                    of the ecclesiastical peerages of the kingdom; and at the beginning of the 12th
                    century it easily obtained a communal charter through the favour of its bishops.
                    The extent of the bishopric was considerably curtailed in 1135 by the breaking
                    off of the diocese of Tournay. Noyon was ravaged by the English and the
                    Burgundians during the Hundred Years’ War. In 1516 a truce was signed at Noyon
                    by Francis I. and Charles V. The city was captured by the Spaniards in 1552, and
                    afterwards by the Leaguers, who were expelled in 1594 by Henry IV. It lost its
                    bishopric in 1791, and is at present only the chief town of a canton in the
                    arrondissement of Compiègne. Calvin was born at Noyon in 1509.</p>
