                    been popularly known for several centuries. The present city, which stands in
                    32° 5' N. lat. and 118° 47' E. long., dates only from the beginning of the Ming
                    dynasty (1368), although it is built on the site of one which for more than two
                    thousand years has figured under various names in the history of the empire. The
                    more ancient city was originally known as Kin-ling; under the Han dynasty (206
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 25 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> its name
                    was converted into Tan-yang; by the T’ang emperors (618-90f <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n183/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0183-0172"/> Λ.D.) it was styled Keang-nan and Shing Chow; by
                    the first sovereign of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> it was created the ‘‘southern capital” (Nan-king), and was given the
                    distinctive name of Ying-t’een; and since the accession to power of the present
                    Manchu rulers it has been officially known as Keang-ning, though still popularly
                    called Nan-king. As a matter of fact it was the seat of the imperial court only
                    during the reigns of the first two emperors of the Ming dynasty, and was
                    deserted for Shunt’een (Peking) by Yung-lo, the third sovereign of that line,
                    who in 1403 captured the town and usurped the crown of his nephew, the reigning
                    emperor.</p>
                <p>But even when speaking of the city rebuilt by the Ming emperors it is necessary
                    to use the past tense. The Taiping rebels, who carried the town by assault in
                    1853, made a clean sweep of all the national monuments and most of the more
                    conspicuous public buildings it contained, and destroyed or were the means of
                    destroying the greater part of the magnificent wall which surrounded it. The
                    following description, therefore, must be understood as referring to the town as
                    it existed before it was invaded by those ruthless destroyers.</p>
                <p>The city is said by Chinese topographers to have been surrounded by a wall
                    measuring 96 le, or 32 miles, in circumference. This computation has, however,
                    been shown by more accurate calculation to be a gross exaggeration, and it is
                    probable that 60 le, or 20 miles, would be nearer the actual dimensions. The
                    wall, of which only small portions now remain, was about 70 feet in height,
                    measured 30 feet in thickness at the base, and was pierced by thirteen gates.
                    Encircling the north, east, and south sides of the city proper was a second wall
                    which enclosed about double the space of the inner enclosure. The public
                    buildings were on a scale befitting one of the foremost cities in the empire,
                    which was and still is the permanent seat of the provincial government, and
                    which for a time was the abode of the imperial court. The inner city, which is
                    nominally inhabited by the Manchu garrison only, is crossed from north to south
                    by four main thoroughfares, which are intersected by roads connecting the gates
                    in the eastern and western walls. In the north-east corner of the town stood the
                    imperial palace reared by Hung-woo, the imperial founder of the modern city.
                    After suffering mutilation at the time of the overthrow of the Ming dynasty,
                    this magnificent building was finally burnt to the ground on the recapture of
                    the city from the Taiping rebels in 1864. But beyond comparison the most
                    conspicuous public building at Nanking was the famous porcelain tower, which was
                    designed by the emperor Yung-lo (1403-28) to commemorate the virtues of his
                    mother. Twelve centuries previously an Indian priest deposited on the spot where
                    this monument afterwards stood a relic of Buddha, and raised oveι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> the sacred object a small pagoda of three stories in
                    height. During the disturbed times which heralded the close of the Yuen dynasty
                    (1368) this pagoda shared the fate of the surrounding buildings, and was utterly
                    destroyed. 11 was doubtless out of respect to the relic which then perished that
                    Yung-lo chose this site for the erection of his “token-of-gratitude” pagoda. At
                    noon on the fifteenth day of the sixth month of the tenth year of the reign of
                    this monarch (1413) the building was begun. But before it was finished Yung-lo
                    had passed away, and it was reserved for his successor to see the final pinnacle
                    fixed in its place, after nineteen years had been consumed in carrying out the
                    designs of the imperial architect. In shape the pagoda was an octagon, and was
                    about 260 feet in height, or, as the Chinese say, with that extraordinary love
                    for inaccurate accuracy which is peculiar to them, 32 chang (a chang equals
                    about 120 inches) 9 feet 4 inches and <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅞- of an
                    inch. The outer walls were cased with bricks of the finest white porcelain, and
                    each of the nine stories into which the building was divided was marked by
                    overhanging eaves composed of green glazed tiles of the same material. The
                    summit was crowned with a gilt ball fixed on the top of an iron rod, which in
                    its turn was encircled by nine iron rings. Hung on chains which stretched from
                    this apex to the eaves of the roof were five large pearls of good augury for the
                    safety of the city. One was supposed to avert floods, another to prevent fires,
                    a third to keep dust-storms at a distance, a fourth to allay tempests, and a
                    fifth to guard the city against disturbances. From the eaves of the several
                    stories there hung one hundred and fifty-two bells, and countless lanterns
                    adorned the same coignes of vantage. The strange form and beauty of the edifice,
                    which might have been expected to have preserved it from destruction, were,
                    however, no arguments in its favour· in the eyes of the Taiping rebels, who
                    razed it to the ground when they made themselves masters of Nanking.</p>
                <p>Nanking is about 194 geographical miles to the west of</p>
                <p>Shanghai, and is nearly equidistant between Canton and Peking. It is situated on
                    the south bank of the Yangtsze Keang, and has a population of 400,000 souls. In
                    bygone days it was one of the chief literary centres of the empire, besides
                    being famous for its manufacturing industries. Satin, crape, nankeen cloth,
                    paper, pottery, and artificial flowers were among its chief products. Of late
                    years, however, these peaceful industries have been superseded by the production
                    of all kinds of warlike material. As at Fuh-chow, the arsenal at Nanking is
                    superintended by Europeans, under whose guidance steam ships of war and cannon
                    of the newest and most approved type are there manufactured. In the history of
                    the political relations of England with China, Nanking principally figures as
                    the city where, after its capture by British ships in 1842, Sir Henry Pöttinger
                    signed the “Nanking treaty.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. k. d.)</hi></p>
