                    37° N. lat. and 41° 20' 10" E. long., in the north of Mesopotamia, near the
                    point where the Jaghjagha leaves the mountains by a narrow defile. The modern
                    Nasibin consists of some two hundred wretched huts, mainly inhabited by Jews,
                    who pay tribute to the Sham mar Bedouins. The neighbourhood, we are informed by
                    Arab writers, was at one time richly wooded. The locality is at present somewhat
                    marshy and unhealthy. The number of dangerous scorpions is specially noticeable.
                    According to Yâkùt the legend is that Persian scorpions were thrown into the
                    place when it was besieged by Anushirwan. The church of St James, belonging to a
                    small community of Jacobite Christians, and a few pillars and blocks of masonry
                    are the only remains of the former greatness of the town.</p>
                <p>The site of Nisibis, on the great military and commercial route between the
                    Tigris and the Mediterranean, and commanding alike the mountain country to the
                    north and the then fertile plain to the south, gave it an importance which began
                    during the Assyrian period and continued under the Seleucidae (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Mesopotamia,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 48). From 149 B.c. to 14 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Nisibis was the residence of the kings of
                    Armenia, and it was there that Tigranes had his treasure-houses. The place
                    afterwards figured frequently as a strong frontier fortress <pb break="no"

                    its brick walls being unusually thick and its citadel very strong. Ceded to the
                    Parthians by Hadrian, it became a Roman colony (Septimia Colonia Nisibis) under
                    Septimius Severus. It was heroically defended against Sapor II., who
                    unsuccessfully besieged it thrice. In the peace made by Jovian, however, it
                    passed into the hands of the Persians, who established a strong colony there.
                    Nisibis early became the seat of a Jacobite bishop and of a Nestorian
                    metropolitan, and under the Arabs (when it continued to flourish and became the
                    centre of the district of Diyâr Rebi'a) the population of the town and
                    neighbourhood was still mostly Christian, and included numerous monasteries.
                    According to Ibn Haukal the taxes and dues derived from the town and district of
                    Nisibin in 358 A.H. (969 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> amounted to five
                    million dirhems and 32,000 dinars. Arab geographers and travellers of the Middle
                    Ages speak in high terms of the gardens of Nisibis, and the magnificent returns
                    obtained by the agriculturist. According to Mukaddasi (oδ. 1024), acorns,
                    preserved fruits, and manufactured articles such as carriages, inkstands,
                    &amp;c., were exported. A change for the worse soon afterwards set in. The town
                    was so heavily burdened with taxes by the Hamdanid princes living at Mosul that
                    the Arab tribe of the Bann Habib, although blood relations of the Hamdanids,
                    migrated in a body into Byzantine territory, where they were well received,
                    accepted Christianity, attracted other emigrants from Nisibis, and at last began
                    to avenge themselves by yearly raids upon their old home. Ibn Haukal goes on to
                    say that finally the Hamdanid Nasir ad-Daule took possession of the town,
                    confiscated the estates of those who had emigrated, and compelled those who
                    remained to substitute corn for their profitable fruit crops. This made a final
                    end of the prosperity of Nisibis; the surrounding district, no longer protected
                    against the incursions of nomad tribes, ceased to be cultivated and became the
                    wilderness which it continues to be to this day.</p>
