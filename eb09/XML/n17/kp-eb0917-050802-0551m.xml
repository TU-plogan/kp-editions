                    elevation of 6500 feet, with an area of about 725 square miles. In 1873 this was
                    increased by the addition of the Ochterlony valley in the south-east Wainâd, and
                    again, in 1877, by other portions of the Wainâd, making a total area of 957
                    square miles. The administrative headquarters is at Utakamand, which is also the
                    summer capital of the Government of Madras. The summit of the Nilgiri Hills is
                    an undulating plateau, frequently breaking into lofty ridges and steep rocky
                    eminences. The descent to the plains is sudden and abrupt, the average fall from
                    the crest to the general level below being about 6000 feet, save on the north,
                    where the base of the mountains rests upon the elevated land of Wainâd and
                    Mysore, standing between 2000 and 3000 feet above sea-level. The Ochterlony
                    valley and Wainâd country consist of a series of broken valleys, once forestclad
                    throughout, but now studded with coffee-gardens.</p>

                <p>The highest mountain peaks are—Dodabetta, 8760 feet; Kudiakad, 8502; Bevoibetta,
                    8188; Makurti, 8402; Dâvarsolabetta, 8380; Kunda, 8353; Kùndamoge, 7816;
                    Utakamand, 7361; Tâmbrabetta, 7292; Hokabetta, 7267. There are six well-known
                    passes or <hi rend="italic">ghats ∖&gt;γ</hi> which the district communicates
                    with the neighbouring provinces, viz., the Kιimir, Segùr, Gùdalur, Sispâra,
                    Kotâgiri, and Sundapatti, the first three of which are practicable to wheeled
                    traffic. The chief rivers are the Moyâr, Paikâra, and Calicut, none of which are
                    navigable within the district. The only-lake of note is an artificial one,
                    Utakamand (7220 feet above sea-level), which is nearly 2 miles long. The forests
                    consist of fine timber trees, such as <hi rend="italic">sal (Shorea robusta),
                    kino (Pterocarpus Marsupium),</hi> jack <hi rend="italic">(Artocarpus
                    integrifolia),</hi> blackwood <hi rend="italic">(D</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >alber</hi><hi rend="italic">gia</hi><hi rend="italic">latifolia),</hi> and
                    teak. Eucalyptus and Australian wattle have been extensively planted in the
                    higher grounds of the Wainâd. The hills were first explored by British officers
                    in 1814, and in 1821 the first English house was built on the plateau.</p>
                <p>The population of the district in 1881 was 91,034. The only town with more than
                    5000 inhabitants is Utakamand, with a population of 12,335. The most interesting
                    of the hill tribes are the Todas, who regard themselves as autochthonous. They
                    are a tall, well-proportioned, and athletic race, but indolent and dirty. Their
                    sole occupation is cattle herding and dairy work. They practise polyandry, a
                    woman marrying all the brothers of a family. In religion they follow a species
                    of Hinduism, and also worship their dairy buffaloes. The race seems to be
                    gradually dying out, and in 1881 only numbered 675. The most numerous as well as
                    the most wealthy and civilized of the hill tribes are the Badagas. They are
                    occupied in agriculture, dress after the fashion of the natives of the plains,
                    and are fond of ornaments. They profess Hinduism, and in 1881 numbered 24,130.
                    The Kotas, another hill tribe (1065 in 1881), follow agriculture and various
                    handicrafts. They perform menial offices for the Todas and Badagas, and, like
                    the latter, pay a gudu to the Todas. They worship “ideal” gods, which are not
                    represented by any image. The Kurumbas, or shepherds (3185 in 1881), are the
                    most uncivilized of the hill tribes, and officiate as priests to the Badagas.
                    Besides cultivating on a small scale, they collect various sorts of jungle
                    produce, which they barter on the plains for grain and cloth. The Irulas (946 in
                    1881) live on the lowest slopes and forests, extending from the base of the
                    Nilgiris to the plains. They are an idle and dissolute tribe, although in
                    physique adapted to hard manual labour.</p>
                <p>The ordinary crops grown on the Nilgiri Hills include wheat, barley, and other
                    cereals, oilseeds, and nearly every variety of English vegetables and fruits.
                    The commercially important products are coffee, tea, and cinchona. Coffee
                    cultivation was introduced about 1844. One of its chief seats is the beautiful
                    Ochterlony valley. The Madras Government commenced the experimental cultivation
                    of cinchona on the Nilgiris in 1860, and in 1882 the receipts therefrom amounted
                    to over £50,000. Several private cinchona gardens have been laid out, owing to
                    the success of the Government experiment. There are 190 miles of road, bridged
                    and available for wheeled traffic. The climate of the Nilgiri Hills is almost
                    unrivalled for equability of temperature. The average</p>
