                    before Jehovah, wherefore it is said—A mighty hunter before Jehovah even as
                    Nimrod), and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech and Accad, and
                    Calneh in the land of Shinar. Out of that land he went forth into Asshur<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Not “out of that land went
                    forth Asshur”; for the “beginning” of his kingdom demands a continuation, and
                    Asshur is called Nimrod’s land in Micah v. 5.</p></note> and builded Nineveh,”
                    &amp;c. Just as Enos was the first to call upon the name of Jehovah, and Noah
                    the first to plant vines, so is Nimrod the first mighty ruler in the earth, and
                    as such at the same time a mighty hunter before Jehovah, after the manner of the
                    Oriental sovereigns of old. By the Hebrews the Assyrio-Babylonian empire was at
                    all periods regarded as the prototype of the worldly power; and it is of this
                    kingdom that Nimrod here figures as the founder—not in its prehistorical but in
                    its historical form as actually subsisting at the time of the writer. This is
                    apparent, not only from the general character of the genealogical table, but
                    also from the enumeration of the cities in the land of Shinar and Asshur. As
                    founder of the kingdom, Nimrod represents both kingdom and people; the genealogy
                    knows no distinction between the hero and the nation,—the latter is the family
                    of the former. When, therefore, Nimrod is said to be descended from Cush, the
                    mighty nation of Asshur and Babel (which in Gen. x. 22 is regarded as belonging
                    to</p>
                <p>Shem) is also by the Jehovist assigned to Cush. Shem for him seems to have a very
                    narrow meaning, expressing merely the contrast between the Hebrew lords and
                    their Canaanite subjects; Cush, on the other hand (like *Ivδoι with the Greeks),
                    is a very comprehensive and vague word, which does not readily admit of clear
                    geographical or ethnological definition, and therefore also cannot be brought
                    into contrast with Shem if Shem be used in its modern application as indicating
                    race. A god spoken of as “Marri with his hounds” was still worshipped in Harran
                    after the introduction of Christianity (Assem., <hi rend="italic">Bibl.
                    Or.,</hi> i. 327); that this Marri is akin to Nimrod is suggested on the one
                    hand by his hounds and on the other by the etymology of the two names derived
                    from the synonymous roots <hi rend="italic">mry</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mrd.</hi> Nimrod looks like a Syriac imperfect of the root <hi rend="italic"
                    >mrd,</hi> in which case it would seem to follow that the legend arose among the
                    Syrians, the next neighbours of the Babylonians and Assyrians, and from them had
                    passed over to the Hebrews. Then, further, Nimrod may be a modification of the
                    name Merodach, the Babylonian chief god, the final syllable <hi rend="italic"
                    >-aclι</hi> being dropped.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the enmity of the heathen world against the kingdom of God, and the idea they
                    formed of Nimrod was influenced by this view. The arrogance of his character,
                    which seemed to be implied in his very name, was conceived of as defiance of
                    God, and he became a heaven-storming Titan. As such he built the tower of Babel,
                    and as such was he identified with the giant in bonds in the constellation of
                    Orion. Jewish legend made choice of Abraham to be his antithesis, the
                    representative of God’s kingdom over against the heathen autocrat. Nimrod cast
                    the bold confessor of the true God into the fire of the Chaldøeans (UrKasdim),
                    whence, according to Gen. xv. 7, Isa. xxix. 22, Jehovah delivered him.<note
