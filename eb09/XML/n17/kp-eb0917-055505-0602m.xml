                    an area of 629,912 acres, or about 982 square miles. Its greatest length from
                    north-east to south-west is about 70 miles; in breadth it varies from 7 to 26
                    miles. The surface is hilly and undulating, but the hills are for the most part
                    small and rounded and the undulations monotonous, notwithstanding that the
                    country is richly cultivated and in some parts finely wooded. The highest
                    summits are Albury (804 feet) and Naseby (697 feet). In the western and
                    south-western districts the scenery becomes almost picturesque, and in the
                    centre and east, where greater monotony prevails, numerous fine trees add a
                    pleas ing aspect of richness. For a long period Northampton has been famed for
                    its ash trees, and there are also some very old oaks, as well as a few fine
                    avenues of elm. The north-eastern extremity belongs to the great fen district.
                    The county forms the principal watershed of central England, nearly all the more
                    important rivers of this region having their sources within its boundaries. The
                    Avon with a westward course forms for some distance the northern boundary of the
                    county, till near Lilbourne it passes into Warwickshire. The Nene passes
                    southward through Northampton, whence it takes an easterly course, skirting the
                    eastern boundary of the county. The Welland flows in an easterly direction,
                    forming the boundary of the county with Leicester, Rutland, and Lincoln. The
                    Cherwell, after passing into Oxfordshire, forms for a considerable distance the
                    southernmost portion of the western boundary with that county; the Learn forms a
                    portion of the boundary with Warwickshire. The Ouse, which rises near Brackley,
                    soon afterwards leaves the county, but again touches it near Stony Stratford,
                    separating it for some distance <pb break="no"

                    is connected with the Oxford Canal, enters the county at Braunston on the
                    borders of Warwickshire and passes by Daventry and Blisworth into
                    Buckinghamshire, a branch connecting it with Northampton. The Grand Union Canal
                    unites with the Grand Junction near Daventry and runs north until it joins the
                    Leicester Canal at Foxton, branches passing to Welford and Market
                    Harborough.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> Lias forms the foundation of Northamptonshire,
                    and above it rest the Oolite formations which crop to the surface throughout the
                    greater part of the county. Lias prevails as the surface formation in the west
                    and north-west. Its total thickness is about 800 feet, the Lower Lias clays
                    which stretch in from Warwickshire having a thickness of 500 to 600 feet, the
                    Middle Lias or marlstone of about 30 feet, and the Upper Lias clays, which form
                    numerous outliers scattered over the marlstone plateau and also appear along the
                    beds of several of the streams, a thickness of from 150 to 200 feet. Immediately
                    above the lias come the inferior Oolite beds of Northamptonshire sand, which
                    reach their greatest thickness in the neighbourhood of Northampton. The
                    sandstone is strongly impregnated with oxide of iron, supposed to have been
                    deposited by the percolations of water through the stone. Brown haematite iron
                    is also found at Addington. The iron of Northamptonshire was made use of by the
                    Romans, but the rise of the modern industry dates from about 1850. In 1881 iron
                    was worked at thirty different places in the county, the total quantity obtained
                    being 1,270,544 tons with an estimated value of ,£176,427. About one-fourth is
                    smelted in the district, but the greater quantity is sent raw to Merthyr-Tydfil
                    and Staffordshire. East and north-east of the county sandstone is largely
                    quarried for building purposes, and is both easily worked and richly coloured.
                    It is highly fossiliferous, containing many species not known in other
                    districts. The upper division consists of a nearly white silicious sandstone
                    frequently intercalated with clay. Above the sandstone rest beds of Lincolnshire
                    limestone, and, where it is absent, a sandy clay. The slopes of the hills are
                    frequently capped with cornbrash, sometimes overlaid with Oxford clay. Various
                    isolated portions are covered with drift deposits. Where sandstone and limestone
                    join the clay numerous springs occur, the proximity to which has in many cases
                    determined the sites of villages and towns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil and Agriculture.—</hi> The climate of Northamptonshire is
                    mild and genial, while the absence of lofty hills renders it much drier than
                    many other inland districts. The prevailing soil is a rich brown but light and
                    crumbling mould, sometimes with a rocky subsoil. The richest soil is the black
                    mould of the fen district, which is specially suited for grass, as are all the
                    heavier soils. Nearly all the land is capable of cultivation, although there is
                    some stiff wet soil on the slopes of the hills. In 1883 there were 559,536
                    acres, or about 88 per cent, of the total area under cultivation, of which no
                    fewer than 304,654 acres were under permanent pasture, many of the heavier soils
                    having been laid down during the past few years. Leases are the exception, and
                    on this account grass land is more in request than arable. The farms in general
                    are not large. Isolated houses are rare, both farmers and labourers living for
                    the most part in villages. The farm buildings are thus frequently inconveniently
                    situated as well as badly constructed, although improvements in both respects
                    are being introduced. The usual rotation of crops is fallow, wheat, beans, and
                    oats on heavy soils; but on the lighter soils wheat, pease or barley, with
                    clover and roots, on a four or five years’ rotation is the system generally
                    adopted. Frequently the land is left three years in grass. Of the 158,445 acres
                    under corn crops in 1883, 59,613 were under wheat, 50,866 under barley or here,
                    24,914 under oats, 16,770 beans, and 6121 pease. Green crops occupied only
                    38,143 acres, 23,923 of these being under turnips and swedes, 4894 under
                    mangolds, and only 2520 under potatoes. Clover occupied 34,137 acres, and fallow
                    24,157. Horses in 1883 numbered 21,901, of which 16,209 were used solely for
                    agricultural purposes. Cattle numbered 117,790, of which 26,036 were cows and
                    heifers in milk or in calf, the fattening of cattle being the chief occupation
                    of the Northamptonshire farmer. The favourite stock for breeding purposes is the
                    shorthorn, which has now almost entirely superseded the longhorn; but the most
                    common custom is to buy in Hereford, Scotch, Welsh, and Irish cattle in the
                    spring and fatten them off the rich pasture with or without artificial food, a
                    few being retained and fed up for the Christmas market. In autumn additional
                    cattle are bought in to eat the coarse grass off the pastures, and these are
                    usually retained during winter. Sheep in 1883 numbered 413,075, of which 255,737
                    were one year old and above. The most common breed on the rich pastures is the
                    improved Leicester, which is preferred on account of its length of wool; but the
                    Southdown, on account of its superior flesh, is also largely kept.</p>
                <p>According to the latest returns the land was divided among 14,665 proprietors,
                    possessing 592,771 acres, with a gross estimated rental of £1,637,370, an
                    average of about £2 15s. 3d per acre. Of the owners 10,010, or about 79 per
                    cent., possessed less than one acre each; 33 proprietors possessed between 2000
                    and 5000 acres, 11 between 5000 and 10,000, and the following over 10,000 each
                    :— Hon. G. W. Fitzwilliam, 18,116; duke of Buccleuch, 17,965; Earl Spencer,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures. —</hi> The iron industry is of great importance,
                    and, though only a small proportion of the metal is smelted in the county, the
                    number of furnaces in blast is increasing. The staple and the only manufacture
                    of importance is that of boots and shoes, which is chiefly carried on in
                    Northampton and the towns and villages in the centre of the county and along the
                    eastern border.</p>

                    the Great Northern, and the Midland Railways pass through portions of the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> In Domesday Northampton is
                    mentioned as containing 30 hundreds, but it then included a considerable part of
                    Rutlandshire. These divisions were first reduced to 28, and in the reign of
                    Henry II. to 20, their present number. The county includes the municipal
                    boroughs of Daventry (3859) and Northampton (51,881); the principal part
                    (20,123) of the city of Peterborough, which was incorporated under the Municipal
                    Act in 1874; part (1171) of the borough of Stamford, of which the greater part
                    is in Lincolnshire; part (2412) of the borough of Banbury, the greater part of
                    which is in Oxfordshire; the borough of Higham-Ferrers (1468); and the urban
                    sanitary districts of Hardingstone (4866), Kettering (11,095), Oundle (11,196),
                    and Wellingborough (13,794). Before the Reform Act of 1832 Northamptonshire sent
                    nine members to parliament, two for the shire, two each for the city of
                    Peterborough and the boroughs of Northampton and Brackley, and one for the
                    borough of Higham-Ferrers. By that Act the number was fixed at eight, Brackley
                    and Higham-Ferrers being disfranchised, while the county was formed into two
                    divisions, a northern and a southern, each returning two members. There are two
                    courts of quarter-sessions, one for the county and the other for the liberty or
                    soke of Peterborough, and nine petty and special sessional divisions, exclusive
                    of the liberty of Peterborough. The boroughs of Northampton and Stamford have
                    commissions of the peace and separate courts of quarter-sessions. The boroughs
                    of Daventry and Higham-Ferrers form parts of the petty and special sessional
                    divisions of Daventry and Wellingborough, the county justices having concurrent
                    jurisdiction. The county contains 344 civil parishes, with parts of four others.
                    It is almost entirely in the diocese of Peterborough. The population of
                    Northamptonshire in 1801 was 131,757, which in 1821 had increased to 162,483, in
                    1871 to 243,891, and in 1881 to 272,555 (135,662 males and 136,893 females). The
                    number of inhabited houses in 1881 was 57,540, and the average number of persons
                    to an acre 0'43.</p>

                    the Roman invasion inhabited Northamptonshire, are supposed to have been
                    dependent on the Iceni. Of this period the only remains are a few traces of
                    camps and earthworks, the principal being those at Borough Hill near Daventry,
                    where some rude pottery of supposed British origin has been discovered; at
                    Λrbury Hill near Staverton; and at Rockingham, on the site of the present old

                    two great Roman roads, the Waiting Street and the Ermine Street: the former
                    entered the county near Stony Stratford and passed by Towcester and Weedon to
                    Lilbourne, where it crossed the Avon; the latter crossed over from Castor near
                    Peterborough into Lincolnshire. From the large number of remains discovered
                    within its limits Northamptonshire would appear to have been very extensively
                    occupied by the Romans. The principal Roman stations within its limits were
                    Irchester, on the north side of the Nene, where numerous pieces of pottery,
                    coins, and slabs with inscriptions have been found; Castor, the seat of a
                    celebrated Roman pottery, the extent of which and the finish of whose
                    workmanship are attested by the tesselated pavements and other relics, as well
                    as by the kilns for bricks and earthenware, that have been dug up; Benaventa,
                    supposed to be Borough Hill, where excavations have brought to light traces of
                    very extensive buildings; Lactodurnm, supposed to be Towcester, where, however,
                    very few Roman remains are now visible; Isannavatia, probably at Burnt Walls, a
                    large field covered with remains of Roman buildings; and Tripontium, supposed to
                    be Lilbourne, where there are traces of camps on both sides of the river. There
                    were also encampments at Arbury Hill, Barrow Hill, Castle Dykes, Chesterton,
                    Guilsborough, Hunsborough, Rains-borough, Sulgrave, and Wallow Bank, besides
                    numerous small camps and posts at other places, especially along the valley of
                    the Nene, which is thickly strewn with tesselated pavements and other
                    remains.</p>
                <p>Northampton formed part of Middle Anglia, and was included in the Saxon kingdom
                    of Mercia. In the time of Tostig, and according to some at an earlier period, it
                    was attached to Northumberland, ami formed no part of Mercia. When the
                    Northumbrians in 1065 rebelled against Tostig and chose Morkere for their earl
                    they marched southwards to Northampton, where they were met by Harold and
                    received from him the confirmation of Morkere in the earldom; but the shires of
                    Northampton and Huntingdon were detached from it, and bestowed on Siward’s young
                    son Waltheof, who became earl of Northampton and Huntingdon. After the Conquest
                    the district became, on account of its extensive forest, a favourite resort of
                    the kings of England, who occupied the castles of Northampton and Rockingham.
                    During the Civil War Northamptonshire was the scene of many skirmishes in
                    addition to the great fight at Naseby, while the battle of Edgehill took place
                    on its borders.</p>
                <p>Although Northamptonshire was rich in monastic foundations, remains, except of
                    the abbey-church of Peterborough, afterwards the cathedral, are of small
                    importance, the principal being the foundation and parts of the walls of St
                    James’s Abbey at Duston near Northampton, part of the church of the Cistercian
                    abbey of Pipewell near Daventry and of the Cluniae priory at Daventry, and the
                    priory church at Ashby. At Geddington, and also at Northampton, there is an
                    Eleanor cross in good preservation. For the architecture of its churches
                    Northampton holds a place scarcely inferior to any other English county. To the
                    Saxon period belong the tower of Earls Barton church, which stands on an
                    eminence, probably the mound of an old English strong-house; the tower and other
                    portions of Brigstock; the ground plan and other portions of Wittering; the
                    remarkable tower of Barnack; and Brixworth church, constructed in part of Roman
                    materials, and supposed to include part of a Roman basilica. Of Norman, besides
                    the cathedral of Peterborough, the finest examples are St Peter’s and St
                    Sepulchre’s, Northampton, and the tower of Castor. Higham-Ferrers, formerly a
                    collegiate church, Early English and Decorated, is one of the most remarkable
                    churches in the county, both on account of the beauty of its architecture and
                    the number of monuments and brasses it contains. Of the other churches, most of
                    them representing more than one style of architecture, Early English, Decorated,
                    and Perpendicular, the standard of excellence is generally so high that it is
                    impossible to select a few for special notice’ in preference to others.</p>
                <p>The last surviving fragments of the enclosing wall of Northampton Castle were
                    only demolished in 1878. A gateway at Rockingham, and earthworks at
                    Higham-Ferrers and Brackley are worthy of mention. Some castellated ruins remain
                    of Fotheringhay Castle, which was founded soon after the Conquest by Simon de St
                    Liz, was rebuilt by Edmund, son of Edward III., and for many years was a
                    favourite residence of the princes of the house of York. To it Mary Queen of
                    Scots was removed in September 1586, and it was the scene of her trial in the
                    Octobeι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> following, and of her execution, 8th
                    February 1587. The current statement that the castle was razed by James I. after
                    his accession to the English throne is a mistake, but it was allowed to go to
                    decay, and its materials were gradually used for other buildings. Barnwell
                    Castle, founded by William the Conqueror, and an interesting example of the
                    defensive construction of the period, is still a fine ruin, which includes four
                    of the round towers and an imposing gateway. Holdenby Manor House, where Sir
                    Christopher Hatton was born, and where Charles I. was staying when he was
                    carried away by Cornet Joyce, has been demolished. Among the ancient
                    mansion-houses are Castle Ashby, the seat of the Comptons, the oldest portion
                    belonging to the reign of Henry VIII.; Althorp, the seat of the Spencers, of
                    various dates; Drayton House, of the time of Henry VI.; the vast pile of
                    Burghley House, founded by Lord Burghley, but more than once altered and
                    enlarged; and Kirby Hall, built by Sir Christopher Hatton.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Northampton,</hi> a municipal and parliamentary borough, and
                    the county town of Northamptonshire, is situated on the slope and summit of an
                    eminence rising above the river Nene, on the main line of the London and
                    NorthWestern Company, on several branch railway lines, and on a branch canal
                    connecting it with the Grand Junction Canal, 65 miles north-north-west from
                    London. It is divided into four nearly equal parts by two main streets, each
                    about a mile in length, running north and south and east and west, and crossing
                    each other at right angles. In the centre of the town there is a very spacious
                    market square, with a fine drinking fountain, erected in 1860 on the site of the
                    old cross, destroyed by the fire of 1675 which levelled a great part of the
                    town. The older houses are substantially built of stone, the newer ones of brick
                    with stone facings. Formerly there were seven parish churches, but of these only
                    four now remain, All Saints, St Giles’s, St Peter’s, and St Sepulchre’s. All
                    Saints was rebuilt after the fire of 1675, but retains its old Decorated Gothic
                    embattled tower, which scarcely harmonizes with the style of the modern
                    building, the principal feature of which is the fine Ionic portico. The church
                    of St Giles’s was originally a cruciform structure of the beginning of the 12th
                    century, but has been greatly changed, and, besides a fine Norman doorway,
                    contains specimens of Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular. St Peter’s,
                    near the ancient castle, is supposed to be of the same date with it, and its
                    interior is a fine specimen of Norman architecture. St Sepulchre’s, one of the
                    four round churches still remaining in England, is supposed to have been built
                    by the Knights Templars at the close of the 11 th century. The Roman Catholic
                    cathedral, in the Gothic style, was founded in 1844, and greatly enlarged in
                    1863. Among the educational establishments are a free grammar school (1552), a
                    Government school of art (1871), and a bluecoat school, in addition to charity,
                    church, and school-board schools. The charitable foundations comprise St John’s
                    Hospital, founded in the 12th century; St Thomas Hospital, founded 1450, in
                    honour of Thomas Becket; the general <pb break="no"

                    (1837), the union workhouse (1837), and the Royal Victoria Dispensary (1844).
                    Among the public buildings are the town-hall in the Gothic style (1864), the
                    county-hall in the Grecian, the corn exchange buildings in the Italian, the
                    county jail, the borough jail, the barracks, and the theatre. There is a fine
                    public promenade, and a racecourse with an area of 117 acres. A new cattle
                    market was opened in 1873. Northampton is unrivalled in England for the
                    manufacture of boots and shoes. There are also currying works, breweries,
                    maltings, iron-foundries, flour and paper mills, and brick and tile works. The
                    population of the municipal borough (area 1342 acres) in 1801 was 7020, which in
                    1831 had increased to 15,357, in 1851 to 26,658, in 1871 to 41,168, and in 1881
                    to 51,881, of whom 25,249 were males and 26,632 females. The parliamentary
                    borough was enlarged in 1868 to 2046 acres, and the population in 1871 was
                    45,080, which in 1881 had increased to 57,544.</p>
                <p>There is a tradition that Northampton was founded by Belinus, a British king,
                    while according to some it is of Roman origin. Neither of these suppositions is
                    supported by any tangible evidence. In the <hi rend="italic">Saxon
                    Chronicle</hi> it is called Hamptune. From 917 to 921 it was in possession of
                    the Danes, and in 1010 was nearly wholly destroyed by Sweyn. After the Norman
                    Conquest it was defended by embattled walls, bastion towers, and a strong
                    fortress. Northampton has been more than once the scene of a parliament. The
                    priory of St Andrew, founded before the Norman Conquest, was rebuilt by Simon de
                    St Liz, and was of very great extent. During the Civil War the town was
                    fortified for the Parliament. The borough received its charter of incorporation
                    from Henry II., which was subsequently extended by the 36 of George III., and
                    this continued to be the governing charter until the passing of the Municipal
                    Act of 1835, when the government was vested in a mayor, six aidermen, and
                    eighteen councillors, the town being divided into three wards. Northampton has
                    returned two members to parliament since the time of Edward I.</p>
