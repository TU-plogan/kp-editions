                    has, on the other hand, wide straight streets which cross each other at right
                    angles and allow views of the hills around the city. Beyond the gates (several
                    of which are preserved on account of their antiquarian interest, and still
                    indicate the line of the old civic boundaries) long suburbs stretch out into the
                    country. The railway from Paris to Strasburg skirts the city on the south-west
                    side, and to the east and north lie the Meurthe <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0182-0171"/> and the canal from the Marne to the Rhine. Other
                    railways—to Metz, to Épinal by Mirecourt, to Chateau Salins—join the main line
                    in the neighbourhood, and make the place an important junction. The Place
                    Stanislas is worthy of a capital city: in the centre stands the statue of
                    Stanislas Leczinski, ruler of Lorraine (who still remains the most popular
                    personage in the town which he embellished), and on all sides rise imposing
                    buildings in the 17 th-century style—the town-hall, episcopal palace, theatre,
                    &lt;fcc. The streets opening into the square have railings of artistic
                    workmanship. A fine triumphal arch known as the King’s Gate leads from the Place
                    Stanislas to the Place Carrière, which forms a beautiful tree-planted promenade,
                    and at its further end contains the Government palace and the so-called
                    Pépinière (nursery), with fine clumps of trees, grass, and flowers. Other open
                    spaces in the city are the Place d’Alliance (formed by Stanislas, with a
                    fountain in memory of the alliance between Louis XV. and Maria Theresa in 1756),
                    the Place de l’Académie, the Cours Léopold, the Place St Epvre, the Place
                    Dombasle, and the Place de la Gare. The town-hall contains a picture gallery.
                    The cathedral, built in the 18th century, has a wide façade flanked by two
                    dome-surmounted towers, and a somewhat frigid and sombre interior. Of particular
                    interest is the church of the Franciscans (Cordeliers), in the old town, built
                    by René II. to commemorate his victory over Charles the Bold in 1476. Pillaged
                    during the Revolution period, but restored to religious uses in 1825, it
                    contains the tombs of Antony of Lorraine and his wife Marie d’Harcourt, Philippe
                    of Gueldres, second wife of René II., the engraver Jacques Callot, Henry III.,
                    count of Vaudémont, and Isabella of Lorraine his wife, René II. (a curious
                    monument raised by his widow in 1515), and Cardinal de Vaudémont. Here also is a
                    chapel built in the beginning of the 17th century to receive the tombs of the
                    princes of the house of Lorraine. The church of St Epvre, rebuilt between 1864
                    and 1874 on the site of an old church in the style of the 13th, 14th, and 15th
                    centuries, has a fine spire and belfry and good stained glass windows.
                    Bonsecours Church, at the end of the St Pierre Faubourg, contains the mausoleums
                    of Stanislas (by whom it was built) and his wife Catherine, and the heart of
                    their daughter Marie, queen of France. Of the old ducal palace, begun in the
                    15th century by Duke Raoul and completed by René II., there remains but a single
                    wing, and of this a portion was destroyed by a great fire in 1871, and has been
                    replaced by an upper primary school built in the same 15th-century style as the
                    rest of the building. The entrance to this wing is a delightful specimen of the
                    late Gothic of the beginning of the 16th century. From the ground-floor gallery
                    a fine staircase ascends to the Galerie des Cerfs, which accommodates the
                    archaeological museum of Lorraine; one of the greatest treasures of the
                    collection is a piece of tapestry 92 feet long and 13 feet broad, which was
                    found in the tent of Charles the Bold after the battle of Nancy. At a short
                    distance from the railway station a cross marks the spot where the duke’s body
                    was found. Of the old gates of Nancy the most remarkable is the Porte de la
                    Crafle.</p>
                <p>Nancy is the seat of a bishop and of a court of appeal, and the headquarters of a
                    military division dependent on the Chalons corps d’armée. It is also a
                    university town, with the four faculties of medicine, literature, science, and
                    law, and as an educational centre has risen in importance since 1871. It
                    possesses a large library, archives of antiquarian interest, a botanical garden,
                    and a museum of natural history, an academy, a geographical society, and an
                    important school of forestry (see vol. ix. p. 403). The first agricultural
                    station founded in France (1822) is at Roville in the vicinity. Timber, grain,
                    and hops (largely grown in the district), rags for the paper-mills of the
                    Vosges, and the embroidery which was its earliest industry have long been the
                    objects of an extensive trade at Nancy; during the last fifty years the
                    commercial and industrial importance of the place has been greatly increased by
                    the construction of the railway and the canal from the Marne to the Rhine, now
                    supplemented by the new eastern canal between the Meuse, the Moselle, and the
                    Saône; and since the Franco-German war the manufacturing class has been
                    recruited by numerous immigrants from Alsace. Round about the city are now to be
                    seen the chimneys of iron-works and foundries, cotton-mills, chemical-works, and
                    glass-works; and large numbers of the inhabitants are also employed in making
                    straw-hats, artificial flowers, boots and shoes, and hosiery. A printing and
                    publishing establishment of some importance has been transferred from Strasburg.
                    The population was about 28,000 in the close of the 18th century, 43,000 in
                    1856, 52,000 in 1871, and 66,000 (73,225 as a commune) in 1881.</p>
                <p>At the close of the 11th century Odelric of Nancy, brother of Gerard of Alsace,
                    possessed at Nancy a castle which enabled him to defy the united assaults of the
                    bishops of Metz and Treves and the count of Bar. In the course of the next
                    century the town was surrounded with walls, and became the capital of the dukes
                    of Lorraine; but its real importance dates from the 15th century, when (in 1477)
                    Charles the Bold and his schemes of conquest perished at its gates. Enlarged,
                    embellished, and admirably refortified by Charles III., it was taken by the
                    French in 1633 (Louis XIII. and Richelieu being personally present at the
                    siege); and when in 1661 it was restored by Louis XIV. Charles was compelled to
                    raze its fortifications. After the peace of Ryswick in 1697 Duke Leopold, at
                    length in quiet possession of his duchy, set himself to repair the disasters of
                    the past. He founded academies, established manufactures, and set about the
                    construction of the new town. But it was reserved for Stanislas Leczynski, to
                    whom Lorraine and Bar were assigned in 1736, to carry out the plans of
                    improvement and embellishment in a style which made Nancy one of the palatial
                    cities of Europe, and rendered himself the most popular as he was the last of
                    the dukes of Lorraine. The city, which became French in 1766, was occupied by
                    the allies in 1814 and 1815, and put to ransom by the Prussians in 1870.</p>
