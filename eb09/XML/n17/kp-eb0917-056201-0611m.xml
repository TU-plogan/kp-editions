                    October 1746. Though he early showed an inclination for art, his father, a poor

                    portrait painter. Four years later he went to London, and was admitted as a
                    pupil into the studio and house of Reynolds, who had been the object of his
                    warmest admiration from early boyhood. At the same time he studied from the
                    round and the life in the Academy schools, making, it would seem, rather slow
                    progress in the technical processes of art. In 1775 he left Reynolds, and about
                    two years later, having acquired the requisite funds by portrait-painting in
                    Devonshire, he set out for Italy. There he remained for three years, studying
                    the portraits of Titian, looking, as he tells us, twice at Michelangelo for
                    every time he looked at Raphael, and forming the resolution that in the future
                    he would paint portraits for bread and historical subjects for fame. On his
                    return to England he revisited his native county, and then settled in London,
                    where Opie and Fuseli were his rivals. He was elected associate of the Academy
                    in 1786, and full academician in the following spring. The Young Princes
                    murdered in the Tower, his first important historical work, dates from 1786, and
                    it was followed by the Burial of the Princes in the Tower, both paintings, along
                    with seven others, being executed for the Shakespeare gallery of Aiderman
                    Boydell. The Death of Wat Tyler, now in the Guildhall, was exhibited in 1787;
                    and shortly afterwards Northcote began a set of ten subjects, entitled the
                    Modest Girl and the Wanton, which were completed and engraved in 1796. They were
                    suggested by the Pamela of Richardson and the Idle and Industrious Apprentices
                    of Hogarth,—a painter for whom Northcote professed little admiration. The series
                    was popular at the time, but neither in truth of dramatic conception nor in
                    technical qualities does it approach the parallel works of the older master.
                    Among the productions of Northcote’s later years are the Entombment and the
                    Agony in the Garden, besides many portraits, and several animal subjects, like
                    the Leopards, the Dog and Heron, and the Lion, which were more successful than
                    the artist’s efforts <pb break="no"

                    indicated by Fuseli’s caustic remark on examining the Angel opposing
                    Balaam—“Northcote, you are an angel at an ass, but an ass at an angel.” The
                    works of the artist number about two thousand. By unwearied diligence, combined
                    with extreme frugality, he was enabled to accumulate, before his death on 13th
                    July 1831, a fortune of £40,000.</p>
                <p>His works possess a certain dignity, and they tell their story clearly; but they
                    are marred by defective drawing and dull colouring, and by the gross
                    anachronisms and inconsistencies in costume common to the historical painters of
                    the period. Northcote was emulous of fame as an author, and his first essays in
                    literature were contributions to <hi rend="italic">The Artist,</hi> edited by Mr
                    Prince Hoare. In 1813 he embodied his recollections of his old master in a <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Reynolds.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">Fables—</hi> the
                    first series published in 1828, the second posthumously in 1833—were illustrated
                    with woodcuts by Harvey from Northcote’s own designs. In the production of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Life of Titian,</hi> his last work, which appeared in 1830, he
                    was assisted by William Hazlitt, who previously, in 1826, had given to the
                    public in the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi> his recollections of
                    Northcote’s pungent and cynical “conversations,” the bitter personalities of
                    which caused much trouble to the painter and his friends.</p>
