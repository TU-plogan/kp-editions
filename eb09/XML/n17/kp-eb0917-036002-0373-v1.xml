                <p><label type="entry">NETSCHER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gaspar</hi></label>
                    (1639-1684), portrait and genre painter, was born at Heidelberg in 1639. His
                    father died when he was two years of age, and his mother, fleeing from the
                    dangers of a civil war, carried him to Arnheim, where he was adopted and
                    educated by a benevolent physician named Tullekens. At first he was destined for
                    the profession of his patron, but his great aptitude for painting soon caused
                    the plan of his future career to be altered. He was placed under an artist named
                    De Koster, and, having also studied under Terburg, he set out for Italy to
                    complete his education there. Marrying, however, at Liège, he proceeded no
                    farther. He settled at Bordeaux, and toiled hard to earn a livelihood by
                    painting fancy subjects. But those small cabinet pictures which are now so
                    highly valued on account of their exquisite finish brought but a small
                    remuneration; and, after removing to the Hague, he turned his attention to
                    portraitpainting. In this branch of his art he was more successful. He was
                    patronized by William III., and his earnings soon became so considerable that he
                    was enabled at times to gratify his own taste and fancy by depicting musical and
                    conversational pieces. It was in these that Netscher’s genius was first fully
                    displayed. The choice of these subjects, and the habit of introducing female
                    figures, dressed in rich, glossy satins, were imitated from Terburg · they
                    possess easy yet delicate pencilling, brilliant and correct colouring, and
                    pleasing light and shade; but frequently their refinement passes into weakness,
                    and they err through over-finish. The painter soon attracted notice, and was
                    rapidly gaining both fame and wealth, when he was cut off in 1684 at the
                    premature age of forty-five.</p>
                <p>The paintings of Netscher are rare. The most extensive collection of them,
                    numbering eight subjects, is at Dresden; and examples may be studied in the
                    Louvre, in the galleries of Florence, the Hague, Cassel, Copenhagen, and St
                    Petersburg, in the London National Gallery, and in the Bridgewater, Ashburton,
                    and Apsley House collections. The style of Netscher was imitated by his two sons
                    Theodore and Constantine; but these, though meritorious painters, were far
                    inferior to their father.</p>
