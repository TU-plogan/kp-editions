                    subsequently termed by him <hi rend="italic">P. nestor,</hi> in allusion to its
                    hoary head, but now usually known as <hi rend="italic">Nestor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">meridionalis,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">“Kaka”</hi> of the
                    Maories and English settlers in New Zealand, in some parts of which it was, and
                    even yet may be, very abundant, though its numbers are fast decreasing. Forster,
                    who accompanied Cook in his second voyage, described it in his MSS. in 1773,
                    naming it <hi rend="italic">P. hypopdlius,</hi> and found it in both the
                    principal islands. The general colour of the Kaka is olive-brown, nearly all the
                    ∙feathers being tipped with a darker shade, so as to give a scaly appearance to
                    the body. The crown is light grey, the ear-coverts and nape purplish-bronze, and
                    the rump and abdomen of a more or less deep crimson-red; but much variation is
                    presented in the extent and tinge of the last colour, which often becomes orange
                    and sometimes bright yellow. The Kaka is about the size of a Crow; but a larger
                    species, generally resembling it, though having its plumage varied with blue and
                    green, the <hi rend="italic">Nestor</hi><hi rend="italic">notabilis</hi> of
                    Gould, was discovered in 1856 by Mr Walter Manteli, in the higher mountain
                    ranges of the Middle Island. This is the “<hi rend="italic">Kea”</hi> of the
                    Maories, and has of late incurred the enmity of colonists by developing, they
                    say, when pressed by hunger in winter, an extraordinary habit of assaulting
                    sheep, picking holes with its powerful beak in their side, wounding the
                    intestines, and so causing the animals’ death. The lacerations are said to be
                    made so uniformly in one place as to suggest deliberate design; but the bird’s
                    intent has yet to be investigated, though it is admittedly an eater of carrion
                    in addition to its ordinary food, which, like that of the Kaka, consists of
                    fruits, seeds, and the grubs of wood-destroying insects, the last being obtained
                    by stripping the bark from trees infested by them. The amount of injury the Kea
                    inflicts on flock-masters, as always happens in similar cases, has doubtless
                    been much exaggerated, for Dr Menzies states that on one “run,” where the loss
                    was unusually large, the proportion of sheep attacked was about one in three
                    hundred, and that those pasturing below the elevation of 2000 feet are seldom
                    disturbed.</p>
                <p>On the discovery of Norfolk Island (10th October 1774) a Parrot, thought by
                    Forster to be specifically identical with the Kaghâà (as he wrote the name) of
                    New Zealand, —though his son (<hi rend="italic">Voyage,</hi> ii. p. 446)
                    remarked that it was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n368/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0368-0355"/> “infinitely brighter coloured,”—was found in its
                    hitherto untrodden woods. Among the drawings of Bauer, the artist who
                    accompanied Robert Brown and Flinders, is one of a <hi rend="italic">Nestor</hi>
                    marked “Norfolk Isl. 19 Jan. 1805,” on which Herr von Pelzeln in 1860 founded
                    his <hi rend="italic">N. norfolcensis.</hi> Meanwhile Latham, in 1822, had
                    described, as distinct species, two specimens evidently of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Nestor,</hi> one said, but doubtless erroneously, to inhabit New
                    South Wales, and the other from Norfolk Island. In 1836 Gould described an
                    example, without any locality, in the museum of the Zoological Society, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Plyctdlophus</hi><hi rend="italic">productus,</hi> and when some
                    time after he was in Australia, he found that the home of this species, which he
                    then recognized as a <hi rend="italic">Nestor,</hi> was Phillip Island, a very
                    small adjunct of Norfolk Island, and not more than five miles distant from it.
                    Whether the birds of the two islands were specifically distinct or not we shall
                    perhaps never know, since they are all extinct (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 735), and no specimen undoubtedly from Norfolk Island
                    seems to have been preserved; while, now that we are aware of the great
                    diversity in colour, size, and particularly in the form of the beak, to which
                    the New-Zealand members of the genus are subject, it would be unsafe to regard
                    as specific the differences pointed out by Herr von Pelzeln from Bauer’s
                    drawing. The Phillip-Island <hi rend="italic">Nestor</hi> may be distinguished
                    from both of the New-Zealand species by its somewhat smaller size, orange
                    throat, straw-coloured breast, and the generally lighter shade of its tints.</p>
                <p>The position of the genus <hi rend="italic">Nestor</hi> in the Order <hi
                    rend="italic">Psittaci</hi> must be regarded as uncertain. Garrod removes it
                    altogether from the neighbourhood of the Lories <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool.
                    Society,</hi> 1874, p. 597), to which indeed the structure of its tongue, as
                    previously shewn by him <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> 1872, p. 789),
                    indicates only a superficial resemblance. Like go many other New-Zealand forms,
                    <hi rend="italic">Nestor</hi> seems to be isolated, and may fairly be deemed to
                    represent a separate Family— <hi rend="italic">Nestoridae</hi> —a view which is
                    fully justified by a cursory examination of its osteology, though this has
                    hitherto been only imperfectly described and figured (Eyton, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Osteol. Avium,</hi> p. 72; A. B. Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Abbild,</hi><hi
