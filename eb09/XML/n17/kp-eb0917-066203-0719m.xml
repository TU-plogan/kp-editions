                    >Nürnberg},</hi> the second town of Bavaria in size and the first in commercial
                    importance, is situated in the district of Middle Franconia, in a sandy but
                    well-cultivated plain, 95 miles to the north-west of Munich. It is divided by
                    the small river Pegnitz into two parts, called respectively the Lorenzerseite
                    and the Sebalderseite, after the two principal churches.</p>
                <p>Formerly among the richest and most influential of the free imperial towns,
                    Nuremberg is one of the few cities of Europe that have retained their mediaeval
                    aspect substantially unimpaired. It is still surrounded with its ancient feudal
                    walls and moat, though of late several breaches have had to be made to meet the
                    exigencies of modern traffic. Of the 365 towers which formerly strengthened the
                    walls, nearly 100 are still <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> and a few of the
                    interesting old gateways have also been preserved. Most of the streets are
                    narrow and crooked, and the majority of the houses have their gables turned
                    towards the street. The general type of architecture is Gothic, but the rich
                    details, which are lavished with especial freedom in the interior courts, are
                    usually borrowed from the Renaissance. Most of the private dwellings date from
                    the 16th century, and there are almost none of earlier date than the 15th
                    century. A praiseworthy desire to maintain the quaint picturesqueness of the
                    town has induced most of the builders of new houses to imitate the lofty peaked
                    gables, oriel windows, and red-tiled roofs of the older dwellings; and it is
                    easy for the visitor to Nuremberg to fancy himself carried back to the Middle
                    Ages. Altogether it is difficult to conceive of a more piquant contrast than
                    that afforded by the two chief towns of Bavaria—Munich, stamped with the
                    brand-new impress of the 19th century, and Nuremberg, presenting a faithful
                    picture of a well-todo town of 300 years ago.</p>
                <p>A good survey of this interesting town may be obtained from the old burg or
                    castle, picturesquely perched on the top of a rock on the north side of the
                    town. It is supposed to have been founded by the emperor Conrad II. about the
                    year 1024, and dates in its present form mainly from the reign of Frederick
                    Barbarossa (c. 1158). It was restored in careful harmony with its original
                    appearance in 1854-56, and part of the interior is fitted up as a residence for
                    the royal family. The two Late Romanesque chapels, one above the other, are
                    interesting; the lower was the burial-place of the burggraves. Among the
                    instruments of torture preserved in the castle is the famous “Iron Virgin” of
                    Nuremberg. In the court is a linden tree said to be over 700 years old. The
                    castle of Nuremberg was a favourite residence of the emperors of Germany, and
                    the imperial regalia were kept here from 1424 to 1806.</p>
                <p>Nuremberg contains numerous interesting churches, the finest of which are those
                    of St Lawrence, St Sebald, and Our Lady, three Gothic edifices of the 13-15th
                    centuries. All three are notable for their elaborately-carved doorways, in which
                    free play has been given to the exuberant fancy of the Gothic style, and all
                    three enshrine valuable treasures of art. In the church of St Lawrence, the
                    largest of the three, is the masterpiece of the sculptor <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0720-0663"/> Adam Krafft, consisting of a ciborium or
                    receptacle for the host, in the form of a florid Gothic spire 65 feet high; the
                    carving of this work is exquisitely minute and delicate. In front of the altar
                    hangs a curious piece of wood-carving by Veit Stoss, representing the
                    Salutation. The shrine of St Sebald, in the church of St Sebald, consisting of a
                    bronze sarcophagus and canopy, in the richest Gothic style, adorned with
                    numerous statues and reliefs, is looked upon as one of the greatest achievements
                    of German art. It was executed by Peter Vischer, the celebrated artist in
                    bronze, who was occupied on the work for thirteen years (1506-19) and has here
                    shown himself no unworthy rival of Lorenzo Ghiberti. The church of Our Lady
                    possesses some fine old stained glass windows and some paintings by Wohlgemuth.
                    The Aegidienkirche, a building of last century, contains a good altarpiece by
                    Van Dyck.</p>
                <p>The town-house, an edifice in the Italian style, erected in 1616-19, contains
                    frescos by Dürer and a curious stucco relief of a tournament held at Nuremberg
                    in 1446. The new law courts, the hospitals, and the barracks are also imposing
                    structures, but the most interesting secular buildings in the town are the
                    houses of the old patrician families, already referred to. Among the most
                    characteristic of these are the old residence of the counts of Nassau, and the
                    houses of the Tücher, Funk, and Peller families. A special interest attaches to
                    the dwellings of Albert Dürer, Hans Sachs, the cobbler-poet, and Johann Palm,
                    the patriotic bookseller who was shot by order of Napoleon in 1806. Statues of
                    Dürer, Sachs, and Melanchthon (the reputed founder of the grammar-school) have
                    been erected; and the streets are further embellished with several fountains,
                    the most noteworthy of which are the Schöne Brunnen, in the form of a large
                    Gothic pyramid, adorned with statues (1385-96) and the Gänsemännchen or
                    goosemannikin, a clever little figure by Labenwolf. On the way to the cemetery
                    of St John, which contains the graves of Dürer, Sachs, Behaim, and other
                    Nuremberg worthies, are Krafft’s Stations, seven pillars bearing stone reliefs
                    of the Passion, and ranked among the finest works of the well-known
                    sculptor.</p>
                <p>The charitable, educational, scientific, and artistic institutions of Nuremberg
                    are on a scale worthy of its ancient dignity. The Germanic National Museum,
                    established in an old Carthusian monastery, has one of the most important
                    historical collections in Germany. It includes a picture-gallery with works by
                    Holbein, Dürer, Wohlgemuth, etc. The Bavarian Industrial Museum is also a very
                    creditable institution. The municipal library contains about 800 manuscripts and
                    50,000 printed books, some of which are of great rarity.</p>
                <p>Though not of so great relative importance as of yore, Nuremberg still occupies a
                    high place among the industrial and commercial centres of Europe. The principal
                    manufactures are lead pencils, colours, gold and silver wire, gold and silver
                    foil, railway plant, tobacco, playing-cards, and lastly the “Dutch” toys and
                    fancy articles in metal, carved wood, ivory, &amp;c., which are collectively
                    known as “Nuremberg wares.” A great proportion of the toys exported from
                    Nuremberg are really made by the peasants of Thuringia. The pencil manufactory
                    of Faber, the railway works of the Nuremberg Company, and Zeltner’s ultramarine
                    factory are among the most important of their class in Europe. Large quantities
                    of Nuremberg manufactures are sent to India and America, the exports to the
                    United States alone being valued at £800,000 in 1882. Brewing, lithography, and
                    map-publishing are also extensively carried on. Nuremberg is the chief market on
                    the Continent for hops, and in 1882 the “turn over” in the trade in this article
                    was £4,000,000. The bronze foundry established by Professor Burgschmiet, and now
                    carried on by Professor Lenz, produces numerous admirable and important
                    castings; and in the artistic handicrafts generally Nuremberg artisans are
                    honourably distinguished. In addition to numerous railways, trade is facilitated
                    by the Ludwig canal, connecting the Danube and the Main. The railway from
                    Nuremberg to Fürth was the first in Germany. Nuremberg's money-market is also of
                    some importance.</p>
                <p>The population of Nuremberg at the height of its prosperity has been estimated at
                    as high a figure as 150,000, but there seems good reason to believe that it did
                    not exceed 40,000 to 50,000 souls. In 1818 it had sunk to 27,000, but since then
                    it has steadily increased. At the census of 1880 the town contained 99,519
                    inhabitants, 76,886 of whom were Protestants, 19,143 Roman Catholics, and 3032
                    Jews. According to a local estimate the population had risen to 103,255 at the
                    beginning of 1883. Several of the patrician families of Nuremberg can trace
                    their descent in a direct line for four or five centuries, and still occupy the
                    houses built by their forefathers. A few of them are said to possess very
                    complete and interesting domestic archives.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The first authentic mention of Nuremberg, which
                    seems to have been called into existence by the foundation of the castle, occurs
                    in a document of 1050; and about the same period it received from Henry III.
                    permission to establish a mint, a market, and a custom-house. It is said to have
                    been destroyed by the emperor Henry V. in 1105, but if this was the case the
                    town must have been very speedily rebuilt, as in 1127 we find the emperor
                    Lothair taking it from the duke of Swabia and assigning it to Henry the Proud,
                    duke of Bavaria. λVe now first hear of an imperial officer styled the burggrave
                    of Nuremberg, who, however, seems to have been merely the military governor of
                    the castle, and to have exercised no sway over the citizens. This office came
                    into the hands of the counts of Hohenzollern at the beginning of the 13th
                    century, and “burggrave of Nuremberg” is still one of the titles of their
                    descendant, the emperor of Germany. The government of the town was vested in the
                    patrician families, who, contrary to the usual course of events in the free
                    towns, succeeded in permanently excluding the civic guilds from all share of
                    municipal power. Conrad III. (1138-1152) reunited Nuremberg to the empire, and
                    for the next three or four centuries the town was specially favoured by the
                    German monarchs, -who frequently resided and held diets here. In 1219 Frederick
                    II. conferred upon it the rights of a free imperial town, and in 1355 it
                    witnessed the promulgation of the famous ‘ ‘ Golden Bull” of Charles IV. At the
                    beginning of the 15th century the burggraves of Nuremberg, who had in the
                    meantime raised themselves to the rank of princes of the empire, were invested
                    with the margraviate of Brandenburg, and sold the castle of Nuremberg to the
                    town. They, however, reserved certain rights, which resulted in keenly -
                    contested feuds between the burghers and the margraves Albert Achilles (1449),
                    Frederick (1502), and Albert Alcibiades (1552).</p>
                <p>The quarrel with the margraves, however, did not interfere with the growth of the
                    town’s prosperity, which reached its acme in the 16th century. Like Augsburg,
                    Nuremberg attained great wealth as an intermediary between Italy and the East on
                    the one hand, and northern Europe on the other. Its manufactures were so well
                    known that it passed into a proverb—“Nuremberg’s hand goes through every land.”
                    Its citizens lived in such luxury that Aeneas Sylvius (Pope Pius II., 1405-1464)
                    has left it on record that a simple burgher of Nuremberg was better lodged than
                    the king of Scotland. The town had gradually extended its sway over a territory
                    nearly 500 square miles in extent, and was able to furnish the emperor
                    Maximilian with a contingent of 6000 troops. But perhaps the great glory of
                    Nuremberg lies in its claim to be the principal font of German art. Its
                    important architectural features have already been described. The love of its
                    citizens for sculpture is abundantly manifest in the statues and carvings on
                    their houses. Adam Krafft (c. 1455-1507), Veit Stoss (c. 1450-1532), and Peter
                    Vischer (c. 1455-1529) form a trinity of sculptors of which any city might be
                    proud. In painting Nuremberg is not less prominent, as the names of Wohlgemuth
                    (1434-1519) and Albert Durer (1471- 1528* sufficiently indicate. In the
                    decorative arts the Nuremberg handicraftsman attained great perfection in
                    ministering to the luxurious tastes of the burghers, and a large proportion of
                    the old German furniture, silver-plate, stoves, and the like, which we now
                    admire in industrial museums, was made in Nuremberg workshops. Wenzel Jamnitzer
                    (1508-1585), the worker in silver, is perhaps eminent enough to be added to the
                    above list of artists. _ Its place in literary history—by no means an
                    unimportant one—Nuremberg owes to Hans Sachs (1494-1576) and the other
                    meistersänger. , A final proof of the vigorous vitality of Nuremberg at this
                    period may be found in the numerous inventions of its inhabitants, which include
                    watches (at first called “Nuremberg eggs”), the air-gun, gun-locks, the
                    terrestrial and celestial globes, the composition now called brass, and the art
                    of wire-drawing.</p>
                <p>Nuremberg was the first of the imperial towns to throw in its Jot with the
                    Reformation (in 1525), and it embraced Protestantism with its wonted vigour. Its
                    name is associated with a peace concluded between Charles V. and the Protestants
                    in 1532. The first blow to its prosperity was the discovery of the sea-route to,
                    India in 1497; and the second was inflicted by the Thirty Years’ War, during
                    which Gustavus Adolphus was besieged here in an entrenched camp by Wallenstein.
                    During the eight or ten weeks that the blockade lasted no fewer than 10,000
                    inhabitants of Nuremberg are said to have died of want or disease. The downfall
                    of the town was accelerated by the illiberal and short-sighted policy of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0721-0664"/> its patrician rulers; and the French Revolution
                    reduced it to such a degree that in 1796 it offered itself and its terri tories
                    to the king of Prussia on condition that he would pay its debts (9,000,000
                    guldens). Prussia, however, refused the offer. In 1803 Nuremberg was allowed to
                    maintain its nominal position as a free city, but in 1806 it was annexed to
                    Bavaria. During this century its progress has been one of uninterrupted
                    prosperity, and it is now the chief commercial town in South Germany.</p>
