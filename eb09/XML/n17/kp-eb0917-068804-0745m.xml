                <p><label type="entry">NYMPH</label>. The belief that the nature which surrounds
                    mankind—the woods, the springs, the hills—is full of a life resembling, yet
                    different from, human life is universal in a primitive stage of thought. At
                    Psophis in Arcadia a row of tall cypress trees was called αί <hi rend="italic"
                    >παρθένοι,</hi> the damsels. In other places the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >κόραι</hi> was used, but the general term for the spirits who dwell in external
                    nature was <hi rend="italic">vvμφaι.</hi> All three words have the same meaning.
                    There is a close relation between the souls of dead men and the life of nature;
                    the Nymphs often play the part of death and carry away human beings to dwell
                    with them. This idea appears in a slightly different form when heroes and
                    favoured mortals live in communion with them. The connexion of a human being
                    with a Nymph has something unnatural about it, and almost always brings some
                    disaster on the mortal. Yet another form’of the idea appears in the word <hi
                    rend="italic">ννρ,φόληπτος</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> he whose mind the Nymphs
                    take possession of loses his human wit and becomes mad, but has wisdom more than
                    human. The worship of the Nymphs was practised throughout the classical period
                    in places where they seemed to have chosen a home for themselves, in shady
                    groves and beside springs of clear water. It retained its primitive simplicity.
                    No temple, no statue, no priest was needed; the offerings of a rural people were
                    placed on the simple altar. The cultus is therefore not often mentioned in
                    literature; but it appears to have been closely connected with the household
                    life of the people, and to have had a strong hold on them. Among the ceremonies
                    of marriage an acknowledgment of the power of the Nymphs was included. The
                    bride, herself a <hi rend="italic">vvμφη,</hi> was sprinkled with water from the
                    fresh spring of the Nymphs, or she went to bathe in the spring.</p>
                <p>The Nymphs, the ever-youthful spirits of nature, protected and nourished children
                    <hi rend="italic">(κουροτρόφοι)</hi>; they were themselves often, especially in
                    Asia Minor, the mothers of the heroes of the land. In the Troad, Hermes and the

                    Hesiod 9720 times that of man; it was a common belief that they were born and
                    died along with the trees of the forest. It was usual to distinguish Nymphs of
                    the rivers and fountains, Naiads, from those of the forests and mountains,
                    Dryads, Hamadryads, Oreades; but they were all <hi rend="italic">κoι&gt;paι</hi>
                    ∆ιos, the maidens of heaven, or, in more anthropomorphic language, the daughters
                    of Zeus. The worship of the Nymphs became more fashionable in later time, and
                    shrines of Nymphs <hi rend="italic">(wμφaιa)</hi> were built even in cities.</p>
