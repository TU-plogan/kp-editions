                <p><label type="entry">NORWEGIAN SEA</label>. The sub-polar regions of the Atlantic
                    lying between the Scandinavian peninsula and Greenland have been in recent years
                    carefully investigated by Norwegian expeditions under Professors Mohn and Sars;
                    and, as the sea immediately to the west of Norway has not hitherto been known by
                    any distinctive name, Mohn has proposed the name of “Norwegian Sea,”—a
                    suggestion which has been now generally adopted. The Norwegian Sea, therefore,
                    includes the whole of the region between Greenland and Norway, a portion of
                    which, to the northwest of the island of Jan Mayen, is sometimes known as the
                    Greenland Sea. The Norwegian Sea is a well-marked basin cut off from the
                    Atlantic by submarine ridges connecting the north of Scotland, the Faroe
                    Islands, Iceland, and Greenland. On the summit of these ridges there is an
                    average depth of about 250 fathoms. Between Spitzbergen and Lapland there is a
                    wide opening into the Barents Sea, where the depth is from 100 to 200 fathoms.
                    Between Spitzbergen and Greenland a wide and deep opening extends into the
                    frozen Arctic Ocean, with a depth of 2500 fathoms. The surrounding land is
                    almost everywhere high, rugged, deeply indented with fjords, and skirted with
                    outlying islands, which are mostly composed of stratified rocks and ancient
                    geological formations. Jan Mayen, situated near the centre of the basin,
                    Iceland, and the Faroe Islands are of volcanic origin.</p>
                <p>The marked peculiarity of the Norwegian Sea is the striking contrast in the
                    climate of its eastern and western portions. If we draw a line from the east
                    side of Iceland to the south end of Spitzbergen we have, generally speaking, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n648/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0648-0593"/> on the west of this line a sea covered with ice
                    during the whole of the year, throughout nearly its entire extent. It is only
                    rarely that the east coast of Greenland can be approached through the lanes and
                    openings formed in the ice. An arctic current passes southward along the coast
                    of Greenland, carrying with it vast fields of hummocky ice, and enters the North
                    Atlantic through the straits which separate Iceland from the coast of Greenland.
                    To the eastward of this line we have a sea free from ice throughout the year. A
                    warm current—the so-called extension of the Gulf Stream—passes between the
                    coasts of Scotland and Iceland, and carries a large amount of heat to the shores
                    of Norway and Lapland, rendering them relatively mild and habitable. The
                    prevailing wind over the western part of the Norwegian Sea is from the
                    northeast, while that over the eastern is from the south-west, in each case
                    corresponding with the direction of the ocean currents. With respect to the
                    relations of the barometric minimum to the prevailing winds and currents see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 139.</p>
                <p>In March and April a very extensive seal fishery is carried on to the north and
                    east of Jan Mayen along the edge of the ice-fields,—as many as 300,000 young
                    seals having been captured in one season. Large numbers of polar bears are at
                    this time noticed in the neighbourhood of the seal rookeries, and are captured
                    on the ice at great distances from land. Later in the season there is a right
                    whale fishery to the north and west of the island of Jan Mayen. A large number
                    of small vessels from Hammerfest and Lapland ports visit the coasts of
                    Spitzbergen each season to collect eider-down, and to engage in the walrus and
                    shark fisheries. Narwhals <hi rend="italic">(Monodon)</hi> are also captured
                    along the edge of the ice-floes. Guillemots, little auks, gulls, and other
                    sea-birds are found in vast numbers near the coast of Spitzbergen and along the
                    edge of the pack-ice. Along the coast of Norway there are valuable cod,
                    mackerel, herring, and lobster fisheries. The Norwegian Sea has a depth almost
                    rivalling that of the great Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, that of the whole of
                    the central parts exceeding 1000 fathoms, while to the south-east of Jan Mayen
                    there is a depth of 2000 fathoms, and off Spitzbergen of 2500 fathoms.</p>
                <p>The bottom in the western portion is composed of a mixture of mud and stones
                    formed from the detrital matter carried from the land by floating ice, and
                    containing not more than 5 or 6 per cent, of carbonate of lime. In the deeper
                    parts of the eastern portion we have a fine mud or clay containing sometimes 50
                    per cent, of carbonate of lime, and a total absence of the ice-borne stones and
                    gravel so abundant in the western portion. The carbonate of lime consists
                    chiefly of the shells of <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> which have fallen
                    from the surface, and some other species of Foraminifera (the most frequent of
                    which is <hi rend="italic">Biloculina)</hi> which live on the bottom. In some
                    places this deposit approaches in character the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Globigerina</hi> ooze or mud of the Atlantic, but is very poor in pelagic
                    shells when compared with the deposits in lower latitudes. The pelagic
                    Foraminifera and Pteropod shells so abundant in tropical parts of the Gulf
                    Stream are killed off and fall to the bottom as they are carried into the colder
                    areas of the North Atlantic. The upper layer of this deposit is of a brownish
                    colour, and is less compact and contains more lime than the deeper layers, which
                    have a blue or greyish colour. In this respect it agrees with the deposits found
                    at similar depths around all continental shores. The deposits along the
                    Norwegian coast, in depths less than 1000 fathoms, consist chiefly of detrital
                    matter from the shores, the mineral particles consisting of quartz, felspars,
                    mica, hornblende, magnetite, and fragments of rocks. Around Jan Mayen and
                    Iceland the deposits consist largely of volcanic sand. In all the deposits there
                    are many Diatom frustules.</p>
                <p>The isotherms of the atmosphere receive a very remarkable deflexion to the north
                    along the coast of Norway, as may be seen by reference to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> figs. 8-11 (vol. xvi. pp. 133 135, 136). A
                    similar remarkable deflexion takes place with thé isotherms of the ocean,
                    showing the temperature of the sea surface In January the warmest water is
                    foιtnd at a distance of over 100 miles from the coast, and ranges from 46° Fahr,
                    in the south to 36° Fahι. in the north. In July and August the warmest water is
                    found close along the shore, the range being from 60° Fahr, in the south to 47°
                    Fahr, in the north. This is due to the cooling effect of the land in winter and
                    its warming effect in summer. In the western part of the Norwegian Sea ice-cold
                    water is found at the surface throughout the year. The deeper parts are wholly
                    filled with ice-cold water, this temperature being met with off the coast of
                    Norway at a depth of 400 or 600 fathoms. The remarkably mild and genial
                    temperature of Norway, considering its latitude, is to be accounted for (1) by
                    the warm current from the south which flows northwards over the banks and fills
                    up the deep fjords beyond with water of a relatively high temperature; (2) by
                    the banks which extend along its shores with a depth of between 100 and 200
                    fathoms,— sometimes stretching out several hundred miles from the land and thus
                    keeping the ice-cold water of the basin out of the deep bays and fjords. The
                    water at the bottom of the deep fjords usually ranges from 40° Fahr, to 43°
                    Fahr, throughout the year. In summer the surface is warmer than the bottom water
                    in these fjords, but in winter it is several degrees colder (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Norway,</hi> p. 580). The bottom water in the fjords is not
                    affected by the cold of winter or heat of summer, owing to the great depth in
                    connexion with the slow rate at which changes of temperature are communicated
                    through the water. The specific gravity ranges from 1'0265 along the coast of
                    Norway to 1 · 0250 among the ice-floes off the coast of Greenland.</p>
                <p>The narrow and deep channel running between the Faroe Islands and Scotland (see
                    fig. 1, p. 564) must be specially referred to on account of the deep-sea
                    investigations which have been there carried on. Indeed the widespread interest
                    taken at the present time in the deep sea arose in a great degree from the
                    interesting discoveries made in this channel by Dr Carpenter and Wyville Thomson
                    in 1868 and 1869, in H.M.S. “Porcupine” and “Lightning.” Two areas were found,
                    one having at the bottom a temperature of 30° Fahr, and the other a temperature
                    of 45° Fahr. The faunas in the two <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n649/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0649-0594"/> areas were likewise characterized by remarkable
                    differences. There appears to have been no suspicion that a submarine ridge
                    separated the bottom water of the one area from that of the other. The
                    researches carried on in H.M.S. “Challenger” showed that in all cases there were
                    indications of submarine ridges separating areas in which a difference of
                    temperature was found at the bottom. In the years 1880 and 1882 this channel was
                    again investigated by H.M.S. “Knight Eruant” and “Triton.” A ridge, now called
                    the Wyville Thomson ridge, was discovered running in a north-north-west
                    direction from the north of Scotland to the Faroe banks, and separating the warm
                    and cold areas. The average depth on this ridge is 250 fathoms, but there is a
                    small saddle-back in the northern portion of it with a depth of a little over
                    300 fathoms. Ice-cold water was traced to the top of this ridge, and through the
                    saddle-back to the south-west margin. Here the cold water is met by the warm
                    current passing to the north-east, a mixture takes place, and the whole flows
                    towards the north-east. No true ice-cold current appears to pass into the
                    Atlantic through the Faroe channel (see the map). That the ridge is swept by
                    strong tidal currents as well as by the steady flow to the north-east is shown
                    by the fact that no fine deposit is allowed to accumulate on it, and by the
                    particles of sand and gravel from the ridge which are spread over the seabottom
                    to the north-east. Over the ridge large smooths and Wellings up of water take
                    place at certain times as the great tidal wave passes through this channel into
                    the North Sea. The top of the ridge, which is about 5 miles wide, is covered
                    with gravel and rocks, many of them rolled and glaciated, consisting of granite,
                    gneiss, mica-schists, sandstone, limestone, diorites, &amp;c. On both sides of
                    the ridge a mud is found containing Foraminifera shells, Diatoms, and minute
                    mineral fragments, such as quartz, mica, hornblende, augite, felspars,
                    magnetite, glauconite, &amp;c. Mineral particles from the ridge are much more
                    numerous and larger in the cold than in the warm area, thus indicating the
                    direction in which the currents sweep. The stones resemble those of the Orkneys,
                    and were most probably carried to their present position by glaciers or icebergs
                    during the Glacial period. Since temperature is the most important factor in the
                    distribution of marine species it is not astonishing to find a considerable
                    difference in the fauna on each side of the ridge. Mr Murray states that in the
                    ‘ ‘ Knight Errant” dredgings, of seventy-one species from the warm area and
                    forty-seven from the cold area, the depths being about the same and the distance
                    only about 40 miles apart, there were only two common to both areas. The animals
                    from the cold area are chiefly arctic forms, and resemble closely those from
                    similar depths off the east coast of North America, while those from the warm
                    area have a southern and abyssal character. We have indeed in the Faroe channel
                    a curious mixture of arctic, abyssal, and modified British faunas, the
                    distribution and limits of which have not yet been worked out. A thorough
                    investigation of this channel in its hydrographical and biological relations is
                    still a great desideratum.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian Sea exhibits an abundant pelagic fauna and flora. The warm water of
                    the Gulf Stream very frequently brings to the coasts of Norway animals usually
                    met with only at lower latitudes. Diatoms and other minute Algae are found in
                    vast banks, especially in the neighbourhood of the melting ice, giving the water
                    a peculiar green colour. This green-coloured water is regarded by the whalers as
                    one of the best indications of good fishing grounds. Entomostraca, Medusae,
                    Ctenophora, Siphonophora, Pteropods, and Radiolarians are also to be found in
                    great abundance on the whaling grounds. The deep-sea dredgings of the Norwegians
                    do not show such an abundant or rich fauna as is met with at similar depths in
                    more southern latitudes.</p>
