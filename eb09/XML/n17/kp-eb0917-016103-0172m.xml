                    literature were, from the first, moulded on those of Greek literature, it was
                    due to Naevius that much of its spirit and substance was of native growth. Long
                    before the formal recognition of literature in Rome, which dated from the year
                    240 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> there had existed various kinds of
                    inartistic composition, written or spoken, in Saturnian verse. The most
                    important of these were satiric and dramatic medleys, known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">saturae,</hi> and commemorative verses in praise of eminent men,
                    which were first sung at funeral banquets, and seem afterwards to have been
                    preserved among family records. The fact that Naevius wrote his most important
                    poem in Saturnian verse, the disparaging reference made to him by Ennius as the
                    writer of verses like those of the old native “Fauni and Yates,” the claim which
                    he makes in his epitaph to be the last purely Latin poet, the political satire
                    which he introduced into his comedies, the national and commemorative character
                    of his epic poem, all point to him as a medium of connexion between the nameless
                    authors of these satiric and commemorative verses and the recognized authors of
                    Roman comedy, satire, and even epic poetry.</p>
                <p>Though the fragments preserved from his numerous writings are few and
                    inconsiderable, yet they corroborate the impression derived from ancient
                    testimony that he was a man of originality and force of mind, and of a bold and
                    vigorous character. The impulse which he sought to give to Latin literature was
                    somewhat antagonistic to that actually given by Ennius; and either the greater
                    genius and richer culture of the latter or his greater adaptation to his times
                    determined that his influence should be predominant. Probably the genius of
                    Ennius was the higher creative force; it was more in harmony with the serious
                    Roman spirit, and with the grandeur of Roman institutions; it more naturally
                    allied itself with the aristocratic influence which was predominant in the state
                    for two generations after the death of Naevius; it was also more <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n173/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0173-0162"/> capable of assimilating the Greek culture, which
                    was the formative element in the literary art of the Romans. Yet the racy
                    popular spirit of Naevius gained for him admirers even in the Augustan age, and
                    Cicero represents the great master of Latin oratory, Crassus, as the highest
                    compliment he could pay to the pure idiomatic speech of his mother-in-law,
                    Laelia, comparing it to the style of Naevius and Plautus. Though a richer vein
                    of imaginative feeling was introduced into the Latin language and literature by
                    Ennius, yet much was lost in their subsequent development by the partial
                    suppression of the aggressive boldness and freedom of Naevius, as well as of the
                    exuberant mirth and humour of Plautus.</p>
                <p>There is great uncertainty in regard to the facts and dates of the life of
                    Naevius. From the expression of Gellius characterizing his epitaph as written in
                    a vein of “Campanian arrogance” it has been inferred that he was born in one of
                    the Latin communities settled in Campania. But the phrase “Campanian arrogance”
                    seems to have been used proverbially for “gasconade”; and, as there was a
                    plebeian <hi rend="italic">Gens Naevia</hi> in Rome, it is quite as probable
                    that he was by birth a Roman citizen. The strong political partisanship which he
                    displayed in his plays is favourable to this supposition, as is also the active
                    interference of the tribunes on his behalf. On the other side weight must be
                    given to the remark of Mommsen, viz., “the hypothesis that he was not a Roman
                    citizen, but possibly a citizen of Cales or of some other Latin town in
                    Campania, renders the fact that the Roman police treated him so unscrupulously
                    the more easy of explanation.” He served either in the Roman army or among the
                    <hi rend="italic">socii</hi> in the First Punic War, and thus must have reached
                    manhood before the year 241 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> We learn from Cicero
                    that he lived to a good old age, and that he died in exile about the end of the
                    3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The date of his birth may be thus
                    fixed with approximate probability about the year 265 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> No particulars of his military service are recorded. Sicily was the
                    great battlefield of the combatants during the latter years of the war. No
                    important Sicilian city was without its theatre, and it seems legitimate to
                    connect the new taste for regular dramatic performances (and especially for
                    tragedy, to which there was nothing corresponding among the Italian races)
                    developed at Rome immediately after the conclusion of the First Punic War with
                    the Sicilian experiences of the Roman and allied armies serving in the war.
                    Another important influence in Roman literature and Roman belief which first
                    appeared in the epic poem of Naevius also had its origin in Sicily, viz., the
                    recognition of the mythical connexion of Aeneas and his Trojans with the
                    foundation of Rome. The origin of this belief may probably be attributed to the
                    Sicilian historian Timaeus; but the contact of the Romans and Carthaginians in
                    the neighbourhood of Mount Eryx may have suggested that part of the legend which
                    plays so large a part in the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> which brings Aeneas
                    from Sicily to Carthage and back again to the neighbourhood of Mount Eryx. The
                    actual collision of Phoenician and Roman on the western shores of Sicily, of
                    which Naevius may well have been a witness, if it did not originate, gave a
                    living interest to the mythical origin of that antagonism in the relations of
                    Aeneas and Dido.</p>
                <p>The career of Naevius as a dramatic author began with the exhibition of a drama
                    in or about the year 235 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and was carried on
                    energetically for thirty years afterwards. Towards the close of this career he
                    incurred the hostility of some of the nobility, especially, it is said, of the
                    family of the Metelli, by the attacks which he made upon them on the stage, and
                    at their instance he was imprisoned,—a circumstance to which Plautus alludes in
                    a passage of the <hi rend="italic">Miles</hi><hi rend="italic">Gloriosus</hi>
                    (211). After writing two plays during his imprisonment, in which he is said to
                    have apologized for his former rudeness (Gellius, iii. 3, 15), he was liberated
                    through the interference of the tribunes of the commons; but he had shortly
                    afterwards to retire from Rome (in or about the year 204 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> to Utica. The generally received accounts assigned his death to that
                    year; but Cicero <hi rend="italic">{Brutus,</hi> 15, 60) quotes Varro as an
                    authority for the belief that his life was prolonged beyond that date. It may
                    have been during his exile, when withdrawn from his active career as a
                    dramatist, that he composed or completed his poem on the First Punic War.<note

                    Sen.,</hi> 14) speaks of it as the work of his old age.</p></note> Probably his
                    latest composition was the epitaph already referred to, also written in
                    Saturnian verse :—</p>
                <p>“Immortales mortales flere si foret fas, Flerent divae Camenae Naevium poetam;
                    Itaque postquam est Orcino traditus thesauro Obliti sunt Romai loquier lingua
                    Latina.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“If it were
                    permitted that immortals should weep for mortals, the divine Camenae would weep
                    for Naevius the poet; for since he hath passed into the treasure-house of death
                    men have forgotten at Rome how to speak in the Latin tongue.”</p></note></p>
                <p>If, as has been supposed, these lines were dictated by a jealousy of the growing
                    ascendency of Ennius, the life of Naevius must have been prolonged considerably
                    beyond the year 204 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> as it was only in that year
                    that Ennius first settled, and began his career as an author, in Rome.</p>
                <p>Like Livius, Naevius professed to adapt Greek tragedies and comedies to the Roman
                    stage. Among the titles of his tragedies are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aegisthus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Lycτcrgus, Andromache</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Hector</hi><hi rend="italic">Proficiscens,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eqτιus</hi><hi rend="italic">Trojanus,</hi> &amp;c. We find in the letters of
                    Cicero a reference to a representation of the last-named play at the opening of
                    the theatre of Pompey in 55 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.; but it seems to
                    have retained its popularity so long not so much from its dramatic merits as
                    from the scope it afforded for the gratification of the Roman taste for gorgeous
                    spectacles. The few fragments preserved from the tragedies show the first rude
                    beginnings of that artificial poetical phraseology and poetical word-formation
                    which the impulse derived from Greek literature developed in the speech of
                    Latium, and also the more native product of pithy sayings (such as the “laudari
                    a laudato viro,” “sero sapiunt Phryges ”) which had passed into proverbs in the
                    age of Cicero. The national cast of his genius and temper was further shown by
                    his deviating from his Greek originals, and producing at least two specimens of
                    the <hi rend="italic">fdbula</hi><hi rend="italic">praetcxta,</hi> one founded
                    on the childhood of Romulus and Remus (<hi rend="italic">Romulus s.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">A limonium Romuli et</hi><hi rend="italic">Remi),</hi> the other
                    called <hi rend="italic">Clastidium,</hi> which celebrated the contemporary
                    victory in which Marcellus carried off the <hi rend="italic">spolia
                    opima.</hi></p>
                <p>But it was as a writer of comedy that he was most famous, most productive, and
                    most original. While he is never ranked as a writer of tragedy with Ennius,
                    Pacuvius, or Accius, he is placed in the canon of the grammarian Volcatius
                    Sedigitus third (immediately after Caecilius and Plautus) in the rank of Roman
                    comic authors. He is there characterized as “Naevius qui fervet,” a phrase
                    expressive of his ardent, impetuous character and style. He is also appealed to,
                    along with Plautus and Ennius, as a master of his art in one of the prologues of
                    Terence. His comedy, like that of Plautus, seems to have been rather a free
                    adaptation of his originals than a rude copy of them, as those of Livius
                    probably were, or an artistic copy like those of Terence. The titles of most of
                    them, like those of Plautus, and unlike those of Caecilius and Terence, are
                    Latin not Greek. Among the few lines preserved from them λve find in one the
                    “Laurentines and Praenestines” spoken of, just as we find mention of provincial
                    Italian towns frequently in Plautus. He drew from the writers of the old
                    political comedy of Athens, as well as from the new comedy of manners, and he
                    attempted to make the stage at Rome, as it had been at Athens, an arena of
                    political and personal warfare. A strong spirit o. partisanship is recognized in
                    more than one of his fragments; and this spirit is thoroughly popular and
                    adverse to the senatorian ascendency which became more and more confirmed with
                    the progress of the Second Punic War. Besides his attack on the Metelli and
                    other members of the aristocracy, the great Scipio (whose services and
                    world-wide fame he acknowledges) is the object of a censorious criticism on
                    account of a youthful escapade attributed to him. Among the few lines still
                    remaining from his lost comedies, we seem to recognize the idiomatic force and
                    rapidity of movement characteristic of the style of Plautus. There is also found
                    that love of alliteration which is a marked feature in all the older Latin poets
                    down even to Lucretius. In one considerable comic fragment attributed to
                    him,—the description of a coquette,— there is great truth and shrewdness of
                    observation. But we find <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n174/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0174-0163"/> no trace of the exuberant comic power and
                    geniality of his great contemporary. His critical spirit and vehement temper
                    declare his affinity rather to Lucilius than to Plautus.</p>
                <p>He was not only the oldest native dramatist, but the first author of an epic
                    poem,—which, by combining the representation of actual contemporary history with
                    a mythical background, may be said to have created the Roman type of epic
                    poetry. The poem as he gave it to the world was one continuous work, and was
                    divided into seven books by a grammarian of a later age. The earlier part of it
                    treated of the mythical adventures of Aeneas in Sicily, Carthage, and Italy, and
                    borrowed from the interview of Zeus and Thetis in the first book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> the idea of the interview of Jupiter and Venus, which
                    Virgil has made one of the cardinal passages in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeneid.</hi> The later part of the poem treated of the events of the First
                    Punic War in the style of a mètrical chronicle. The few remaining fragments
                    produce the impression of vivid and rapid narrative, to which the flow of the
                    native Saturnian verse, in contradistinction to the weighty and complex
                    structure of the hexameter, was naturally adapted. Mommsen has noticed that in
                    these fragments the story is told in the present tense. The disparaging
                    criticism of Ennius—</p>
                <p>“Scripsere alii rem</p>
                <p>Versibu’ quos olim Fauni vatesque canebant, &lt;fcc.”— applies to the rudeness of
                    the verse, not to the spirit or substance of the work. Cicero speaks of it as
                    giving pleasure, like a statue of Myron, and the grudging admission of
                    Horace—</p>
                <p>“Naevius in manibus non est et mentibus haeret Paene recens ”—</p>
                <p>attests the fresh pleasure with which it still could be read in the Augustan
                    age.</p>
                <p>The impression we get of the man is that, whether or not he actually enjoyed the
                    full rights of Roman citizenship, he was a vigorous representative of the bold
                    combative spirit of the ancient Roman commons,—of the political not, like
                    Plautus, of the bourgeois type of the Roman plebeian. Energy of character and
                    vitality of temperament are shown by the prolonged continuation of his career as
                    a writer, notwithstanding the discouragement of his imprisonment, and, what was
                    a greater trial than temporary imprisonment, his exile. The chief service which
                    he rendered to Roman letters was that he was one of those who made the Latin
                    language into a great organ of literature, and that with the new formative
                    energy which he applied to it he transmitted the force of the best popular
                    speech of his time. The phrases still quoted from him have nothing of an
                    antiquated sound, while they have a genuinely idiomatic ring. As a dramatist he
                    worked more in the spirit of Plautus than of Ennius, Pacuvius, Accius, or
                    Terence; but the great Umbrian humorist is separated from his older
                    contemporary, not only by his breadth of comic power, but by his general
                    attitude of moral and political indifference. The power of Naevius was the more
                    genuine Italian gift—the power of satiric criticism—the “Italum acetum” which
                    was employed in making men ridiculous, not, like that of Plautus, in extracting
                    amusement from the humours, follies, and eccentricities of lifa. His more truly
                    creative faculty seems to have shown itself, not only in rapid and animated
                    narrative, but in pregnant invention which still lives in literature, owing to
                    the recognition of its value by the receptive and reproductive genius of Virgil.
                    Although our means of forming a fair estimate of Naevius are more scanty than in
                    the case of the otheι ’ makers of Roman literature whose work is only known to
                    us in fragments, yet all that we do know of him leads to the conclusion that he
                    was far from being the least among them, and that with the loss of his writings
                    there was lost a vein of national feeling and genius which reappears rarely in
                    the writings of the later republican and the imperial times—the vein which
                    probably was predominant in Cato, which may still be traced in the fragments of
                    Lucilius and in the personal and political lampoons of Catullus, and may be
