                <p>THE authenticated history of newspapers begins in Germany. The earliest plainly
                    <hi rend="italic">periodical</hi> collection of the “news of the day,” as
                    distinguished from the isolated news-pamphlets (of which there is at least one
                    example of as early a date as 1498, and in Germany alone about eight hundred
                    examples, all dating before 1610, still to be found in existing libraries), is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Frankfurter Journal,</hi> a weekly publication started by
                    Egenolph Emmel in 1615. Antwerp follows, with its <hi rend="italic">Nieuwe
                    Tijdinghen</hi> of 1616. Six years later came the establishment in London, by
                    Nathaniel Butter and his partners, of a like paper, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Weekly News.</hi> All of these were the enterprises of
                    “stationers,” undertaken in the ordinary way of their trade, and hawked about
                    the streets by itinerating “mercuries.” The foundation in Paris, in 1631, of a
                    journal which eventually attained fame as the <hi rend="italic">Gazette de
                    France,</hi> and which still exists, had a very different origin and different
                    aims. The scheme of Théophraste Renaudot, a busy projector, unconnected with
                    trade, who in certain points of his character and talent may be described as a
                    born publicist, it appeared under the patronage of Richelieu, in the shape and
                    with the limitations which it pleased the chief statesman of the day to mark out
                    for it.</p>
                <p>The history of the “leading article,” as a great factor in the shaping of public
                    opinion, begins with Swift, Defoe, Bolingbroke, and Pulteney, in the many
                    newspapers, from <hi rend="italic">The Review</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Examiner</hi> to <hi rend="italic">The Craftsman,</hi> by which was waged the
                    keen political strife of the years 1704-40. There is no counterpart to it in
                    France until the Revolution of 1789, nor in Germany until 1796 or 1798. It was a
                    Frenchman who wrote—“Suffer yourself to be blamed, imprisoned, condemned; suffer
                    yourself even to be hanged; but publish your opinions. It is not a right; it is
                    a duty.” It was in England that the course so pithily described was actually
                    taken, in the face of fine, imprisonment, and pillory, at a time when in France
                    the public had to depend upon foreign journals illicitly circulated, when its
                    own chief -writers resorted to clandestine presses, to paltry disguises, and to
                    very poor subterfuges to escape the responsibilities of avowed authorship, and
                    when in Germany there was no political publicity worthy to be named.</p>
                <p>When the <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France,</hi> after a long period of
                    mediocrity, came into the hands of men of large intellectual faculty, 'they had
                    the most cogent reasons for exerting their powers upon topics of literature
                    rather than upon themes of politics. True political journalism dates only from
                    the Revolution, and it then had a very brief existence. It occupied a cluster of
                    writers, some of whom have left an enduring mark upon French literature. A term
                    of high aspiration was followed quickly by a much longer term of frantic licence
                    and of literary infamy. Then came the long rule of a despotic censorship; and
                    cycles of licence followed by cycles of repression have revolved, with varying
                    periodicity, from that day to this. Germany has to some extent its parallelisms;
                    but German journalism, if it never soared so high, never sank so low. Journalism
                    in Germany has made steady advances onward; and in one grand feature—that of
                    far-gathered information from foreign countries, not merely of incidents, but of
                    the growth of opinion and the state of social life— the leading newspapers of
                    Germany keep much ahead of their best French contemporaries. In France, too
                    often, the journals that gain the largest circulation are precisely those of
                    most conspicuous frivolity. Sometimes they are much worse than frivolous. In
                    1871 newspapers issued from Parisian presses which were as base and as brutal as
                    those of 1794. In 1870 the democratic Government at Bordeaux issued against
                    journals of high aims and of unspotted integrity, but opposed to its
                    pretensions, edicts as arbitrary as the worst acts in that kind of Napoleon I.,
                    and unparalleled in the whole course of the government of Napoleon III.</p>
                <p>In all the other countries of Europe political journalism, in any characteristic
                    sense, is a thing of the present century, —somewhat earlier in the century in
                    northern Europe, somewhat later in southern. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ordinarie</hi><hi rend="italic">Post-Tidende</hi> of Stockholm dates indeed
                    from 1643, but until very recent times it was a mere news-letter. Denmark had no
                    sort of journal worth remark until the foundation, in 1749, of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Berlingske Tidende,</hi> and that too attained to no political
                    rank. The <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> of St Petersburg—the patriarch of
                    Russian newspapers—dates from 16th December 1702, is a Government organ, and
                    nearly synchronizes with the first successful attempt at a newspaper in the
                    British colonies in America. But the <hi rend="italic">Boston Gazette</hi> was,
                    in its degree, a better journal in the last century than the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wiedomosti</hi> now.</p>
                <p>Journalism in Italy begins with the <hi rend="italic">Diario</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">di Roma</hi> in 1716, but in politics the press remained a
                    nullity—for all practical purposes—until nearly the middle of the present
                    century, when the newspapers of Sardinia, at the impulse of Cavour, began to
                    foreshadow the approach of the influential Italian press of the present day. In
                    Spain no rudiments of a newspaper press can be found until the last century. As
                    late as in 1826 an inquisitive American traveller records his inability to lay
                    his hands, during his Peninsular, tour, upon more than two Spanish,
                    newspapers.</p>
                <p>It may be useful to bring these chronological notes of the origin of journalism
                    into view, at a. glance, conjointly with the dates of some of the chief existing
                    journals of Europe, by tabulating them thus :—</p>

                <p>The development of the modern newspaper is due to a union of causes that may well
                    be termed marvellous. A machine that from a web of paper 3 or 4 miles long can,
                    in one hour, print, fold, cut, and deliver 24,000 or 25,000 perfected
                    broadsheets is after all not so great a marvel as is the organizing skill which
                    centralizes in a London office telegraphic communications from every important
                    town in Europe, Asia, America, and Australia, and which then (whilst
                    re-transmitting thither the news of London) distributes those
                    communications—directly or indirectly—to thousands of recipients simultaneously,
                    by day and by night, throughout all Britain. And but for unusual mental gifts,
                    conjoined with high culture and with great “staying-power,” in the editorial
                    rooms, all these marvels of ingenuity—which now combine to develop public
                    opinion on great public interests, and to guide it—would be nothing better than
                    a vast mechanism for making money out of man’s natural aptitude to spend his
                    time either in telling or in hearing some new thing.</p>
                <p>Julius Reuter’s enterprise grew immediately out of the thoughts of an observant
                    Prussian Government-messenger on the extraordinary excitement of this natural
                    aptitude which he witnessed as caused by the revolutionary movements of 1848. In
                    1849 he established a news-transmitting agency in Paris, with all the appliances
                    that were then available. Between Brussels and Aix-la-Chapelle he formed a
                    pigeon-service, connecting it with Paris and with Berlin by telegraph. As the
                    wires extended, he quickly followed them with agency-offices in many parts of
                    the Continent. When he came to London, his progress was for a moment held in
                    check. The editor of <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> listened very courteously
                    to his proposals, but (on that first occasion) ended their interview by saying,
                    “We generally find that we can do our own business better than anybody else
                    can.” He went to the office of <hi rend="italic">The Morning Advertiser,</hi>
                    which had then the next largest circulation to that of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Times,</hi> and had better success.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mr James Grant has put on record, word for word, the curious
                    conversation that occurred <hi rend="italic">{Hist, of Newspaper Press,</hi> ii.
                    323 <hi rend="italic">sq. ).</hi></p></note> He entered into an agreement with
                    that and afterwards with other London journals, including <hi rend="italic">The
                    Times,</hi> and also with many commercial corporations and firms.</p>
                <p>The newspapers, of course, continued to employ their own wires and to extend
                    them, but they found great advantage in the use of Reuter’s telegrams as
                    supplementary. His enterprise grew apace. Within a few years it is said to have
                    yielded the founder some £25,000 a year. In 1865 it was transferred to a limited
                    company. In 1868 the London Press Association was formed. It contracted with
                    Reuter’s company to supply their telegrams exclusively throughout the United
                    Kingdom, London only excepted. The cost yearly to those newspaper proprietors
                    who are members of the association is £294, to nonmembers £323. In connexion
                    with the intelligence department of the post-office, the Press Association
                    supplies parliamentary, juridical, and market news. The office of the
                    Association is kept open during twenty-one hours of the twenty-four. The
                    enterprise was organized by Mr John Lovell, now editor of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Liverpool Mercury.</hi> London has now at least nine other press and telegraphic
                    associations; Paris probably has almost as many.</p>
                <p>The Newspapers of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>The first English journalists were the writers of “newsletters,” originally the
                    dependants of great men, each employed in keeping his own master or patron
                    well-informed, during his absence from court, of all that transpired there. The
                    duty grew at length into a calling. The writer had his periodical subscription
                    list, and instead of writing a single letter wrote as many letters as he had
                    customers. Then one more enterprising than the rest established an “intelligence
                    office,” with a staff of clerks, such as Ben Jonson’s Cymbal depicts from the
                    life in <hi rend="italic">The Staple of News,</hi> acted in 1625 :—</p>
                <p>“This is the outer room where my clerks sit, And keep their sides, the register
                    in the midst; The examiner, he sits private there within;</p>
                <p>And here I have my several rolls and files Of news by the alphabet, and all put
                    up Under their heads.”</p>
                <p>Of the earlier news-letters good examples may be seen in Sir John Fenn’s
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">Poston Letters,</hi> and in Arthur Collins’s <hi

                    and in other well-known books. Still later examples, and such as have a very
                    high historical interest, may be seen in abundance amongst the papers collected
                    by the historian Thomas Carte, now preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
                    Of these, several series were addressed to the first duke of Ormond, partly by
                    correspondents in England and Ireland, partly by correspondents in Paris; others
                    were addressed to successive earls of Huntingdon; others, again, to various
                    members of the family of Wharton. And like valuable collections are to be seen
                    in the library of the British Museum, and in the English Public Record Office.
                    In Edinburgh, the Advocates’ Library possesses a series of the 16th century,
                    written by Richard Scudamore to Sir Philip Hoby during his embassy to
                    Vienna.</p>
                <p>The MS. news-letters—some of them proceeding from writers of marked ability who
                    had access to official information, and were able to write with greater freedom
                    and independence of tone than the compilers of the printed news—held their
                    ground, although within narrowing limits, until nearly the middle of the last
                    century. Some of the collections of these “gazettes à-la-main” have for the
                    historian a greater value than any existing printed series of a contemporary
                    gazetteer.</p>
                <p>By the pains and critical acumen of the late Mr Thomas Watts, of the British
                    Museum, the obstinate fiction that “for the first printed newspaper mankind are
                    indebted to the wisdom of Elizabeth and the prudence of Burghley” is at length
                    gradually disappearing from current literature, although the old story of the

                <p>Although no genuine newspaper of the 16 th century can be produced, English
                    pamphlets, as well as French, Italian, and German, occur with such titles as <hi

                    17th century they became very numerous. In 1614 we find Burton (the author of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy)</hi> pointing a sarcasm against the
                    non-reading habits of “the major part” by adding, “if they read a book at any
                    time . . . ’tis an English chronicle, Sir Huon of Bordeaux, Amadis de Gaul,
                    &lt;fcc., a play-book, or <hi rend="italic">some pamphlet of news.”</hi> The
                    most eminent purveyors of reading of this sort were Nathaniel Butter, Nicholas
                    Bourne, and Thomas Archer; and by them was issued, in May 1622, the first

                    Archer.” Nathaniel Butter’s name does not occur on this number, but on many
                    subsequent numbers it appears in connexion sometimes with Bourne’s and sometimes
                    with Archer’s name; so that there was probably an eventual partnership in the
                    new undertaking. Butter had published <hi rend="italic">Newes from Spaine</hi>
                    in 1611, and he continued to be a publisher of news until 1641, if not

                    August 1622, the publisher inserted this advertisement :— “If any gentleman or
                    other accustomed to buy the weekly relations of newes be desirous to continue
                    the same, let them know that the writer, or transcriber rather, of this newes
                    hath published two former newes; the one dated the second, the other the

                    November 1641 is especially noticeable for the publication, in the form of a
                    newspaper, of the earliest authentic report of the proceedings of parliament.
                    <hi rend="italic">Diurnal Occurrences, or the Heads of several Proceedings in
                    both Houses of Parliament,</hi> was usually, notwithstanding its title, a weekly
                    periodical, and it sometimes contained ordinary news in addition to its staple
                    matter. This was followed, within five years, by a long train of newspapers,
                    most of which were published weekly. Those which stand out most saliently from
                    the rest are the <hi rend="italic">Mercurius Britannicus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">Pragmaticus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Μ.

                    Aulicus</hi> of John Birkenhead. Nedham was perhaps both the ablest and the
                    readiest man that had yet tried his hand at a newspaper. He commenced the <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">Britannicus</hi> on August 22, 1643,
                    zealously advocated in it the cause of the Parliament, and continued its
                    publication until 1647. At that period he changed sides, and began to write <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus,</hi></p>
                <p>“which, being very witty, satirical against the Presbyterians, and full of
                    loyalty, made him known to, and admired by, the bravadoes and wits of those
                    times. . . . At length . . . Lenthall and Bradshaw . . . persuaded him to change
                    his style once more [in favour of] the Independents, then carrying all before
                    them. So that, being bought over, he wrote <hi rend="italic">Mercurius
                    Politicus,</hi> so extreme contrary to the former that the generality for a long
                    time . . . could not believe that that ‘ intelligence ’ could possibly be
                    written by the same hand that wrote the <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi

                    into all parts of the nation for more than ten years, had very great influence.
                    . . . He was then [after a fourth ‘change of style’] the Goliath of the
                    Philistines, the great champion of the late usurper, whose pen, in comparison of
                    others, was like a weaver’s beam.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Birkenhead’s <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">Aulicus</hi> was also
                    begun in 1643, and continued, although irregularly, until nearly the close of
                    the civil war. According to Wood, Charles I. “appointed him to write the <hi

                    party, His Majesty recommended him to the [university] electors that they would
                    choose him moral philosophy reader,” which was done accordingly. He was assisted
                    in the composition of <hi rend="italic">Aulicus</hi> by George Lord Digby
                    (secretary of state, and afterwards earl of Bristol) and by Dr Peter Heylin. Sir
                    John Birkenhead had considerable powers of satire, after a coarse fashion, and
                    was one of the few rough-weather royalists who were permitted to bask in the
                    sunshine of the Restoration.</p>

                    the first number appeared on the 8th October 1655). These publications were
                    issued on different days of the week, and at length they became conjointly the

                    origin they were in some degree official papers. In 1659 the council of state
                    caused the following announcement to be published :—“Whereas Marchmont Nedham,

                    him was also conferred, by royal grant —and, as it proved, for only a short

                    treasonable schismatical and scandalous books and papers.” L’Estrange continued
                    the papers above mentioned, but changed their titles to <hi rend="italic">The

                    found his own sources of information much abridged. To his application for

                    consuls abroad, in which he says, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> The writer of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> has represented that the reputation of that
                    paper is greatly lessened, and the sale diminished, from the small portion of
                    foreign news with which it is supplied.” He desires that each of them will send
                    regularly all such articles of foreign intelligence as may appear proper for
                    that paper, “taking particular care,—as the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> is
                    the only paper of authority printed in this country,—never to send anything
                    concerning the authenticity of which there is the smallest doubt.” From such
                    humble beginnings has arisen the great repertory of State Papers, now so
                    valuable to the writers and to the students of English history. It has appeared
                    twice a week, in a continuous series, for nearly two hundred and twenty
                    years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A complete set

                <p>In November 1675 L’Estrange—not yet tired of journalism—commenced <hi

                <p>The very day after the departure of James II. was marked by the appearance of
                    three newspapers— <hi rend="italic">The Universal Intelligence, The
                    English</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    London</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant.</hi> Within a few days more these were
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">The London Mercury, The Orange Gazette, The London
                    Intelligence, The Harlem Currant,</hi> and others. The Licensing Act, which was
                    in force at the date of the Revolution, expired in 1692, but was continued for a
                    year, after which it finally ceased. On the appearance of a paragraph in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Flying Post</hi> of 1st April 1697, which appeared to the
                    House of Commons to attack the credit of the Exchequer Bills, leave was given to
                    bring in a Bill “to prevent the writing, printing, or publishing of any news
                    without licence ”; but the Bill was thrown out in an early stage of its
                    progress. That <hi rend="italic">Flying Post</hi> which gave occasion to this
                    attempt ‘was also noticeable for a new method of printing, which it thus
                    announced to its customers,—“If any gentleman has a mind to oblige his country
                    friend or correspondent with this account of public affairs, he can have it for
                    twopence . . . . on a sheet of fine paper, half of which being left blank, he
                    may thereon write his own affairs, <hi rend="italic">or the material news of the
                    day.”</hi></p>
                <p>In 1696 Edward Lloyd—the virtual founder of the world-famous “Lloyd’s” of
                    commerce—started a thrice-a-week paper, <hi rend="italic">Lloyds News,</hi>
                    which had but a brief existence in its first shape, but was the precursor of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lloyds List</hi> of the present day. No. 76 of the original
                    paper contained a paragraph referring to the House of Lords, for the appearance
                    of which a public apology must, the publisher was told, be made. He preferred to
                    discontinue his publication (February 1697). Nearly thirty years afterwards he
                    in part revived it, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Lloyds List,—</hi>
                    published at first weekly, afterwards twice a week.<note anchored="true"

                    published daily.</p>
                <p>It was in the reign of Queen Anne that the newspaper press first became really
                    eminent for the amount of intellectual power and of versatile talent which was
                    employed upon it. It was also in that reign that the press was first fettered by
                    the newspaper stamp. The accession of Anne was quickly followed by the
                    appearance of the first successful London daily newspaper, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Daily</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> (1703). Seven years earlier, in 1695,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Postboy</hi> had been started as a daily paper, but only
                    four numbers appeared. The <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> was published and
                    edited by the well-known and learned printer Samuel Buckley, who explained to
                    the public that “the author has taken care to be duly furnished with all that
                    comes from abroad, in any language. .... At the beginning of each article he
                    will quote the foreign paper from which it is taken, that the public, seeing
                    from what country a piece of news comes, with the allowance of that Government,
                    may be better able to judge of the credibility and fairness of the relation. Nor
                    will he take upon himself to give any comments, . . . . supposing other people
                    to have sense enough to make reflexions for themselves.” Then came, in rapid
                    succession, a crowd of new competitors for public favour, of less frequent
                    publication. The first number of one of these, <hi rend="italic">The Country
                    Gentleman's</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> (1706), was given away
                    gratuitously, and made a special claim to public favour on the ground that “here
                    the reader is not only diverted with a faithful register of the most remarkable
                    and momentary <hi rend="italic">[i.e.,</hi> momentous] transactions at home and
                    abroad, . . . . but also with a geographical description of the most material
                    places mentioned in every article of news, whereby he is freed the trouble of
                    looking into maps.”</p>
                <p>On tie 19th of February 1704, whilst still imprisoned in Newgate for a political
                    offence, Defoe began his famous paper <hi rend="italic">The Review</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Defoe).</hi> At the outset it was published weekly, afterwards
                    twice, and at length three times a week. It continued substantially in its first
                    form until July 29, 1712; and a complete set is of extreme rarity. From the
                    first page to the last it is characterized by the manly boldness and persistent
                    tenacity with which the almost unaided author utters and defends his opinions on
                    public affairs against a host of able and bitter assailants. Some of the numbers
                    were written during travel, some in Edinburgh. But <hi rend="italic">The
                    Review</hi> appeared regularly. When interrupted by the pressure of the Stamp
                    Act, the writer modified the form of his paper, and began a new series (August
                    2, 1712, to June 11, 1713). In those early and monthly supplements of his paper
                    which he entitled “Advice from the Scandalous Club,” and set apart for the
                    discussion of questions of literature and manners, and sometimes of topics of a
                    graver kind, Defoe to some extent anticipated the <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Spectator.</hi> In 1705 he severed those supplements from
                    his chief newspaper, and published them twice a week as <hi rend="italic">The
                    Little Review.</hi> But they soon ceased to appear. Not again to revert to Defoe

                    May 1716 he began a new monthly paper under an old title, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercurius</hi><hi rend="italic">Politicos,</hi>.... “by a lover of old
                    England.” This journal continued to appear until September 1720.</p>
                <p>The year 1710 was marked by the appearance of <hi rend="italic">The Examiner, or
                    Remarks upon Papers and Occurrences</hi> (No. 1, August 3), of which thirteen
                    numbers appeared by the co-operation of Bolingbroke, Prior, Freind, and King
                    before it was placed under the sole control of Swift. <hi rend="italic">The Whig
                    Examiner,</hi> avowedly intended “to censure the writings of others, and to give
                    all persons a rehearing who had suffered under any unjust sentence of <hi

                <p>This increasing popularity and influence of the newspaper press could not fail to
                    be distasteful to the Government of the day. Prosecutions were multiplied, but
                    with small success. At length some busy projector hit upon the expedient of a
                    newspaper tax. The paper which seems to contain the first germ of the plan is
                    still preserved amongst the Treasury papers. It is anonymous and undated, but
                    probably belongs to the year 1711. “There are published weekly,” says the
                    writer, “about 44,000 newspapers, viz., <hi rend="italic">Daily</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Courant,</hi><hi rend="italic">London Post, English Post, London

                <p>The duty eventually imposed was a halfpenny on papers of half a sheet or less,
                    and a penny on such as ranged from half a sheet to a single sheet (10 Anne, c.
                    xix. § 101), and it came into force on the 19th July 1712. The first results of
                    the tax cannot be more succinctly or more vividly described than in the
                    following characteristic passage of the <hi rend="italic">Journal to Stella</hi>
                    (August 7, 1712): “Do you know that Grub Street is dead and gone last week? No
                    more ghosts or murders now for love or money. I plied it close the last
                    fortnight, and published at least seven papers of my own, besides some of other
                    people’s; but now every single half-sheet pays a halfpenny to the queen. The <hi

                    rend="italic">Methinks the stamping is worth a halfpenny.”</hi></p>
                <p>Swift’s doubt as to the ability of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> to hold
                    out against the tax was justified by its discontinuance in the following year.
                    But the impost which was thus fruitful in mischief, by suppressing much good
                    literature, wholly failed in keeping out bad. Some of the worst journals that
                    were already in existence kept their ground, and the number of such ere long
                    increased.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the

                    rend="italic">Public Advertiser.</hi> Part of this increase may fairly be
                    ascribed to political corruption. In 1742 the committee of the House of Commons
                    appointed to inquire into the political conduct of the earl of Orford reported
                    to the House that during the last ten years of the Walpole ministry there was
                    paid, out of public money, no “less a sum than £50,077, 18s. to authors and
                    printers of newspapers, such as the <hi rend="italic">Free Briton, Daily</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Courant,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gazetteer,</hi> and other political

                    >Parliamentary History,</hi> xii. 814.</p></note> But some part of the payment
                    may well have been made for advertisements. Towards the middle of the century
                    the provisions and the penalties of the Stamp Act were made more stringent. Yet
                    the number of newspapers continued to rise. Johnson, writing in 1758, bears
                    testimony to the still growing thirst for news: “Journals are daily multiplied,
                    without increase of knowledge. The tale of the morning paper is told in the
                    evening, and the narratives of the evening are bought again in the morning.
                    These repetitions, indeed, waste time, but they do not shorten it. The most
                    eager peruser of news is tired before he has completed his labour; and many a
                    man who enters the coffee-house in his nightgown and slippers is called away to
                    his shop or his dinner before he has well considered the state of Europe.” Five
                    years before this remark appeared in <hi rend="italic">The Idler</hi> the
                    aggregate number of copies of newspapers annually sold in England, on an average
                    of three years, amounted to 7,411,757. In 1760 it had risen to 9,464,790, and in
                    1767 to 11,300,980. In 1776 the number of newspapers published in London alone
                    had increased to fifty-three.</p>
                <p>When Johnson wrote his sarcastic strictures on the newspapers that were the
                    contemporaries and, in a sense, the rivals of <hi rend="italic">The Idler,</hi>
                    the newswriters had fallen below the standard of an earlier day. A generation
                    before, the newspaper was often much more of a political organ than of an
                    industrial venture. All of the many enterprises of Defoe in this field of
                    journalism united indeed both characteristics. But if he was a keen tradesman,
                    he was also a passionate politician. And not a few of his fellowworkers in that
                    field were conspicuous as statesmen no less than as journalists. Even less than
                    twenty years before the appearance of Johnson’s remarks, men of the mental
                    calibre of Henry Fielding were still to be found amongst the editors and writers
                    of newspapers. The task had fallen to a different class of men in 1750.</p>
                <p>The history of newspapers during the long reign of George III. is a history of
                    criminal prosecutions, in which individual writers and editors were repeatedly
                    defeated and severely punished, whilst the press itself derived new strength
                    from the protracted conflict, and turned ignominious penalties into signal
                    triumphs. From the days of <hi rend="italic">The North Briton</hi> to those of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Examiner,</hi> every conspicuous newspaper prosecution
                    gave tenfold currency to the doctrines that were assailed. In the earlier part
                    of this period men who were mere traders in politics—whose motives were
                    obviously base and their lives contemptible— became for a time powers in the
                    state, able to brave king, legislature, and law courts, by virtue of the simple
                    truth that a free people must have a free press. Yet the policy that had failed
                    in 1763 continued to be clung to in 1819.</p>
                <p>One of the minor incidents of the <hi rend="italic">North Briton</hi> excitement
                    led indirectly to valuable results with reference to the much-vexed question of
                    parliamentary reporting. During the discussions respecting the Middlesex
                    election, Almon, a bookseller, collected from members of the House of Commons
                    some particulars of the debates, and published them in <hi rend="italic">The
                    London Evening Post.</hi> The success which attended these reports induced the
                    proprietors of <hi rend="italic">The .St James's Chronicle</hi> to employ a
                    reporter to collect notes in the lobby and at the coffee-houses. This repeated
                    infraction of the privilege of secret legislation led to the memorable<pb

                    their fierce debates, angry resolutions, and arbitrary imprisonments,—all
                    resulting, at length, in that tacit concession of publicity of discussion which
                    in the main, with brief occasional exceptions, has ever since prevailed.</p>
                <p>The three metropolitan newspapers which at different periods of this reign stood
                    pre-eminent amongst their competitors were <hi rend="italic">The, Public
                    Advertiser, The Morning Post,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Morning
                    Chronicle.</hi> The first-named paper owed much of its popularity to the letters
                    of Junius. The <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> were mainly indebted for their success to the personal qualities
                    of individual editors, combined, in both cases, although in very different
                    degree, with a staff of writers endowed with exceptional literary power and
                    marked versatility of talents. The <hi rend="italic">Public Advertiser</hi> was
                    first published in 1726, under the title <hi rend="italic">London Daily Post and
                    General Advertiser.</hi> In 1738 the first part of the title was dropped, and in
                    1752 <hi rend="italic">General Advertiser</hi> was altered into the name which
                    the letters of Junius made so famous. Many of these had appeared before the
                    smallest perceptible effect was produced on the circulation of the paper; but
                    when the “Letter to the King” came out (19th December 1769, almost a year from
                    the beginning of the series) it caused an addition of 1750 copies to the
                    ordinary impression. The effect of subsequent letters was variable; but when
                    Junius ceased to write the monthly sale of the paper had risen to 83,950. This
                    was in December 1771. Seven years earlier the monthly sale had been but
                    47,515.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These are the
                    figures of Mr W. S. Woodfall, the editor.</p></note> It now became so valuable a
                    property that shares in it were sold, according to John Nichols, “as regularly
                    as those of the New River Company.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Century.</hi></p></note> But the fortunes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Advertiser</hi> declined almost as rapidly as they had risen. It continued to
                    appear until 1798, and then seems to have been amalgamated with the commercial
                    paper called <hi rend="italic">The Public Ledger</hi> (dating from 1759), which
                    still exists as a London daily journal. Actions for libel were brought against
                    the paper by Edmund Burke in 1784, and by William Pitt in 1785, and in both
                    suits damages were given. <hi rend="italic">The Morning Chronicle</hi> was begun
                    in 1769. William Woodfall was its printer, reporter, and editor, and continued
                    to conduct it until 1789. James Perry succeeded him as editor, and so continued,
                    with an interval during which the editorship was in the hands of the late Mr
                    Sergeant Spankie, until his death in 1821. Perry’s editorial functions were
                    occasionally discharged in Newgate in consequence of repeated prosecutions for
                    political libel. In 1819 the daily sale reached nearly 4000. It was sold in 1823
                    to Mr Clement, the purchase-money amounting to £42,000. Mr Clement held it for
                    about eleven years, and then sold it to Sir John Easthope for £16,000. It was
                    then, and until 1843, edited by John Black, who numbered amongst his staff
                    Albany Fonblanque, Charles Dickens, and John Payne Collier. The paper continued
                    to be distinguished by much literary ability, but not by commercial prosperity.
                    In 1849 it became the joint property of the duke of Newcastle, Mr Gladstone, and
                    some of their political friends; and by them, in 1854, it was sold,
                    conditionally, to Mr Serjeant Glover, under whose management it became
                    eventually the subject of a memorable public scandal in the law courts of
                    France. At length the affairs of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> were wound
                    up in the Bankruptcy Court of London, after an existence of more than ninety
                    years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Morning Post</hi> dates from 1772. For some years it was in
                    the hands of Henry Bate (afterwards known as Sir Henry Bate Dudley), and it
                    attained some degree of temporary popularity, though of no very enviable sort.
                    In 1795 the entire copyright, with house and printing materials, was sold for
                    £600 to Peter and Daniel Stuart, who quickly raised the position of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Post</hi> by enlisting Mackintosh and Coleridge in its service,
                    and also by giving unremitting attention to advertisements and to the copious
                    supply of incidental news and amusing paragraphs. There has been much
                    controversy about the share which Coleridge had in elevating the <hi
                    rend="italic">Post</hi> from obscurity to eminence. That he greatly promoted
                    this result there can be no doubt. His famous “Character of Pitt,” published in
                    1800, was especially successful, and created a demand for the particular number
                    in which it appeared that lasted for weeks, a thing almost without precedent.
                    Coleridge wrote for this paper from 1795 until 1802, and during that period its
                    circulation in ordinary rose from 350 copies, on the average, to 4500. Whatever
                    the amount of rhetorical hyperbole in Fox’s saying,—recorded as spoken in the
                    House of Commons,—“Mr Coleridge’s essays in <hi rend="italic">The Morning
                    Post</hi> led to the rupture of the treaty of Amiens,” it is none the less a
                    striking testimony, not only to Coleridge’s powers as a publicist, but to the
                    position which the newspaper press had won, in spite of innumerable obstacles,
                    eighty years ago. The list of his fellow-workers in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Post</hi> is a most brilliant and varied one. Besides Mackintosh, Southey, and
                    Arthur Young, it included a galaxy of poets. Many of the lyrics of Moore, many
                    of the social verses of Mackworth Praed, some of the noblest sonnets of
                    Wordsworth, were first published in the columns of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Post.</hi> And the story of the paper, in its early days, had tragic as well as
                    poetic episodes. In consequence of offence taken at some of its articles, the
                    editor and proprietor, Nicholas Byrne (who succeeded Daniel Stuart), was
                    assaulted and murdered whilst sitting in his office. In later days, but long
                    prior to those of the submarine cable, the <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> for a
                    time eclipsed most of its rivals by means of the skilful organization which
                    Lieutenant Waghorn—the pioneer of the overland route to India— gave to its
                    agencies for foreign intelligence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> is usually dated from the 1st of January 1788,
                    but was really commenced on the 18th January 1785, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">The London Daily Universal Register, printed logographically.</hi>
                    This “word-printing” process had been invented by a printer named Henry Johnson
                    several years before, and found a warm advocate in John Walter, who expounded
                    its peculiarities at great length in No. 510 of his <hi rend="italic">Daily
                    Universal Register.</hi> In a later number he stated, very amusingly, his
                    reasons for adopting that altered title which the enterprise and the ability of
                    his successors have made world-famous.</p>
                <p>Within two years Walter had his share in the Georgian persecutions of the press,
                    by successive sentences to three fines and to three several imprisonments in
                    Newgate, chiefly for having stated that the prince of Wales and the dukes of
                    York and Clarence had so misconducted themselves “as to incur the just
                    disapprobation of his Majesty.” In 1803 he transferred the management (together
                    with the joint proprietorship) of the journal to his son, by whom it was carried
                    on with remarkable energy and consummate tact. To Lord Sidmouth’s Government he
                    gave a general but independent support. That of Pitt he opposed, especially on
                    the questions of the Catamaran expedition and the malversations of Lord
                    Melville. This opposition was resented by depriving the elder Walter of the
                    printing for the customs department, by the withdrawal of Government
                    advertisements from <hi rend="italic">The Times,</hi> and also, it is said, by
                    the systematic detention at the outports of the foreign intelligence addressed
                    to its editor. Walter, however, was strong and resolute enough to brave the
                    Government. He organized a better system of news transmission than had ever
                    before existed. He introduced steam-printing, and repeatedly improved its
                    mechanism; and, although machines <pb break="no"

                    seem to thrust into insignificance a press of which it was at first announced as
                    a notable triumph that the new machine performed its task “with such a velocity
                    and simultaneousness of movement that no less than 1100 sheets are impressed in
                    one hour,” yet Walter’s assertion was none the less true, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >The</hi><hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of 29th November 1814 “presented to the
                    public the practical result of the greatest improvement connected with printing
                    since the discovery of the art itself.”</p>
                <p>The effort to secure for <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> the best attainable
                    literary talent in all departments kept at least an equal pace with those which
                    were directed towards the improvement of its mechanical resources. And thus it
                    came to pass that a circulation which did not, even in 1815, exceed on the
                    average 5000 copies became, in 1834, 10,000; in 1844, 23,000; in 1851, 40,000;
                    and in 1854, 51,648. In the year last named the average circulation of the other
                    London dailies was— <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser,</hi> 7644; <hi

                <p>Sir John Stoddart, afterwards governor of Malta, edited <hi rend="italic">The
                    Times</hi> for several years prior to 1816. He was succeeded by Thomas Barnes,
                    under whose management the great journal became famous for munificent reward of
                    every kind of efficient service. The energy shown of late in the use of the
                    railway and the telegraphic cable is no more marvellous than was the bringing of
                    important news to London in 1834, at the rate of 15 miles an hour, for 400
                    miles. Unlike his most distinguished successor in the editorship, Barnes for
                    many years wrote largely in his paper. When his health began to fail the largest
                    share of the editorial work came into the hands of Captain Edward Sterling,—the
                    contributor about a quarter of a century earlier of a noteworthy series of
                    political letters signed “Vetus,” the Paris correspondent of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Times</hi> in 1814 and subsequent eventful years, and afterwards for many
                    years the most conspicuous among its leader-writers.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Life of John
                    Sterling,</hi> by Carlyle, who says of him at this time —“The emphatic,

                    >Times</hi> newspaper was the express emblem of Edward Sterling. He, more than
                    any other man, . . . was <hi rend="italic">The Times,</hi> and thundered through
                    it, to the shaking of the spheres.”</p></note> From 1841 to 1877 the chief
                    editor was John Thaddeus Delane. It is known, on the best authority, that “he
                    never was a writer; he never even attempted to write anything, except what he
                    wrote better than most writers could do—reports and letters.”<note

                    sense, a wonderful life’s work was crowded into those six and thirty years. The
                    result of that labour, cβmbined with the labour of a most brilliant staff of
                    contributors, was to make what already had grown to be the “favourite
                    broadsheet” of the English public into that which is now wont to be described as
                    the “leading journal of the world.” Everything that is used in the production of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Times,</hi> except the printing paper, is made in its
                    offices. Not only its own “Walter machines” —able to print and perfect from
                    22,000 to 24,000 sheets in the hour—but those also which have been supplied to
                    <hi rend="italic">The Scotsman, The Daily News, The Liverpool Post,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> have been manufactured there. The editor’s
                    office in Printing-House Square is now in direct communication by special wires
                    with his branch offices both in Paris and in Berlin. The parliamentary reports
                    are sent to the office from the Houses through the telephone. The shorthand
                    writer extends his notes in the usual way, and reads off the manuscript through
                    the instrument. The recipient dictates the reports to the type setters. The
                    manuscript follows the telephonic report, and the proofs are read by it. These
                    several mechanical triumphs, in their varied stages of development, must have
                    occasioned a preliminary outlay of at least £ 100,000. And that such
                    experiments, on any like scale, became possible is due to the growth of
                    advertisements. Of these, the first number of <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>
                    contained fifty-seven, all brief ones. In recent days a number of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Times</hi> has occasionally contained sixty columns—in one
                    instance, at least, sixtyseven—of advertisements. The rates of charge vary, but
                    upon a rough average it seems probable that the annual revenue from this source
                    alone may considerably exceed £400,000. With such a fund in reserve—apart from
                    the direct product by sale—it becomes easy to understand the otherwise amazing
                    items of outlay known to have been incurred for telegrams, as, for instance, of
                    £800 for reports of the results of the congress of Berlin, when <hi
                    rend="italic">The Times</hi> achieved the publication of the treaty almost at
                    the instant of its signature. What the sale of the paper was upon that occasion
                    is not publicly recorded. But when, in December 1861, it published a memoir of
                    the lamented Prince Consort, 91,000 copies were sold. On occasion of the

                <p>Of the many curious episodical incidents which occur in the public history of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Times,</hi> one only can here be mentioned. In 1840 the Paris
                    correspondent of the paper (Mr O’Reilly) obtained information respecting a
                    gigantic scheme of forgery which had been planned in France, together with
                    particulars of the examination at Antwerp of a minor agent in the conspiracy,
                    who had been there, almost by chance, arrested. All that he could collect on the
                    subject, including the names of the chief conspirators, was published by <hi
                    rend="italic">The Times</hi> on the 26th of May in that year, under the heading
                    “Extraordinary and Extensive Forgery and Swindling Conspiracy on the Continent
                    (Private Correspondence).” The project contemplated the almost simultaneous
                    presentation at the chief banking-houses throughout the Continent of forged
                    letters of credit, purporting to be those of Glyn &amp; Company, to a very large
                    amount; and its failure appears to have been in a great degree owing to the
                    exertions made, and the responsibility assumed, by <hi rend="italic">The
                    Times.</hi> One of the persons implicated brought an action for libel against
                    the printer, which was tried at Croydon in August 1841, with a verdict for the
                    plaintiff, <hi rend="italic">one farthing damages.</hi> A subscription towards
                    defraying the heavy expenses (amounting to more than £5000) which <hi
                    rend="italic">The Times</hi> had incurred was speedily opened, but the
                    proprietors declined to profit by it; and the sum which had been raised was
                    devoted to the foundation of two <hi rend="italic">“Times</hi> scholarships,” in
                    connexion with Christ’s Hospital and the City of London School. Three years
                    afterwards <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> rendered noble public service in a
                    different direction. It used its vast power with vigour—at the expense of
                    materially checking the growth of its own advertisement fund—by denouncing the
                    fraudulent schemes which underlay the “railway mania” of 1845.</p>
                <p>For a long period after the establishment of <hi rend="italic">The Times,</hi> no
                    effort to found a new daily London morning newspaper was ever conspicuously
                    successful. As time went on, many endeavours were made, at an aggregate cost, as

                    there are to be set but three successful ones,—disregarding papers of a strictly

                    a large society of licensed victuallers, amongst whom subscription to the paper
                    was the condition of membership. For nearly sixty years its circulation lay
                    almost entirely in public-houses and coffee-houses, but amongst them it sold
                    nearly 5000 copies daily, and it yielded a steady profit of about £6000 a year.
                    Then, by the ability and enterprise of an experienced editor (James Grant), it
                    was within four years raised^ to a circulation of nearly 8000, and to an
                    aggregate profit of £12,000 a year.</p>
                <p>Setting aside mere class-journals like <hi rend="italic">The Financier</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Sportsman,</hi> the only existing London morning
                    newspapers which have been founded during the present century are <hi

                    (2 9th June 1857). The lowest of the three in the point of circulation has
                    attained an average issue of 170,000 copies; the highest has reached (by
                    notarial certificate) to an average of about 242,000. In 1856 no London
                    newspaper of any kind was recorded to have reached a higher average circulation
                    than 109,106 copies (attained in 1854 by the weekly <hi rend="italic">News of
                    the World);</hi> no daily newspaper had exceeded an average of 51,648 copies

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Daily News</hi> became a penny paper in 1868. The great
                    stride in its circulation did not come until 1870, when lavish use of the
                    electric telegraph, combined with the great powers of a brilliant war
                    correspondent, are said to have lifted the sale in a week from 50,000 copies to
                    150,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hatton, <hi

                <p>Originally an evening paper, established in 1827 as the express organ of the
                    opponents of the measure for the removal of the Roman Catholic disabilities, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Standard</hi> was at first edited by Dr Gifford. From the
                    beginning it showed marked literary ability, but its commercial success was
                    small. When sold to James Johnson its fortunes rapidly improved. He made it both
                    a morning and evening journal, reduced its price to a penny, and gave it a
                    thoroughly good organization. Occasionally, in 1870, the evening sale reached
                    100,000 copies. In 1882 the aggregate circulation, morning and evening, was
                    certified to average 242,062 copies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Daily Telegraph</hi> was originally founded by Colonel
                    Sleigh, and for a few and unprosperous years was edited by Henry Barnett. It
                    attained no success until a change of ownership placed it under the editorial
                    care of Edward Lawson. In 1882 its certified average daily circulation exceeded
                    241,900 copies.</p>
                <p>London possessed no daily evening paper until 1788, nor did any evening paper
                    attain an important position until the period of the war with Napoleon, when <hi
                    rend="italic">The Courier</hi> (established in 1792) became the newspaper of the
                    day. For a few years its circulation exceeded that of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Times.</hi> The average amounted during the last three years of the war to
                    10,000 copies daily, a circulation not till then known to have been attained by
                    any daily paper. Mackintosh, Coleridge, and Wordsworth were amongst its stated
                    contributors. Out of an article in <hi rend="italic">The Courier,</hi> from the
                    pen of the last-named, grew the famous pamphlet on the convention of Cintra.
                    Among the successive editors of <hi rend="italic">The Courier</hi> were Daniel
                    Stuart, William Mudford, Eugenius Roche, John Galt, James Stuart, and Laman
                    Blanchard. In 1827 one twenty-fourth share in the property is said to have
                    brought 5000 guineas. But changes of editorship and keen competition were fatal
                    to a paper that had rendered brilliant public service in its day, and for a time
                    had headed the newspaper press of London.</p>
                <p>The metropolis has now seven evening papers, one of which— <hi rend="italic">The
                    Shipping and Mercantile Gazette—</hi> is exclusively commercial. Whilst, of the
                    distinctively political morning journals, four are Liberal and only two
                    Conservative, of the six political evening ones, four are Conservative <hi

                <p>The London weekly press has always worn a motley garb. Weekly publication
                    facilitates the individuality of ajournai, both as respects its editorship and
                    as respects the class of readers to which it more especially addresses itself.
                    From the days of Daniel Defoe to those of Albany Fonblanque and Robert Rintoul
                    there have always been newspapers bearing the unmistakable impress of an
                    individual and powerful mind. When to great force of character in the writer and
                    its natural result, an almost personal intimacy between writer and reader,
                    Governments have been unwise enough to add the strength which inevitably grows
                    out of persecution, the combination might well prove a formidable one. Cobbett’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Weekly Register</hi> affords perhaps as striking an
                    illustration of journalism in its greatness and in its meanness as could be
                    found throughout its entire annals. And Cobbett’s paper has had many successors,
                    some of which, profiting by the marvellous mechanical appliances of thθ present
                    day, have attained a far wider popular influence than was possessed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Weekly Register</hi> in its most prosperous days.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Observer</hi> dates from 1792, and was conducted by one
                    editor— Mr Doxat—for more than fifty years. It early distanced its competitors;
                    its expenditure was lavish, and its profits large. There is record that the
                    issue of <hi rend="italic">The Observer</hi> which contained a report of the
                    coronation of George IV. (published in two parts, each of them with a fourpenny
                    stamp) attained a circulation of 60,000 copies, and that there was paid to the
                    Government for that week’s issue about £2000 of stamp duty.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The late well-known <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> was founded in 1808, and had
                    a career as one of the most prominent organs of the Liberals of nearly seventy
                    years. That its literary reputation was great resulted naturally from a
                    succession of such editors as Leigh Hunt, Albany Fonblanque, John Forster, and
                    Professor Henry Morley. It had in its later days a distinguished competitor in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> founded (July 1828) and for more than
                    thirty years edited by Robert Rintoul.</p>
                <p>Strikingly in contrast with newspapers of this class stand two which have much in
                    common besides their identity of title and their extraordinary circulation— <hi
                    rend="italic">Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Reynolds's
                    Weekly Newspaper.</hi> The former started as an unstamped illustrated journal at
                    a penny in September 1842. In 1843 it was enlarged in size, and the price raised
                    to threepence. Curious ingenuity was shown in advertising it by all sorts of
                    expedients. Amongst others, all the pennies its proprietor could lay his hands
                    on were embossed, by a cleverly constructed machine, with the title and price of
                    the new journal. <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> soon drew attention to this
                    defacement of the queen’s coin, and so gave a better advertisement still. From a
                    weekly sale of 33,000 in 1848 it rose to 170,000 in 1861. In anticipation of the
                    abolition of the paper duty, the price was then reduced to a penny. The
                    circulation became 347,000 in 1863; in 1865 it rose to 412,080. The skill of the
                    American machine-makers was now put to a test which produced for this paper
                    Hoe’s first great web-machine,—adopted immediately afterwards by <hi

                    In 1879 the weekly sale of <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Newspaper</hi> was
                    certified to average 612,902 copies. <hi rend="italic">Reynolds’s Weekly

                    the oldest, and has the largest circulation (about 95,000). Besides its
                    pictorial merits, it has long been notable for its obituary notices and its
                    abstracts of wills. It was founded in May 1842. <hi rend="italic">The

                <p>Nearly thirty years ago (in 1855) the total number of London daily newspapers was
                    15; it is still (in 1883) only 18. The total number of London newspapers of all
                    kinds increased from 89 in 1855 to 386 in 1883. In 1855 the total number of
                    provincial newspapers published throughout the United Kingdom was 560; in 1883
                    it was 1576. The whole number of daily newspapers in the provinces at the former
                    date was but 13; at the latter it was 162. This vast growth is due in the main
                    to altered legislation rather than to altered economic conditions. Some account
                    must now be given of the Government restrictions on the British newspaper press,
                    commencing with the Stamp Act of 1712.</p>
                <p>In 1756 an additional halfpenny was added to the tax of 1712. In 1765 and in 1773
                    various restrictive regulations were imposed (5 Geo. III. c. 46, and 13 Geo.
                    III. c. 65). In 1789 the three-halfpence was increased to twopence (29 Geo. III.
                    c. 50), in 1797 to twopence-halfpenny (37 Geo. III. c. 90), in 1804 to three-
                    {&gt;ence-halfpenny (44 Geo. III. c. 98), and in 1815 to fourpence, ess a
                    discount of 20 per cent. Penalties of all kinds were also increased, and
                    obstructive regulations were multiplied. In the course of the struggle between
                    this constantly enhanced taxation and the irrepressible desire for cheap
                    newspapers, more than seven hundred prosecutions for publishing unstamped
                    journals were instituted, and more than five hundred persons were imprisoned,
                    sometimes for considerable periods. As the prosecutions multiplied and the
                    penalties became more severe, <hi rend="italic">Poor Man’s Guardians, Democrats,
                    Destructives,</hi> and their congeners multiplied also, and their revolutionary
                    tendencies increased in a still greater ratio. Blasphemy was added to sedition.
                    Penny and halfpenny journals were established which dealt exclusively with
                    narratives of gross vice and crime, and which vied with each other in every kind
                    of artifice to make vice and crime attractive. Between the years 1831 and 1835
                    many scores of unstamped newspapers made their appearance. Papers such as those
                    enumerated above swarmed from presses that seemed to rival, in their mysterious
                    itinerancy and sudden vanish-ings, the famous Marprelate press of the 16th
                    century. The political tone of most of them was fiercely revolutionary.
                    Prosecution followed prosecution; but all failed to suppress the obnoxious
                    publications.</p>
                <p>To the late Lord Lytton is due the credit of grappling with this question in the
                    House of Commons in a manner which secured the speedy reduction of the tax from
                    fourpence to a penny, and paved the way for its subsequent though long-delayed
                    abolition. The reduction to a penny took effect on the 15th September 1836. At
                    that date the number of newspapers stamped in Great Britain and Ireland was
                    about 36,000,000 in the year, and the gross amount of duty upwards of £553,000.
                    Of this sum English newspapers paid £473,910, Scottish newspapers £47,999, Irish
                    newspapers £31,287. In the year ending 9th January 1838—the first complete year
                    of the reduced duty—the number of stamps issued was 53,897,926. The gross amount
                    of duty was reduced to£223,425&lt; (English, £182,998; Scottish, £18,671; Irish,
                    £21,756).</p>
                <p>The results of the reduction surpassed all that had been predicted by its
                    promoters. Yet the total abolition came only in 1855. la the year ending 5th
                    January 1855 the number of penny stamps issued to newspapers was 107,052,053,
                    and the gross amount of duty £446,050. The details are as follows :—</p>

                <p>The measure for the final abolition of the stamp tax was substantially prepared
                    by Mr Gladstone during his chancellorship of tho exchequer in 1854, but was
                    introduced into the House of Commons by his successor in 1855. The second
                    reading was carried by a majority of 215 to 161. In the House of Lords no
                    division took place. To enable the reader to appreciate the legislation of June-
                    1855, we give here the aggregate circulation of newspapers, as shown by the
                    number of stamps issued and as compared with the growth of population, at
                    various periods during the century preceding the abolition of the stamp duty,
                    and also the figures for the first year after the abolition took effect.</p>

                <p>It will be observed that for several years in the earlier part of this century
                    the aggregate circulation remained very steady—almost -stationary—at about
                    24,000,000 copies, and that, after a gradual increase within a few years to
                    30,000,000, the political excitements of the y ears 1830-32 raised the aggregate
                    to very nearly 38,000,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The figures in the table are from the parliamentary returns. Mr Hrant <hi
                    rend="italic">(History of the Newspaper Press,</hi> vol. ii. p. 321) states the
                    circulation for 1831 at 38,649,314 copies, founding upon figures quoted in the
                    House of Commons in 1864 by Mr Edward Baines.</p></note> Making allowance for
                    the mere trade-lists, this number came to be more than tripled in 1854.</p>
                <p>The number of newspapers established from the early part of 1855, when the repeal
                    of the duty had become a certainty, and continuing in existence at the beginning
                    of 1857, amounted to 107, 80 started in 1855, and 27 in 1856; 26 were
                    metropolitan, and SI provincial. Of the latter, the majority belonged to towns
                    which possessed no newspaper whatever under the Stamp Acts, and the price of
                    nearly one-third of them was but a penny. In some cases, however, a portion of
                    these new cheap papers of 1857 was printed in London, usually with pictorial
                    illustrations, and to this was added a local supplement containing the news of
                    the district.</p>
                <p>The total number of the newspapers published throughout the United Kingdom at the
                    beginning of 1857 was 711. They may be classified as follows :—</p>

                <p>The decrease in the number of newspapers which passed through the post-office in
                    the year 1855 (during exactly one-half of which the compulsory stamp had been
                    abolished) amounted to about onefourth of the aggregate number which had been
                    posted in the preceding year. During the six months of the optional stamp the
                    money received for impressed stamps was about £93,000, and that for postage
                    stamps affixed on newspapers about £25,000. In the year 1856 the number of
                    newspapers which passed through the post-office was nearly 71,000,000,—about
                    three-fourths bearing the impressed stamp and one-fourth franked by the ordinary
                    postage stamps. The total gross revenue was therefore about £295,833. Prior to
                    the abolition of the compulsory stamp the average weight cf the newspapers
                    passing through the post-office was three ounces and a half; in 1857 the average
                    weight fell to about two ounces and three quarters. The reduction was due to the
                    increase of the small and cheap papers. It was understood that <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Times,</hi> at that date, stamped about 40 per cent, of its entire
                    impression, the daily average of which then exceeded 60,000.</p>
                <p>Amongst the earliest results of the change in newspaper law made in 1855 was the
                    establishment in quick succession of a series of penny metropolitan local
                    papers, chiefly suburban, of a kind very different from their unstamped
                    forerunners. They spread rapidly, and attained considerable success, chiefly as
                    advertising sheets, and as sometimes the organs, more often the critics, of the
                    local vestries and other administrations. There are now (1883) 128 of these
                    local papers. One of them, <hi rend="italic">The Clerkenwell News and Daily
                    Chronicle,</hi> so prospered in the commercial sense, being crowded with
                    advertisements, that it sold for £30,000, and was then transformed into the <hi
                    rend="italic">London Daily Chronicle</hi> (28th May 1877). In the hands of its
                    new owner—the proprietor of <hi rend="italic">Lloyd’s Weekly News—</hi> its
                    circulation increased fivefold within a year. Another conspicuous result of the
                    legislation of 1855 was an enormous increase in the number and influence of what
                    are known as “class papers,” and as professional and trade papers.</p>
                <p>The history of the provincial press of England begins with the year 1690, and
                    with a weekly newspaper which still exists, <hi rend="italic">The Worcester
                    Postman,</hi> now known as <hi rend="italic">Berrow's Worcester Journal.</hi>
                    But the real development of provincial journalism, as a power coordinate with
                    that of London, dates only from 1855; although there were many newspapers
                    issuing from country presses here and there —at least from the later years of
                    thelastcentury—which were marked by originality of character and by considerable
                    literary skill. Worcester has now four weekly and two dailynewspapers. Stamford
                    followed next after Worcester by the establishment of its <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercury</hi> in 1695. This also is still published under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Lincoln, Rutland, and Stamford Mercury.</hi> Next to <hi
                    rend="italic">The Stamford Mercury</hi> came <hi rend="italic">The Norwich
                    Postman,</hi> first published in 1706 in small quarto, and of meagre contents.
                    The stated price of this paper was a penny, but its proprietor notified to the
                    public that “a halfpenny is not refused.” Two other papers were started in
                    Norwich within a few years afterwards,— <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Courant</hi> in 1712, and <hi rend="italic">The Weekly Mercury or
                    Protestant's Packet</hi> (which still exists) in 1720. Norwich has now seven
                    other weekly and, in addition, two daily papers. Nottingham follows in 1710 with
                    its <hi rend="italic">Courant,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">The Nottingham
                    Journal,</hi> and a daily paper. Nottingham has now in all four daily and three
                    weekly ^newspapers. <hi rend="italic">The Newcastle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Courant</hi> followed in 1711; Newcastle has now five weekly and five daily
                    journals. <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> continues to
                    be the farmers’ paper of the north; for almost a hundred and eighty years it has
                    had but seven successive proprietors; in politics it is independent. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Daily Journal</hi> is an organ of the Conservative party,
                    dating as a weekly paper from 1832, as a daily one from 1861. <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Chronicle</hi> holds a like position on the Liberal side. <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Liverpool</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> dates from May 1712. It lasted
                    a very short time, and had no successor until May 1756, when <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Liverpool Advertiser</hi> appeared; <hi rend="italic">Gore's General
                    Advertiser</hi> followed in 1765, and continued until 1870. Liverpool has now
                    (1883) eight daily and five weekly journals. There are, besides, commercial
                    gazettes and a <hi rend="italic">European Times</hi> published irregularly. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Hereford Journal</hi> dates from 1713, is of Conservative
                    politics, and is noted for its fulness of local reports. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Hereford Times</hi> was established in 1832, and claims to be “the largest
                    newspaper in the world,” containing regularly 112 columns, with frequent
                    supplements. Its merits are such that it holds its ground at the price of 3⅛d.
                    against a competitor at 2d. and two at Id. The four papers of Hereford are all
                    weekly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Salisbury Postman</hi> was the first newspaper started in
                    that city. It appeared in 1715, and its first number was the earliest first
                    number of a provincial newspaper that the researches of the committee of the
                    Caxton Centenary of 1877 enabled them to exhibit at South Kensington. It was
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">The Salisbury Journal</hi> of 1729, which
                    continues to appear. Bristol journalism began with <hi rend="italic">Felix
                    Farley’s Journal</hi> in 1715, which merged into <hi rend="italic">The Bristol
                    Times</hi> (1735), and both were conjoined with <hi rend="italic">The Bristol
                    Mirror</hi> (weekly from 1773) to form <hi rend="italic">The Daily Bristol Times
                    and Mirror</hi> of January 1865. In journalism as in much else Bristol contrasts
                    curiously with its northern rival. Liverpool had no really established newspaper
                    until 1756. It now (in 1883) publishes seventeen papers (reckoning those which
                    are printed to accompany the outgoing mails), while Bristol has only seven,
                    including the little visitors’ paper of Clifton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Kentish Gazette</hi> dates from 1717, but was first
                    published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Kentish Post.</hi> Canterbury has
                    now seven papers, one of which appears twice a week; the others are of weekly
                    issue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Leeds Mercury was</hi> established in 1718, and, for the
                    purpose of evading the Stamp Act, was made to extend to twelve pages small
                    quarto (or a sheet and a half,—the stamp being then levied only on papers not
                    exceeding a single sheet). Like its contemporaries it was published weekly, and
                    its price was three-halfpence. In 1729 it was reduced to four pages of larger
                    size, and sold, with a stamp, at twopence. From 1755 to 1766 its publication was
                    suspended, but was resumed in January 1767, under the management of James
                    Bowley, who continued to conduct it for twenty-seven years, and raised it to a
                    circulation of 3000. Its price at this time was fourpence. The increase of the
                    stamp duty in 1797 altered its price to sixpence, and the circulation sank from
                    3000 to 800. It was purchased in 1801 by Edward Baines, who first began the
                    insertion of “leaders.” It took him three years to obtain a circulation of 1500;
                    but the <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> afterwards made rapid progress, and

                    as a weekly paper. Leeds has now four dailies and six weeklies.</p>
                <p>Journalism in Exeter began in the same year as in Leeds, and, somewhat
                    singularly, with three newspapers, all of which in the first year of existence
                    became the subject of debate in parliament. The western capital was then
                    fiercely political. Its journals took the freedom of commenting on proceedings
                    in parliament, and the three editors—those of <hi rend="italic">The Exeter

                <p>The following year (1719) saw the beginnings of journalism in Manchester,
                    originating with <hi rend="italic">The Manchester Weekly Journal. The Manchester
                    Gazette</hi> followed in 1730, and lasted until 1760. Then, in 1762, came Joseph
                    Harrop’s <hi rend="italic">Manchester Mercury,</hi> which had a stormy life, but
                    continued to appear until 1830. In 1867 Manchester had three daily papers and
                    four weekly ones; now it has six dailies (two Conservative, two Liberal, and two
                    neutral) and seven weeklies.</p>
                <p>The earliest of the Birmingham newspapers dates from 1741, when <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aris’s Gazette</hi> (still in course of publication) began its career. It seems
                    to have had no competitor, of any lengthened existence, until the establishment

                    neutral, four Liberal, two Conservative.</p>
                <p>The newspapers of Cambridge begin with the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of
                    1744, still extant. The Radical <hi rend="italic">Intelligencer</hi> of the
                    later years of the last century, conducted by Benjamin Flower, and notable in
                    the history of press prosecutions, is said to have been the first provincial
                    paper in England for which original leading articles on the political topics of
                    the day were written. But it would need a far-reaching examination of scattered
                    collections and files of newspapers preserved in editorial offices—the
                    collection, large as it is, in the British Museum is quite inadequate to the
                    inquiry—to warrant any absolute assertion on that point. Cambridge has now three
                    weekly newspapers (one Liberal, one Conservative, one neutral), exclusive of
                    those university organs which appear only during term. Oxford journalism begins,
                    strictly speaking, with <hi rend="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</hi><note

                    sixty, in 1883 seventy-five. Of these eleven are printed in Welsh; one of them,
                    <hi rend="italic">Y</hi><hi rend="italic">Lian a'r Dywysogaeth</hi> describes
                    itself as “the only” church and state Welsh newspaper. Of the English-printed
                    papers, thirteen are described as Conservative, twenty-seven as Liberal, the
                    remainder as being either “neutral” or “independent” in respect of politics.</p>

                    >Scottish Journal of Topography,</hi> vol. ii. p. 303, it is mentioned as an

                    >The Gazette</hi> was transferred to John Reid, by whose family it long
                    continued to be printed. In February 1705 Watson started <hi rend="italic">The
                    Edinburgh</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant,</hi> of which he only published
                    fifty-five numbers. He states it to be his plan to give “most of the remarkable
                    foreign news from their prints, and also the home news from the ports of this
                    kingdom, .... now altogether neglected.” The <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi>
                    appeared thrice a week. Upon complaint being made to the privy council
                    concerning an advertisement inserted after the transfer of the paper to Adam
                    Boig, the new printer presented a supplication to the council in which he
                    expressed his willingness “that in all time coming no inland news or
                    advertisements shall be put into the <hi rend="italic">Courant,</hi> but at the
                    sight and allowance of the clerks of council.” In 1710 the town council
                    authorized Mr Daniel Defoe to print <hi rend="italic">The Edinburgh</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Courant</hi> in the place of the deceased Adam Boig. Four years
                    earlier the indefatigable pioneer of the Scottish press, James Watson, had begun
                    the <hi rend="italic">Scots</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant,</hi> which he
                    continued to print until after the year 1718. To these papers were added in
                    October 1708 <hi rend="italic">The Edinburgh Flying Post</hi> and in August 1709
                    <hi rend="italic">The Scots Postman.</hi> Five years later this paper appears to
                    have been incorporated with <hi rend="italic">The Edinburgh Gazette,</hi> and
                    the publication appeared twice a week, as it still continues to do in 1883, as
                    the Government gazette for Scotland. <hi rend="italic">The Caledonian
                    Mercury</hi> began April 28, 1720. At one period it was published thrice and
                    afterwards twice a week. Its first proprietor was William Rolland, an advocate,
                    and its first editor Thomas Ruddiman. The property passed to Ruddiman on
                    Rolland’s death in 1729, and remained in his family until 1772. It is curious to
                    notice that in his initiatory number of April 1720, Rolland claimed a right to
                    identify his <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> with that of 1660. This journal, he
                    said in his preface to the public, “is the oldest [existing] in Great Britain.”
                    And his successor of the year 1860 followed suit by celebrating the “second
                    centenary” of <hi rend="italic">The Caledonian Mercury.</hi> He brought out a

                    was the first of Scottish journals to give conspicuous place to literature—
                    foreign as well as Scottish. In “the ’45” one of its editors, Thomas Ruddiman,

                    sent to London. In 1780 David Ramsay became its proprietor. Under his management
                    it is said to have attained the largest Scottish circulation of its day. It was
                    then of neutral politics. Of late years, returning to its original title, and
                    appearing as a daily morning paper, it has ranked as the senior organ of the
                    Conservative party in Scotland.</p>

                    many characteristic articles. Ballantyne edited it until his death in 1833, and
                    was succeeded in the editorship by Thomas Moir. The paper was discontinued about
                    1840.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Scotsman</hi> was established as a twice-a-week paper in
                    January 1817, and became a daily in June 1855. It has always ranked as the chief
                    organ of the Liberal, party in Scotland. The proprietorship continues to be in
                    the family of William Ritchie, by whom, in conjunction with Charles Maclaren,
                    the paper was founded. For a short period it was edited by J. R. M'Culloch, the
                    eminent political economist. He was succeeded by Maclaren, who edited the paper
                    until 1845, and he in turn by Alexander Russel, who continued to conduct it with
                    great ability until 1876. In 1854 its average circulation was 3451 copies. In
                    1859 the first of Hoe’s rotary machines brought into Scotland was erected for
                    <hi rend="italic">The Scotsman,</hi> and the productive power was raised from

                    paper appeared twice a week, and its editor, Hugh Miller, very soon made it
                    famous. In the course of less than sixteen years he wrote about a thousand
                    articles and papers, conspicuous for literary ability, still more so for a wide
                    range of acquirement and of original thought, most of all for deep
                    conscientiousness. It survived its first editor’s lamented death (1855) only a
                    few years. Edinburgh has now five daily and six weekly papers.</p>

                    specially famous for the organizing skill with which he brought his intelligence
                    at an unprecedented rate of speed from Carlisle, the nearest point then

                    industrial characteristics of journalism—they occupy at least an equal rank with
                    the best journals of the leading provincial towns of England, whilst the

                    editor was Dr Lucas. Flood and Grattan were at one time numbered amongst its
                    contributors; although the latter, at a subsequent period, is reported to have
                    exclaimed in his place in the Irish parliament, “the <hi rend="italic">Freeman’s

                    process for discovering the names of proprietors and publishers, but until the
                    year next following (1870) the establishment of a newspaper still required
                    compliance with most of the regulations of the 6 &amp; 7 Will. IV. c. 76. In
                    that year, by the Act 33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 32, the (until then optional) stamp
                    duties on newspapers were wholly repealed, and their postal transmission became
                    subject only to the regulations of the post-office. It is now subject, under the

                <p>Newspapers of France.</p>
                <p>The annals of French journalism begin with the <hi rend="italic">Gazette,</hi>
                    established by Théophraste Renaudot in 1631, under the patronage of Richelieu,
                    and with his active co-operation. Much of its earliest foreign news came direct
                    from the minister, and not seldom in his own hand. Louis XIII. took a keen,
                    perhaps a somewhat childish, interest in the progress of the infant <hi
                    rend="italic">Gazette,</hi> and was a frequent contributor, now and then taking
                    his little paragraphs to the printing office himself, and seeing them put into
                    type. Renaudot was born at Loudun in 1584, studied medicine in Paris and at
                    Montpellier, established himself in the capital in 1612, and soon became
                    conspicuous both within and beyond the limits of his profession. Endowed by
                    nature with great energy and versatility, he seems at an early period of his
                    career to have attracted the attention of the great cardinal, and to have
                    obtained permission to establish a sort of general agency office, under the
                    designation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0453-0424"/> of <hi rend="superscript"> tt</hi> Bureau d <hi
                    rend="subscript"> o</hi> ’ Adresses et de Rencontre.” An enterprise like this
                    would, perhaps, naturally suggest to such a mind as Renaudot’s the advantage of
                    following it up by the foundation of a newspaper. According to some French
                    writers, however, the project was formed by Pierre d’Hozier, the genealogist,
                    who carried on an extensive correspondence both at home and abroad, and was thus
                    in a position to give valuable help; according to others by Richelieu himself.
                    Be this as it may, Renaudot put his hand zealously to the work, and brought out
                    his first weekly number in May 1631. So much, at least, maybe inferred from the
                    date (4th July 1631) of the sixth number, which was the first <hi rend="italic"
                    >dated</hi> publication, the five preceding numbers being marked by “signatures”
                    only—A to E.∖ Each number consists of a single sheet (eight pages) in small
                    quarto, and is divided into two parts—the first simply entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Gazette,</hi> the second <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles
                    Ordinaires</hi><hi rend="italic">de Divers</hi><hi rend="italic">Endroits.</hi>
                    For this division the author assigns two reasons—(1) that two persons may thus
                    read his journal at the same time, and (2) that it facilitates a division of the
                    subject-matter—the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles</hi> containing usually
                    intelligence from the northern and western countries, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gazette</hi> from the southern and eastern. He commonly begins with foreign and
                    ends with home news, a method which was long and generally followed, and which
                    still obtains. Once a month he published a supplement, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Relation</hi><hi rend="italic">des Nouvelles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >du Monde,</hi><hi rend="italic">reçues dans</hi><hi rend="italic">tout</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">le mois.</hi> In October 1631 Renaudot obtained letters-patent to
                    himself and his heirs, conferring the exclusive privilege of printing and
                    selling, where and how they might please, “the gazettes, news, and narratives of
                    all that has passed or may pass within and without the kingdom.” His assailants
                    were numerous, but he steadily .pursued his course, and at his death in October
                    1653 left the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> to his sons in flourishing
                    circumstances. In 1752 the title <hi rend="italic">Gazette de France</hi> was
                    first used. Under this designation it continued to appear until the 24th August
                    1848. During the five days which followed that date it was suspended; on the
                    30th it was resumed as <hi rend="italic">Le Peuple Français,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Appel à la Nation,</hi> and again modified on the 14th September
                    to <hi rend="italic">L’Étoile</hi><hi rend="italic">de la France, Journal des
                    Droits de</hi><hi rend="italic">Tous.</hi> On the 25th October it became <hi
                    rend="italic">Gazette de France, Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Appel à</hi><hi rend="italic">la
                    Nation;</hi> and under this title it still continues to appear. A complete set
                    extends to upwards of 300 volumes, of which 189 are in quarto and the rest in
                    folio. It scarcely need be added that such a set forms a collection of great
                    value, not only for the history of France, but for that of Europe generally.</p>
                <p>Not the least curious nor the least instructive incident in the history of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gazette· de France—</hi> a history which abounds both with
                    curiosity and with instruction—is the endeavour which was made by a great French
                    minister, more than a hundred years ago, to make the envoys and consuls of
                    France at foreign courts official members of its literary staff, by calling on
                    them for periodical accounts of the progress of letters and science and of
                    literary and scientific institutions in the several countries to which they were
                    respectively accredited. The approach of 1789 obstructed the good effect of this
                    pregnant scheme.</p>
                <p>Loret’s rhymed <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> (1650 to March 1665) will always
                    have interest in the eyes of students who care less for the “dignity” of history
                    than for the fidelity of its local colouring and the animation of its
                    backgrounds. It were vain to look there for any deep appreciation of the events
                    of those stormy times. But it abounds in vivid portraits of the men and manners
                    of the day. It paints rudely, yet to the life, the Paris of the Fronde, with all
                    its effervescence and depression, its versatility and fickleness, its cowardice
                    and its courage.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Mercure Galant,</hi> established by Donneau de Visé in
                    1672, with Thomas Corneille for its sub-editor, it may be said that it sought to
                    combine the qualities of the <hi rend="italic">Gazettes,</hi> both grave and
                    gay. Like the former, it contained the permitted state news and court circulars
                    of the day. Like the latter, it amused its readers with satirical verses, and
                    with sketches of men and manners, which, if not always true, were at least well
                    invented. Reviews and sermons, law pleas and street airs, the last reception at
                    the Academy and the last new fashion of the milliners, all found their place. De
                    Visé carried on his enterprise for more than thirty years, and at his death it
                    was continued by Rivière du Fresny. The next editor, Lefèvre de Fontenay,
                    altered the title to <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Mercure,</hi> which in 1728 was
                    altered to <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France,</hi> a designation retained,
                    with slight modification, until 1853. The <hi rend="italic">Mercure</hi> passed
                    through many hands before it came into those of Panckoucke, at the eve of the
                    Revolution. Amongst its more conspicuous writers, immediately before this
                    change, had been Raynal and Marmontel. The latter, indeed, had for many years
                    been its principal editor, and in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> has left
                    us a very interesting record of the views and aims which governed him in the
                    performance of an arduous task. And he there narrates the curious fact that it
                    was Madame de Pompadour who contrived the plan of giving pensions to eminent men
                    of letters out of the profits of the <hi rend="italic">Mercure.</hi> To one of
                    Marmontel’s predecessors the “privilege,” or patent, had been worth more than
                    £1000 sterling annually. This revenue was now to be shared amongst several, and
                    to become a means of extending royal “patronage” of literature at a cheap rate.
                    It is to this pension-scheme, too, that we owe the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contes</hi><hi rend="italic">Moraux.</hi> Marmontel, who had long before lost
                    his “patent” by an act of high-minded generosity, continued to share in the
                    composition of the literary articles with Chamfort and La Harpe, whilst Mallet
                    du Pan, a far abler writer than either, became the most prominent of the
                    political writers in the <hi rend="italic">Mercure.</hi> In 1789 he contributed
                    a series of remarkable articles on the well-known book of De Lolme; and in the
                    same year he penned some comments on the “Declaration of the Rights of Man,”
                    very distasteful to violent men of all parties, but which forcibly illustrate
                    the pregnant truth they begin with:—“The gospel has given the simplest, the
                    shortest, and the most comprehensive ‘Declaration of the Rights of Man,’ in
                    saying, ‘ Do unto others as you would that they should do unto you.’ All
                    politics hinge upon this.”</p>
                <p>In 1790 the sale of the <hi rend="italic">Mercure</hi> rose very rapidly. It
                    attained for a time a circulation of 13,000 copies. Mirabeau styled it in debate
                    “the most able of the newspapers.” Great pains were taken for the collection of
                    statistics and state papers, the absence of which from the French newspaper
                    press had helped to depress its credit as compared with the political journalism
                    of England and to some extent of Germany. But, as the Revolution marched on
                    towards a destructive democracy, Mallet du Pan evinced more and more
                    unmistakably his rooted attachment to a constitutional monarchy. And, like so
                    many of his compatriots, he soon found the tide too strong for him. The
                    political part of the <hi rend="italic">Mercure</hi> changed hands, and after
                    the 10th August 1792 its publication was suspended.</p>
                <p>All this time the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gazette</hi><hi rend="italic">Nationale, ou le Moniteur Universel)</hi> was
                    under the same general management as the <hi rend="italic">Mercure</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Français</hi> (so the title had been altered in 1791). The first
                    idea, indeed, of this famous official journal appears to have been Panckoucke’s,
                    but it did not firmly establish itself until he had purchased the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Assemblée Nationale,</hi> and
                    so secured the best report of the debates. The <hi rend="italic">Moniteur,</hi>
                    however, kept step with the majority of the assembly, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercure</hi> with the minority. So marked a contrast between two journals, with
                    one proprietor<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n454/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0454-0425"/>, gave too favourable a leverage to the republican
                    wits not to be turned to good account. Camille Desmoulins depicted him as
                    Janus,—one face radiant at the blessings of coming liberty, the other plunged in
                    grief for the epoch that was rapidly disappearing.</p>
                <p>When resumed, after a very brief interval, the <hi rend="italic">Mercure</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Français</hi> became again <hi rend="italic">Mercure de
                    France,—</hi> its political importance diminished, whilst its literary worth was
                    enhanced. During the later days of the Revolution, and under the imperial rule,
                    its roll of contributors included the names of Geoffroy, Ginguené, Morellet,
                    Lacretelle, Fontanes, and Chateaubriand. The statesman last named brought upon
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mercure</hi> another temporary suppression in June 1807
                    (at which date he was its sole proprietor), by words in true unison with the
                    noblest deed of his chequered career—his retirement, namely, from the imperial
                    service on the day that the news of the execution of the duke of Enghien reached
                    him, being the day after he had been appointed by Napoleon a minister
                    plenipotentiary.</p>
                <p>Thus it chanced that alike under the brilliant despotism of Napoleon and under
                    the crapulous malversation of Louis XV. the management of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercure</hi> was revolutionized for protests which conferred honour upon the
                    journal no less than upon the individual writers who made them. Resumed by other
                    hands, the <hi rend="italic">Mercure</hi> continued to appear until January
                    1820, when it was again suspended. In the following year it reappeared as <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Mercure de France,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >au dix-neuvième siècle,</hi> and in February 1853 it finally ceased. A complete
                    set extends to no fewer than 1611 volumes.</p>
                <p>The only other newspaper of a date anterior to the Revolution which needs to be
                    noticed here is the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Paris,</hi> which was commenced
                    on New Year’s Day of 1777. It had but a feeble infancy, yet lived for half a
                    century. Its early volumes appear so insipid to a 19th-century reader that he
                    wonders what can have been the cause of its occasional bickerings with the
                    police. Its tameness, however, did not save it from sharing in the “suspensions”
                    of its predecessors. After the Revolution such men as Garat, Condorcet, and
                    Regnaud de St Jean d’Angély appear amongst its contributors, but those of
                    earlier date were obscure. Its period of highest prosperity may be dated about
                    1792, when its circulation is said to have exceeded 20,000.</p>
                <p>The police adventures of the writers of the MS. newsletters, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nouvelles à</hi><hi rend="italic">la Main,</hi> were still more numerous, and,
                    if we may judge from the copious specimens of these epistles which yet survive,
                    must also not unfrequently have arisen from lack of official employment, rather
                    than from substantial provocation. Madame Doublet de Persan, the widow of a
                    member of the French board of trade, was a conspicuous purveyor of news of this
                    sort. For nearly forty years daily meetings were held in her house at which the
                    gossip and table-talk of the town were systematically (and literally) <hi
                    rend="italic">registered·,</hi> and weekly abstracts or epitomes were sent into
                    the country by post. Piron, Mirabaud, Falconet, D’Argental, and, above all,
                    Bachaumont, were prominent members of the “society,” and each of them is said to
                    have had his assigned seat beneath his own portrait. The lady’s valet-de-chambre
                    appears to have been editor <hi rend="italic">ex officio·,</hi> and as he
                    occasionally suffered imprisonment, when offensive news-letters had been seized
                    by the police, so responsible a duty was doubtless “considered in the wages.”
                    News and anecdotes of all kinds—political and literary, grave, gay, or merely
                    scandalous—were all admitted into the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles à</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">la Main ∙,</hi> and their contents, during a long series of years,
                    form the staple of those <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The journalism of the first Revolution has been the theme of many bulky volumes,
                    and their number is still on the increase. The recital of the mere titles of the
                    newspapers which then appeared throughout France fills more than forty pages of
                    larger dimensions than those which the reader has now before him. It is obvious,
                    therefore, that a very casual glance at this part of our subject is all that can
                    be given to it here.</p>
                <p>When at least one half of the French people was in a ferment of hope or of fear
                    at the approaching convocation of the states-general, most of the existing
                    newspapers were still in a state of torpor. Long paragraphs, for example, about
                    a terrible “wild beast of the Gevaudan ”— whether wolf or bear, or as yet
                    nondescript, was uncertain —were still current in the Paris journals at this
                    momentous juncture. Mirabeau was among the foremost to supply the popular want.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Lettres à ses Commettants</hi> began on the 2d May 1789,
                    and with the twenty-first number became the <hi rend="italic">Courrier</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Provence.</hi> Within a week Maret (afterwards duke of Bassano)
                    followed with the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin des</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">des États Généraux.</hi> In June Brissot de Warville began his <hi
                    rend="italic">Patriote Français.</hi> Gorsas published the first number of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Courrier</hi><hi rend="italic">de Versailles</hi> in the
                    following month, from which also dates the famous periodical of Prudhomme,
                    Loustalot, and Tournon, entitled <hi rend="italic">Révolutions</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Paris,</hi> with its characteristic motto,—“Les grands ne nous
                    paraissent grands que parce que nous sommes à genoux; levons nous !” In August
                    1789 Baudouin began the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Débats</hi> (edited in
                    1792 by Louvet) and Marat the <hi rend="italic">Ami du Peuple</hi> (which at
                    first was called <hi rend="italic">Le Publiciste Parisien).</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Moniteur Universel</hi> (of which we have spoken already) was
                    first published on the 24th November, although numbers were afterwards printed
                    bearing date from the 5th May, the day on which the states-general first
                    assembled. Camille Desmoulins also commenced his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Révolutions</hi><hi rend="italic">de France</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Brabant</hi> in November 1789. The <hi rend="italic">Ami du
                    Roi</hi> was first published in June 1790, <hi rend="italic">La Quotidienne</hi>
                    in September 1792.</p>
                <p>Of all these prominent journals the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Débats</hi> alone have survived until now. A few of them lasted
                    until 1794 or 1795; one continued until recently; but most of them expired
                    either in the autumn of 1792 or with the fall of the party of the Gironde in
                    September 1793. In some of these papers the energy for good and for evil of a
                    whole lifetime seems to be compressed into the fugitive writings of a few
                    months. Even the satirical journals which combated the Revolution with shafts of
                    ridicule and wit, keen enough after their kind, but too light to do much damage
                    to men terribly in earnest, abound with matter well deserving the attention of
                    all students desirous of a thorough knowledge of the period.<note

                    period.</p></note></p>
                <p>The consular Government began its dealings with the press by reducing the number
                    of political papers to thirteen. At this period the number of daily journals had
                    been nineteen, and their aggregate provincial circulation, apart from the Paris
                    sale, 49,313, an average of 2600 each.</p>
                <p>Under Napoleon the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> was the only political paper
                    that was really regarded with an eye of favour. Even as respects the nation at
                    large, the monstrous excesses into which the Revolutionary press had plunged
                    left an enduring stigma on the class. When Bertin acquired the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Débats</hi> from Baudouin, the printer, for
                    20,000 francs, he had to vanquish popular indifference on <pb break="no"

                    other. The men he called to his aid were Geoffroy and Fievée; and by the
                    brilliancy of their talents and the keenness of his own judgment he converted
                    the <hi rend="italic">Débats</hi> into a paper having 32,000 subscribers, and
                    producing a profit of 200,000 francs a year. When the imposition of a special
                    censorship was threatened in 1805, at the instance of Fouché, a remarkable
                    correspondence took place between Fievée and Napoleon himself, in the course of
                    which the emperor wrote that the only means of preserving a newspaper from
                    suspension was “to avoid the publication of any news unfavourable to the
                    Government, until the truth of it is so well established that the publication
                    becomes needless.” The censorship was avoided, but Fievée had to become the
                    responsible editor, and the title was altered to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">VEmpire—</hi> the
                    imperial critic taking exception to the word <hi rend="italic">Débats</hi> as
                    “inconvenient.” The old title was resumed in August 1815. The revolution of July
                    did but enhance the power and the profit of the paper. It has held its course
                    with uniform dignity, as well as with splendid ability, amidst recent perils,
                    and may still be said, in the words which Lamartine applied to it in an earlier
                    day, to have “made itself part of French history.”</p>
                <p>Shortly before the <hi rend="italic">Journal de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Empire</hi> became again the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Débats</hi> (in 1815), a severance occurred amidst both the writers and
                    subscribers. It led to the foundation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Constitutionnel,</hi> which at first and for a short time bore the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">L’Indépendant.</hi> The former became, for a time, the organ of
                    the royalists <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> the latter the leader of

                    the day. At that date, in a secret report addressed to the ministry, the
                    aggregate circulation of the opposition press of Paris was stated at
                    41,330,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    press amounted only to 14,344.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The rapid rise of the <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi> was due partly to
                    the great ability and influence of Jay, of Étienne, of Béranger, and of Saint
                    Albin (who had been secretary to Carnot in his ministry of 1815), all of whom
                    co-operated in its early editorship, and partly to its sympathy with the popular
                    reverence for the memory of Napoleon, as well as to the vigorous share it took
                    in the famous literary quarrel between the classicists and romanticists
                    (although in that quarrel it took what may now be called the side of the
                    vanquished). Its part in bringing about the revolution of 1830 raised it to the
                    zenith of its fortunes. For a brief period it could boast of 23,000 subscribers
                    at 80 francs a year. But the invasion of cheap newspapers, and that temporary
                    lack of enterprise which so often follows a brilliant success, lowered it with
                    still greater rapidity. When the author of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires
                    d’un</hi><hi rend="italic">Bourgeois,</hi> Dr Véron, purchased it, the sale had
                    sunk to 3000. Véron gave 100,000 francs for the <hi rend="italic">Juif</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Errant</hi> of Sue, and the Sue fever rewarded him for a while
                    with more than the old circulation. Afterwards the paper passed under the
                    editorship of Césena, Granier de Cassagnac, and La Guéronnière.</p>
                <p>The cheap journalism of Paris began in 1836 (1st July) with the journal of
                    Girardin, <hi rend="italic">La Presse,</hi> followed instantly by <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Siècle,</hi> under the management of Dutacq, to whom, it is
                    said—not incredibly—the original idea was really due. The first-named journal
                    attained a circulation of 10,000 copies within three months of its commencement,
                    and soon doubled that number. The <hi rend="italic">Siècle</hi> prospered even
                    more strikingly, and in a few years had reached a circulation (then without
                    precedent in France) of 38,000 copies.</p>
                <p>The rapid growth of the newspaper press of Paris under Louis-Philippe will be
                    best appreciated from the fact that, while in 1828 the number of stamps issued
                    was 28 millions, in 1836, 1843, 1845, and 1846 the figures were 42, 61, 65, and
                    79 millions respectively. At the last-mentioned date the papers with a
                    circulation of upwards of 10,000 were (besides the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moniteur,</hi> of which the circulation was chiefly official and gratuitous) as
                    follows :— <hi rend="italic">Le Siècle,</hi> 31,000; <hi rend="italic">La
                    Presse</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Constitutionnel,</hi> between 20,000 and
                    25,000; <hi rend="italic">Journal des Débats</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >L’Epoque,</hi> between 10,000 and 15,000.</p>
                <p>If we now cast a retrospective glance at the general characteristics (1) of the
                    newspaper press of France, and (2) of the legislation concerning it, between the
                    respective periods of the devastating revolution of 1793-94 and the scarcely
                    less destructive revolution of 1848, it will be found that the years 1819, 1828,
                    1830 (July), and 1835 (September) mark epochs full of pregnant teaching upon our
                    subject. We pass over, as already sufficiently indicated, the newspaper licence
                    of the first-named years (1793-94), carried to a pitch which became a disgrace
                    to civilization, and the stern Napoleonic censorship which followed it,—also
                    carried to an excess, disgraceful, not, indeed, to civilization, but to the
                    splendid intellect which had once given utterance to the words, “Physical
                    discovery is a grand faculty of the human mind, but literature is the mind
                    itself.”</p>
                <p>The year 1819 is marked by a virtual cessation of the arbitrary power of
                    suppression lodged till then in the Government, and by the substitution of a
                    graduated system of preliminary bonds and suretyships (“cautionnements”) on the
                    one hand, and of strict penalties for convicted press-offences on the other.
                    This initiatory amelioration of 1819 became, in 1828, a measure of substantial
                    yet regulated freedom, which for two years worked, in the main, alike with
                    equity towards the just claims of journalism as a profession and with steady
                    development towards the public of its capabilities as a great factor in the
                    growth of civilization. Those two years were followed by a widely-contrasted
                    period of five years. That was a term of entire liberty often grossly abused,
                    and fitly ending with the just and necessary restrictions of September 1835. But
                    that period of 1830-35 was also signalized by some noble attempts to use the
                    powers of the newspaper press for promoting the highest and the enduring
                    interests of France. Not least memorable amongst these was the joint enterprise
                    of Montalembert and Lamennais— soon to be aided by Lacordaire,—when, by the
                    establishment (October 1830) of the newspaper <hi rend="italic">L'Avenir,</hi>
                    they claimed for the church of France ‘ ‘ her just part in the liberties
                    acquired by the country,” and asserted for the sacred symbols of Christianity
                    their lawful place, alike above the tricolor and above the lilies. “Dieu et la
                    liberté” was the motto which Montalembert chose for his newspaper, as he had
                    chosen it long before for the guiding star of his youthful aspirations. <hi
                    rend="italic">L'Avenir</hi> existed only for one year and one month. It came to
                    its early end from no lack of energy and patience in its writers, but in part
                    from that mission of the editors to Rome (November 1831) which, at least for a
                    time, necessitated the discontinuance of their newspaper. Human regrets had
                    higher than human consolations. ‘ ‘ Our labours” on <hi rend="italic">L'A
                    venir,</hi> wrote Montalem - bert, with simple truth, “decided the attitude of
                    Catholics in France and elsewhere, from the time of the July revolution to the
                    time of the second empire.”</p>
                <p>There were many other papers, at this time and afterwards, which, like <hi
                    rend="italic">L’Avenir,</hi> were, in their degree, organs of ideas, not
                    speculations of trade. But they cannot be even enumerated here. No very notable
                    specially religious paper succeeded <hi rend="italic">L’Avenir</hi> until the
                    foundation in 1843—under widely different auspices, although twice at the outset
                    the editorship was offered to Lacordaire—of <hi rend="italic">L</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Univers Religieux.</hi> That
                    journal was edited, at first, by De Coux, then by Louis Veuillot; it underwent
                    innumerable lawsuits, “warnings,” suppressions, and interdicts, for causes very
                    diverse. Several prelates suppressed <hi rend="italic">L’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Univers Religieux</hi> in their respective dioceses, amongst them the great
                    bishop Dupanloup in that of Orleans (1853). Napoleon III. suppressed it in 1861,
                    permitted it to reappear as <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Monde,</hi> and suspended it many times afterwards; but it has survived all its
                    misfortunes and still exists, under its new title. <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Monde</hi> had the curious fate, at one time, of being conducted
                    jointly by the first editor of <hi rend="italic">L'Avenir,</hi> Lamennais, and
                    by George Sand, who had previously figured in the newspaper annals of France as
                    co-foundress of <hi rend="italic">L’Éclaireur</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    l'Indre,</hi> a journal published at Orleans. The account given by that
                    brilliant writer of her adventures in what was then to her a new department of
                    activity is an instructive one. With that breadth of sympathy which was so
                    characteristic of her, she strove to interest all her friends (however varied in
                    character, as in rank) in the enterprise. There is, perhaps, scarcely anything
                    more amusing in French journalistic annals than is her (contemporary) account of
                    the first <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n456/mode/1up"

                    us, about five hundred resolutions were moved for the guidance of the editor at
                    his desk. <hi rend="italic">L'Éclaireur</hi> did not shed its lustre on the
                    department of the Indre for much length of time. In later days <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Monde,</hi> under very various editorships, has amply
                    vindicated the change in its title.</p>
                <p>The impulse given to the growth of advertisements in the days which followed July
                    1830, although trivial in comparison with what British newspaper readers are
                    daily familiar with, became, as the years rolled on, sufficiently developed to
                    induce the formation of a company—in which one of the Lafittes took part—to farm
                    them,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Or, to speak more
                    precisely, to farm a certain conspicuous page of each newspaper, in
                    perpetuity.</p></note> at a yearly rent of £12,000 sterling (300,000 francs), so
                    far (at first) as regarded the four leading journals <hi rend="italic">(Débats,
                    Constitutionnel, Siècle, Presse),</hi> to which were afterwards added two others
                    <hi rend="italic">(Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Pays</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La
                    Patrie).</hi> The combination greatly embarrassed advertisers, first, since its
                    great aim was to force them either to advertise in all, whether addressing the
                    classes intended to be canvassed or not, or else to pay for each advertisement
                    in a selected newspaper the price of many proffered advertisements in all the
                    papers collectively, and, secondly, because by many repetitions in certain
                    newspapers no additional publicity was really gained, two or three of the
                    favoured journals circulating for the main amongst the same class of buyers. <hi
                    rend="italic">La France</hi> was then the newspaper of the Conservative
                    aristocracy of the nation; <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Monde</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Union</hi> more especially addressed the clergy; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Débats</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Temps</hi> were the
                    journals of the upper mercantile class, the <hi rend="italic">Siècle</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">L’Opinion</hi> of the lower or shopkeeping class. A man who
                    asked to advertise briefly, in the <hi rend="italic">Siècle,</hi> for example,
                    alone, was charged 2 francs for each several insertion. If he went the round of
                    the six, his advertisement cost him only 75 centimes per journal, for ten
                    successive insertions in each of them, all round.</p>
                <p>To a great extent, the inundation of newspapers which followed the revolution of
                    February 1848 was but a parody on the revolutionary press of 1793. Most of them,
                    of course, had very short lives. When Cavaignac took the helm he suppressed
                    eleven journals, including <hi rend="italic">La Presse</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">L'Assemblée Nationale.</hi> The former had at this period a
                    circulation of nearly 70,000, and its proprietor, in a petition to the National
                    Assembly, declared that it gave subsistence to more than one thousand persons,
                    and was worth in the market at least 1,500,000 francs. In August the system of
                    sureties was restored. On the 13th June 1849 the president of the republic
                    suspended <hi rend="italic">Le Peuple, La Révolution Démocratique et Sociale, La
                    Vraie République, La Démocratie Pacifique, La Réforme,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">La Tribune des Peuples.</hi> On July 16, 1850, the assembly passed
                    what is called the “Loi Tinguy,” by which the author of every newspaper article
                    on any subject, political, philosophical, or religious, was bound to affix his
                    name to it, on penalty of a fine of 500 francs for the first offence, and of
                    1000 francs for its repetition. Every false or feigned signature was to be
                    punished by a fine of 1000 francs, “together with six months’ imprisonment, both
                    for the author and the editor.” The practical working of this law lay in the
                    creation of a new functionary in the more important newspaper offices, who was
                    called “secrétaire de la redaction,” and was, in fact, the scapegoat <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio.</hi> In February 1852 all the press laws were
                    incorporated, with increased stringency, into a “Décret organique sur la
                    presse.” The stamp duty for each sheet was fixed at 6 centimes, within certain
                    dimensions, and a proportional increase in case of excess.</p>
                <p>In 1858 the order of the six leading Parisian papers in point of circulation
                    was—(1) <hi rend="italic">Siècle,</hi> (2) <hi rend="italic">Presse,</hi> (3)
                    <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel,</hi> (4) <hi rend="italic">Patrie,</hi> (5)
                    <hi rend="italic">Débats,</hi> (6) <hi rend="italic">Assemblée Nationale.</hi>
                    The number of provincial papers exceeded five hundred. “Newspapers, nowadays,”
                    wrote a keenly observant publicist in that year, “arc almanacs, bulletins,
                    advertising mediums, rather than the guides and the centres of opinion.” In 1866
                    the change had become more marked still. The monetary success of Girardin’s many
                    commercial speculations in this branch of commerce greatly increased the number
                    of Parisian journals, whilst lowering the status of those of established rank.
                    The aggregate daily issue of the Parisian ’ ‘ dailies” had increased to about
                    350,000 copies, but the evening paper, <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Petit</hi><hi rend="italic">Moniteur,</hi> alone issued nearly
                    130,000 of these. The average circulation of <hi rend="italic">Le Siècle</hi>
                    had fallen from 55,000 to 45,000 copies; that of <hi rend="italic">La
                    Patrie</hi> was reduced by one-half (32,000 to 16,000); that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Constitutionnel</hi> from 24,000 to 13,000; of <hi
                    rend="italic">L’Opinion</hi><hi rend="italic">Nationale</hi> from 18,000 to
                    15,000; whilst the chief journal of all,—with grand antecedents, and with a
                    brilliant history of public service rendered,— had for a time descended, it is
                    said, from 12,000 copies to 9000. And yet almost over the whole of this very
                    period the brilliant ‘ ‘ Lundis” of Sainte-Beuve were making their punctual
                    appearance in <hi rend="italic">Le Constitutionnel,</hi> to be presently
                    continued in <hi rend="italic">Le Moniteur</hi> and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Temps;</hi> and writers like St Marc Girardin,
                    Cuvillier-Fleury, and Prévost-Paradol were constantly writing in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Débats.</hi> Meanwhile,
                    Villemessant and his colleagues were making their fortunes out of <hi
                    rend="italic">Figaro,</hi> and helping to make frivolous petty ‘ ‘ para graphs”
                    on matters of literature almost everywhere take the place of able and
                    well-elaborated articles. Well might Albert Sorel say, <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> “Our trumpery newspapers are the newspapers that pay.” And the descent in
                    the sterling characteristics of journalism continued at an increased speed. In
                    1872 the circulation of <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Petit
                    Journal</hi> was 212,500; in June 1877 it reached nearly to 500,000.</p>
                <p>No incident in recent newspaper history made more temporary noise than did the
                    strange charges brought in 1867 against the <hi rend="italic">Débats,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Siècle,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L’Opinion Nationale,</hi>
                    by Μ. Kerveguen, member for Toulon, in the French assembly. He charged them
                    collectively with receiving bribes, both from the Government of Prussia and from
                    that of Italy,—upon the faith, as it afterwards appeared, of statements made by
                    another newspaper, not of France but of Belgium, <hi rend="italic">La
                    Finance.</hi> An elaborate inquiry, presided over by Μ. Berryer, pronounced the
                    accusation to be absolutely groundless. Yet it was soon revived by <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Pays,</hi> in the shape of a specific
                    charge against an individual editor of <hi rend="italic">Le Siècle,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> La Varenne. All that was eventually proved, in due course
                    of law, was merely the agency in Paris of La Varenne for the Italian Government,
                    at a time prior to the events of 1866.</p>
                <p>In 1874 an elaborate return showed that in thirty-five principal towns of France,
                    comprising a population of 2,566,000, their respective journals had an aggregate
                    weekly issue of 2,800,000 copies. The details in round numbers are as follows

                <p>In 1878 the total number of journals of all kinds published in Fi ance was 2200.
                    Of these 150 were political, strictly speaking, of which Paris published 49. Of
                    Parisian journals other than political there were 1141 (including 71 religious,
                    104 legal, 153 commercial, 134 technological, 98 scientific and medical, 59

                <p>The law concerning the liberty of the press, of July 29, 1881, abolished
                    suretyship for newspapers, and transferred their registration from the ministry

                    two copies, and upon due registration of each newspaper under the simple
                    guarantee of a registered director, French by birth, responsible in case of
                    libel. And it took away the former discretionary power, lodged in the home

                    home minister may still prohibit a single number of a newspaper; only the whole

                <p>Newspapers of Germany.</p>
                <p>Printed newspapers in Germany begin with the <hi rend="italic">Frankfurter
                    Journal,</hi> established in the year 1615, by Egenolph Emmel, a bookseller of
                    Frankfort-on-Main. In the following year his example was imitated, doubtless
                    with some improvement, by the foundation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Frankfurter</hi><hi rend="italic">Oberpostamtszeitung,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> continued until the year 1866 as <hi rend="italic">Frankfurter
                    Postzeitung.</hi> Fulda appears to have been the next German town to possess a
                    newspaper, then Hildesheim (1619) and Herford (1630). In the course of the
                    century almost all German cities of the first rank possessed their respective
                    journals. The earliest in Leipsic bears the date 1660. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rostocker Zeitung</hi> was founded in 1710. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamburgischer</hi><hi rend="italic">Correspondent</hi> dates from 1714, but was
                    originally published under the name of <hi rend="italic">Holsteinische
                    Zeitung</hi><hi rend="italic">s-Correspondenz,</hi> two years earlier, and was
                    almost the only German newspaper which really drew its foreign news from “our
                    own correspondent.” Berlin had two papers, those of Voss and of Spener, both of
                    which are still published. They possessed in their earlier career some literary
                    value, but were politically null. Some halfdozen papers which glimmered in the
                    surrounding darkness were the reservoirs whence the rest replenished their
                    little lamps. On the whole, it may be said that the German newspapers were of
                    very small account until after the outbreak of the French Revolution. Meanwhile
                    the MS. news-letters, as in earlier days, continued to enjoy a large circulation
                    in Germany. Many came from London. The correspondence, for instance, known under
                    the name of “Mary Pinearis,”—that, apparently, of a French refugee settled in
                    London,—had a great German circulation be tween 1725 and 1735. Another series
                    was edited by the Cologne gazetteer, Jean Ignace de Rodérique, also a French
                    refugee, and remembered as the subject of a characteristic despatch from
                    Frederick II. of Prussia to his envoy in that city, enclosing 100 ducats to be
                    expended in hiring a stout fellow with a cudgel to give a beating to the
                    gazetteer as the punishment of an offensive paragraph.<note anchored="true"

                    was earned, for Rodérique was well-nigh killed. At Berlin itself, Franz Hermann
                    Ortgies carried on a brisk trade in these news-letters (1728-35), until he too
                    came under displeasure on account of them, was kept in prison several months,
                    and then exiled for life.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    journal of a high order be mentioned of prior appearance to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung,</hi> founded at Leipsic by the bookseller
                    Cotta (at first under the title of <hi rend="italic">Neueste Weltkunde)</hi> in
                    1798, and which is still at the head of the political press of Germany. Posselt
                    was its first editor, but his want of nerve—and perhaps his weak health—hindered
                    the application of his high powers to political journalism. His articles, too,
                    gave offence to the Austrian court, and the paper had to change both its title
                    and its place of publication. It had been commenced at Tübingen, and removed to
                    Stuttgart; it was now transferred to Ulm, and again to Augsburg. It was Cotta’s
                    aim to make this the organ of statesmen and publicists, to reach the public
                    through the thinkers, to hold an even balance between the rival parties of the
                    day, and to provide a trustworthy magazine of materials for the historians to
                    come; and, in the course of time, his plan was so worked out as to raise the <hi
                    rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung</hi> into European fame. Cotta was also the
                    founder, at various periods, of the <hi rend="italic">Morgenblatt,</hi> which
                    became famous for its critical ability and tact, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vesperus,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Das Inland,</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nemesis,</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Oppositionsblatt</hi> of Weimar (for a
                    time edited by Bertuch), and even of the <hi rend="italic">Archives</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Parisiennes.</hi> His ventures were not, of course, uniformly
                    successful, but it is rare that men of like enterprise have made so few
                    failures. Whilst French influence was dominant in Germany, the German papers
                    were naturally little more than echoes of the Parisian press. But amidst the
                    excitements of the “war of liberation” a crowd of new journals appeared. Niebuhr
                    started a <hi rend="italic">Preussischer</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Correspondent;</hi> Görres—who in 1798 had founded at Coblentz <hi
                    rend="italic">Das rothe Blatt,</hi> soon suppressed by the invading
                    French—undertook the <hi rend="italic">Rheinischer</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercur</hi> (January 1814 to January 1816), which was suppressed by the
                    Prussian Government, under Von Hardenberg. This journal, during its initiatory
                    year, had the honour of being termed by Napoleon—perhaps satirically—“the fifth
                    power of Europe.” Wetzel, somewhat later, founded the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fränkischer</hi><hi rend="italic">Mercur,</hi> published at Bamberg, and
                    Friedrich Seybold the <hi rend="italic">Neckarzeitung.</hi> Some of these
                    journals lasted but two or three years. Most of the survivors fell victims to
                    that resolution of the diet (20th September 1819) which subjected the newspaper
                    press, even of countries where the censorship had been formally abolished, to
                    police superintendence of a very stringent kind.</p>
                <p>The aspirations for some measure of freedom which burst forth again under the
                    influences of 1830 led to the establishment of such papers as Siebenpfeiffer’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Westbote,</hi> Lohbauer’s <hi rend="italic">Hochwächter,</hi>
                    Wirth’s <hi rend="italic">Deutscher</hi><hi rend="italic">Tribune,</hi>
                    Eisen-mann’s <hi rend="italic">Baierisch.es</hi><hi rend="italic">Volksblatt,
                    Der Freisinnige</hi> of Rotteck and Weicker, and many more of much freer
                    utterance than had been heard before in Germany. This led, in the ordinary
                    course, to new declarations in the diet <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n458/mode/1up"

                    of the press, and to “regulations” of a kind which will be sufficiently
                    indicated by the mention of one, in virtue whereof no editor of a suppressed
                    journal could undertake another journal, during the space of five years, within
                    any part of Germany. It need hardly be added that few of the newspapers of 1830
                    saw the Christmas of 1832. Very gradually some of the older journals—and amongst
                    the number the patriarch of all, the <hi rend="italic">Frankfurter
                    Oberpostamtszeitung—</hi> plucked up courage enough to speak out a little; and
                    some additional newspapers were again attempted. Amongst those which acquired
                    deserved influence were Brockhaus’s <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Allgemeine
                    Zeitung,</hi> the advocate of free trade and of a moderate liberalism, and
                    possessing a large circulation in northern Germany (1837); the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deutsche Zeitung,</hi> edited by Gervinus, at Heidelberg (July 1847); and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dorfzeitung,</hi> published at Hildburghausen. The stirring
                    events of 1848 called forth in Germany, as in so many other countries, a
                    plentiful crop of political instructors of the people, many of whom manifestly
                    lacked even the capacity to learn, and vanished almost as suddenly as they had
                    appeared. But it is undeniable that a marked improvement in the ability and
                    energy of the German political press may be dated from this period; and of late
                    years the press of Germany has gone far towards turning into very grave earnest
                    the ironical words of the first Napoleon.</p>
                <p>In 1833 the number of German newspapers of all kinds, popular journals
                    (Volksblätter) included, but without reckoning periodicals devoted to literature
                    or science, amounted to no more than about 335; in 1849 this number had
                    increased to 1551, their geographical distribution being as follows :—Anhalt,
                    10; Austria (German), 74; Baden, 55; Bavaria, 127; Bremen, 18; Brunswick, 9;
                    Frankfort, 17; Hamburg, 24; Hanover, 32; Hesse-Cassel, 22; Hesse-Darmstadt, 34;
                    Hesse-Homburg, 4; Hohenzollern, 4; Holstein, 17; Lippe-Detmold, 4; Lübeck, 4;
                    Luxemburg, 4; Mecklenburg, 22; Nassau, 13; Oldenburg, 8; Prussia, 632; Reuss,
                    11; Saxon Duchies, 44; Saxony, 183; Schaumburg-Lippe, 2; Schleswig, 5;
                    Schwartzburg, 12; Waldeck, 2; Würtemberg, 67. In addition to these, but included
                    in the total of 1551, 77 German newspapers were published in the Swiss cantons,
                    and 14 in the Baltic provinces of Russia. Many of those reckoned in this
                    enumeration soon ceased to appear, but others took their place, and the total in
                    1855 was estimated at a little above 1600.</p>
                <p>In 1879 it was estimated that the total number of newspapers and periodicals
                    published in the German language, in all parts of the world, reached to nearly
                    5480 :—in Germany proper, 3780; Austria-Hungary, about 700; Switzerland, about
                    300; Russia, about 50; Great Britain, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, &amp;c., 40;
                    North America, 600; South America, 9; Africa (Cape Town) 1.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">National Zeitung,</hi> published at Berlin, holds a
                    conspicuous place amongst existing German newspapers. Dr Bernhard Wolff, who
                    founded it (also in 1848), continued to be chief editor until his death in 1879.
                    He was a notable precursor (only a little in advance) in telegraphic enterprise
                    of Julius Reuter; and, to some extent, his telegraphic bureau at Berlin may be
                    regarded as the germ at once of the “Agence Havas” and of “Reuter’s telegrams.
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ,v</hi> Like Reuter, he found it expedient, as the
                    affair grew, to turn it over to a company. He did so in 1864, but continued to
                    work the enterprise until 1871. Of strictly political papers, the <hi

                    journals, 13 of which are of daily publication. . . . The collective circulation

                <p>At the beginning of 1840 the whole number of Austro-German and Hungarian
                    periodicals, of all sorts, was less than 100, only 22 being (after a fashion)
                    political newspapers; and of these nearly all drew their materials and their
                    inspiration from the official papers of Vienna (<hi rend="italic">Wiener
                    Zeitung</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oesterreichischer Beobachter).</hi> These two
                    were all that appeared in the capital. Agram, Pesth, Pressburg, Lemberg, and
                    Prague had also two each; but no other city had more than a single journal. In
                    1846 the aggregate number of periodicals had grown to 155, of which 46 were
                    political, but political only in the character of mere conduit-pipes for
                    intelligence “approved of” by the Government. In 1855 the number of political
                    papers published throughout the entire territory under Austrian government, the
                    Italian provinces excepted, was 60.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    including all the specifically administrative organs, as well local as general,
                    was 267, and that of mere advertising papers 42; now, in 1883, the former number
                    is increased to about 280, the latter to about 60. The comparatively brief
                    duration of Austrian-Hungarian newspapers and periodicals generally is a
                    characteristic feature. Of 866 journals of all kinds existing at a recent date,
                    153 had their birth in 1873, 145 others in 1872, 109 in 1871; only 67 dated from
                    the decennium 1851-60, 30 from 1841-50, and there were but 21 with any claim to
                    a date earlier than 1840.</p>
                <p>Vienna had in 1883 in all 18 daily newspapers (really such), ten of which range
                    in average circulation from 14,000 to 54,000 copies, and, according to the
                    consular returns collected by Hubbard, no less than 483 periodicals of all
                    kinds, and of all periods of issue. Of 1016 journals, classified as to language,
                    600 appear in German, 170 in Hungarian, 79 in Bohemian, 58 in Polish, 56 in
                    Italian, 22 in Slovenian, 11 in Croatian and Servian, 9 in Ruthenian, 8 in
                    Roumenian, 3 in Hebrew. Budapest claims to have 229 journals, and Prague 99,
                    counting those of all descriptions. The aggregate number of stamps issued to
                    political journals in 1860 was about 42,100,000; in 1871 it reached nearly
                    81,000,000.</p>

                    between “classicists” and “romanticists” spread itself in Sweden, as in France,
                    from the field of literature into that of politics. Crusenstolpe’s <hi

                    Swedish journals,—the former on the side of the royalists, the latter on that of
                    the reformers. Hjerta’s paper, in its best days, could boast of a circulation of
                    5000 copies; but on the accession of King Oscar it ceased to appear as an
                    opposition organ. Almost every town in the provinces has its paper. The growth
                    of the Swedish press during the present century may be thus briefly
                    epitomized:—</p>

                <p>In 1882 the newspapers and “other journals,” according to Hubbard, numbered
                    303.</p>
                <p>While Denmark, as regards mere news-journals, followed the example of its rival
                    by publishing an <hi rend="italic">Europäische Zeitung,</hi> as early as 1663
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Danske</hi><hi rend="italic">Mercurius</hi> in 1666,
                    the political influence of the press is a newer thing in that country than even
                    in Sweden. Until 1830 Copenhagen had but two papers, and they filled their
                    columns with mild extracts from foreign journals. Real activity in this
                    direction dates but from the establishment of the provincial states in 1834. The
                    oldest existing paper is the <hi rend="italic">Berlingske Tidende,</hi> which
                    dates from 1749, and was at first published in German. It is now a
                    semi-ministerial journal. The <hi rend="italic">Fädrelandet</hi> belongs to the
                    opposition, and in 1848-49 was in a glow of zeal for Scandinavian-ism and “Young
                    Denmark.” The total number of political journals in 1849 was 36. Of political
                    and miscellaneous journals together there were in 1879, according to Larousse,
                    207, of which number 97 were published in Copenhagen. Those belonging to the
                    provinces are of small account. The American consular returns furnished to
                    Hubbard in 1882 give to Denmark 142 (in the text 61 only, but 81 are added in a
                    supplement apparently printed subsequently to the table) of all kinds. So great
                    is the diversity of the most recent accounts. Iceland has in all 12 journals; 10
                    of these may fairly be looked upon as newspapers, while 2 are magazines. The 10
                    include two papers printed in Copenhagen for circulation in Iceland.</p>
                <p>The earliest Norwegian paper was the Christiania <hi rend="italic"
                    >Intelligents-sedler,</hi> founded in 1763. Next to this came the <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Den Constitutionelle</hi> was until recently the organ of the
                    Government, and had absorbed an older paper, called <hi rend="italic">Norske
                    Rigstidende.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Morgenblad</hi> is now the daily journal
                    of the popular party, and dates from 1819.</p>

                    date virtually from 1605, in which year a “licence for the exclusive retailing
                    of news” was accorded to him by the archdukes Albert and Isabella. But the claim
                    is conjectural. No copy of any number of this paper anterior to 1616 is now
                    known to exist. It seems probable that the <hi rend="italic">Gazette
                    Extraordinaris Posttijdinghcn,</hi> published by Wilhem Verdussen between 1637
                    and 1644, is a continuation of Verhoeven’s paper. But, be this as it may, that
                    of Verdussen was certainly the foundation of the well-known <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gazette van Antwerpen,</hi> which continued to appear until 1827.</p>

                    rend="italic">Quartieren,</hi> published (in black letter) by Nicholaes
                    Breyghel. When this paper was commenced is uncertain, but various numbers of it
                    exist with dates between 1637 and 1645. In one of these (26th July 1644) a <hi
                    rend="italic">Brusselsche Gazette</hi> of the 24th of that month is quoted,
                    apart from which citation no Brussels paper is known of earlier date than 1649.
                    When the first number of <hi rend="italic">Le Courrier véritable des
                    Pays-Bas</hi> made its appearance, the publisher (Jean Mommaert) prefaced the
                    first number by an address to the reader, in which he says :— “I have long
                    endeavoured to meet with somebody who would give employment to my presses in
                    defending truth against the falsehoods which malignity and ignorance <hi
                    rend="italic">send daily abroad.</hi> I have at length found what I sought, and
                    shall now be able to tell you, weekly, the most important things that are going
                    on in the world.” This paper became afterwards the <hi rend="italic">Gazette de
                    Bruxelles,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">Gazette des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pays-Bas</hi>; and, under the last-named title, it continued, to appear until
                    1791. The <hi rend="italic">Annales Politiques</hi> of Linguet was one of the
                    most remarkable of the political journals of Brussels in the last century. For a
                    time the editor won the favour of the emperor Joseph II. by praising his
                    reforms, and the Government subscribed for 1200 copies of his paper at two louis
                    d’ors each a year; but here, as in almost every other place of residence during
                    his chequered career, Linguet at length incurred fine and imprisonment. His
                    journal was repeatedly suppressed, and as often resumed under many modifications
                    of title. It was continued in France, in Switzerland (at Lausanne), and in
                    England. At one time it was so popular that a printer in Brussels regularly and
                    rapidly published a pirated edition of it. For a brief period the publication
                    was resumed at Brussels. A complete set extends to eighteen volumes, and ranges
                    in date from 1780 to 1791.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    prior to the revolution of 1830. Soon after its cessation—its presses were
                    destroyed by the populace on the 26th August—the official journal, <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Moniteur Belge,</hi> was established,—“the ministry deeming it
                    indispensable to the success of its great political enterprise that a journal
                    should be created which might expound its views, and act daily upon public
                    opinion”; and, on decree of the regency, it was published accordingly. It now
                    claims a circulation of 30,500, and the restored <hi rend="italic">National</hi>
                    one of 21,100 copies. But <hi rend="italic">L’Étoile</hi> outshines both;
                    according to its publishers, it circulates, on the average, 40,500 copies daily.
                    Hubbard’s correspondents assign to Brussels a total of 28 daily newspapers, but
                    this heaps together publications of the most incongruous kind.</p>

                    said to have an average circulation of about 7000 copies (1882). It is the organ
                    of the“old Russia” party, and also of the ministry of war. Adding to the
                    distinctively political journals those of miscellaneous character, the whole
                    number of newspapers published within the Russian states—Poland and Finland
                    excepted—in the year 1835 was 136; in 1858 that number had grown to 179, of
                    which 82 were published in St Petersburg and 15 in Moscow; 132 were printed in
                    Russian, 3 in Russian and in German, 1 in Russian and in Polish, 28 in German, 8
                    in French, 3 in English, 1 in Polish, 1 in Lithuanian, 1 in Italian. In 1879,
                    under the more liberal rule of Alexander II., the number of political and
                    miscellaneous journals—if we may trust the native authorities used by Lagai—had
                    grown to 293, and of these 105 were under the direct influence of the
                    Government. But, in truth, the period of relaxation of censorship, if strictly
                    examined, will be found to have lasted only from 1855 to 1864, when repressive
                    measures were again and frequently resorted to. Only 107 foreign political
                    journals are now authorized to circulate. The total number of licensed foreign
                    periodicals amounts to about 300, and of that number no less than 154 are in
                    German.</p>
                <p>Poland in 1830 had 49 newspapers. Fifty years later the number was still less
                    than 70, of which 54 are in Polish, these numbers including journals of all
                    kinds.</p>
                <p>Finland in 1860 had 24 newspapers, half in Swedish, half in Finnish. In 1863 the
                    number had increased to 32, in spite of the zealous opposition of Count de Berg,
                    the governor-general, to all discussion of political events and “subjects which
                    do not concern <pb break="no"

                    gardening and cottage economy, and to magazines of light literature, and did not
                    regard comic papers with anger provided they kept quite clear of politics. The
                    paper which was long the chief Finnish organ, <hi rend="italic">Suometar</hi>
                    (founded at Helsingfors in 1847, and circulating to more than 4000 copies), owed
                    much of its popularity to the pains its editors took with their correspondence.
                    The <hi rend="italic">0ulun Wukko-Sanomat</hi> (“Uleaborg Daily News") was for a
                    considerable period the most northerly newspaper of the world, with the one
                    exception of the little journal published at Tromso, in Norway. Uleaborg, with a
                    population of less than 9000, supports 6 periodicals, 4 of which are strictly
                    newspapers.</p>
                <p>In 1880 the whole number of newspapers printed within the government of Finland
                    was 46, while the total number of newspapers and journals of all kinds published
                    within the whole Russian empire during the same year was 608. Of these, 417 were
                    printed in the Russian language, 155 of them being official or administrative
                    organs; 54 were printed in Polish, 40 in German, 11 in Lettish, 10 in French, 7
                    in Esthouian, 3 in Lithuanian.</p>

                    >Diario di Roma,</hi> although dating only from 1716, may claim to have been the
                    patriarch of the Italian press. It lasted for nearly a century and a half.
                    During its later years it was a daily paper, with a weekly supplement having the
                    somewhat whimsical title <hi rend="italic">Notiz</hi><hi rend="italic">ie
                    del</hi><hi rend="italic">Giorno.</hi> Next to this, we believe, came the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gazzetta Uffiziale di Napoli,</hi> which continues to exist. These
                    and their congeners were published under a rigid censorship until far into the
                    present century, and exercised little influence of any kind. The first tentative
                    movement towards a free press may, perhaps, be dated from the effort to
                    establish at Milan, in 1818, under the editorship of Silvio Pellico, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Conciliatore,</hi> in which Simonde de Sismondi, Gonfalonieri, and
                    Romagnosi were fellow-writers. But the new journal was suppressed in 1820. The
                    first really effectual effort had to wait for the lapse of nearly thirty years.
                    <hi rend="italic">L'</hi><hi rend="italic">Opinione,</hi> which in many respects
                    is the leading journal of Italy, although its circulation is far inferior to
                    that of many of its rivals, was first published in Turin (26th December 1847).
                    It is now published in Rome. It has had, amongst its many editors, Giacomo
                    Durando (a soldier of mark, and twice minister of foreign affairs), Montezenolo,
                    Giovini Bianchi, and Giacomo Dina. At one period it attained, according to
                    credible report, a circulation of 15,000 copies. Its present circulation
                    averages less than the half of that, but few Italian papers are so often met
                    with in other countries. Fewer still are edited with equal ability.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gazzetta del Popolo</hi> of Turin had in 1855 about 7000
                    subscribers. In later days its sale has occasionally reached almost 20,000
                    copies. Hubbard’s agents, in 1882, reported its circulation as 8000. The
                    Florence <hi rend="italic">Diritto,</hi> originally founded at Turin, in 1851,
                    by Lorenzo Valerio, was edited successively by Macchi, Bargini, and Civinini,
                    and as a radical organ attained great influence. When (under the last-named
                    editor) it displayed a wise moderation in its politics, popularity rapidly
                    declined; and it has long ceased to appear.</p>
                <p>Counting journals of all kinds, there were published in Italy in 1836 185

                    Italy, the'press-law of March 1848 remains substantially and in the main the law
                    of to-day. There is neither stamp, caution-money, nor obligatory signature; but
                    there are provisions— used with great moderation—for a wise and firm repression
                    of libel. It was in Piedmont that the best portion of the press learned the
                    lesson that its duty is rather to fructify and to expand established
                    institutions than to attack them by sap and mine. By the Police Act of November
                    1859 the vending of newspapers is made subject to due regulation. And by the
                    constitutional law of Italy (June 1874) it is made illegal for newspapers to
                    publish reports of criminal procedure until after the delivery of the verdict or
                    definitive judgment in each case.</p>

                    number was far more noticeable than the value. Spanish newspapers have been too
                    often the mere stepping-stones of political adventurers, and not unfrequently
                    the worst of them appear to have served the turn more completely than the best.

                    introduced a sort of indirect censorship, and a system of “warnings,” rather

                    45 may be described as class journals, 297 as political, general, and
                    advertising. Of 226 of the whole number, 53 were of daily issue, 166 appeared
                    twice or thrice a week, and 7 only were of weekly issue. Of 225 political
                    journals, 185 are classed as “Progressist” organs, 40 as “Conservative.” Zurich

                    Dilbaum, of Augsburg. He varied his titles, so that his monthly newsbooks,
                    although really consecutive, do not wear the appearance of serial publications.

                    which demanded caution-money by actual deposit. The journal <hi rend="italic"

                    of which 77 appeared in Greek, 2 in Greek and French, 2 in French only; 37 of
                    these were printed in Athens, 17 in the Ionian Islands. Of strictly political
                    newspapers there were 12 at Athens and 3 in the Islands. In 1882 the American

                    During the embassy (1795) of Verninac Saint-Maur, envoy of the French republic,
                    a French journal was established at Pera. This, possibly, is the pioneer of all
                    Turkish newspapers. Thirty years later (1825) the <hi rend="italic">Spectateur
                    de Ï</hi><hi rend="italic">Orient</hi> was founded at Smyrna, also by a
                    Frenchman (Alexander Blacquet ?). It was afterwards published under the titles
                    <hi rend="italic">Courrier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Journal de Smyrne,</hi>
                    and its latest editor was a third Frenchman, Bousquet des Champs. In like
                    manner, the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi><hi rend="italic">Ottoman,</hi> first
                    of strictly Constantinopolitan journals, was founded by the above-named Blacquet
                    in 1831. It soon changed its language to Turkish, and was edited by Franceschi.
                    The second Smyrna newspaper, <hi rend="italic">Echo del'Orient,</hi> established
                    in 1838, was transferred to Constantinople in 1846. But not one of these papers
                    has survived until now. In 1876 the total number of journals of all kinds
                    published in the capital was 72 (namely, 20 in French, 16 in Turkish, 13 in
                    Armenian, 12 in Greek, 11 in as many other tongues); in 1877 it was 80. In 1882
                    the whole number published in all the Turkish dominions, Asiatic as well as
                    European, is reported as 121 of all kinds and of all varieties of periodicity.
                    Among the papers printed in Constantinople are four Bulgarian journals; the <hi

                    official newspapers for Bulgaria are published by the Turkish Government at
                    Rustchuk, Adrianople, and Salonica. The Arabic <hi rend="italic">Jawdib</hi> of

                    Company, the Indian press was very unimportant both in character and influence.
                    It was permitted to shape its course and to gain a position as it could, under
                    the potent checks of the deportation power and the libel law, without any direct
                    censorship. Nor was it found difficult to inflict exemplary punishment on the
                    writers of “offensive paragraphs.”</p>
                <p>Prior to Lord Wellesley’s administration the most considerable newspaper

                    Calcutta newspapers, properly so called, are comparatively of short duration,
                    and also of narrow circulation. None at present exceeds 2000 copies, and only
                    one— <hi rend="italic">Englishman's Overland Mail—</hi> attains so high. The

                    until now. Mr Duane, the editor of the first-named paper, was sent to Europe in
                    1794 for “an inflammatory address to the army,” as was Mr Charles Maclean, four
                    years afterwards, for animadverting in <hi rend="italic">The Telegraph</hi> on
                    the official conduct of a local magistrate. Lord Wellesley was the first
                    governor-general who created a censorship (April 1799). His press-code was
                    abolished by the marquis of Hastings in 1818. The power of transporting
                    obnoxious editors to Europe of course remained. Perhaps the most conspicuous
                    instance of its exercise was the removal of the editor of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Calcutta Journal</hi> (Silk Buckingham), which occurred immediately after Lord
                    Hastings’s departure from India, and during the government of his temporary
                    successor, Mr John Adam. Buckingham’s departure was followed closely (14th March
                    1823) by a new licensing Act, far exceeding in stringency that of Lord
                    Wellesley, and (5th April 1823), by an elaborate “Regulation for preventing the
                    Establishment of Printing-Presses without Licence, and for restraining under
                    certain circumstances the Circulation of Printed Books and Papers.” The first
                    application of it was to suppress <hi rend="italic">The Calcutta
                    Journal.</hi></p>
                <p>In the course of the elaborate inquiry into the administration of India which
                    occupied both Houses of Parliament in 1832, prior to the renewal of the
                    Company’s charter, it was stated that there were, besides 5 native journals, 6
                    European newspapers :—three daily, <hi rend="italic">The Bengal Hurkaru, John
                    Bull,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Indian Gazette;</hi> one published twice a
                    week, <hi rend="italic">The Government Gazette;</hi> and two weekly, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Bengal Herald</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Oriental
                    Observer.</hi> At this period every paper was published under a licence,
                    revocable at pleasure, with or without previous inquiry or notice. At Madras, on
                    the other hand, the press remained under rigid restriction. The Madras
                    censorship was removed whilst the parliamentary inquiry of 1832 was still
                    pending.</p>
                <p>One question only, and that but for a brief interval, disturbed</p>
                <p>Lord William Bentinck’s love of free discussion. The too famous “Half-Batta”
                    measure led him to think that a resolute persistence in an unwise policy by the
                    home Government against the known convictions of the men actually at the helm in
                    India and an unfettered press were two things that could scarcely co-exist. It
                    was on this occasion that Sir Charles Metcalfe recorded his minute of September
                    1830, the reasoning of which fully justifies the assertion—“I have, for my own
                    part, always advocated the liberty of the press, believing its benefits to
                    outweigh its mischiefs; and I continue of the same opinion.” This opinion was
                    amply carried out in the memorable law (drafted by Macaulay, and enacted by
                    Metcalfe as governor-general in 1835), which totally abrogated the licensing
                    system. It left all men at liberty to express their sentiments on public
                    affairs, under the legal and moral responsibilities of ordinary life, and
                    remained in force until the outbreak of the mutiny of 1857.</p>
                <p>In 1853 Garcin de Tassy, when opening at Paris his annual course of lectures on
                    the Hindustani lan'guage, enumerated and gave some interesting details
                    concerning twenty-seven journals (of all sorts) in Hindustani. In 1860 he made
                    mention of seventeen additional ones. Of course the circulation and the literary
                    merits of all of them are relatively small. One, however, he said, had reached a
                    sale of 4000 copies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In 1857 Lord Canning’s law, like that of 1823, on which it is closely modelled,
                    absolutely prohibited the keeping or using of printing-presses, types, or other
                    materials for printing, in any part of the territories in the possession and
                    under the government of the East India Company, except with the previous
                    sanction and licence of Government, and also gave full powers for the seizure
                    and prohibition from circulation of all books and papers, whether printed within
                    the Indian territories or elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The Act (March 1878) which now regulates the important part of the subject that
                    concerns the vernacular press of India runs thus:—“Printers or publishers of
                    journals in Oriental languages must, upon demand by the due officer, give bond
                    not to print or publish in such newspapers anything likely to excite feelings of
                    disaffection to the Government or antipathy between persons of different castes
                    or religions, or for purposes of extortion. Notification of warning is to be
                    made in the official gazette if these regulations be infringed (whether there be
                    bond or not); on repetition, a warrant is to issue for seizure of plant,
                    &amp;c.; if a deposit have been made, forfeiture is to ensue. Provision is made
                    not to exact a deposit if there be an agreement to submit to a Government
                    officer proofs before publication.”</p>
                <p>The total number of journals of all kinds published within all the territories of
                    British India was reported by the American consular staff in 1882 as 373, with
                    an estimated average aggregate circulation per issue of 288,300 copies. Of
                    these, 43, with an aggregate circulation of 56,650 copies, were published in

                <p>The chief papers of the Cape Colony are <hi rend="italic">The Evening
                    Express</hi> (6000) and <hi rend="italic">The Cape Argιιs</hi> (5000). At
                    Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, in 1882, four papers were
                    published—three in Dutch, one in English.</p>
                <p>Newspapers of the United States.</p>
                <p>Boston was the first city of America that possessed a local newspaper; but the
                    earliest attempt in that direction, made in 1689, and a second attempt, under
                    the title <hi rend="italic">Publick Occurrences,</hi> which followed in
                    September 1690, were both suppressed by the Government of Massachusetts. Only
                    one copy of the first and two copies of the second of these two pioneers are now
                    known to exist. One copy of the <hi rend="italic">Publick Occurrences</hi> may
                    be seen in the State Paper Department of the Rolls House in London. The other
                    was recently exhibited at Philadelphia. The paper is a small quarto sheet, one
                    of the four pages of which is blank, while the other three contain a record of
                    passing occurrences, not unlike the contemporary news of the English press; and
                    there is little in the paper to justify, in any sense, the governor’s assertion
                    that “it contained reflexions of a very high nature.” Although it purports to be
                    “printed by Richard Pierce for Benjamin Harris,” it is probable that the latter
                    was both printer and editor, as he had already been of a London paper <hi
                    rend="italic">(The Post),</hi> and was again at a subsequent period. Nearly
                    fourteen years afterwards (April 24, 1704), the first number of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Boston News-Letter</hi> was “printed by B. Green, and sold by
                    Nicholas Boone”; but its proprietor and editor—so far as it can be said to have
                    had an editor, for extracts from the London papers were its staple contents—was
                    John Campbell, postmaster of the town. In 1719 he enlarged his paper, in order,
                    as he told his readers, “to make the news newer and more acceptable; ....
                    whereby that which seem’d old in the former half-sheets becomes new now by the
                    sheet This time twelvemonth we were thirteen months behind with the foreign news
                    beyond Great Britain [or, in other words, the attention of the Bostonian
                    politicians was engrossed on the siege of Belgrade, when their contemporaries in
                    the mother country were intent on the destruction of the Spanish fleet on the
                    coast of Sicily], and now less than five months <hi rend="italic">; so</hi> that
                    .... we have retrieved about eight months since January last and he encourages
                    his subscribers with the assurance that if they will continue steady “until
                    January next, life permitted, they will be accommodated with all the news of
                    Europe .... that are needful to be known in these parts.” But Campbell’s new
                    plans were soon disturbed by the loss of his office, and the commencement of a
                    new journal by his successor in the postmastership, William Brooker, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">The Boston Gazette,</hi> “published by authority” (No. 1, 21st
                    December 1719). The old journalist had a bitter controversy with his rival, but
                    at the end of the year 1722 relinquished his concern in the paper to Benjamin
                    Green, by whom it was carried on with higher aims and greater success.</p>
                <p>Green conducted the paper until his death, at the close of 1733, and was
                    succeeded by his son-in-law, John Draper, who published it until December 1762.
                    By Richard Draper, who followed his father, the title was altered to <hi
                    rend="italic">Massachusetts Gazette and Boston News-Letter ∙,</hi> and the
                    maintenance of the British rule against the rising spirit of independence
                    uniformly characterized his editorship and that of his widow (to whom, at a
                    subsequent period, a pension was granted by the British Government). It was the
                    only paper printed in Boston during the siege, and ceased to appear when the
                    British troops were compelled to evacuate the city.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Boston Gazette</hi> began, as we have seen, in 1719. James
                    Franklin, elder brother of the celebrated Benjamin Franklin, was its first
                    printer. It lasted until the end of 1754, its editorship usually changing with
                    the change of the postmasters. On the 17th August 1721 James Franklin started
                    <hi rend="italic">The New England</hi><hi rend="italic">Courant,</hi> the
                    publication of which ceased in 1727; and two years later Benjamin Franklin
                    established <hi rend="italic">The Pennsylvania Gazette,</hi> which he continued
                    weekly until 1765.</p>
                <p>To <hi rend="italic">The Boston Gazette</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Courant</hi> succeeded <hi rend="italic">The New England Weekly Journal</hi>
                    (20th March 1727; incorporated with <hi rend="italic">The Boston Gazette</hi> in
                    1741), and <hi rend="italic">The Weekly Rehearsal</hi> (27th September 1731),
                    which became <hi rend="italic">The Boston Evening Post</hi> (August 1735), and
                    under that title was for a time the most popular of the Boston newspapers. It
                    aimed at neutrality in politics, and therefore did not survive the exciting
                    events of the spring of 1775. Several minor papers followed, which may be passed
                    over without notice. A new <hi rend="italic">Boston Gazette,</hi> which began in
                    April 1755, has, however, claims to be particularized. For a long time it was
                    the main organ of the popular party, and expounded their policy with great
                    ability, and in a dignified temper. Otis, John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Warren
                    were amongst its writers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Massachusetts Spy,</hi> under the indefatigable editorship
                    of the American historian of printing, Isaiah Thomas, did yeoman’s service in
                    this struggle, although of a different kind from that of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Boston Gazette.</hi> The latter spoke chiefly to the thinkers and natural
                    leaders of the people. The <hi rend="italic">Spy</hi> was a light and active
                    skirmisher who engaged his antagonists wherever he met them, and frequently
                    carried the war into the enemy’s country. In July 1774, during the operation of
                    the Boston Port Act, and soon after the landing of four British regiments, it
                    adopted Franklin’s odd device, representing Great Britain as a dragon, and the
                    colonies as a snake divided into nine parts with the motto, “join or die.” But
                    Boston grew too hot for the patriotic printer, and he had to remove to Worcester
                    on the day of the battle of Lexington. Here the paper continued to be published
                    until 1786,—the lack of the stirring revolutionary matter being occasionally
                    supplied by the republication in its columns of entire books, such as
                    Robertson’s <hi rend="italic">America</hi> and Gordon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Revolution.</hi> This journal, like so many more, was for a time
                    killed by a tax. The stamp duty imposed in March 1786, though amounting to but
                    two-thirds of a penny, and very speedily repealed, led to the suspension of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Spy</hi> until April 1788. At that period it was resumed; and
                    it still continues, being the oldest newspaper in Massachusetts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Boston Sentinel</hi> is on many grounds a memorable
                    newspaper. It was founded and for nearly forty years edited by Major Bursell, a
                    man who combined ability with singular moderation of temper, and with singular
                    modesty and disinterestedness. He printed the Acts of Congress for a very long
                    time without charge. William Lloyd Garrison’s once well-known <hi rend="italic"
                    >Boston Liberator</hi> was founded on New Year’s Day 1831. For a time its editor
                    was also writer, compositor, and pressman. In December of that year the assembly
                    of his State offered a reward of 5000 dollars to any one who would cause him to
                    be apprehended and brought to trial. He continued the paper to the last day of
                    1861, and lived to witness the abolition of negro slavery.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of the struggle for independence in 1775 Massachusetts
                    possessed 7 newspapers, New Hampshire 1 <hi rend="italic">(The New Hampshire

                    all for the New England colonies. Pennsylvania had 8, of which the earliest in
                    date was <hi rend="italic">The American Weekly Mercury</hi> (No. 1, 22d December

                    >The New York Gazette,</hi> the publication of which had commenced on the 16th
                    October 1725. Up to that period (1725) Boston and Philadelphia were the only
                    towns possessing a newspaper throughout America. In the middle and southern
                    colonies there were, in 1775, in the aggregate, 10 journals, of which Maryland,
                    Virginia, and North Carolina possessed each 2, South Carolina 3, and Georgia 1.
                    The total number of the Anglo-American papers was 34, and all of them were of
                    weekly publication.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The New Hampshire Gazette</hi> still exists, and is the
                    “father” of the New-England press. In 1810 this State possessed 12 papers; in
                    1828, 17; in 1840, 27; in 1850, 32,—viz., 22 described as “political,” and 10 as
                    “miscellaneous.” The earliest paper established in Vermont was <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Green Mountain Postboy,</hi> first published in April 1781. In 1850 the
                    number of newspapers was 30, 27 of which are described as “political.” Maine
                    possessed in 1850 29, 4 of them of daily publication. Rhode Island had 13, of
                    which 5 were daily; Connecticut had 28, including 7 daily papers; Massachusetts
                    possessed in 1850 no less than 91 newspapers, about two-thirds of them published
                    in Boston. Of the whole number, 22 were of daily and 54 of weekly
                    publication.</p>
                <p>Pennsylvania had in 1810 71 newspapers; in 1850, 210, with a collective
                    circulation of 338,336 copies; in 1870, 540, with a circulation of 3,419,765
                    copies; and in 1880, 973, with a circulation of 5,031,061 copies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Aurora</hi> was the most notable of the early Philadelphia
                    papers, next to Franklin’s <hi rend="italic">Gazette.</hi> Its hostility to
                    Federalism, and to Washington as the main pillar of the Federalists, was
                    violent. <hi rend="italic">The Daily National Gazette,</hi> started in 1820,
                    soon became prominent for its union of literature with politics.</p>
                <p>The earliest journal of Maryland was William Parker’s <hi rend="italic">Maryland
                    Gazette,</hi> established in 1727, when in all America it had but six existing
                    predecessors. Discontinued in 1736, it was revived in 1745 by Jonas Green, to
                    exist to the present day as the flourishing patriarch of American journals. In
                    Maryland there were, at the census of 1850, 40 newspapers; at that of 1870, 88,
                    with an aggregate circulation of 235,450 copies. In March 1880 its capital,
                    Baltimore, had 4 daily newspapers—a number equal to that of Boston, and
                    surpassed only by Philadelphia, New York, Cincinnati, and Chicago.</p>
                <p>New Jersey had no really established newspaper before the Revolution, although
                    the first number of an intended journal was published in 1765, under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">The Constitutional Gazette, containing matters interesting
                    to Liberty, but no wise repugnant to Royalty.</hi> The earliest regular paper
                    was <hi rend="italic">The New Jersey Gazette,</hi> which began in December 1777.
                    New Jersey in 1850 had 45 newspapers; in 1870, 122.</p>
                <p>Virginia, notwithstanding its illustrious precedency,—the province of Raleigh,
                    the cradle of Washington,—possessed neither newspaper nor printing office until
                    1736, so that (as respects one-half at least of the wish) there was once a
                    prospect that the devout aspiration of Sir William Berkeley might be realized.
                    “Thank God,” said this Virginian governor in 1671, “we have neither free school
                    nor printing press, and I hope may not have for a hundred years to come.” The
                    earliest journal established in the State was <hi rend="italic">The Virginia
                    Gazette,</hi> commenced in 1736. <hi rend="italic">The Richmond Inquirer,</hi>
                    which started in 1804, early attained a leading position. In 1810 the total
                    number of Virginian papers was 23; in 1828, 37; at the census of 1850, 67; in
                    1870, 173, with an average total circulation of 198,272 copies. North Carolina
                    had, in 1850, 37 journals, with an aggregate circulation of 25,439 copies; in
                    1870 it had 64, with 64,820; South Carolina in 1870 had 55, with 80,900;</p>
                <p>Georgia 110, with 150,987 of circulation; Florida 23, with 10,545; Alabama 89,
                    with a circulation of 91,165 copies.</p>
                <p>In New York, the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> already mentioned was followed by
                    <hi rend="italic">The Weekly Journal</hi> (No. 1, 5th November 1733), still
                    memorable for the prosecution for sedition which it entailed on its printer,
                    John Peter Zenger, and for the masterly defence of the accused by Andrew
                    Hamilton. “The trial of Zenger,” said Gouverneur Morris, “was the germ of
                    American freedom.” Gaines’s <hi rend="italic">New York Mercury</hi> was
                    published from 1752 to 1783. Rivington’s <hi rend="italic">Royal Gazette</hi>
                    was established in 1773, and in the first year of· its existence is said to have
                    attained a circulation of 3600. After the Revolution this paper was continued
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">New York Gazette and Universal
                    Advertiser.</hi> The first daily newspaper published in the city or State of New
                    York was <hi rend="italic">The New York Journal and Register,</hi> commenced in
                    1788. In 1810 the aggregate number of papers published within the State was 66,
                    of -which 14 belonged to New York city. Ten years later the city press included
                    8 daily journals, with an aggregate daily circulation of 10,800 copies. No one
                    paper circulated more than 2000, and but two— <hi rend="italic">The Evening
                    Post</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Commercial Advertiser—</hi> attained that
                    number. In 1832 there were 13 daily journals, with a collective daily
                    circulation of 18,200. In 1850 the number of daily papers was 51, with an
                    aggregate annual circulation of 63,928,685.</p>
                <p>The penny press of America began in New York, and the pioneer was <hi
                    rend="italic">The Daily Sun</hi> (No. 1, 23d September 1833), written, edited,
                    set up, and worked off by Benjamin Franklin Day, a journeyman printer. Its
                    circulation at first was 600 copies; in 1854 its average issue was 36,525
                    copies. Its success has been described with sufficient significancy as mainly
                    owing to “piquant police reports,” at least at the outset. It was afterwards
                    reorganized, and made to take a more vigorous political course, chiefly on the
                    Democratic side. Without increasing its size or changing its price, it has thus
                    become one of the most profitable journals in New York. <hi rend="italic">The
                    New York Herald</hi> followed in May 1835. Exceptional and eccentric forms of
                    advertisement were persistently used to gain notoriety for the new paper, and
                    its commercial success was great. Within twenty years it had attained a
                    circulation of 36,158 copies,—which was at that date about five times the
                    circulation of any London newspaper, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> only
                    excepted,—and the issue has since greatly increased. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Herald</hi> is said to be still “the most fickle, coarse, and blustering of
                    American papers,” but it is none the less conducted with conspicuous skill and
                    enterprise. It often contains several columns of “exclusive” telegrams, obtained
                    by a lavish outlay. In a single number during 1882, forty columns of original
                    matter appeared. In another number (also of 1882) one hundred columns of
                    advertisements appeared, containing nearly 4000 several insertions. The one fact
                    explains the other. James Gordon Bennett, the founder, proprietor, and editor of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Herald,</hi> gradually yielded its management in the later
                    years of his life to his only son, of the same name, who succeeded to the
                    absolute control on his father’s death. The elder Bennett left a large fortune;
                    and of part of this a noble use was eventually made. Besides the expenditure on
                    the world-famous mission in search of Livingstone, a generous but unfortunate
                    Arctic exploration enterprise was fitted out from the same fund. A popular
                    subscription for the relief of the suffering in Ireland was also started with a
                    gift of a hundred thousand dollars from the <hi rend="italic">Herald. The New
                    York Tribune</hi> was established in 1841 by Horace Greeley, who remained its
                    editor and one of its proprietors until his death, shortly after his defeat for
                    the presidency in 1872. It was also, at the outset, a penny paper, but it
                    differed from its cheap rivals in being a vigorous political propagandist<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n464/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0464-0435"/>, and in giving hospitable attention to literature
                    and to novel ideas in social and political economy. Thus it allowed contributors
                    to expound and defend the doctrines of Fourier; it encouraged various efforts at
                    founding associations more or less communistic and educational; after the
                    failure of the famous Brook Farm experiment, it took the president and three
                    other conspicuous members of that association upon its staff; it was early in
                    giving serious notice to the so-called manifestations of spiritualism; it
                    advocated co-operation instead of trades unions and strikes as the best remedy
                    for the wrongs or misfortunes of labour; and it led in the warfare upon slavery
                    through political agencies. The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> made the first
                    great use of the Atlantic cables for transmitting war correspondence, in its
                    voluminous reports of the Franco-Prussian war. Another of its notable feats was
                    the translation of the “cipher dispatches,” revealing the effort by some of Mr
                    Tilden’s partisans to purchase electoral votes for him, in the disputed
                    presidential election of 1876. Its circulation in 1851 was 19,000 copies, of
                    which somewhat more than half was sold within the limits of the city. It had
                    gained in 1857 a daily circulation of about 29,000 copies, and in addition
                    issued as a weekly paper 163,000 copies, irrespectively of certain special
                    issues for California and for Europe. The circulation in both forms is now, in
                    1883, greatly increased, but there are no quite trustworthy records of the
                    present issues of the New York press. <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>
                    was established by Henry J. Raymond in September 1851; and, though absent at
                    times in the discharge of his duties as lieutenant-governor of New York and
                    member of congress, he continued its editor and chief proprietor until his death
                    in June 1869. It was intended to satisfy the wants of those who preferred
                    ajournai of the <hi rend="italic">Tribune's</hi> general political tendencies
                    and literary character, but with a more moderate and conservative spirit. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> also began as a cheap paper; and it was successful
                    almost from the first. Its greatest good fortune came after the death of its
                    founder, in its discovery and vigorous exposure of the frauds and robberies
                    committed by the “Tweed Ring,” in the municipal government of New York, a work
                    for which it received great praise and profit. These are amongst the prizes of
                    New York journalism. How numerous the blanks are may be inferred from the
                    statement that between the years 1820 and 1850 32 daily newspapers were founded
                    and abandoned.</p>
                <p>The prices of the more important New York papers were advanced to three, and
                    finally, during the war of the Rebellion, to four cents. They all came to make
                    regular issues on Sunday also, when the price was generally five cents. In
                    September 1883 the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> suddenly reduced its price from
                    four to two cents. The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> did the same; but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Trilmne</hi> stopped at three cents, being now the only one of the
                    great morning journals to charge over two cents. There are also several one-cent
                    papers, with considerable circulations. Their inroads upon the larger journals,
                    and that from the <hi rend="italic">World,</hi> an eight-page Democratic
                    newspaper sold at two cents, are supposed to have forced the reductions in price
                    above named, which are obviously to make a great change both in the character
                    and prosperity of the press of New York.</p>
                <p>The expenditures upon the New York newspapers have greatly increased since 1860.
                    Forty columns of news and editorial comment are often given in a single
                    eight-page paper; extra sheets are frequent, and are always given when
                    advertisements require it. The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> sometimes prints as
                    many as 32 pages in one issue. Nearly all the news is now received by telegraph,
                    and a large part of it is collected for each paper by its own staff of
                    correspondents and reporters. Several papers lease telegraphic wires to
                    Washington for their own use. A large staff of reporters is also maintained by
                    each for occurrences in and about the city—twenty-five to fifty reporters not
                    being an unusual number for any of the more important journals.</p>
                <p>The New York Associated Press is the chief news agency of the American continent.
                    It is a partnership between the <hi rend="italic">Herald, Tribune, Times, Sun,
                    World, Journal of Commerce,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mail and Express</hi> for
                    the collection of such news as its members may wish to use in common, and the
                    sale of it to others. This and the Western Associated Press—an organization of a
                    large number of the more important newspapers of Chicago, Cincinnati, St Louis,
                    and other cities in the Mississippi valley—are now consolidated in a working
                    arrangement, under the management of a permanent joint executive committee, who
                    appoint agents, contract with telegraph companies, distribute the news to the
                    members of the two associations, and sell it to a great number of individual
                    papers and other associations. They transmit proceedings of Congress and the
                    State legislatures, public documents, market news, the dispatches by ocean
                    cables, and, in general, accounts of all public occurrences of interest.</p>
                <p>Until the reductions of 1883, the prevailing price for first-class papers, of
                    eight or more pages, was, in New York, four cents; in Chicago, Cincinnati, St
                    Louis, and elsewhere, five cents. The past ten years, however, had been notable
                    for the growth of another class of journals, of about half the size, generally
                    of only four pages, which aimed at a greater condensation of routine news, and
                    often at giving special prominence to “sensations.” These were sold at two
                    cents, and frequently attained great success. The New York <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sun,</hi> Boston <hi rend="italic">Herald,</hi> Philadelphia <hi rend="italic"
                    >Times,</hi> Chicago <hi rend="italic">News,</hi> and San Francisco <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> were good examples. Equally successful, if
                    generally less sensational, were the Philadelphia <hi rend="italic">Ledger,</hi>
                    Baltimore <hi rend="italic">Sun,</hi> Washington <hi rend="italic">Star,</hi>
                    and San Francisco <hi rend="italic">Call.</hi> The wide circulation and handsome
                    profits of this class of journals have developed a considerable reaction against
                    large papers, extreme fulness of news detail, and long editorial comment. Most
                    of the newspapers started or projected now are of this two-cent class.</p>
                <p>The great distances in the United States, the excellent and cheap telegraphic
                    service, and the facilities afforded by the Associated Press combine to promote
                    the growth of what would be called in England “provincial journals.” Cincinnati,
                    Chicago, and St Louis being each over a day’s and a night’s journey from New
                    York, Boston, or Philadelphia, are able to build up first-class papers of their
                    own. In Chicago the <hi rend="italic">Tribune, Times,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inter-Ocean</hi> are all strong and enterprising eight-page journals, often
                    sending out double or sixteen-page sheets, maintaining large corps of
                    correspondents, and leasing private wires from New York and Washington.
                    Substantially the same may be said of the <hi rend="italic">Commercial
                    Gazette</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Enquirer</hi> of Cincinnati, of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Globe-Democrat</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Republican</hi> of
                    St Louis, and of the <hi rend="italic">Times-Democrat</hi> of New Orleans. Some
                    of these papers realize net profits of over a hundred thousand dollars in a
                    single prosperous year.</p>
                <p>Nearly every town of 15,000 inhabitants has its own daily paper. Scarcely a
                    “county seat” in the settled part of the United States is without its weekly
                    paper,—even if the population should be below 1000. In the older counties,
                    villages of a few hundred inhabitants in the “out-townships” are also apt to
                    have a weekly. These are often of the class known as “patent outsides,” for
                    which the first and fourth pages, composed of reprint matter and advertisements,
                    are made up and printed in a central office, doing such work by wholesale for
                    hundreds of papers, while the half-printed sheets are then forwarded to the
                    local office, to be filled out with village news and advertisements.</p>

                <p>Only one illustrated daily paper is published in America, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Daily Graphic</hi> of New York. It prints regularly woodcuts and other
                    engravings on four of its eight pages. The illustrated weeklies are
                    numerous,—the best known in New York being <hi rend="italic">Harper’s Weekly,
                    Harper's Bazar,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Frank Leslie's Illustrated

                <p>Elaborate as are the newspaper returns given in the successive census reports of
                    the United States, they are only to be relied upon for precise information when
                    limited to papers of daily issue. The classification of the main returns is
                    headed “periods of issue”; and, although there is a subsidiary classification,
                    according to character, this fails to elicit even the simple distinction between
                    newspapers and magazines. Of the 5871 publications shown by the census of 1870,
                    4333 are classed as political. The 11,314 of the 1880 census are classified thus

                    different from that of former returns, and, in this absence of uniformity, we
                    cannot give any precise statement, at once com« parative and detailed, of the
                    progress of American journalism.</p>
                <p>Nor will the <hi rend="italic">Directories</hi> of the well-known advertising
                    houses of agency—such as those of Pettengill and of Hubbard—serve the purpose,
                    for reasons which are thus stated by the able statistician who edited the
                    “Population and Social Science Tables” in the census report of 1870. “There
                    are,” he writes in his prefatory remarks, “very considerable numbers of issues
                    of . . . . sheets, intended for distribution at places of public amusement, and
                    a dozen other forms of advertisement, ‘ more or less disguised under a show of
                    presenting news or criticism ’ to the public To swamp statistics [of newspapers]
                    . . . by inconsiderately admitting hundreds of . . . advertising sheets, would
                    be undoubtedly an abuse.” But shoals of such are recorded in PettengilΓs <hi
                    rend="italic">Directory</hi> and in Hubbard’s <hi rend="italic">Record.</hi></p>
                <p>The following figures are from the official returns for 1850, 1870, and 1880.
                    “Class papers” are included among the newspapers for 1850 and 1870, while the
                    heading in the census tables of 1880 is “newspapers and periodicals.” The 1880
                    returns do not furnish statistics of annual circulation. The aggregate
                    circulation per issue of the 971 dailies in 1880 was 3,566,395, and that of the
                    10,343 other papers (8633 of which were published weekly and 1167 monthly)
                    28,213,291.</p>

                    daily newspapers, of which the circulation of the chief ones, as it is stated by
                    their respective publishers, stands thus:— <hi rend="italic">Evening News,</hi>
                    of which three or four successive editions are regularly published, 35,000; <hi

                <p>Comparative Statistics.</p>
                <p>It is almost impossible by any statistical detail to give an idea of the recent
                    advances made—even as regards circulation merely—by the newspaper press; but an
                    outline of the general results reached by three statists, who published their
                    summaries respectively in 1828,1866, and 1882, may have its utility.</p>
                <p>The earliest summary is that of Adrien Balbi. It was published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Revue</hi><hi rend="italic">Encyclopédique</hi> for 1828 (vol. i.
                    pp. 593-603), along with much matter of more than merely statistical interest.
                    The numbers of newspapers published in different countries at that date are
                    given as follows :—France, 490; United Kingdom, 483; Austria, about 80; Prussia,
                    288; rest of the Germanic Confederation, 305; Netherlands, 150; Spain, 16;
                    Portugal and the Azores, 17; Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, 161; Russia and
                    Poland, 84. The respective proportions of journals to population were—for
                    Prussia 1 to 41,500, German states 1 to 45,300, United Kingdom 1 to 46,000,
                    France 1 to 64,000, Switzerland 1 to 66,000, Austria 1 to 400,000, Russia 1 to
                    565,000. Europe had in all 2142 newspapers, America 978, Asia 27, Africa 12, and
                    Oceania 9; total 3168. Of these, 1378 were published in English-speaking
                    countries (800 of them in the United States), having a population of 154
                    millions, and 1790 in other countries, with a population of 583 millions.</p>
                <p>The second summary is that given by Eugène Hatin in an appendix to his very able
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque de la Presse périodique.</hi> His enumeration of
                    newspapers is as follows: —France, 1640; United Kingdom, 1260; Prussia, 700;
                    Italy, 500; Austria-Hungary, 365; Switzerland, 300; Belgium, 275; Holland, 225;
                    Russia, 200; Spain, 200; Sweden and Norway, 150; Denmark, 100; United States,
                    4000. Here the proportions -of papers to population are —Switzerland and United
                    States 1 to 7000, Belgium 1 to 17,000, France and the United Kingdom 1 to
                    20,000, Prussia 1 to 30,000, Spain 1 to 75,000, Austria 1 to 100,000, Russia 1
                    to 300,000. Hatin assigns to Europe a total of 7000, to America 5000, and to the
                    rest of the world 250, making in all 12,500.</p>
                <p>The third summary is that of Henry Hubbard, published in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Newspaper Directory of the World</hi> (New Haven, Connecticut, 1882), a work
                    the value of which is marred by the exclusively commercial spirit that has
                    moulded its compilation, and its want of literary character. Its scope embraces
                    a very considerable number of serial publications which cannot be classed as
                    newspapers. Still—all this being understood—Hubbard’s figures, which were
                    collected (chiefly by the American consuls and consular agents in all parts of
                    the world) about 1880, cannot be disregarded. The following are his general
                    results :-—</p>
