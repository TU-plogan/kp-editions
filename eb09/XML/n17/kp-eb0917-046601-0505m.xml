                <p><label type="entry">NEW ZEALAND</label> consists of two large islands, the North
                    Island and the South Island, of another much smaller one named Stewart Island,
                    and of islets around the coast. The colony includes also the Chatham Islands and
                    the Auckland Islands. New Zealand extends from 34° 25' to 47° 17' S. lat., and
                    from 166° 26' to 178° 36' E. long. The Chatham Islands lie between 43° 25' and
                    44° 20' S. lat., and 176° 10'and 177° 15' W. long., and are about 365 miles
                    eastward of Cape Palliser, Cook Strait, New Zealand. The Auckland Islands, which
                    are uninhabited, lie between 50° 30' and 5Γ S. lat., and 165° 55' and 166° 15'
                    E. long. The whole group comprised in the British colony of New Zealand is
                    situated in the South Pacific Ocean, and is nearly antipodal to Great Britain.
                    The area of New Zealand is about 100,000 square miles, or one-sixth less than
                    that of Great Britain and Ireland. The area of the North Island is about 44,000
                    square miles, or 28,000,000 acres; that of the South Island is about 55,000
                    square miles, or 36,000,000 acres; and Stewart Island has about 800 square
                    miles, or 512,000 acres. The Chatham Islands and the Auckland Islands are of
                    inconsiderable dimensions. The North and South Islands together extend over
                    twelve degrees of latitude, and vary from 46 miles to 250 miles in breadth, the
                    average breadth being about 140 miles. The North Island is in area about
                    three-fourths that of England and Wales. The South Island is larger; its area is
                    about equal to that of England and Wales.</p>
                <p>The mountains in the North Island occupy about one-tenth of the surface, and are
                    covered with dense forests containing an almost inexhaustible supply of fine
                    timber. In the northern half the mountains are not so frequent as in other
                    parts, and do not exceed 1500 feet in height, with the exception of a few
                    extinct volcanoes between 2000 and 3000 feet high. In the centre there are some
                    higher volcanic mountains. Tongariro (6500 feet) is occasionally active. Ruapehu
                    (9100 feet) and Mount Egmont (8300 feet) are extinct volcanoes. The main range
                    of the island, beginning to the eastward of these mountains, is at its greatest
                    height 6000 feet. The plains in the North Island lie chiefly on the western side
                    of the range. Mount Egmont is surrounded by an extensive and very fertile
                    district. Nearly four-fifths of the South Island is occupied by mountains. The
                    greater part of them is open, well grassed, and adapted for pasture. The
                    Southern Alps, as they are called, run close to the west coast the whole length
                    of the island. Mount Cook, the highest peak, is 12,349 feet high, and has many
                    glaciers. Its summit was for the first time reached in March 1882 by the Rev. W.
                    .S. Green, a member of the Alpine Club, and his two Swiss guides, Messrs
                    Kaufmann and Boss. The main range is crossed at intervals by low passes.
                    Extensive agricultural <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0508-0467"/> plains lie on the eastern side. The rugged
                    western slopes are rich in mineral wealth. On the south-western coast there are
                    several fiords or sounds, long, narrow, and deep, surrounded by snow-capped
                    mountains from 5000 to 10,000 feet in height. The scenery, especially in Milford
                    Sound, is sublime.</p>
                <p>There are countless running streams of the purest water throughout New Zealand,
                    but not many rivers of depth and size. The Waikato is the chief river in the
                    North Island. Its tortuous course is over 200 miles long, and it is joined by a
                    fine tributary, the Waipa, at Ngaruawahia. The Waikato rises in the central part
                    of the island, and flows into the sea on the west coast south of the Manukau.
                    The Wairoa, discharging itself into Kaipara harbour, is large and deep, and is
                    navigable for vessels of considerable tonnage. In the South Island, the chief
                    river is the Clutha, rising north of Lake Wanaka, and 220 miles in length. It
                    flows into the sea about 50 miles south of Otago Harbour, and a calculation has
                    been made that it discharges 1,088,736 cubic feet of water a minute. Rivers in
                    New Zealand have bars at their mouths, and are, with two or three exceptions,
                    only navigable for small craft. Owing to the height and the precipitous nature
                    of the mountain ranges, the rivers, especially in the South Island, are subject
                    to sudden and dangerous floods.</p>
                <p>The lakes in New Zealand are a characteristic feature. Lake Taupo, in the central
                    part of the North Island, covers an area of about 250 square miles. In its
                    neighbourhood, and in a line between it and White Island, in the Bay of Plenty,
                    which is in constant volcanic action, there is the famous Lake District with its
                    wonderful collection of geysers, sulphurous springs, palatial terraces, and
                    lovely natural baths, formed as it were of tinted marble, and full of warm
                    transparent water of a beautiful blue colour. Nor are these waters only
                    astonishing to the sightseer. Their curative properties in cases of rheumatism,
                    scorbutic and tubercular diseases, cutaneous eruptions, and nervous affections
                    are well established. In the South Island there are numerous lakes, some of them
                    of considerable extent, Lake Wakatipu covering 112 and Lake Te Anau 132 square
                    miles. These and many others embosomed in the Southern Alps are scenes of great
                    natural beauty, abound with objects of interest, and present strong attractions
                    to the explorer and the tourist.</p>
                <p>The coast-line is over 3000 miles. Cook Strait separates the two large islands,
                    and Foveaux Strait separates the South Island from Stewart Island. Both straits
                    greatly facilitate inter-navigation. The. coastal features of the northern part
                    of the North Island are remarkable. The waters of Auckland Harbour on the
                    eastern side and of Manukau Harbour on the western side approach each other
                    within a mile. A great number of natural harbours are included between the North
                    Cape and Cape Colville. The harbours on the west coast of the North Island have
                    shifting bars at the entrance; but Manukau, Kaipara, and Hokianga are
                    excellently surveyed, and can, with due caution, be safely entered. Inside they
                    are spacious and fine. Auckland and Wellington have excellent natural harbours.
                    The South Island on its north side, from Cape Farewell to Cape Campbell, is
                    indented with numerous good harbours; and on the eastern coast, Port Lyttelton,
                    Akaroa, Port Chalmers, and the Bluff are all available for large vessels. On the
                    south-western extremity the coast is iron-bound, but there are several deep
                    fiords surrounded by lofty and precipitous mountains. Anchorage can rarely be
                    obtained there, except at the head of remote coves. Northward there is Jackson’s
                    Bay; and between it and Cape Farewell, a distance of 300 miles, there is an open
                    and exposed coast, with seven or eight small bar river harbours at
                    intervals.</p>
                <p>Stewart Island is only 120 miles in circumference, and has several excellent
                    harbours on its eastern side. There are some anchorages on the western side, but
                    they are rather exposed to the prevailing westerly winds.</p>
                <p>Meteorological statistics are collected at Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch,
                    and Dunedin; and observations of rainfall, temperature, and wind-direction are
                    received from thirty other stations. From the data thus obtained an isobaric map
                    and a report are prepared for each day; and weather warnings are telegraphed to
                    any part of the coast when necessary. A system of intercolonial weather
                    exchanges has been agreed upon, and telegrams are daily exchanged between Sydney
                    and Wellington.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Handbook of New Zealand</hi> (1883), Dr Hector makes the
                    following observations :—</p>
                <p>“The climate resembles that of Great Britain, but is more equable, the extremes
                    of daily temperature only varying throughout the year by an average of 20°,
                    whilst London is 7° colder than the North and 4° colder than the South Island of
                    New Zealand. The mean annual temperature of the North Island is 57°, and of the
                    South Island 52° that of London and New York being 51°. The mean annual
                    temperature of the different seasons for the whole colony is in spring 55°, in
                    summer 63°, in autumn 57°, and in winter 48°. The climate on the west coast of
                    both islands is more equable than on the east, the difference between the
                    average summer and winter temperature being nearly 4° greater on the south-east
                    portion of the North Island and 7° on that of the South Island than on the
                    north-west, on which the equatorial winds impinge. This constant wind is the
                    most important feature in the meteorology of New Zealand, and is rendered more
                    striking by comparing the annual fluctuation of temperature on the opposite
                    seaboards of the South Island, which have a greater range of temperature by 18°
                    at Christchurch on the east than at Hokitika on the west.”</p>
                <p>Rain is frequent. In the north the greater fall is during winter; in the south it
                    is more equally distributed throughout the year. There is a much greater
                    rainfall on the west than on the east coast, especially in the South Island. The
                    winter snow-line on the Southern Alps is 3000 feet on the east side, and 3700
                    feet on the west side. Periods of drought are very rare in New Zealand. Westerly
                    winds prevail in all parts and throughout all seasons. The formation of the
                    land, however, much modifies the winds.</p>
                <p>The configuration of New Zealand, and its extension over twelve degrees of
                    latitude, cause considerable variety of climate in different districts. The
                    northern half of the North Island possesses a beautiful climate, and remarkably
                    equable; that of the southern half is more variable. The climate of the west
                    coast of the South Island is rainy, but temperate and salubrious; that of other
                    parts of the South Island is generally similar to the English, but warmer in
                    summer and not so cold in winter. In the North Island, sheep-shearing extends
                    from September to November, and harvesting from November to January. In the
                    South Island, sheep-shearing is from October to January, and harvesting from
                    December to the end of February.</p>

                <p>On the whole, the New Zealand climate is admirably suited to Europeans. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Colonial Office List</hi> for 1883 it is stated that,
                    according to the official reports of the medical department, whereas the annual
                    mortality from all diseases outf of every 1000 British soldiers quartered in the
                    United Kingdom was 16, it was only 5 out of every 1000 in the troops quartered
                    for more than twenty-five years in New Zealand. The true test of the comparative
                    healthiness of countries is the rate of mortality distributed according to the
                    ages of population; and different actuarial investigations show that this rate
                    is light for New Zealand.</p>
                <p>It is generally supposed that in the course of ages volcanic action has
                    gradually, by an alternate process of subsidence and upheaval, left New Zealand
                    as it is. There are lines of volcanic craters stretching across the North
                    Island,—one at the Bay of Islands, another at Auckland, and a third from Mount
                    Egmont near New Plymouth to White Island, an active volcano in the Bay of
                    Plenty. There are evidences in the South Island of submarine volcanic action.
                    Slight shocks of earthquake are often felt in different parts of New Zealand,
                    but none of great severity has been felt since 1855. During 1882 twenty-eight
                    shocks were recorded, only one being at all severe, while ten were described as
                    “smart,” and the other seventeen were slight tremors.</p>
                <p>A description of the general geological structure of the islands, so far as it is
                    at present ascertained, is contained in the sketch geological map of 1883 by Dr
                    Hector, the director of the geological survey of New Zealand, who has kindly
                    allowed an advance proof to be available for this article (see Plate XIV.). The
                    classification adopted in this map is founded on a mass of palaeontological
                    data, but, owing to the unavoidable absence hitherto of minute surveys, is
                    merely provisional. The following is an abstract of some of Dr Hector’s remarks
                    on this map :—</p>
                <p>The post-Tertiary (Recent) deposits have accumulated with great rapidity in New
                    Zealand, owing to the mountainous character of the country giving to the rivers,
                    even when of large size, the character of torrents which are liable to
                    occasional floods of extreme violence. The Pliocene formation belongs to a
                    period when New Zealand was the mountain range of a greatly extended land area.
                    The Upper Miocene beds are limited in their extent to the southern and eastern
                    districts of the North Island, and in the South Island occur as patches. The New
                    Zealand seas have yielded about 450 species of existing shells, of which 120
                    have been found in this formation, together with 25 forms which are now extinct.
                    The Lower Miocene represents a period of great depression, and the deposits are
                    remarkable for the absence of evidence of volcanic activity in any part of the
                    region, and for the abundance of marine life. The Upper Eocene is a very marked
                    formation of calcareous sandstone composed of shell fragments with corals and
                    <hi rend="italic">Bryozoa,</hi> and is a shallow-water and littoral deposit.
                    Intense volcanic activity prevailed during this period in both islands. In the
                    upper part of the Cretaceo-Tertiary formation occurs the valuable building
                    stone, known commercially as the “0amaru stone,” a calcareous sandstone which is
                    very easily worked, but which hardens when exposed to the weather. The principal
                    coal deposits of New Zealand occur in the Cretaceo-Tertiary formation, but
                    always at the base of the marine beds of the formation, in every locality where
                    they occur. The Lower Greensand, which is confined to a few localities of
                    limited extent, is very rich in fossils of the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Belemnites</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trigonia,</hi> with a few saurian bones
                    and large chimaeroid fishes. It has been found necessary to include in the Trias
                    a thickness of strata which is quite unusual in other parts of the world, but
                    the close connexion which exists throughout, founded both on palaeontological
                    and on stratigraphical grounds, and the clearly denned Permian character of the
                    next underlying formation, renders this classification absolutely necessary.
                    Saurian remains are associated with the Permian beds at Mount Potts, which were
                    referred by Dr Hector to <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> in 1871, but
                    subsequently to the genus <hi rend="italic">Eosaurus</hi> of Marsh. The further
                    remains obtained of this saurian are, however, of such gigantic size as compared
                    with the original types found in Nova Scotia, in which the vertebrae were 2⅜
                    inches in diameter, that the determination may be doubted. The Lower
                    Carboniferous and Upper Devonian formation is of considerable importance from
                    the large share it takes in the structure of the great mountain ranges, and from
                    the occasionally great development in it of contemporaneous igneous rocks with
                    which are associated metalliferous deposits. The ieneous rocks</p>
                <p>(basic volcanic and acidic volcanic) have played an important part in almost
                    every formation in New Zealand, marking great movements of the earth’s crust at
                    the different geological periods, while the superficial and later-formed
                    volcanic rocks occupy nearly one-third of the area of the North Island. The
                    geysers and boiling springs in the North Island give rise to the formation of
                    siliceous sinter deposits, which must be included as the most purely acidic
                    products of volcanic action, and are due to the decomposition of the older rocks
                    by the action upon them of fresh water; but in the case of White Island and
                    other localities where the decomposition is brought about by the agency of sea
                    water, the sinter deposits are formed chiefly of sulphate of lime and not
                    silica.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 shows that out of a total population (other than aboriginal)
                    of 489,933 there were 14,273 miners, of whom 12,996 were returned as being
                    engaged in gold mining, and 1087 in coal mining. The principal quartz mines for
                    gold are in the Thames and Coromandel districts near Auckland in the North
                    Island, but several auriferous reefs are extensively worked in the Otago,
                    Westland, and Nelson gold-fields in the South Island. There is good reason to
                    believe that quartz mining in New Zealand is still in its infancy, and that its
                    indefinite extension can be ensured by the judicious application of more
                    capital. Alluvial gold mining chiefly exists in the Otago, Westland, and Nelson
                    districts. Gold drift, as it is called, is found in river-beds and on the
                    sea-coast, where it can be worked with comparative ease, and also in thick
                    deposits of gravel, the working of which requires mechanical water-power, and
                    often large expenditure. The opinion entertained in many quarters that the
                    auriferous resources of New Zealand will soon be exhausted, and that the gold
                    mining industry is approaching a rapid decline, is certainly not based upon
                    fact. There still, it is reliably stated, exist large areas, both in the North
                    and South Islands, that on geological grounds are highly promising for the
                    existence of original or primary auriferous deposits, namely, quartz lodes. With
                    regard to secondary or derived auriferous deposits—namely, gold drift—the more
                    easily and cheaply accessible of them have, no doubt, been worked out, more or
                    less, but the South Island still contains tracts that offer profitable
                    employment to the miner for generations to come. The total quantity of gold
                    produced in and exported from New Zealand from 1st April 1857 to 31st March 1883
                    was 10,144,926 ounces, valued at £39,747,940. The quantity during the year ended
                    31st March 1883 was 248,862 ounces, valued at £994,555. Good coal is obtained in
                    many parts of New Zealand. The number of coal mines in work in 1882 was 104; and
                    the output during 1882 was 378,172 tons, being 215,954 tons more than the output
                    in 1878. Silver is chiefly extracted from the gold produced in the Thames
                    district, but other mines containing silver ores have been found. There are many
                    other valuable ores—copper, iron, lead, zinc, antimony, chrome, and
                    manganese—some of which are being worked. Several fine mineral oils also are
                    obtained. Building stones of various kinds and of excellent quality abound.
                    Marble and cement stones occur in many places. In 1881 there were 127 brick,
                    tile, and pottery manufactories in work; and their lands, buildings, and
                    machinery were valued at £105,765. There are extensive deposits of iron-sand on
                    the west coast of the North Island.</p>

                <p>A study of this table, he adds, shows that “in the whole colony there are about
                    12,000,000 acres of land fitted for agriculture, and about 50,000,000 which are
                    better adapted for pasturage; but from these estimates allowance must be made
                    for about 20,000,000 of surface at present covered by forest.”</p>
                <p>Dr Hector also reports the prevalence, in the north of Auckland and in the lower
                    part of the Waikato Valley, of light volcanic soil, interspersed with areas of
                    clay marl, which in the natural state is cold and uninviting to the
                    agriculturist, but which under proper drainage and cultivation can be brought to
                    high productiveness. He adds valuable information, in substance as follows,
                    respecting other districts. In Taranaki and Wanganui districts the soil is very
                    rich, and on the surface is formed by the decomposition of calcareous marls
                    intermixed with the debris from the lava streams and tufaceous rocks of the
                    extinct volcanic mountains. The forest growth which generally covers the land
                    proves its productiveness, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n510/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0510-0469"/> although that growth greatly impedes the progress
                    of settlement. From Lake Taupo towards the Bay of Plenty the surface soil is
                    derived from rocks of a highly siliceous character, and large areas are covered
                    with little else than loose friable pumice-stone. On the eastern side of the
                    slate range which extends through the North Island, the surface is generally
                    formed of clay marl and calcareous rocks; in the valleys there are shingle
                    deposits from the back ranges, with occasional areas of fertile alluvium of
                    considerable extent. The latter portions of the district are adapted for
                    agriculture, and the remainder is very fine pastoral land. In the South Island
                    the chief agricultural areas are in the vicinity of the eastern coast, but there
                    are also small areas fitted for agriculture in the interior in the vicinity of
                    the lake districts. The alluvial soils of the lower part of the Canterbury
                    plains and of Southland are remarkably fertile. Scarcely less important are the
                    low rolling downs formed by the calcareous rocks of the Tertiary formation which
                    skirt the higher mountain masses, and often are improved by the disintegration
                    of interspersed basaltic rocks. On the western side of the South Island, from
                    the close vicinity of the mountain ranges, there are comparatively small areas
                    of good alluvial soil, but these are made very fertile by the wetness of the
                    climate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In 1880 Messrs
                    S. Grant and J. S. Foster, delegates to New Zealand from the tenant farmers of
                    Lincolnshire, travelled over and inspected the chief agricultural districts in
                    both islands. Their impression was, as stated in their report, that the soil is,
                    as a rule, much lighter than farmers in England are accustomed to work, and that
                    it does not require half the working that English land does. One double-furrow
                    plough, they say, will turn up about 18 acres a week. They saw very little
                    really heavy clay-land in the colony, and such soil, they think, will not be
                    worth cultivating for some time to come. “The labour required to work it,” they
                    write, “is far too great, and there are no frosts in winter sufficient to
                    pulverize it, while it is perfectly possible to consolidate any soil which may
                    be a little too light by stocking it sufficiently heavily.” And they add—“But of
                    one thing we are certain, that, whatever the quality of the soil, there were
                    splendid crops on it in almost every part of the country that we
                    saw."</p></note></p>
                <p>New Zealand is singular in the absence of all indigenous land mammals except two
                    small kinds of bat, and a rat which has already disappeared. A native dog is
                    supposed to have been introduced by the natives on their original migration.
                    There are no snakes. A few lizards are found, but they are harmless, though held
                    in superstitious terror· by the natives. A peculiar species of frog exists, but
                    it is very rare. Insect life is not nearly so abundant as in Europe, though
                    bloodthirsty sand-flies swarm on the sea-shore, and mosquitoes in the bush.
                    There are between four and five hundred species of molluscs. Seals are numerous
                    on some parts of the coast. New Zealand is also remarkable for its wingless
                    birds, living and extinct. There are four species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apteryx,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Kiwi</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.),</hi>
                    without wings and tail-feathers, and a little larger than a hen; they have short
                    legs, snipe-bills, and bodies covered with long, brown feathers like hair. The
                    gigantic wingless bird called the Moa (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Dinornis)</hi>
                    has been long extinct. The tradition of the natives is that their ancestors
                    found these birds living, and hunted them for food till they exterminated
                    them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Buller, in his

                <p>The peculiar nature of the New Zealand fauna has given rise to much scientific
                    speculation, and, in the opinion of able writers, points to a continental period
                    as the condition of the country in remote ages, and to subsequent partial
                    subsidence and partial elevation. The discovery and colonization of the country
                    have completely changed the character of its animal life. Captain Cook
                    introduced the English dog and the pig. Colonists have brought all kinds of
                    domestic animals. Game and small birds have been imported and acclimatized;
                    rabbits have become a formidable nuisance in many districts.</p>
                <p>There are about one thousand species of flowering plants, of which about
                    three-fourths are endemic. Most of those not peculiar to the country are
                    Australian; others are South-American, European, Antarctic; and some have
                    Polynesian affinities. Ferns and other cryptogamie plants are in great variety
                    and abundance. There are a few indigenous plants and fruits used as food. <hi
                    rend="italic">Phormium</hi><hi rend="italic">tenax,</hi> or the New Zealand
                    hemp, is a common and most useful plant. Forests covering from 11,000,000 to
                    12,000,000 acres are a characteristic feature in New Zealand vegetation. Much of
                    the timber is of great value for building and for constructive works (see vol.
                    ix. p. 407). The area of forest land is rapidly diminishing, and the rate of
                    decrease in some large forests has been estimated at 4 per cent, per annum. The
                    rapid decrease is stated to be due to reckless and wasteful consumption of the
                    best timber without regard to the conservation of the young trees, to fires, and
                    to other avoidable causes.</p>
                <p>The following return, compiled from a report, in 1875, by Professor Kirk, F.L.S.,
                    on New Zealand timbers, specifies those of great durability, and adapted for
                    general building purposes and for constructive works. &amp;c. :—</p>

                <p>There are many other kinds of trees which are less durable, but of considerable
                    value. Some have barks largely used for tanning purposes. Kauri gum, a valuable
                    product of the kauri tree, is found in the soil on the sites of old kauri
                    forests, and at the base of growing trees. It is much used in Europe and America
                    as a base, instead of gum mastic, for fine varnishes, and for other purposes.
                    There are now many flourishing plantations of English and foreign trees.</p>
                <p>The New Zealand flora, like the fauna, has been cited in support of the theory of
                    the remote continental period. Sir Joseph Hooker, in his <hi rend="italic"

                    Zealand flora is not to be accounted for by any theory of transport or

                <p>In 1880 the estimated average produce of wheat per acre was 28 bushels, in 1881
                    25 bushels, in 1882 22⅛ bushels, and in 1883 26⅛ bushels. The estimated average
                    of oats was 36⅜ bushels to the acre in 1880, 32 bushels in 1881, 22⅛ bushels in
                    1882, and nearly 33 bushels in 1883. Barley was estimated in 1880 at 30∣ bushels
                    to the acre, in 1881 at 26, in 1882 at 22∣, and in 1883 at 26. Potatoes were
                    estimated to produce 4∣ tons to the acre in 1880, in 1881 5⅛ tons, in 1882 5
                    tons 17 cwts., and in 1883 5 tons 2 cwts. The number of horses in 1881 was
                    161,736, having doubled since 1871. The number of cattle increased during the
                    same ten years from 436,592 to 698,637, and sheep from 9,700,629 to 12,985,085.
                    The yearly production of butter in 1881 was 8,453,815 lb, and of cheese
                    3,178,694 lb. The produce of wool will be stated in the summary of exports for
                    1882. Pigs, goats, and poultry abound.</p>
                <p>Except eels and a few small fishes of little worth, there are no indigenous fish
                    in the rivers. Dr Hector states that thirty-three kinds of sea fish are used as
                    food. Among the constant residents on the coast or on parts of it, he names
                    hapuku, tarakihi, trevally, moki, aua, rock cod, wrasse, flounder, snapper,
                    mullet, gurnet, trumpeter, butter fish, and red cod. Of the edible fish
                    irregularly visiting the coast, much the largest number come from warmer
                    latitudes, namely, the frost fish, barracouta, Norse mackerel, king fish, dory,
                    waichou, mackerel, and gar fish. He adds that of 140 species of fish found in
                    New Zealand 67 species are believed to be peculiar to New Zealand, 75 are common
                    to Australia and <pb break="no"

                    other places, but not in the Australian seas. “New Zealand ichthyology,” he
                    states, “presents, a very distinct character, the thorough deciphering of which
                    affords a wide field for future observation and scientific investigation.”
                    Oyster fisheries exist, and are protected by law. Cray-fish are in abundance.
                    Whaling formerly flourished on the coast, but since New Zealand has become a
                    colony whaling stations have disappeared. Whales, however, of valuable kinds are
                    numerous in the adjacent ocean, and a few whaling ships are owned in New
                    Zealand. Efforts have, for several years past, been made by the Government, but
                    chiefly by local acclimatization societies, private and self-supported bodies,
                    to introduce and acclimatize "European and American edible fish. Ova, in
                    considerable quantities, of British salmon, of Californian salmon, of brown
                    trout, and of American whitefish have been imported, and the fish hatched from
                    them distributed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>According to a paper read by Mr W. Arthur before the Otago Institute in
                    1881, the numbers distributed by the various societies were—British salmon,
                    4000; Californian salmon, 417,000; brown trout, 332,000; salmon trout, 1000; and
                    American whitefish, 34,000.</p></note> No instance of the survival of British
                    salmon has as yet been authenticated; but three or four cases of grown
                    Californian salmon having been found are reported. The success of brown trout in
                    many streams has been great, and fish of 11, 14, and even 21 lb weight have been
                    caught. Trout-fishing has become a common sport in many places. Salmon trout fry
                    hatched in 1870 spawned in 1875. The Canterbury Acclimatization Society in 1880
                    liberated nearly 25,000 American whitefish in Lake Coleridge. The
                    acclimatization of other fish has also been successful.</p>
                <p>The natural features of the country were, for a long time after its colonization,
                    a bar to overland internal communication, but good coach roads now traverse the
                    country in every direction, and railways especially have enabled solitudes to be
                    peopled, and wastes to be made productive. The total length of railways opened
                    for traffic in March 1883 was 1443 miles. In the North Island, the chief working
                    lines are—Kaipara to Waikato, 141 miles; Wellington to Napier, 138 miles open;
                    Foxton to New Plymouth, 169 miles open; in the South Island—Hurunui to Bluff,
                    671 miles, and Invercargill to Kingston, 89 miles. £10,400,000 in round numbers
                    have been expended on opened lines of Government railways from 1870 to March 31,
                    1883, and the net earnings as a whole were yielding £3, 8s. lOd. per cent, on
                    that expenditure. In addition to road and railway communication, intercourse
                    between the chief ports is carried on two or three times a week by swift and
                    commodious Steamers. The telegraph wire runs through every settled district, and
                    is extended to Australia and England.</p>

                    Europe seems likely to become very valuable. In an able paper on the <hi

                    rend="italic">Australasia,</hi> read before the. Royal Colonial Institute in
                    London on November 21, 1882, Sir Francis Dillon Bell, K.C.M.G., agent-general
                    for New Zealand, stated that 5000 frozen sheep had recently come in good
                    condition in one lot from New Zealand, that “the meat was readily taken into
                    consumption,” and that “the sheep netted 21s. 9d. a-piece, a return eminently
                    satisfactory to their owners, because they would not have sold for more than
                    12s. in New Zealand.”</p>
                <p>The total shipping inwards during 1882 was 795 vessels of 461,285 tons, as
                    compared with 765 vessels of 420,134 tons during 1881. The total outwards during
                    1882 was 764 vessels (436,793 tons), as compared with 762 vessels (413,487 tons)
                    in 1881. The number of vessels on the New Zealand register, on 31st December
                    1881, was 572, altogether 72,387 tons, of which 443 (56,751 tons) were sailing
                    vessels and 129 (15,636 tons) were steamers. There were in 1883 twenty-three
                    coastal light-houses, among which six were of the first and twelve of the second
                    order of apparatus.</p>
                <p>New Zealand was not colonized in the ordinary manner around one centre. There
                    were in its early years six distinct settlements— Auckland, Wellington, Nelson,
                    New Plymouth, Canterbury, and Otago —between which communication was for several
                    years irregular and infrequent. To meet their political wants, the Constitution
                    Act of 1852 created them into provinces, with elective councils and
                    superintendents respectively, —subordinated to one colonial legislature. In 1876
                    the provincial system was abolished by that legislature. The general assembly,
                    as it is called, is composed of the governor, the legislative council, and the
                    house of representatives.</p>
                <p>The governor is appointed by the crown. The legislative council consists of
                    members appointed for life by the governor; the number of legislative
                    councillors in 1883 was 50. The house of representatives consists of 95 members
                    chosen by the electors. The franchise is manhood suffrage, conditional on a
                    previous residence in the colony for a year, including six months in the
                    electoral district for which a claim to vote is registered. Every elector is
                    qualified for election. Four members of the house must be Maoris elected by
                    their own race. The duration of the house is for three years, but it is subject
                    to re-election whenever the governor dissolves the general assembly. Legislation
                    is subject to disallowance by the crown, but practically that power is seldom if
                    ever exercised. Executive administration is conducted on the principle of
                    English responsible or parliamentary government. Its seat is at Wellington.
                    Local administration is vested in local elective bodies, such as municipal
                    councils, county boards, road boards, and others, with power to levy rates. The
                    colonial revenue is chiefly derived from customs, stamp duties, property tax,
                    postal and telegraphic services, railways, and crown land sales. The proceeds of
                    land sales are applied to surveys and public works. Crown lands are acquired at
                    auction, or by selection, or on deferred payment, or by lease with right to
                    purchase on certain conditions. The price is rarely less than £1 an acre.</p>
                <p>The chief feature of public policy in New Zealand from 1871 to 1883 has been to
                    borrow and expend large sums on railways, immigration, main roads, native
                    land-purchases, telegraphs, and other important public works. During that time
                    about £19,000,000 has been expended on those objects collectively, and there are
                    good grounds for the general conclusion that, as a whole, this policy of
                    investing loans in large reproductive services has been, and will be, if
                    prudently continued, a substantial success. The gross public debt of the colony
                    on March 31, 1883, was £30,357,111, subject to a deduction of £2,571,829 for
                    accrued sinking funds. The annual charge, including sinking fund, was
                    £1,525,281. The loan of £1,000,000, raised in January 1883, for railways and
                    other works was a 4 per cent, loan inscribed in stock at the Bank of England.
                    Another similar loan was raised in January 1884.</p>
                <p>The New Zealand state has encouraged public thrift by a system of Government life
                    insurance, which is working with remarkable success. On 31st December 1882, when
                    the population may be estimated at 505,000, the total sum assured on 23,439
                    policies in force in both branches (ordinary and industrial) of the department,
                    exclusive of insurance in private offices, was £5,355,900. The Government
                    post-office savings banks, at the end of 1882, had 57,517 open accounts,
                    amounting altogether to £1,470,950.</p>
                <p>Under the Education Act of 1877 state schools are established, in which teaching
                    is free, secular, and compulsory, with certain exceptions, for children between
                    the ages of seven and thirteen. A capitation grant is given for every child in
                    average daily attendance at the schools. Grants are also made for scholarships
                    from primary to secondary schools, for training institutions for teachers, and
                    for school buildings. Large reserves of public lands have been made for primary,
                    secondary, and university education. The progress in the education of children
                    is shown in the census of 1881. In 1874 the number of children attending school
                    was 66'78 per cent, of the population between five and fifteen years; in 1878 it
                    was 73'64 per cent., and in 1881 80'76 per cent. Native schools are also
                    provided by the state in native districts. There are, moreover, industrial
                    schools, orphanages, and an institution for the deaf and dumb. There are several
                    secondary schools with public endowments. The university of New Zealand is an
                    examining body, and grants honours, degrees, and scholarships. It is empowered
                    by royal charter to confer degrees entitled to rank and consideration throughout
                    the British dominions, as fully as if they were granted by any university in the
                    United Kingdom. It has also the privilege of nominating one of its students in
                    each year for a cadetship at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. The
                    Canterbury College and the Otago University, both academical institutions of a
                    high order, are affiliated to the New Zealand University. Provision made by the
                    legislature in 1882 for a university college at Auckland has been given
                    practical effect to. The state in no way controls or interferes with religious
                    administration. Each denomination attends to the religious instruction of its
                    own adherents. State school-buildings can be used for such instruction on days
                    and at hours other than those fixed by law for ordinary school work; but no
                    child can be required to attend, except at the wish of its parent or guardian.
                    The average daily attendance of scholars at the state schools throughout the
                    year 1882 was 68,288. In 1881 the number returned as attending private schools
                    was 13,538; Sunday schools, 78,891; and receiving tuition at home, 7348.</p>
                <p>Exclusive of the aboriginal population, the estimated population of New Zealand
                    on December 31, 1883, was 515,000. The census of 1881 returns the number in
                    April of that year as 489,933 (269,605 males and 220,328 females). The average
                    number of persons to an inhabited dwelling was 5'12. The population under
                    twenty-one years of age was 258,774, of whom 128,791 were females. The number of
                    those born in the colony was 45'60 per cent, of the whole population; of those
                    born in England, <pb break="no"

                <p>The excess of immigration over emigration for the ten years 1872-81 was 4973,
                    8811, 38,106, 25,270, 11,955, 6376, 10,502, 18,723, 7231, and 1616 persons
                    respectively. The great decrease in the last two years is owing to the stoppage,
                    almost wholly, of immigration at public cost.</p>
                <p>The proportionate number in 1881 of occupied European holdings of land, exclusive
                    of crown pastoral leases, classified according to size is as follows :—holdings
                    over 1 acre and up to 10 acres inclusive, 7680; thence up to 50 acres, 6498; to
                    100, 4462; to 200, 5066; to 320, 2453; to 640, 2258; to 1000, 828; to 5000,
                    1097; to 10,000, 185; to 20,000, 169; to 50,000, 111; to 100,000, 18; and above
                    100,000, 7; total, 30,832.</p>
                <p>It has always been difficult to collect the number of the aboriginal population.
                    In 1878 the number returned was 43,595; in 1881 44,097, of whom 19,729 were
                    females. Those residing in the North Island were 22,872 males, and 18,729
                    females. The apparent increase in 1881 is believed by the registrar-general to
                    be attributable to omissions in 1878. His conclusion is that on the whole there
                    was a decrease from 1878 to 1881. If former estimates, partly conjectural, are
                    at all correct, the decrease during the last forty years has been considerable.
                    The comparatively small proportion of females under fifteen years of age to the
                    total population of both sexes in 1881, given as 15'35 per cent., renders future
                    increase improbable. Generally, Maoris are in form middle-sized and well-made.
                    They show great aptitude for European habits. The Maoris are of Polynesian race;
                    and the probability is that they migrated from the Navigators’ Islands to
                    Rarotonga, and thence to New Zealand. Their tradition is that they came
                    originally from “Hawaiki.” This may be the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands; but
                    there is also “Savii,” which is a dialectical form of the other name, in the
                    Navigators’ Islands. Dr Thomson, in his <hi rend="italic">Story of New
                    Zealand,</hi> quotes a Maori tradition, among those published by Sir George
                    Grey, that certain islands, among which it names Rarotonga, Parima, and Manono,
                    are islands near Hawaiki. The natives of Rarotonga state that their ancestors
                    came from Hawaiki; and Pirima and Manono are the native names of two islands in
                    the Navigators’ group. The almost identical languages of the Rarotonga natives
                    and the Maoris, as well as other circumstantial evidence, strengthen the
                    supposition. The distance from Rarotonga is about 3000 miles; and, with the aid
                    of the trade wind, large canoes could traverse the distance within a month. A
                    comparison of genealogies of Maori chiefs of different tribes shows that about
                    eighteen generations, or probably not much more than five hundred years, have
                    Ïassed since the first migration. The origin and distribution of the blynesian
                    race cannot be discussed here, but there is in some respects a remarkable
                    likeness in the customs, appearance, and character of Maoris and of Malays.</p>
                <p>The Maoris, before their conversion, had no idea of a Supreme Being. Their notion
                    was that all things had been produced by process of generation from darkness and
                    nothingness. They believed that the spirit survives the body, and retires to
                    some place under the earth, whence it occasionally returns to advise and
                    sometimes punish the living. The Maoris are divided into tribes, which
                    respectively had their chiefs and priests. Land was held by tribal tenure, and
                    small plots were cultivated. Each tribe had its unwritten laws regarding land,
                    cultivation, and other social matters. “Tapu,” or the practice of making certain
                    things sacred, —a rule, the breach of which was severely punished by spirits and
                    men,—was an essential element in their code of law. Tribes were constantly
                    fighting with each other; and the chief causes of strife arose from alleged
                    wrongs to property and person. Cannibalism was practised from vindictive
                    feelings. Slaves were captives in war. The dead bodies of chiefs were put away
                    on stages; and in course of time the bones were collected and hidden in secret
                    places. The Maoris have a genius for war, and show great ability in building,
                    fortifying, and defending stockades.</p>
                <p>The Maori language is a Polynesian dialect. It closely approaches that of the
                    Sandwich Islands, of the Navigators’ group, and of Rarotonga. Natives of these
                    mutually understand each other.</p>
                <p>The first European discoverer of New Zealand was Tasman, in 1642, who did not,
                    however, land there. Captain Cook, in 1769, was the first European who set foot
                    on its shores, and he took formal possession of the country for King George III.
                    Cook visited New Zealand several times, and circumnavigated the coasts in the
                    course of his three voyages of discovery, exploring and partly surveying the
                    general outline. He introduced several useful animals and plants; and pigs,
                    fowls, potatoes, turnips, and cabbages, first brought by him, increased and
                    multiplied. From the time of Captain Cook’s final departure from New Zealand in
                    1777 to 1814, little is known of the country, except that, owing to the ferocity
                    and cannibalism of its aborigines, it was a terror to sailors. In 1814 the Rev.
                    Samuel Marsden, colonial chaplain to the Government of New South Wales, first
                    established his church mission in New Zealand at the Bay of Islands. He was
                    followed by others; and both Protestant and Roman Catholic missions were formed.
                    In the course of the following thirty years almost the whole native population
                    was converted, nominally at least, to Christianity. There was in after years a
                    considerable relapse; but the results of missionary teaching were, as a whole,
                    great and permanent. Cannibalism ceased, ana the barbarous nature of the race
                    became softened and capable of civilization. The missionary paved the way for
                    the colonist.</p>
                <p>In February 1840 an assemblage of chiefs at the Bay of Islands signed the treaty
                    of Waitangi acknowledging their submission to the queen of England; and Her
                    Majesty guaranteed their possessions, extended to them her protection, and
                    imparted to them the rights and privileges of British subjects. This treaty was
                    shortly afterwards signed by many other chiefs in other parts of both islands.
                    Cavil as persons may at the treaty, there is no doubt that it is the honourable
                    and equitable agreement on which New Zealand first became a British colony. The
                    leading features of the colonization of the country, so far as the natives are
                    concerned, can only be most briefly summarized here. The rights of the natives
                    to their lands have been fully recognized by the crown; and no land has been
                    alienated from them without their consent except in the case of the confiscated
                    blocks which were taken under the authority of a special law from rebellious
                    tribes. The native title to land has not been confined to that in actual use,
                    but has extended over waste territory. The Government and the legislature have
                    always been disposed to consider favourably native interests; and special action
                    has often been taken for that object. Mistakes have, no doubt, often been made
                    on both sides; and serious disputes have arisen. Native tribes, here and there,
                    have been in active insurrection, but at no time have the natives, as a race,
                    been arrayed in arms against Britain. A large majority has either been passive
                    or friendly. The most serious disturbances took place in 1863 and 1864. During
                    that time several British regiments and ships of war were, in common with the
                    colonial forces, actively engaged in their suppression. No imperial soldiers
                    have been stationed in New Zealand since 1869. The colony has from that date
                    altogether provided for its internal defence. The present state of native
                    affairs is peaceful, and likely, with ordinary prudence, to remain so. In many
                    districts the gradual amalgamation of the two races is hopeful, natives and
                    Europeans co-operating with each other in a common civilization. (W. GI.)</p>
