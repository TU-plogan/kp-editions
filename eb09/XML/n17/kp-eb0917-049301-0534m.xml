                    southern border of Holstein, March 17, 1733, the son of a small farmer. He had
                    little elementary education, and for several years of his youth had to do the
                    work of a peasant. His bent was towards mathematics, and he managed to obtain
                    some lessons in surveying. It was while he was working at this subject that one
                    of his teachers, in 1760, proposed to him to join the expedition which was being
                    sent out by Frederick V. of Denmark for the scientific exploration of Egypt,
                    Arabia, and Syria. To qualify himself for the work of surveyor and geographer,
                    he studied hard at mathematics for a year and a half before the expedition set
                    out, and also managed to acquire some knowledge of Arabic. The expedition sailed
                    in January 1761, and, landing at Alexandria, ascended the Nile and devoted some
                    time to an examination of the pyramids and of the hieroglyphic writings of
                    Egypt. Proceeding to Suez, Niebuhr made a visit to Mount Sinai, and in October
                    1762 the expedition sailed from Suez to Jiddah, journeying thence overland to
                    Mocha. Here in May 1763 the philologist of the expedition, Van Haven, died, and
                    was followed shortly after by the naturalist Forskâl. San <hi rend="superscript"
                    > t</hi> a, the capital of Yemen, was visited, but the remaining members of the
                    expedition suffered so much from the climate or from the mode of life that they
                    returned to Mocha. Niebuhr seems to have saved his own life and restored his
                    health by adopting the native habits as to dress and food. From Mocha the ship
                    was taken to Bombay, the artist of the expedition dying on the passage, and the
                    surgeon soon after landing. Niebuhr was now left alone, the only surviving
                    member of the expedition. He stayed fourteen months at Bombay, and then returned
                    home by Muscat, Bushire, Shiraz, and Persepolis, visited the ruins of Babylon,
                    and thence went to Baghdad, Mosul, and Aleppo. After a visit to Cyprus he made a
                    tour through Palestine, crossing Mount Taurus to Brussa, reaching Constantinople
                    in February 1767, and Copenhagen in the following November. On his return
                    Niebuhr at once set himself to the task of preparing the records of the
                    expedition. His first volume, <hi rend="italic">Beschreibung von Arabien,</hi>
                    was published at Copenhagen in 1772, the Danish Government defraying the
                    expenses of the abundant illustrations. This was followed in 1774-78 by other
                    two volumes, <hi rend="italic">Reisebeschreibung von Arabien und anderen·
                    umliegenden Ländern.</hi> The fourth volume was not published till long after
                    his death, in 1837, under the editorship of Niebuhr’s daughter. He also
                    undertook the task of bringing out the work of his friend Forskâl, the
                    naturalist of the expedition, under the titles of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Descriptiones Animalium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Flora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aegyptiaco-Arabica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Icones Rerum Naturalium</hi>
                    (Copenhagen, 1775-76). To a German periodical, the <hi rend="italic">Deutsches
                    Museum,</hi> Niebuhr contributed papers on the interior of Africa, the political
                    and military condition of the Turkish empire, and other subjects. He married in
                    1773, and for some years held a post in the Danish military service which
                    enabled him to reside at Copenhagen. In 1778, however, he accepted a position in
                    the civil service of Holstein, and went to reside at Meldorf, where he died,
                    April 26, 1815.</p>
                <p>Niebuhr was in no sense a genius nor even a man of many accomplishments, but he
                    was one of the best scientific travellers that ever lived. He was well equipped
                    for the particular service which he had to perform in connexion with the Eastern
                    expedition; above all, he was an accurate and careful observer, had the
                    instincts of the scholar, was animated by a high moral purpose, and was
                    rigorously conscientious and anxiously truthful in recording the results of his
                    observation. His works have long been classical, and even now must be consulted
                    by any one who desires to have the most trustworthy accounts, not only of the
                    geography, but of the people, the antiquities, and the archaeology of much of
                    the district of Arabia which he traversed. His narratives are simple, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n535/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0535-0494"/> and he himself is kept almost entirely in the
                    background. He was a genuine peasant in many respects to the end of his life,
                    having many of the peasant’s virtues as well as failings.</p>
                <p>French and Dutch translations of his narratives were published during his
                    lifetime, and a condensed English translation, by Robert Heron, of the first
                    three volumes in Edinburgh, 1792. His distinguished son Barthold published a
                    short <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> at Kiel in 1817; an English version was issued
                    in 1838 in the <hi rend="italic">Lives of Eminent Men,</hi> published by the
                    Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.</p>
