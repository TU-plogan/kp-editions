                <p><label type="entry">NUMISMATICS</label></p>
                <p>THE science of numismatics treats of coins and medals.</p>
                <p>It acquaints us with the metals used in their composition, their various
                    inscriptions and devices, their mechanical execution and artistic merit. It
                    tells us of the different denominations of coins, their relation to one another,
                    and the laws by which they were regulated.</p>
                <p>The earliest known coins were issued by the Greeks in the 7th century before the
                    Christian era. By the 4th century the whole civilized world used money, each
                    state generally having its proper coinage. This has continued to be the case to
                    the present time; so that now there are few nations without a metal currency of
                    their own, and of these but a small proportion are wholly unacquainted with the
                    use of coins. The number of varieties of coins and medals of which specimens are
                    preserved in collections may be estimated at not less than several hundred
                    thousand; and future discoveries will probably greatly increase this sum. A
                    series of monuments of such length and completeness affords, as might be
                    expected, very important illustration to history and to kindred branches of
                    knowledge. This is, indeed, the real value of numismatics, and the student will
                    do well to keep it constantly before him.</p>
                <p>Coins, although they confirm history, rarely correct it, and never very greatly.
                    The earliest belong to a time and to nations as to which we are not otherwise
                    wholly ignorant, and they do not afford us that precise information which would
                    fill in any important details of the meagre sketch of contemporary history. We
                    gain from them scarcely any direct historical information, except that certain
                    cities or princes issued money. When in later times the devices and inscriptions
                    of the coins give more detailed information, history is far fuller and clearer,
                    so that the numismatic evidence is rarely more than corroborative. There are,
                    indeed, some remarkable exceptions to this rule, as in the case of the Bactrian
                    coins, which have supplied the outlines of a portion of history which was
                    otherwise almost wholly lost. The value of the corroborative evidence afforded
                    by coins must not, however, be overlooked. It chiefly relates to chronology,
                    although it also adds to our knowledge of the pedigrees of royal houses. But
                    perhaps the most interesting manner in which coins and medals illustrate history
                    is in their bearing contemporary, or nearly contemporary, portraits of the most
                    famous kings and captains, from the time of the first successors of Alexander
                    the Great to the present age, whereas pictures do not afford portraits in any
                    number before the latter part of the Middle Ages; and works of sculpture,
                    although occupying in this respect the same place as coins in the last-mentioned
                    period and under the Roman empire, are neither so numerous nor so authentic.
                    There is no more delightful companion in historical reading than a cabinet of
                    coins and medals. The strength and energy of Alexander, the ferocity of
                    Mithradates, the philosophic calmness of Antoninus, the obstinate ferocity of
                    Nero, and the brutality of Caracalla are as plain on the coins as in the pages
                    of history. The numismatic portraits of the time following the founding of
                    Constantinople have less individuality; but after the revival of art they
                    recover that quality, and maintain it to our own day, although executed in very
                    different styles from those of antiquity. From this last class we can form a
                    series of portraits more complete and not less interesting than that of the
                    ancient period.</p>
                <p>While coins and medals thus illustrate the events of history, they have an
                    equally direct bearing on the belief of the nations by which they were issued;
                    and in this reference lies no small part of their value in connexion with
                    history. The mythology of the Greeks, not having been fixed in sacred writings,
                    nor regulated by a dominant priesthood, but having grown out of the different
                    beliefs <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n686/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0686-0629"/> of various tribes and isolated settlements, and
                    having been allowed to form itself comparatively without check, can scarcely be
                    learned from ancient books. Their writers give us but a partial or special view
                    of it, and modern authors, in their attempts to systematize, have often but
                    increased the confusion. The Greek coins, whether of kings or cities, until the
                    death of Alexander, bear sacred subjects only. Afterwards, on the regal coins,
                    the king’s head usually occupies the obverse and a sacred subject is placed on
                    the reverse. The coins of Greek cities under the empire have usually an imperial
                    portrait and a reverse type usually mythological. The whole class thus affords
                    us invaluable evidence for the reconstruction of Greek mythology. We have
                    nowhere else so complete a series of the different types under which the
                    divinities were represented. There are in modern galleries very few statues of
                    Greek divinities, including such as were intended for architectural decoration,
                    which are in good style, fairly preserved, and untouched by modern restorers. If
                    to these we add reliefs of the same class, and the best Graeco-Roman copies, we
                    can scarcely form a complete series of the various representations of these
                    divinities. The coins, ⅛owever, supply us with the series we desire, and we may
                    select types which are not merely of good work, but of the finest. The mythology
                    of ancient Italy, as distinct from that of the Greek colonies of Italy, is not
                    so fully illustrated by the coins of the country, because these are for the most
                    part of Greek design. There are, however, some remarkable exceptions, especially
                    in the money of the Roman commonwealth, the greater number of the types of which
                    are of a local character, including many that refer to the myths and traditions
                    of the earliest days of the city. The coins of the empire are especially
                    important, as bearing representations of those personifications of an
                    allegorical character to which the influence of philosophy gave great prominence
                    in Roman mythology.</p>
                <p>Coins are scarcely less valuable in relation to geography than to history. The
                    position of towns on the sea or on rivers, the race of their inhabitants, and
                    many similar particulars are positively fixed on numismatic evidence. The
                    information that coins convey as to the details of the history of towns and
                    countries has a necessary connexion with geography, as has also their
                    illustration of local forms of worship. The representations of natural
                    productions on ancient money are of special importance, and afford assistance to
                    the lexicographer. This is particularly the case with the Greek coins, on which
                    these objects are frequently portrayed with great fidelity. We must recollect,
                    however, that the nomenclature of the ancients was vague, and frequently
                    comprised very different objects under one appellation, and that therefore we
                    may find very different representations corresponding to the same name.</p>
                <p>The art of sculpture, of which coin-engraving is the offspring, receives the
                    greatest illustration from numismatics. Not only is the memory of lost statues
                    preserved to us in the designs of ancient coins, but those of Greece afford
                    admirable examples of that skill by which her sculptors attained their great
                    renown. The excellence of the designs of very many Greek coins struck during the
                    period of the best art is indeed so great that, were it not for their smallness,
                    they would form the finest series of art-studies in the world. The Roman coins,
                    though at no time to be compared to the purest Greek, yet represent worthily the
                    Graeco-Roman art of the empire. From the accession of Augustus to the death of
                    Commodus they are often fully equal to the best Graeco-Roman statues. This may
                    be said, for instance, of the dupondii struck in honour of Livia by Tiberius and
                    by the younger Drusus, of the sestertii of Agrippina, and of the gold coins of
                    Antoninus Pius and the two Faustinas, all which present portraits of remarkable
                    beauty and excellence. The mediaeval Italian medals aie scarcely less useful as
                    records of the progress and characteristics of art, and, placed by the side of
                    the Greek and Roman coins, complete the most remarkable comparative series of
                    monuments illustrating the history of the great schools of art that can be
                    brought together. Ancient coins throw as great light upon the architecture as
                    upon the sculpture of the nations by which they were struck. Under the empire,
                    the Roman coins issued at the city very frequently bear representations of
                    important edifices. The Greek imperial coins struck in the provinces present
                    similar types, representing the most famous temples and other structures of
                    their cities, of the form of some of which we should otherwise have been wholly
                    ignorant. The little-known art of painting among the ancients does not receive
                    so much illustration from the coins. The best Greek pieces are of too severe a
                    style to admit of an approach to pictorial treatment, although we perceive such
                    a tendency in the works of important schools, and during the period of decline.
                    The Roman coins sometimes present groups which have a very pictorial character,
                    traceable to the tendency of the sculpture of the period; this is principally
                    about the time of the Antonines. They are, however, never so pictorial in
                    treatment as the mediaeval Italian medals. The art of gem-engraving among the
                    ancients is perhaps most nearly connected with their coinage. The subjects of
                    coins and gems are so similar and so similarly treated that the authenticity of
                    gems, that most difficult of archaeological questions, receives the greatest aid
                    from the study of coins.</p>
                <p>After what has been said it is not necessary to do more than mention how greatly
                    the study of coins tends to illustrate the contemporary literature of the
                    nations which issued them. Not only the historians, but the philosophers and the
                    poets, are constantly illustrated by the money of their times. This was
                    perceived at the revival of letters; and during the last two centuries coins
                    were very frequently engraved in the larger editions of the classics. A want of
                    technical numismatic knowledge in the editors, and the carelessness of the
                    artists, combined to deprive these illustrations of much of their value.
                    Probably in part on this account, but chiefly in consequence of the change from
                    historical to textual criticism, ancient coins have been little used in this
                    manner by the new school. This neglect is being remedied, although the full
                    value of coins and medals in illustration of the literature of modern as well as
                    of ancient times is not as yet sufficiently perceived.</p>
                <p>The science of numismatics is of comparatively recent origin. The ancients do not
                    seem to have formed collections, although they appear to have occasionally
                    preserved individual specimens for their beauty. Petrarch has the credit of
                    having been the first collector; but it is probable that in his time ancient
                    coins were already attracting no little notice. The importance of the study of
                    all coins has since been by degrees more and more recognized, and at present no
                    branch of the pursuit is left wholly unexplored.</p>
                <p>Besides its bearing upon the history, the religion, the manners, and the arts of
                    the nations which have used money, the science of numismatics has a special
                    modern use in relation to art. Displaying the various styles of art prevalent in
                    different ages, coins supply us with abundant means for promoting the
                    advancement of art among ourselves. If the study of many schools be at all times
                    of advantage, it is especially so when there is little originality in the world.
                    Its least value is to point out the want of artistic merit and historical
                    commemoration in modern coins, and to suggest that modern medals should be
                    executed<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n687/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0687-0630"/> after some study of the rules which controlled
                    the great works of former times.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definitions.—</hi> The following are the most necessary
                    numismatic definitions.</p>
                <p>1. A <hi rend="italic">coin</hi> is a piece of metal of a fixed weight, stamped
                    by authority of government, and employed as a circulating medium.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This definition excludes, on
                    the one hand, paper currencies and their equivalents among barbarous nations,
                    such as cowries, because they are neither of metal nor of fixed weight, although
                    either stamped or sanctioned by authority, and, on the other hand, modes of
                    keeping metal in weight, like the so-called Celtic ‘ ‘ ring-money,” because they
                    are not stamped, although perhaps sanctioned by authority. The latter has
                    attracted so much attention that it must not be passed by without some further
                    notice. There seems to be no reasonable doubt that the Celtic gold rings all
                    weigh multiples of the same unit, but very seldom multiples of one another. From
                    their form it is probable that most of them were used as ornaments, and as such
                    they would probably have been generally made to weigh an exact weight without
                    fractions, on the same principle that the ancients frequently avoided fractions
                    of their measures in architecture. They belong to a time anterior to the
                    introduction of money among the Celts, or before its general use, anil one,
                    therefore, at which precious metal must have been weighed when employed in
                    barter. Hence an additional reason, and probably the main one, why their weight
                    is always some multiple of the same unit. In a primitive state of society in the
                    present day a woman often wears her dowry in coins as ornaments; and thus these
                    Celtic rings may have been both ornaments and substitutes for
                    money.</p></note></p>
                <p>2. A <hi rend="italic">medal</hi> is a piece, having no place in the currency,
                    struck to commemorate some event or person. Medals are frequently comprised with
                    coins in descriptions that apply to both equally; thus, in the subsequent
                    definitions, by the term coins, coins and medals must generally be
                    understood.</p>
                <p>3. The coinage of a country is usually divided into the classes of gold, silver,
                    and bronze (copper), for which the abbreviations A, √fi, and Ae are employed in
                    catalogues. In each class are comprised, not only the coins of the metal from
                    which it takes its name, with no more than a necessary or inseparable proportion
                    of alloy, but coins of other metallic substances, usually base, and always
                    compound, which were generally struck in the place of the purer pieces. The
                    principal metallic substances thus used were electrum for gold, billon for
                    silver, brass for copper, and potin for silver and copper.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Electrum (fiλeκτρov,</hi><hi rend="italic">ήλεκτρο^,</hi> a
                    compound metallic substance, consisting of gold with a considerable alloy of
                    silver. Pliny makes the proportion to have been four parts of gold to one of
                    silver.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Nat.,</hi> xxxiii. 23; comp, xxxvii. 11. Pliny distinguishes
                    two kinds of “electron,”—amber, and this metallic substance. In Greek poetry the
                    name seems to apply to both, but it is generally difficult to decide which is
                    meant in any particular case. Sophocles, however, where he mentions τάττό <hi
                    rend="italic">^∑dpδeωv ijλeκτpov, . . . κal</hi><hi rend="italic">τον ’Ινδικόν
                    χρυσόν</hi><hi rend="italic">(Ant.</hi> 1037-39), can scarcely be doubted to
                    refer to the metallic electrum.</p></note> The material of early coins of Asia
                    Minor struck in the cities of the western coast is the ancient electrum. It
                    appears here to have at first consisted of three parts of gold to one of silver;
                    but afterwards the proportion of silver was increased, though perhaps not
                    everywhere. Gold largely alloyed with silver, not struck by the ancient Greeks
                    or their neighbours, should be termed <hi rend="italic">pale gold,</hi> as in
                    the case of some of the late Byzantine coins.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Billon,</hi> a term applied to the base metal of some Roman
                    coins, and also to that of some mediaeval and modern coins. It is silver with a
                    great proportion of alloy. When the base silver coins are replaced by copper
                    washed with silver the term billon becomes inappropriate.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Brass,</hi> a compound metallic substance employed for
                    coins. It may be used as an equivalent to the orichalcum of the Romans, a fine
                    kind of brass of which the sestertii and dupondii were struck, but it is
                    commonly applied indiscriminately to the whole of their copper currency.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Potin,</hi> a term applied to the base metal of which some
                    ancient coins are composed. It is softer than billon.</p>
                <p>8. Various other metallic substances have been used in coinage. The so-called
                    “glass coins” of the Arabs are merely coin-weights.</p>
                <p>9. The <hi rend="italic">forms of</hi> coins have greatly varied in different
                    countries and at different periods. The usual form in both ancient and modern
                    times has been circular, and generally of no great thickness.</p>
                <p>10. Coins are usually measured by <hi rend="italic">J/ionnet’s scale,</hi> from
                    which the greatest dimension is taken, or, when they are square, the greatest
                    dimension in two directions. This is, however, a very unsatisfactory scale, as
                    its divisions are of an arbitrary character, and the instruments for applying it
                    are such as make exactness scarcely possible. A gauge graduated to inches and
                    decimal parts of an inch or to millimètres is far more satisfactory.</p>
                <p>11. The <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> of a coin is of great importance, both in
                    determining its genuineness and in distinguishing its identity. To ascertain
                    exact weight even to the tenth of a grain is therefore necessary, and this can
                    only be done by the careful use of excellent scales.</p>
                <p>12. The <hi rend="italic">specific gravity</hi> of a coin may be of use in
                    determining the metals in its composition.</p>
                <p>13. Whatever representations or characters are borne by a coin constitute its <hi
                    rend="italic">type.</hi> The subject of each side is also called a type, and,
                    when there is not only a device but an inscription, the latter may be excluded
                    from the term. This last is the general use. No distinct rule has been laid down
                    as to what makes a difference of type, but it may be considered to be an
                    essential difference, however slight.</p>
                <p>14. A difference too small to constitute a new type makes a <hi rend="italic"
                    >variety.</hi></p>
                <p>15. A coin is a <hi rend="italic">duplicate</hi> of another when it agrees with
                    it in all particulars but those of exact size and weight. Strictly speaking,
                    ancient coins are rarely, if ever, duplicates, except when struck from the same
                    die.</p>
                <p>16. Of the two sides of a coin, that is called the <hi rend="italic">obverse</hi>
                    which bears the more important device or inscription. In early Greek coins it is
                    the convex side; in Greek and Roman imperial it is the side bearing the head; in
                    mediaeval and modern that bearing the royal effigy, or the king’s name, or the
                    name of the city; and in Oriental that on which the inscription begins. The
                    other side is called the <hi rend="italic">reverse.</hi></p>
                <p>17. The <hi rend="italic">field</hi> of a coin is the space unoccupied by the
                    principal devices or inscriptions. Any detached independent device or character
                    is said to be in the field, except when it occupies the exergue.</p>
                <p>18. The <hi rend="italic">exergue</hi> is that part of the reverse of a coin
                    which is below the main device, and distinctly separated from it; it often bears
                    a secondary inscription. Thus, the well-known inscription CONOB occupies the
                    exergue of the late Roman and early Byzantine gold coins.</p>
                <p>19. The <hi rend="italic">edge</hi> of a coin is the surface of its
                    thickness.</p>
                <p>20. By the <hi rend="italic">inscription</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >inscriptions</hi> of a coin all the letters it bears are intended; an
                    inscription is either principal or secondary.</p>
                <p>21. In describing coins the terms <hi rend="italic">right</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">left</hi> mean the right and left of the spectator, not the
                    heraldic and military right and left, or those of the coin.</p>
                <p>22. A <hi rend="italic">bust</hi> is the representation of the head and neck; it
                    is commonly used of such as show at least the collar-bone, other busts being
                    called heads.</p>
                <p>23. A <hi rend="italic">head</hi> properly means the representation of a head
                    alone, without any part of the neck, but it is also commonly used when any part
                    of the neck above the collar-bone is shown. The present article follows custom
                    in the use of the terms <hi rend="italic">bust</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >head.</hi></p>
                <p>24. A bust or head is either facing, usually three-quarter face, or in profile,
                    in which latter case it is described as <hi rend="italic">to right</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">to left.</hi> Two busts may be placed in various relative
                    positions λvhich cannot be described in English without circumlocution.</p>
                <p>25. A bust wearing a laurel-wreath is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >laureate.</hi></p>
                <p>26. A bust bound with a regal fillet (diadem) is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >diademed.</hi></p>
                <p>27. A bust of which the neck is clothed is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >draped.</hi></p>
                <p>28. An object in the field of a coin which is neither a letter nor a monogram is
                    usually called a <hi rend="italic">symbol.</hi> This term is, however, only
                    applicable when such an object is evidently the badge of a town or individual.
                    The term <hi rend="italic">adjunct,</hi> which is sometimes employed instead of
                    symbol, is manifestly incorrect.</p>
                <p>29. A <hi rend="italic">mint-mark</hi> is a difference placed by the authorities
                    of the mint upon all money struck by them, or upon each new die or separate
                    issue.</p>
                <p>30. A coin is said to be <hi rend="italic">surfrappe</hi> when it has been struck
                    on an older coin, of which the types are not altogether obliterated.</p>
                <p>31. A <hi rend="italic">double-struck</hi> coin is one in which the die or dies
                    have shifted so as to cause a double impression.</p>
                <p>32. A coin which presents two obverse types, or two reverse types, or of which
                    the types of the obverse and reverse do not correspond, is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">mule</hi>; it is the result of mistake or caprice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arrangement of Coins.—</hi> No uniform system has as yet been
                    applied to the arrangement of all coins. It is usual to separate them into the
                    three great classes of ancient coins (comprising Greek and Roman), mediaeval and
                    modern, and Oriental coins. The details of these classes have been differently
                    treated, both generally and specially. The arrangement of the Greek series has
                    been first geographical, under countries and towns, and then chronological, for
                    a further division; that of the Roman series, chronological, without reference
                    to geography; that of the mediaeval and modern, the same as the Greek; and that
                    of the Oriental, like the Greek, but unsystematically,—a treatment inadmissible
                    except in the case of a single empire. Then, again, some numismatists have
                    separated each denomination or each metal, or have separated the denominations
                    of one metal and not of another. There has been no general and comprehensive
                    system, constructed upon reasonable principles, and applicable to every branch
                    of this complicated science. Without laying down a system of rules, or
                    criticizing former modes of arrangement, we offer the following as a
                    classification which is uniform without being servile.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Greek Coins.—</hi> All coins of Greeks, or barbarians who
                    adopted Greek money, struck before the Roman rule or under it, but without
                    imperial effigies. The countries and their provinces are placed in a
                    geographical order from west to east, according to the system of Eckhel, with
                    the cities in alphabetical order under the provinces, and the kings in
                    chronological order. The civic coins usually precede the regal, as being the
                    more important. The coins are further <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n688/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0688-0631"/> arranged chronologically, the civic commencing
                    with the oldest and ending with those bearing the effigies of Roman emperors.
                    The gold coins of each period take precedence of the silver and the silver of
                    the copper. The larger denominations in each metal are placed before the
                    smaller. Coins of the same denomination and period are arranged in the
                    alphabetical order of the magistrates’ names, or the letters, &amp;c., that they
                    bear.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Roman Coins. —</hi> All coins issued by the Roman
                    commonwealth and empire, whether struck at Rome or in the provinces. The
                    arrangement is chronological, or, where this is better, under geographical
                    divisions.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Mediaeval</hi><hi rend="italic">and Modern Coins of
                    Europe.—</hi> All coins issued by Christian European states, their branches and
                    colonies, from the fall of the empire of the West to the present day. This class
                    is arranged in a geographical and chronological order, as similar as possible to
                    that of the Greek class, with the important exception of the Byzantine coins and
                    the coins following Byzantine systems, which occupy the first place. The reason
                    for this deviation is that the Byzantine money may be regarded not only as the
                    principal source of mediaeval coinage but as the most complete and important
                    mediaeval series, extending as it does without a break throughout the Middle
                    Ages. The regal coins usually precede the civic ones, as being the more
                    important; and the medals of each sovereign or city follow the coins.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Oriental Coins.—</hi> All coins bearing inscriptions in
                    Eastern languages, excepting those of the Jews, Phoenicians, and Carthaginians,
                    which are classed with the Greek coins from their close connexion with them.
                    These coins should be arranged under the following divisions: Ancient Persian,
                    Arab, Modern Persian, Indian, Chinese, and coins of the far East.</p>
                <p>This method of arrangement will be found to be as uniform as it can be made,
                    without being absolutely mechanical. It differs in some important particulars
                    from most or all of those which have previously obtained; but these very
                    differences are the result of the consideration of a complete collection, and
                    have therefore an inductive origin. A general uniformity is no slight gain, and
                    may well reconcile us to some partial defects. These defects may be remedied in
                    large collections by the use of “cross-references” from one cabinet to another,
                    and by the formation of independent series to illustrate the general one. A
                    series illustrative of Greek art, and another of Graeco-Roman, might be formed.
                    A series of portraits, and another of reverse types, would be equally valuable.
                    Others might be made to show the changes of the coinage in relation to the
                    condition of a state, with careful indications of the weight and composition of
                    the examples, and others to illustrate the history of a particular country or
                    city. Thus, the Byzantine copper coinage exhibits the success or disaster of the
                    imperial arms, and the financial state of the empire in its fluctuations, while
                    nothing can be more interesting than to see at one view the numismatic history
                    of a great city. We have coins of Rome under the commonwealth and the empire,
                    under the Ostrogoths, the Byzantines, the mediaeval senate, and the popes. The
                    series of London would be not the least curious. It would begin with the Roman
                    coins issued by the mint of Londinium at the time of Diocletian and his
                    colleagues, comprising those of the usurpers Carausius and Allectus; then,
                    having not long after ceased for a time, it would recommence with the Saxon
                    pennies, including a specimen of those of King Alfred, which have for their
                    reverse type the monogram of the city’s name; and, continuing through the
                    mediaeval period, it would conclude with modern tokens and medals, among the
                    latter of which might be placed a copy of that famous one of the first Napoleon,
                    with the inscription “Frappée a Londres,” which was intended to commemorate the
                    success of the Boulogne expedition.</p>
                <p>I. — <hi rend="smallcaps">Greek Coins.</hi></p>
                <p>There are some matters relating to Greek coins in general which may be properly
                    considered before they are described in geographical order. These are their
                    general character, the chief denominations, with the different talents of which
                    they were the divisions, their devices and inscriptions, their art, and the mode
                    of striking.</p>
                <p>The period during which Greek coins were issued was probably not much less than a
                    thousand years, commencing about the beginning of the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and generally ending at the death of Gallienus (268
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d. ).</hi> If classed with reference only to their form,
                    fabric, and general appearance they are of three principal types,—the archaic
                    Greek, the ordinary Greek, and the Graeco-Roman. The coins of the first class
                    are of silver, electrum, and sometimes gold. They are thick lumps of an
                    irregular round form, bearing on the obverse a device, with in some cases an
                    accompanying inscription, and on the reverse a square or oblong incuse stamp <hi
                    rend="italic">{quadratum incusum),</hi> usually divided in a rude manner. The
                    coins of the second class are of gold, electrum, silver, and bronze. They are
                    much thinner than those of the preceding class, and usually have a convex
                    obverse and a slightly concave or flat reverse. The obverse ordinarily bears a
                    head in bold relief. The coins of the third class are, with very few exceptions,
                    of bronze.</p>
                <p>Ιhey are flat and broad, but thin, and generally have on the obverse the portrait
                    of a Roman emperor. It may be observed that the. common division of Greek coins
                    is into autonomous and imperial, the former comprising all except those of the
                    Roman period which have the effigies of emperors.</p>
                <p>Ιhe different monetary systems of the Greeks grew out of the use of different
                    standards of weight; in other words, their coins were divisions of various
                    talents. To investigate the origin of these monetary systems would demand a
                    complete examination of Greek metrology, which could not be attempted in the
                    present article. It will be well, however, to state in a few words the theory of
                    Dr Brandis, at once the latest and the most satisfactory, though it cannot be
                    said to completely solve the hard series of problems which the documents set
                    before us.</p>
                <p>The source of the Greek systems of weight has been referred to Babylonia, no link
                    having been established with the different metrology of Egypt, a circumstance
                    which may make us pause before finally accepting the results of the inquiry.”
                    The Babylonian weights had a twofold form,—the heavy talent, sometimes called
                    the Assyrian, and the light talent, sometimes called the Babylonian. The heavy
                    talent is the double of the light. Their weights and those of their divisions
                    are thus stated by Dr Brandis on the evidence of the inscribed weights found at
                    Nimrùd, the ancient Calah, in Assyria (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Nineveh),</hi>
                    which are now in the British Museum. The result is approximately true, but it
                    has been shown by a careful re weighing of the objects that the maximum weights
                    rise somewhat higher and the minimum fall somewhat lower than is indicated in
                    the table.</p>

                <p>The heavy talent is supposed to have found its way to Greece by sea from the
                    Phoenician coast-towns, the light talent by land through Lydia. In adopting the
                    Babylonian weights the Phoenicians and Greeks made an important deviation. They
                    accepted the sixtieth of the mina as their shekel or stater, but allowed only
                    fifty instead of sixty of these units to their mina, retaining the sexagesimal
                    division in counting sixty minae to the talent. Thus the Phoenician and Greek
                    talents contained 3000 shekels or staters, not 3600 sixtieths of the mina.</p>
                <p>Two talents thus arose,—that by which the earliest Phocaic gold money was struck,
                    derived from the heavy Babylonian, with a stater having a maximum weight of 256
                    grains, and the Euboic talent, derived from the light Babylonian, with a stater
                    of 130 grains or a little more. The Phocaic was a modification of the Babylonian
                    heavy talent, the Euboic of the light, each having the same stater as the parent
                    weight, but a lower talent. The relation of gold to silver in the earliest days
                    of coined money, about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and for long after,
                    was 13⅜ to 1; consequently it was inconvenient to use the same standard for the
                    two metals. Two systems for silver money are supposed to have arisen from this
                    necessity, and it is here that the most brilliant but least conclusive part of
                    the theory of Dr Brandis begins. The sixtieth of the heavy Babylonian mina
                    weighed 260 grains, its sixtieth again weighed 4'3; this multiplied by 13‘3
                    gives us the Phoenician drachm of 57 grains, introduced into Greece, and the
                    basis of the so-called Graeco-Asiatic or Phoenician silver standard. Four of
                    these drachms produced the Phoenician stater at its maximum of 230 grains. Thus
                    fifteen staters were equal to one gold sixtieth (230 × 15÷13⅛ = 258j, nearly
                    260). Dr Brandis therefore calls this the fifteen-stater system. The Lydians, on
                    the other hand, are supposed to have originated a silver stater by multiplying
                    the sixtieth of the light mina, 130 grains, by 13 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    3 and dividing this by ten, so as to obtain a silver stater of about 170 grains,
                    current long after in Asia Minor. Ten of these staters would thus be equal to
                    one gold sixtieth. This, therefore, is called the ten-stater system.</p>
                <p>The monetary standards of the Greeks (expressed in grains) may be referred to the
                    two original talents in the following manner :—</p>

                <p>In the types of Greek coins (using the term in its restricted sense) the first
                    intention of the designers was to indicate the city or state by which the money
                    was issued. The necessity for distinctive devices was most strongly felt in the
                    earlier days of the art, when the obverse of a coin alone bore a design, and, if
                    any inscription, only the first letter, or the first few letters, of the name of
                    the people by whom it was issued. The motive which dictated the kind of type to
                    be selected was undoubtedly a religious one.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Burgon, in <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Journal,</hi>
                    vol. i. pp. 97 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p></note> There are some isolated
                    instances in which the religious character of a type is doubtful; but these, if
                    proved, would be only exceptions to a general rule. The piety of that age
                    adopted religious devices, and for a long time it was held to be impious to
                    substitute any other representations for them. To the same cause may, perhaps,
                    be partly ascribed the preference on the most ancient coins for devices of a
                    symbolical character to actual representations of divinities, although the
                    difficulty of portraying the human form in the infancy of art must have had
                    considerable influence in this direction.</p>
                <p>Greek coins, if arranged according to their types, fall into three classes: (1)
                    civic coins, and regal without portraits of sovereigns; (2) regal coins bearing
                    portraits; and (3) Graeco-Roman coins, whether with imperial heads or not. The
                    coins of the first class have either a device on the obverse and the <hi
                    rend="italic">quadratum incusum</hi> on the reverse, or two devices; and these
                    last are again either independent of each other, though connected by being both
                    local, or—and this is more common—that on the reverse is a kind of complement of
                    that on the obverse. It will be best first to describe the character of the
                    principal kinds of types of the first class, and then to notice their relation.
                    It must be noted that a head or bust is usually an obverse type, and a figure or
                    group a reverse one, and that, when there is a head on both obverse and reverse,
                    that on the former is usually larger than the other, and represents the
                    personage locally considered to be the more important of the two. We must
                    constantly bear in mind that these types are religious and local if we would
                    understand their meaning. “I do not believe,” Burgon says, “that the types of
                    coins are, on any occasion, original compositions, but always copied (from the
                    earliest to the lowest times) from some sacred public monument. Thus, when we
                    find what is called a Boeotian buckler on coins, we are not to look upon the
                    representation as <hi rend="italic">a Boeotian</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >buckler,</hi> but as <hi rend="italic">the buckler</hi> of some Boeotian hero
                    well known to the ancient inhabitants of that country, and accounted to be
                    sacred by them. In like manner, when we find Minerva represented on coins we are
                    not to understand the type as <hi rend="italic">a Minerva,</hi> but <hi
                    rend="italic">the Minerva of that place</hi>; and, in some cases which might be
                    brought forward, the individual statues which are represented on coins, or
                    ancient copies, will be found to exist. The only example of originality of
                    composition apparent on coins is where types have been <hi rend="italic"
                    >doubled</hi> or <hi rend="italic">halved,</hi> to express similar modifications
                    of value.”</p>
                <p>In the following list the types of Greek coins of cities, and of kings, not
                    having regal portraits, are classed in a systematic order, without reference to
                    their relative antiquity.</p>
                <p>1. Head or figure of a divinity worshipped at the town, or by the people, which
                    issued the coin, as the head of Pallas on coins of Athens, and the figure of
                    Heracles on coins of Boeotian Thebes. Groups are rare until the period of
                    Graeco-Roman coinage.</p>
                <p>2. Sacred natural or artificial objects,—(a) animal sacred to a divinity of the
                    place, as the owl (Athens) and the tortoise (Aegina); <hi rend="italic">{b}</hi>
                    sacred tree or plant, as the silphium (Cyrene) and the olive-branch (Athens);
                    (c) arms or implements of divinities, as the arms of Heracles (Erythrae), the
                    tongs of Vulcan (Aesernia).</p>
                <p>It is difficult to connect many objects comprised in this class with local
                    divinities. The reason of this appears to be that the Hellenes, wherever they
                    colonized, and nowhere more than in Greece, found an earlier system of low
                    nature - worship, and en deavoured to incorporate it into their own more
                    intellectual mythology, sometimes with but partial success.</p>
                <p>3. Head or figure of a local genius, — (a) river-god, as the Gelas (Gela); (ά)
                    nymph of a lake, as Camarina (Camarina); (c) nymph of a fountain, as Arethusa
                    (Syracuse).</p>
                <p>4. Head or figure of a fabulous personage or half-human monster, as a Gorgon
                    (Neapolis Macedoniae), the Minotaur (Cnossus).</p>
                <p>5. Fabulous animal, as Pegasus (Corinth),a griffin (Panticapaeum), the Chimaera
                    (Sicyon).</p>
                <p>6. Head or figure of a hero or founder, as Ulysses (Ithaca), the Lesser Ajax
                    (Locri Opuntii),Taras, founder of Tarentum (Tarentum).</p>
                <p>7. Objects connected with heroes,—animal connected with local hero, as the
                    Calydonian boar or his jaw-bone (Aetolians). Arms of heroes also occur as types,
                    but their attribution to particular personages is difficult or impossible.</p>
                <p>8. Celebrated real or traditional sacred localities, as mountains on which
                    divinities are seated, the labyrinth (Cnossus).</p>
                <p>9. Representations connected with the public religious festivals and contests, as
                    a chariot victorious at the Olympic games (Syracuse).</p>
                <p>The relation of the types of the obverse and reverse of a coin is a matter
                    requiring careful consideration, since they frequently illustrate one another.
                    As we have before observed, this relation is either that of two independent
                    objects, which are connected only by their reference to the same place, or the
                    one is a kind of complement of the other. Among coins illustrating the former
                    class we may instance the beautiful silver didrachms of Camarina, having on the
                    obverse the head of the river-god Hipparis and on the reverse the nymph of the
                    lake carried over its waters by a swan, and those of Sicyon, having on the
                    obverse the Chimaera and on the reverse a dove. The latter class is capable of
                    being separated into several divisions. When the head of a divinity occurs on
                    the obverse of a coin, the reverse is occupied by an object or objects sacred to
                    that divinity. Thus the common Athenian tetradrachms have on the one side the
                    head of Pallas and on the other an owl and an olive - branch; the tetradrachms
                    of the Chalcidians in Macedonia have the head of Apollo and the lyre; and the
                    copper coins of Erythrae have the head of Heracles and his weapons. The same is
                    the case with subjects relating to the heroes: thus there are drachms of the
                    Aetolian League which have on the obverse the head of Atalanta and on the
                    reverse the Calydonian boar, or his jaw-bone and the spear-head with which he
                    was killed. In the same manner the coins of Cnossus, with the Minotaur on the
                    obverse, have on the reverse a plan of the Labyrinth. Besides the two principal
                    devices there are often others of less importance, which, although always
                    sacred, and sometimes symbols of local divinities, are generally indicative of
                    the position of the town, or have some reference to the families of magistrates
                    who used them as badges. Thus, for example, besides such representations as the
                    olive-branch sacred to Pallas on the Athenian tetradrachms, as a kind of second
                    device dolphins are frequently seen on coins of maritime places; and almost
                    every series exhibits many symbols which can only be the badges of the
                    magistrates with whose names they occur. Regal coins of this class, except
                    Alexander’s, usually bear types of a local character, owing to the small extent
                    of most of the kingdoms, which were rather the territories of a city than
                    considerable states at the period when these coins were issued.</p>
                <p>The second great class—that of coins of kings bearing portraits— is necessarily
                    separate from the first. Religious feeling affords the clue to the long
                    exclusion of regal portraits,—the feeling that it would be profane for a mortal
                    to take a place always assigned hitherto to the immortals. Were there any doubt
                    of this, it would be removed by the character of the earliest Greek regal
                    portrait, that of Alexander, which occurs on coins of Lysimachus. This is not
                    the representation of a living personage, but of one who was not only dead but
                    had received a kind of apotheosis, and who, having been already called the son
                    of Zeus Ammon while living, had been treated as a divinity after his death. He
                    is therefore portrayed as a young Zeus Ammon. Probably, however, Alexander would
                    not have been able, even when dead, thus to usurp the place of a divinity upon
                    the coins, had not the Greeks become accustomed to the Oriental “worship” of the
                    sovereign, which he adopted. This innovation rapidly produced a -complete
                    change; every king of the houses which were raised on the ruins of the Greek
                    empire could place his portrait on the money which he issued, and few neglected
                    to do so, while the sovereigns of Egypt and Syria even assumed divine
                    titles.</p>
                <p>The reign of Alexander produced another great change in Greek coinage, very
                    different from that we have noticed. He suppressed the local types almost
                    throughout his empire, and compelled the towns to issue his own money, with some
                    slight différence for mutual distinction. His successors followed the same
                    policy; and thus the coins of this period have a new character. The obverses of
                    regal coins with portraits have the head of the sovereign, which in some few
                    instances gives place to that of his own or his country’s tutelary divinity,
                    while figures of the latter sort almost exclusively occupy the reverses. Small
                    symbols, letters, and monograms on the reverses distinguish the towns in this
                    class.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0690-0633"/>
                <p>The Graeco-Roman coins begin, at different periods, with the seizure by Rome of
                    the territories of the Greek states. They are almost all bronze; and those in
                    that metal are the most characteristic and important. In their types we see a
                    further departure from the religious intention of those of earlier times in the
                    rare admission of representations, not only of eminent persons who had received
                    some kind of apotheosis, such as great poets, but also of others who, although
                    famous, were not, and in some cases probably could not have been, so honoured.
                    We also observe on these coins many types of an allegorical character.</p>
                <p>The following principal kinds of types may be specified, in addition to those of
                    the two previous classes. (1) Head or figure of a famous personage who either
                    had received a kind of apotheosis, as Homer (Smyrna), or had not been so
                    honoured, as Herodotus (Halicarnassus) and Lais (Corinth). (2) Pictorial
                    representations, always of a sacred character, although occasionally bordering
                    on caricature. We may instance, as of the latter sort, a very remarkable type
                    representing Pallas playing on the double pipe and seeing her distorted face
                    reflected in the water, while Marsyas gazes at her from a rock,—a subject
                    illustrating the myth of the invention of that instrument (Apamea Phrygiae). (3)
                    Allegorical types, as Hope, &amp;c., on the coins of Alexandria of Egypt, and
                    many other towns. These were of Greek origin, and owed their popularity to the
                    sculpture executed by Greeks under the empire; but the feeling which rendered
                    such subjects prominent was not that of true Greek art, and they are essentially
                    characteristic of the New Attic school which attained its height at Rome under
                    the early emperors. Of this kind of typer we must again speak in noticing the
                    Roman coinage.</p>
                <p>Those types which were common to this and the older classes were also much
                    developed in their subjects. Thus, for instance, groups frequently took the
                    place of single figures; and the representations of sacred localities acquired a
                    great prominence, the most common being of buildings, which are generally
                    temples. In the architectural types a tendency to pictorial representation is
                    evident in the constant endeavours to depict edifices in perspective.</p>
                <p>There is a class of coins which is always considered as part of the Graeco-Roman,
                    although in some respects distinct. This is the colonial series, struck in Roman
                    coloniae, and having almost always Latin inscriptions. As, however, these
                    coloniae were towns in all parts of the empire, from Emerita in Spain (Merida)
                    to Niniva Claudiopolis (Nineveh) in Assyria, in the midst of a Greek population
                    and often of Greek origin, their coins help to complete the series of civic
                    money, and, as we might expect, do not very markedly differ from the proper
                    Greek imperial coins except in having Latin inscriptions and showing a
                    preference for Roman types.</p>
                <p>We have now to speak of the meaning of the inscriptions of Greek coins. These are
                    either principal or secondary; but the former are always intended when
                    inscriptions are mentioned without qualification, since the secondary ones are
                    non-essential. The inscription of civic money is almost always the name of the
                    people by which it was issued, in the genitive plural, as ΑΘΗΝΑΙΩΝ on coins of
                    the Athenians, ΣYPAKOΣI∩N on coins of the Syracusans. The inscription of regal
                    money is the name, or name and title, of the sovereign in the genitive, as
                    ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ, or BAΣIΛEΩΣ ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ, on coins of Alexander the Great. J <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> his genitive form implies a nominative understood,
                    which has been generally supposed to be <hi rend="italic">νόμισμα,</hi> “money.”
                    There are four instances in which a nominative of this kind occurs in
                    coins,—ΦΑΝΟΣ EMI ΣΗΜΑ, “I am the badge of Phanes,” on an archaic coin of
                    Halicarnassus; ΓOPTYNOΣ TO ΠAIMA, “the struck” money of Gortys, if the form
                    suggested by Μ. François Lenormant be admissible, on an archaic coin of Gortys;
                    and ΣEYΘA ΚΟΜΜΑ, “the stamp” or “coin of Seuthes,” as well as ΣEYΘA APΓYPION,
                    the “silver piece” or “money of Seuthes.” The balance preponderates in favour of
                    the idea that such a word as <hi rend="italic">vbμj,σμa,</hi> or the more
                    definite term for a piece of gold (χpu&lt;τoi⅛), silver <hi rend="italic"
                    >(apyvpiov),</hi> or copper (χαλκoi⅛), was intended. Yet the instances are not
                    sufficient to establish the case. Besides their disagreement, it must be
                    remembered that the coins of Phanes and Gortys belong to the infancy of money in
                    Asia Minor and Crete, and that Seuthes was a semi-barbarous’chieftain. Any one
                    familiar with Greek epigraphy will see the danger of resting on such evidence.
                    In the eighth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi> a
                    different explanation was offered on the authority of the late Mr Burgon, who
                    generously communicated it to the writer. He supposed the inscription to relate
                    to the type, and that the nominative understood is the name of that type.' It
                    should be remarked that the type of the reverse of a civic coin is usually a
                    complement of that of the obverse, and that the converse may be inferred of
                    regal coins; there is thus in general virtually but one type, that of the
                    tutelary divinity or sacred symbol of the city or sovereign. Athenian coins with
                    the inscription AΘH[NAIΩN] have as their obverse type the head of Athene; the
                    meaning of the inscription, according to Burgon’s explanation, would be, not
                    “the money of the Athenians,” but “Athene of the Athenians.” When the name of
                    the divinity represented is written, the nominative understood is supplied. Thus
                    on coins of Syracuse, with the head of Arethusa as the obverse type, we read
                    ΑΡΕΘΟΣΑ—(rev. ) AKOΣIΩN, “Arethusa of the Syracusans,” and on others with the
                    head of Zeus, ΖΕΥΣ ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΟΣ-ΣYPAKOΣIΩN “Zeus the giver of liberty of the
                    Syracusans.” There are instances <hi rend="superscript"> ιn λ</hi> i⅛⅛JJi⅛J <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιaπιe8</hi> tbe divinity and of the people occur together,
                    as ΕΙΡΗΝΗ ΛOKPΩN, “Irene of the Locrians,” on a coin of iz⅛Λ⅛ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> cri</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> ize</hi> P <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> y <hi rend="superscript"> rii</hi> &gt; the obverse
                    having the head and name of ΖΕΥΣ, as though the sense were Zeus (and) Irene of
                    the Locrians. In the case of regal coins Burgon’s theory cannot be applied in
                    strictness. In most cases we could supply the name of the divinity represented
                    on the reverse, as, for the gold staters of Alexander, [ΝΙΚΗ] ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ, and
                    for the silver, [ΖΕΥΣ] ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ; but when the type, as of almost all the
                    Ptolemaic coins, is a symbol, in this case the eagle, some modification is
                    needed. If we suppose that the nominative, understood when none is expressed, or
                    implied when a divinity is named, is some word expressing the idea conveyed by
                    the badge, as Zeus by the eagle, we shall probably be not far from the truth.
                    The secondary inscriptions either describe secondary types, as ΑΘΛΑ, “rewards,”
                    accompanying the representation of the arms given to the victor in the exergues
                    of Syracusan decadrachms,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It is scarcely to be doubted that the arms on the Syracusan decadrachms
                    represent a reward given to an Olympic competitor or competitors on returning
                    home.</p></note> or are the names of magistrates or other officers, or in regal
                    coins those of cities, or are those of the engravers of the dies, of whom
                    sometimes two were employed, one for the obverse and the other for the reverse,
                    or are dates. These inscriptions are often but abbreviations or monograms,
                    especially when they indicate cities on the regal coins.</p>
                <p>The importance of Greek coins as illustrating the character of contemporary art
                    cannot be easily overrated. They are beyond all other monuments the grammar of
                    Greek art. Their geographical and historical range is only limited by Greek
                    history and the Greek world; as a series they may be called complete; in quality
                    they are usually worthy of a place beside contemporary sculpture, having indeed
                    a more uniform merit; they are sometimes the work of great artists, and there is
                    no question of their authenticity, nor have they suffered from the injurious
                    hand of the restorer. Thus they tell us what other· monuments leave untold,
                    filling up gaps in the sequence of works of art, and revealing local schools
                    known from them alone.</p>
                <p>The art of coins belongs to the province of relief, which lies between the
                    domains of sculpture and of painting, partaking of the character of both, but
                    most influenced by that which was dominant in each age. Thus in antiquity relief
                    mainly shows the rule of sculpture, in the Renaissance that of painting.</p>
                <p>Sculpture best represents character (⅞0os), painting expression (τα 7rα07}).
                    Character is the permanent aspect of the face and figure as denoting the
                    dominant quality. Thus a great statue may be not unfairly described by a single
                    epithet. Expression is the transient but intense effect of some sudden feeling.
                    A single figure in a painting requires a fuller description than a statue; the
                    character is seen beneath the expression. Sculpture aims at embodying the ideal,
                    and when it represents the real it must show the fulness of all qualities and
                    even of all potentialities. Repose is the condition of sculpture. Painting
                    having for its purpose the representation of light (colour), and the effects of
                    light in bodies, can only deal with the circumstances of the moment. Movement is
                    implied in painting.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On
                    the whole subject cf. C. O. Müller, <hi rend="italic">Archäologie der</hi><hi

                    and painting that is sculpturesque belong to the decline of art. Expression of a
                    <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> supreme kind is, however, found in sculpture of
                    high quality, especially in that kind of relief which lies nearest to sculpture,
                    alto-rilievo; and character is seen in noble portraits which endeavour to
                    represent the man in his completeness. But such sculpture is properly in groups
                    and such painting in the single form. The group suggests the treatment of
                    painting, the single form in pictorial art that of sculpture. Relief, as
                    intermediate between sculpture and painting, admits separately of movement and
                    the momentary action, but the movement must be of the most dignified and
                    rhythmical kind, otherwise it will need colour to counteract confusion by a
                    higher harmony, and the momentary action must be of supreme importance. Observe
                    the dignity and rhythm of the Panathenaic frieze of the Parthenon, the want of
                    colour in the Amazon frieze of the Mausoleum, contrasting it with the noble
                    fragmentary chariot frieze, and the supreme moment chosen in the metopes of the
                    Parthenon.</p>
                <p>Relief is usually divided into three kinds, low, middle, and high (basso-,
                    mezzo-, and alto-rilievo), and it is convenient to retain these terms while
                    admitting that they are only roughly correct. Work to be viewed in a feeble
                    light and from a distance must have clearness in the most necessary outlines,
                    and that simplicity which equally marks the Panathenaic frieze. It admits of
                    simple and general movement. This is low relief, and must not be too much raised
                    from the background. High relief difiers from sculpture in the round in that it
                    is not necessarily detached from the background, nor usually of the full depth
                    of true proportion, and in <pb break="no"

                    so simply treated as to be free from confusion due to the shadows upon them, and
                    not to cast shadows. It should thus be simple in the forms. It admits of
                    expression of the highest kind, which is almost suggested by the relation of the
                    figures which constitute a group, but it does not allow movement. Middle relief,
                    inasmuch as it is used for objects to be seen near, is delicate in its outlines
                    and may be elaborate in its details. The sculptured columns of the temple of
                    Artemis at Ephesus show the delicacy of the method and coins and gems its
                    delight in elaboration. All coins should be treated in this manner, and it is
                    usual in the entire range of those of the Greeks, although the influence of
                    sculpture on relief of other kinds is constantly traceable.</p>
                <p>It may be expected that Greek coins will bear the impress of the sister arts of
                    sculpture and painting, filling up the gaps in the sequence of examples of the
                    art of which we have remains, telling us somewhat of that which has but a
                    written tradition. Our first duty is to endeavour to place the documents in the
                    best order, separating the geographical from the historical indications, first
                    examining the evidence of local schools, then those of the succession of styles.
                    It is from coins alone that we can discover the existence of great local
                    schools, reflecting the character of the different branches of the Hellenic
                    race. In tracing the changes in these schools we gain a great addition to our
                    ideas of the successive styles, and can detect new examples of those which owe
                    their fame to the leading masters. But in dealing with works in relief we have
                    the advantage due to their intermediate character. In our larger geographical
                    horizon we can trace the character of the successive styles, not of sculpture
                    only, but also of sculpture and painting.</p>
                <p>Greek coins clearly indicate three great schools, each with its subordinate
                    groups. The school of central Greece holds the first place, including the
                    northern group centred in Thrace and Macedonia, and the southern in the
                    Peloponnesus, with the outlying special schools of Crete and Cyrene. The Ionian
                    school has its northern group, Ionia, Mysia, and Aeolis, and its southern,
                    Rhodes and Caria. Beyond these are certain barbarous and semi-barbarous groups,
                    of which the most important is that of eastern Asia Minor, Persia, and
                    Phoenicia, with Cyprus. The school of the West comprises the two groups of Italy
                    and Sicily.</p>
                <p>The whole duration of the schools is limited, by the repulse of the Persians and
                    the accession of Alexander, from 480 to 332 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Before this age all is archaic, and it is hard to trace local characteristics.
                    After it, the centralizing policy of the sovereigns and the fall of the free
                    cities destroyed local art. In certain cultivated centres under enlightened
                    kings a local art arose, but it speedily became general, and we have thus to
                    think of a succession of styles during the rest of the life of Greek art. The
                    century and a half of the local schools is significantly the great age of this
                    art.</p>
                <p>In the study of each school we have first to determine its character, and then to
                    look in its successive phases for the influence of the great masters of style.
                    Two dangers must be avoided. We must not too sharply divide the sculptors and
                    the painters as if they always were true to the special functions of their arts.
                    It is well to bear in mind that the earliest great painter, Polygnotus, was a
                    portrayer of character, <hi rend="italic">καλό; -ηθογράφος, -ηθικός,</hi> as
                    Aristotle calls him, whereas the latest great sculptors represented expression.
                    Thus sculpture first weighed down the balance, afterwards painting; but it must
                    be remembered that relief can be truer to painting than sculpture in the round,
                    which is more limited by the conditions of the material and mechanical
                    necessities. Our second danger is due to the ease with which local qualities may
                    be ascribed to the influence of a leading style. It is also to be borne in mind
                    that the movement of art in coins was during one period slower than in
                    sculpture,—hence an influence more general than particular. Phidias and Myron do
                    not make their mark so much as Polyclitus. In all cases the direct influence of
                    great masters is to be looked for later than their age. The style of their time
                    is prevalent in the coins, their actual works do not produce imitations till
                    later, and as this is so we must regard the reflexions as influenced by the
                    atmosphere in which they were produced. A Hera of the age of Polyclitus may be
                    truer to the style of this artist than a later one which was produced under the
                    influence of his famous statue.</p>
                <p>The school of central Greece in its southern group, comprehending Attica, is
                    remarkable for its widespread extent. It has its colonies in Magna Graecia at
                    Thurium, an Athenian foundation, probably at Terina, and in Macedonia at
                    Amphipolis and Chalcidice under Athenian rule. It alone shows instances
                    comparable to the works of Phidias, though its most numerous fine works are of
                    the age of Polyclitus and that of Praxiteles and Scopas. Its qualities may be
                    seen by comparison of the same subjects as treated by the other schools and
                    groups. The earliest works are marked more than any others by the qualities of
                    high promise which characterized the Aeginetan marbles,—the same dignified
                    self-restraint and calm simplicity. Next we perceive a series strong in style,
                    and showing that lofty dignity, that reposeful embodiment of character, which
                    are the stamp of the works of Phidias and his contemporaries. The subjects are
                    more remarkable for fidelity, breadth, and boldness than for delicacy of
                    execution or elaboration of ornament. Every subject is ideal, even the portrayal
                    of animal form. Thus the character shows us what divinity is intended and the
                    ideality what is intended by the representation of beast or bird. From these
                    works we pass to those which reflect the style of the time of Praxiteles and
                    Scopas, when the influence of painting began to be felt, and art inclined
                    towards feeling and descended to sentiment. Still, to the last, character rules
                    these coins, and the chief difference we see is in the increased love of beauty
                    for its own sake and the fondness for representing movement, not to the
                    exclusion of repose, but by its side. In other respects there is little change
                    except in the finer execution and more ornamental quality of the work. Even when
                    the greatest achievement of the Sicilian school, the head of Persephone on the
                    decadrachms of Syracuse, is copied by the Locrians and the Messenians, the
                    larger quality of the school of Greece asserts itself, and the copy is better
                    than the original: there is less artifice and more breadth. The northern group
                    is at first ruder, in the age of Phidias severer, and afterwards it merges into
                    the greater softness of its southern rival. If it copies, as Larissa may copy
                    Syracuse and Neapolis in Campania, it again asserts its superior simplicity, and
                    we prefer the copy to the original.</p>
                <p>The Ionian school lacks the sequence which the rest of the Greek world affords.
                    It is broken by the baneful influence of the Persian dominion, and consequently
                    the best works belong to the earliest and latest part of the period. The
                    earliest coins, of the Aeginetan age, present nothing special; the later, of the
                    time of Praxiteles and Scopas, comprise works not inferior to those of central
                    Greece, and remarkable, like the Western and the Cretan, as the sole records of
                    a school otherwise unknown. They are markedly characterized by the qualities of
                    the style of feeling, that of Praxiteles and Scopas; but more than this, they
                    are the expression of that style in pictorial form. They represent expression,
                    and they treat it as it could not be treated in sculpture in the round,
                    portraying locks streaming in the air and flowing draperies. At the same time,
                    they are true to the highest qualities of art. Each divinity is at once
                    recognized. Persephone has not the maidenly sweetness she wears in Hellas, but
                    the melancholy foresight of her fate; she has not the character but the
                    expression of the goddess. It must be remembered that, while Hellas produced the
                    great sculptors, western Asia Minor bred the great painters after Polygnotus,
                    himself a sculptor in painting rather than a painter. In the native land of
                    Zeuxis, Parrhasius, and Apelles we see the evidence of the rule of painting. The
                    execution of even the smallest works of this school is marked by the subtlest
                    modulations of form, and here again we see the quality of the painter, who,
                    having to represent solid objects on a plane, must have the highest knowledge of
                    anatomy. The power of expression and the knowledge of what underlies the surface
                    of the face are carried even in the smallest works just alluded to, as the
                    Cyzicene hectae, to a degree of excellence which baffles modern critical power.
                    The technical skill is inferior to that of the West, yet the skill in modelling
                    is far greater, and has no parallel in the medallic work of any other time or
                    country.</p>
                <p>The school of the West, if we except such outlying examples of the art of Hellas
                    as those of Thurium and Terina, has its highest expression in Italy, its most
                    characteristic in Sicily. It has distinctive qualities throughout the age. Even
                    in the earlier period we trace a striving after beauty and. a delicacy of
                    finish, with a weakness of purpose, that mark the school with an influence
                    increasing to a time long after the extinction of its rivals. We trace neither
                    clearness of character nor force of expression. The Persephone of Syracuse is
                    merely a beautiful girl. More than this, her beauty is shown off by the
                    portrayal of the artifices of civilized life, emphasized by tricks of style. At
                    the same time there is a knowledge of the capacity of the materials and the form
                    of the coin, and a masterly power of finish, on the whole a completeness of
                    technical skill which is unequalled. The result in the lower subjects is
                    splendid, if wanting in variety, but in the higher we miss the noble
                    achievements of the greater schools. So far there is a general agreement in the
                    northern and southern groups. Yet the Italian shows a nobler and simpler style,
                    with some affinity to that of central Greece, which we look for in vain in
                    Sicily, though we are dazzled by the rich beauty of the magnificent series of
                    coins which marks her wealthiest age. Sicilian art has this apparent advantage,
                    that the great cities, save Syracuse, perished in the Carthaginian invasion, or
                    under the tyranny of the elder Dionysius. Thus we have no important works save
                    of Syracuse during the second half of our period, and cannot judge fully to what
                    this school would have fallen. The key to this exceptional development of Greek
                    art is found in the absence of sculptors or painters in the West, except only
                    Pythagoras of Rhegium at the very beginning of the age, whose influence is
                    thought to be traceable on the money of his native town. The Western art is that
                    of engravers accustomed to minute and decorative work, uninfluenced by sculpture
                    or painting. Their designs will not bear enlargement, which only enhances the
                    charm of those of the other leading schools. Those of the great Syracusan
                    decadrachms are small; those of the minute hectae of Cvzicus are large.</p>

                <p>The most important of the lesser schools is the Cretan. Crete, retaining the
                    primitive life of older Hellas, was never truly civilized, but enjoyed to the
                    last the privileges and exhibited the faults of an undeveloped condition.
                    Producing in the age of high art neither sculptor nor painter of renown, the
                    Cretans, to judge from their coins, were copyists of nature or art. At first
                    rude, their work acquires excellence in design, but never in execution. While we
                    see their poor reproductions of the designs of the Peloponnesus, we are amazed
                    by their skill in portraying nature. Their gods are seated in trees with a
                    background of foliage. Their bulls are sketched as they wandered in the meadows.
                    All fitness for the mode of relief, as well as for the material and the shape of
                    the coin, is entirely ignored. Hence a delight in foreshortening, and a free
                    choice of subject with no reference to the circle in which it must be figured.
                    In spite, however, of their skill, the Cretans never attempted the three-quarter
                    face, which is at once the best suited to the surface of a coin and the most
                    trying to the skill of the artist. Yet their work is delightfully fresh, as if
                    done in the open air. There is no idealism, but much life and movement. In a
                    word, the school is naturalistic and picturesque. Its works are of the highest
                    value in the study of Greek art, but as examples of the application of that art
                    to coins they are to be used with caution. Nowhere else do λve see the artist so
                    freely copying nature and art, nowhere so unshackled by academic rules, nowhere
                    so little aware of the limitation of his province.</p>
                <p>It is important to study the mode in which Greek money was coined, because the
                    forms of the pieces thus receive explanation, and true coins are discriminated
                    from such modern falsifications as have been struck, and in some degree from
                    those which have been cast. Our direct information on the subject is extremely
                    scanty, but we are enabled by careful inference to obtain a very near
                    approximation to the truth on all the most important points.</p>
                <p>The only single ancient Greek die of the authenticity of which we are persuaded
                    was seen by Burgon in the East. He described it, from recollection, as a piece
                    of copper or bell-metal, in the shape of a truncated cone, flat at the top and
                    bottom, about 3⅛ inches in height, and from about 3 inches in diameter at the
                    bottom to 2 at the top. In the upper surface was cut the die for the reverse of
                    a tetradrachm of a Seleucid king of Syria, with the type of Apollo seated on the
                    omphalos. There appears to have been no trace of any method of fitting this to
                    the die of the obverse. From the appearance which the coins present, it may be
                    inferred that the Greeks placed a ball of metal, carefully adjusted to the
                    proper weight, and cold, between two dies, and then struck the upper die a
                    powerful blow with a very heavy hammer. There was no collar to give the coins an
                    exactly circular form. The dies must have been of hard metal, though softer than
                    modern ones. Some Greek coins have been found of the same die, but such as the
                    writer has seen did not present any evidence as to the wear to which their dies
                    had been subjected. The Roman coins appear to have been struck in the same
                    manner, but with a more careful adjustment of the two sides, yet without a
                    collar. Their dies, although hard, must have been, like the Greek dies, softer
                    than those of the moderns, since, in the case of coins from the same die, we can
                    trace the increase of imperfections through wear, and this notwithstanding the
                    short period for which each die was used and the relatively few coins struck
                    from it. In the case of Greek coins, there is similar evidence, in the great
                    number which have bad or imperfect impressions, although not worn, since all
                    these can scarcely owe their inferiority to insufficient force having been used
                    in striking them. Some few Greek and Roman coins were cast and not struck;
                    others were first cast to give them their general form, and then struck. Both
                    cases, however, form very rare exceptions, and are confined to particular groups
                    of coins and not to isolated examples.</p>
                <p>We may now pass on to notice the Greek coinage of each country, following
                    Eckhel’s arrangement. The series begins with Spain, Gaul, and Britain,
                    constituting the only great class of barbarous Greek coinage. It must not be
                    supposed that the money of the whole class is of one general character; on the
                    contrary, it has very many divisions, distinguished by marked peculiarities; it
                    has, however, everywhere one common characteristic,—its devices are corrupt
                    copies of those of Greek or Roman coins. The earliest of these barbarous
                    coinages begin with the best imitations of the gold and silver money of Philip
                    II. of Macedon. They probably first appeared to the north of his kingdom, but
                    the gold soon spread as far as Gaul, and even found their λvay into southern
                    Britain, by which time the original types had almost disappeared through
                    successive degradations. Next in order of time are the silver imitations of
                    Roman family coins, the victoriati and denarii of the commonwealth, which began
                    in Spain and passed into Gaul and Britain, being current in those countries with
                    the gold money of Greek origin. The copper money of Spain follows the imitated
                    silver types; that of Gaul and Britain, though showing Roman influence, is more
                    original. It is useless to attempt a very minute classification of the subjects
                    of these barbarous types, since the artists by whom they were executed did not
                    properly understand them.</p>
                <p>Side by side with these large coinages we find Greek money of colonies in Gaul
                    and Spain, and a far ampler issue of Phcenician coins by the Carthaginian kings
                    and cities of the Peninsula. The coinage of Hispania, corresponding to the
                    modern Spain and 1 ortugal, was issued during a period of about four centuries,
                    closing in 41 A.D. There are four classes of money, which in the order of their
                    relative antiquity are Greek, of two groups, Carthaginian, Romano-Iberian, and
                    Latin. The first or older group of Greek money belongs to the widespread
                    currency which reveals the maritime power of the Ionians of Phocaea. It consists
                    of fractions of the drachm of the Phocaean standard, from the diobol or third
                    downwards. Its later pieces are of the Phocaean colony of Emporiae, founded by
                    the earlier settlement of Massilia. Next in order and in part contemporary,
                    beginning before the middle of the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    come the drachms of Emporiae, which betray the influence of Siculo-Punic art.
                    Their standard is probably Carthaginian. Of the neighbouring Rhoda, a Rhodian
                    colony, there is similar money. Carthaginian coins of Spain begin in the same
                    period with the issues of the great colony of Gades, following the same weights
                    as the Emporian drachms. These are followed by the issues of the Barcides from
                    234 to 210 B.c., with Carthaginian types and of Phoenician weight, struck of six
                    denominations, from the hexadrachm to the hemidrachm. Senor Zobel de Zangr6niz
                    has classed them to Spain, on the grounds of provenance and the possession of
                    the silver mines by the Barcide kings, against Müller, who attributes them to
                    Africa. The types are Carthaginian, and present some interesting subjects. The
                    true Iberian currency begins not long after the Punic. The later drachms of
                    Emporiae, ultimately following the weight of the contemporary Roman denarius,
                    have Iberian legends, and form the centre of a group of imitations issued by
                    neighbouring native tribes with their distinctive inscriptions. This coinage
                    ceased when the Roman province was formed in 206 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>
                    A little before this date the Romans had begun to introduce Latin money; about
                    this time, however, they took the backward step of permitting native coinages of
                    Latin weight. Probably they found that native legends and types were more
                    welcome to their subjects than those of Rome. Consequently this coinage of Spain
                    under the republic, which lasted until 133 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> may
                    be almost considered national. The two provinces Hispania Citerior and Hispania
                    Ulterior have this marked difference: the coins of the nearer province, of
                    silver and bronze, have always Iberian inscriptions on the reverse, and are
                    clearly under distinct Roman regulation; those of the farther are apparently of
                    independent origin, and consequently bear Iberian, Phoenician, Libyo-Phoenician,
                    and Latin legends, but they are of bronze alone. The interest of these coins
                    lies mainly in their historical and geographical information. They bear the
                    names of tribes, often the same as those of the town of mintage. The art is
                    poor, and lacks the quaint originality and decorative quality of that of Gaul.
                    Ultimately the native money was wholly Latinized (133 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> though political circumstances for a time renewed it under
                    Sertorius (80-72 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> in the modified form of a
                    bilingual currency. The purely Latin issues of the two provinces, and under the
                    empire more largely (from 27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> of the three,
                    Tarraconensis, Baetica, and Lusitania, present little of interest. They closed
                    in the reign of Caligula (37-41 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>), though in later
                    times purely Roman money in gold and silver was issued at different times in
                    Hispania down to the establishment of the Visigothic kingdom.</p>
                <p>The imperial money of Hispania introduces us to one of the two great classes of
                    provincial coins under the empire; the larger of these was the Greek imperial,
                    bearing Greek inscriptions, the smaller the Roman colonial, with Latin
                    inscriptions, deriving its name from the circumstance that among Greek-speaking
                    nations the coloniae were distinguished by the use of the Latin language on
                    their money. In the coinage of Hispania, issued by a nation adopting Latin for
                    official use, the aspect of the coinage is colonial, though it was not wholly
                    issued by colonies. Many of the Spanish towns .belong to the kindred class of
                    municipia; others are neither coloniae nor municipia. In Hispania the obverse of
                    the coin bears, as usual in the colonial class, the head of the emperor or of
                    some imperial personage, the reverse a subject proper to the town. The priest
                    guiding a plough drawn by a yoke of oxen is peculiarly proper to a colonia, as
                    portraying the ceremony of describing the walls of the city, so also an ox, with
                    the same reference, the altar of the imperial founder, or, as connected with his
                    cultus, a temple, probably in some cases that of Roma and Augustus. Other types,
                    however, portray the old temples in restored Roman shapes, or indicate directly
                    by fishes, ears of corn, and more rarely bunches of grapes, the products of the
                    country, not, as in Greek cities, those products in relation to religion. Some
                    original and grotesque types have a markedly local character. The money of
                    Augusta Emerita (Merida) in Lusitania, a colony of pensioners (emeriti), is
                    specially interesting, including as it does the silver issues of P. Carisius,
                    the legatus of Augustus.</p>
                <p>The coinage commonly called that of Gaul belongs to the people more properly than
                    to the country; for it comprehends pieces issued by the Gauls or other
                    barbarians from the borders of Macedonia and Illyricum to the English Channel
                    and the Bay of Biscay, through Pannonia, part of Germany, Helvetia, and Gaul. It
                    influenced<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n693/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0693-0636"/> the money of northern Italy, and, crossing the
                    Channel, produced that of Britain, which has its own distinctive features. Four
                    classes of coinage are found in these vast limits. Arranging them by date, they
                    are the money of the Greek colony of Massilia and her dependencies, that of the
                    Gauls and other barbarians of central and western Europe, those which can be
                    classed to the tribes and chiefs of Gaul, and the imperial coinage of that
                    country. The coins here attributed to the Gauls and other barbarians are by some
                    numismatists classed to Pannonia. It is quite true that the silver money of this
                    class is not found in Gaul, but in the case of the gold it is impossible to draw
                    a distinct geographical line. Further, no nation is so likely to have struck the
                    bulk of these pieces as the plunderers of the Greek cities; at the same time,
                    there are Thracian and other barbarous mintages which are not Gaulish. The gold
                    money cannot be limited to any one country; it is common to all, having
                    evidently spread as a safe commercial medium; the silver, on the other hand,
                    remained limited to the neighbourhood of the Macedonian territory. Thus, though
                    we may separate certain eastern issues, the general designation of the whole
                    group as issued by the Gauls and other barbarians is safest, so long as the
                    great class of gold remains common to the whole region, and even in some
                    varieties to Britain apart from the true British coinage—unless, indeed, its
                    presence there is due to commerce.</p>
                <p>The great mart of Massilia (Marseilles), founded about 600 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> by the Phocaeans, was the centre of the Greek settlements of Gaul and
                    northern Spain. Emporiae was her colony, with other nearer towns of inferior
                    fame. Yet Massilia always held the first place, as is proved by the abundance of
                    her money. At first it consisted of Phocaean obols, part of the widespread
                    Western currency already noticed in speaking of Emporiae. These were succeeded
                    by Attic drachms, some of which, about Philip of Macedon’s time, are beautiful
                    in style and execution. Their obverse type is the head of Artemis, crowned with
                    olive, at once marking the sacred tree, which had grown from a branch carried by
                    the colonists, so tradition said, with a statue of the goddess, from Ephesus,
                    and proclaiming the value of the olive-groves of Massilia. On the reverse we
                    note the Asiatic lion, common to it and the last colony of Phocaea, the Italian
                    Velia in Lucania.</p>
                <p>The coinage of the Gauls clearly had its origin in their predatory incursions
                    into Greece. They there found the money of Philip and Alexander still the great
                    currency. Civilized enough to convert their spoil from metal into money, they
                    speedily coined gold and silver, of which the earliest examples imitate, often
                    with no small intelligence, the gold staters or didrachms of Philip and the
                    silver staters or tetradrachms of Alexander. From the greater rarity of
                    Alexandrine types in silver and their absence in gold, it may be conjectured
                    that the earliest issues were struck in Philip’s reign, though the mass of the
                    coinage must be later. The money of Gallia before the complete Roman conquest,
                    to which it may be anterior in its commencement by half a century, belongs in
                    the gold to degraded types of the earlier widespread currency. The undoubted
                    gold and electrum of this class, identified as bearing regal or geographical
                    names, are extremely limited. By far the most interesting coin of the group is
                    the gold piece which bears the name at full length of the brave and unfortunate
                    Vercingetorix. The silver money is comparatively common. The name of the
                    Helvetian prince Orgetorix is likewise traced on Gaulish coins, on which it
                    appears allied with those of native chiefs, and in a special coinage of his own,
                    remarkable for the characteristic Swiss type of the bear. The bronze money of
                    Gaul is still more abundant than the silver, and has a special interest from its
                    characteristic types. The Roman coins recall those of Hispania, but are limited
                    to a few coloniae. They range in date from Antony and Augustus to Claudius. The
                    principal issues are the well-known money of Lugdunum (Lyons) and Nemausus
                    (Nîmes). Those of Lugdunum may have been struck iu a district around the city;
                    the type of the famous altar of Lyons, that of Roma and Augustus, is worthy of
                    note. The type of Nemausus, commemorating the conquest of Egypt in the crocodile
                    and palm, is further remarkable as sometimes struck in the shape of the hind-leg
                    of a deer, and is therefore called the <hi rend="italic">pied de biche.</hi></p>
                <p>The ancient coinage of Britain is the child of that of Gaul, retaining the marks
                    of its parentage, yet with characters of its own due to independent growth.
                    Μoney first came in trade by the easiest sea-passage, and, once established in
                    Kent, gradually spread north and west, until the age of the earlier Roman Avars,
                    when it was issued in Yorkshire, probably in Lincolnshire, and in a territory of
                    λvhich the northern limits are marked by the counties of Norfolk, Cambridge,
                    Huntingdon, Bedford, Buckingham, Oxford, Gloucester, and Somerset. The oldest
                    coins are gold imitations of Philip’s staters, which, whether struck in Gaul or
                    Britain, had a circulation on the British side of the Channel. They are the
                    prototypes of all later money. From a careful comparison of their weights with
                    those of later coins, and from a study of the gradual degradation of the types,
                    Evans places the origin of the coinage between 200 and 150 B. c. Its close may
                    be placed about the middle of the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D.
                    The inscribed coins occupy the last century of this period, being contemporary
                    with uninscribed ones. The uninscribed coins are of gold, silver, bronze, and
                    tin, the gold being by far the most common. There is small variety in the types,
                    nearly all in gold and silver, and some in copper, presenting in more or less
                    degraded form the original Gaulish type for gold. It may be suspected that all
                    new types and the extremely barbarous descendant of the tin series are of the
                    age of the inscribed coins, or but little earlier. The Channel Islands are
                    remarkable for a peculiar coinage of billon, a very base silver, presenting the
                    usual types modified by Gaulish grotesqueness. The place of this group in the
                    British series is merely accidental; in character as in geography it is
                    Gaulish.</p>
                <p>The inscribed coins are evidently in most cases of chiefs, though it is certain
                    that one town (Verulamium) and some tribes had the right of striking money. The
                    most interesting coins are those of known chiefs and their families—of Commius,
                    probably the active prince mentioned by Caesar, of Dubnovellaunus, mentioned in
                    the famous Ancyra inscription, which has been called the will of Augustus, and
                    most of all the large and interesting series of Cunobelinus, Shakespeare’s
                    Cymbeline, his brother Epaticcus, and his father Tasciovanus. It is evident from
                    the coins and historical evidence collected by Evans that Tasciovanus had a long
                    reign. His chief town, as we learn from his money, was Verulamium. His coins are
                    in three metals, repeat the traditional types, and present new ones, some
                    showing a distinctly Roman influence. The money of Epaticcus is scanty, but that
                    of Cunobelinus, with Camulodunum (Colchester) for his chief town, is even more
                    abundant than his father’s, indicating a second long reign, and having the same
                    general characteristics. The gold shows a modification of the traditional type,
                    the silver and bronze the free action of Roman influence and a remarkable
                    progress in art. With the death of this prince not long before 43 A.D. British
                    coinage probably ceases, none being known of his sons, Adminius, Togodumnus, and
                    the more famous Caractacus, though the coins of the Iceni may have continued as
                    late as 50 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This summary is from Evans’s <hi rend="italic">Coins of the

                <p>The ancient coins of Italy occupy the next place. They appear to have been struck
                    during a period of more than 500 years, the oldest being probably of the
                    beginning of the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and the latest
                    somewhat anterior to the time of Julius Caesar. The larger number, however, are
                    of the age before the great extension of Roman power, which soon led to the use
                    of Roman money almost throughout Italy. There are two great classes, which may
                    be called the proper Italian and the Graeco-Italian; but many coins cannot be
                    referred to either, since they present peculiarities of both. The proper Italian
                    coius are of gold, silver, and bronze. Of these, the gold coins are extremely
                    rare, and can never have been struck in any large numbers. The silver are
                    comparatively common, but the bronze are very numerous and characteristic. Some
                    of the silver coins have an incuse device on the reverse, which is almost always
                    a repetition of that on the obverse; they are of Greek cities, but their fabric
                    is peculiar to Italy. There are also a few with a design on the obverse and a
                    perfectly plain reverse. The most remarkable bronze coins of this class are of
                    the kind called aes grave, some of which were the early proper coinage of Rome,
                    although others are known to have been struck by other Italian cities. These are
                    very thick coins, some of which are of great size, while most have a rude
                    appearance. The designs of the Italian coins are generally, if not always, of
                    Greek origin, although the influence of the native mythology may be sometimes
                    traced. The inscriptions are in Latin, Oscan, or Etruscan, and follow a native
                    orthography; sometimes on the earlier coins they are retrograde. The art of this
                    class is generally poor, or even barbarous. The denominations are common to
                    Greek money, except in the case of the bronze, which follows a native system. Of
                    this system the early proper Roman coins afford the best known examples. The
                    Graeco-Italian coins are of gold, silver, and bronze. The silver and .bronze are
                    very common, and the gold comparatively so, although struck by few states or
                    cities. In form the silver and bronze coins are thicker than those of Greece of
                    the same period, but there is not the same difference in the gold. The designs
                    are of Greek origin, although here, as in the proper Italian coins, but less
                    markedly, native influence can be detected. This influence is evident in the
                    frequent occurrence of types symbolically representing rivers, showing a bias
                    towards the old nature - worship, and still more in the use of Latin
                    inscriptions, with half-Italian forms of the letters on coins otherwise Greek.
                    Of the best art of ancient Italian money we have already spoken, and we shall
                    have occasion to mention some of its most beautiful examples. The denominations
                    of the gold and silver coins are unquestionably derived from those of Greece,
                    according to the weight of the Attic talent, the heaviest gold piece being the
                    stater or 3000th part of that talent; in silver there are few tetradrachms, the
                    didrachms are extremely common, and smaller denominations are usually not rare.
                    We thus learn that the silver currency was chiefly of didrachms, smaller pieces
                    being less used, and larger ones scarcely used at all. It is important here to
                    notice that the interchange of the native or Italian bronze coinage with the
                    Greek silver coinage led to a double standard, silver and bronze. The bronze
                    standard, as might be suspected, was of Italian origin, the silver of foreign
                    introduction.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n694/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0694-0637"/>
                <p>The peculiarity of the Italian bronze is that in its oldest cast form it was of
                    such weight as to show the absence in some parts of the country of silver
                    equivalents. It was long after silver had been introduced everywhere, with
                    struck bronze equivalents, before the heavy coinage (aes grave) went out of
                    circulation. The silver money is at first remarkable for the evidence it affords
                    of its extraneous character in presenting two standards. Afterwards it becomes
                    equivalent to the bronze, or supplies equivalent pieces, and is quite regular.
                    The original condition of the Italian currencies is best illustrated by the
                    money of Etruria about 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Etruria, be it
                    remembered, was an early goal of Oriental commerce by sea. At the great mart of
                    Populonia, and in the country round, we find not only silver coins of two
                    different foreign standards, the Attic and the so-called Persic, but also cast
                    aes grave and later struck bronze pieces issued before the cast money had fallen
                    into disuse. Without discussing the origin of these various currencies it is
                    enough to note that they bear witness to the effects of a widely-spread
                    commerce, and show that here was the meeting-point of the native system and of
                    foreign ones.</p>
                <p>In Italy the aes grave long ruled. Originally it was libral, the principal coin
                    being the as, nominally of the weight of a Roman libra or pound. In the coinage
                    of Rome the as does not seem to have ever exceeded the weight of ten ounces, or
                    ten-twelfths of its proper weight. On the other hand, the aes grave of Etruria
                    is occasionally heavier. The Romans made the quarter denarius, called the
                    sestertius, the silver equivalent of the libral as; the earliest weight of this
                    coin was about 17'156 grs.; and, the value of silver to bronze being as 1 to
                    250, we thus obtain 4290, or about ten libral ounces, as the original weight of
                    the libral as. The successive reductions of the as belong to Roman numismatics,
                    and it is only necessary here to add that they affected the local bronze
                    coinages as Italy fell under the rule of the republic. The silver coinages, on
                    the other hand, survived for a longer time throughout the Greek cities. Their
                    coin corresponding to the sestertius, as the equivalent of the libral as, was
                    the Attic diobolon, which, originally of 22'5 grs., was at once reduced to about
                    18, and of course reduced the didrachm at the same time, which, really Attic,
                    became apparently Phoenician; it was the principal silver coin of the cities of
                    Magna Graecia. The purely Italian currency rules in northern and middle Italy.
                    The great Greek coinages are of the wealthy marts which dotted the coasts of
                    Campania, Calabria, Lucania, and the Bruttii. Similarly λve find Etruscan
                    inscriptions on the coins of Etruria, and Oscan on those of middle and lower
                    Italy, where they are eclipsed in number and style by the Greek issues.</p>
                <p>Beginning in the north of Italy, the first coins that strike us are those of
                    Populonia in Etruria. The silver money of this place is generally of the
                    peculiar fabric in which the reverse is left perfectly plain. The aes grave of
                    upper and middle Italy is of great importance. It presents the great oblong
                    masses of uncertain weight, multiples of the as, which wear an aspect of great
                    antiquity, though the elephant on one shows us that they were cast after the
                    wars of Pyrrhus. Latium is particularly rich, even when we exclude the coinage
                    of Rome (to be treated later). Samnium shows us a curious revival of native
                    silver money after the local coinage of the Italian towns had been almost
                    abolished by Rome. It was the result of the Social or Marsic War of the
                    confederate tribes, who struck for Italy against the Roman supremacy during the
                    years between 90 and 88 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The coins present the
                    head of Italia, and reverse types of which the most striking are warriors,
                    varying in number, taking an oath over a sacrificial pig, and a bull for Italy
                    goring the prostrate wolf of Rome. The inscriptions are Oscan or Latin.</p>
                <p>Certain of the Greek towns of Italy deserve special mention for the splendour of
                    their coinage,—beautiful in style and delicate in execution. In Campania
                    (leaving the Romano - Campanian for later notice) the two most interesting
                    currencies are of Cumae and Neapolis, the modern Naples. Cumae presents silver
                    money of the archaic and the early fine style, in which last we first observe
                    the peculiar naïveté of western Greek art before it had attained elaboration.
                    The abundant silver coins of Neapolis are of the early and the late fine periods
                    and of the decline. The types are usually the head of the siren Parthenope, more
                    rarely Hera and Pallas, favourite goddesses of the Greeks of Italy; the reverse
                    presents the man-headed bull common on Campanian money, here not a rivergod as
                    in Sicily, but the tauromorphous Dionysus. The bronze money is of good style,
                    and age has beautified it with the rich blue or green patina due to the
                    sulphurous soil. When we reach Calabria the Greek money startles us in
                    astonishing wealth of beauty in the currency of the opulent and luxurious mart
                    of Tarentum, second only to Syracuse in the whole West, of all the main periods
                    of art, and including in the age of its greatest prosperity and its fall (the
                    time of the contest with Rome) the most abundant gold issues of any Greek city.
                    The gold money of Tarentum is a delight to the eye, with the varied beauty of
                    its gem-like types, which, while they show the gem-engraver’s art, prove the
                    medallist’s knowledge of the rich but opaque metallic material. Several heads of
                    divinities adorn these coins, and the chief reverse types relate to the
                    legendary founder, Taras, son of Poseidon. Always a youth, he appears as a
                    charioteer, perhaps as a horseman, and riding on a dolphin, the familiar
                    Γarentine type. The most remarkable subject represents him with outstretched
                    arms running to Poseidon seated on a chair. The silver coinage is chiefly of
                    Attic didrachms, oi loiV weight to admit the interchange of their sixth, the
                    diobol, with the Roman libral as. The prevalent type is Taras seated on a
                    dolphin; in earlier money the type is single, and repeated incuse on the
                    reverse; afterwards this subject occupies the reverse, and, itself a charming
                    composition, is delightfully varied. On the early fine coms the people or demos,
                    personified generally as a youth, often holding a spindle, occupies the obverse,
                    but gives place to a horseman in various attitudes, giving great scope to the
                    engraver’s skill; pιobably he is Taras himself, save when he is a full-grown
                    warrior. These representations illustrate the famed horsemanship of the
                    Tarentines, and refer to contests and games which were probably local. Heraclea
                    in Lucania shows us didrachms of the fine age, with heads of Pallas and subjects
                    connected with Heracles: the contest with the Nemean lion is most skilfully
                    treated, and the series is very characteristic of the gem-engraver’s art. The
                    powerful city of Metapontum begins with early coins having the incuse reverse,
                    and then displays a long series stretching down to the decline of art. The
                    constant type, which recurs with the heraldic instinct of the West, is the ear
                    of bearded wheat, reminding us of the “golden harvest” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{χρυσoυv θtpos)</hi> which the Metapontines dedicated at Delphi. Like the
                    Tarentine badge, it first occupies the obverse, then the reverse, balanced by a
                    charming series of heads of divinities. Persephone is the most appropriate
                    counterpart; we also note heads of Concordia <hi rend="italic">{'Ομόνοια)</hi>
                    and Hygieia, marked by an ingenuous grace peculiar to the early fine work of the
                    Western school, of Leucippus the founder as a helmeted warrior (occurring on a
                    rare tetradrachm and the usual didrachms), and many other types of unusual
                    variety and originality of conception.</p>
                <p>The ancient Sybaris, famous for her luxury, has left archaic coins; she was
                    destroyed by Croton in 510 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> restored for a time,
                    and then became an Athenian colony, speedily receiving the name of Thurium about
                    443 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The result of the support of Athens in the
                    days of Pericles was the issue of a splendid series of coins. Not only is the
                    face of the coin occupied by the head of Pallas, and the great currency, as at
                    Athens, of tetradrachms, but the severe beauty of the style points to the direct
                    influence of the art of central Greece. The head of Pallas is covered by a
                    helmet adorned with a splendid figure of the sea-monster Scylla. The reverse
                    shows a bull butting (θot'ptos), in a strikingly ideal form. Probably the
                    obverse type affords the nearest reflexion of the masterpiece of Phidias, or at
                    least the closest following of his style. The finest coins are unsigned
                    tetradrachms, but didrachms of cognate style give the beginning of the name of
                    the engraver Φ. He reappears at Terina (of which town presently).</p>
                <p>Velia, the last colony of Phocaea, whose citizens sailed away to the far west
                    rather than submit to the Persian tyrant (544 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi>
                    shows coins from its foundation. The pieces of fine work witness to an Asiatic
                    origin in the types of the lion, devouring the stag or as a single device, while
                    the obverse displays the head of Pallas so much in favour in Magna Graecia. The
                    style, which lacks strength but not beauty, is Italian, and we see no trace of
                    the pictorial qualities of Ionian art, which indeed had not taken its mature
                    form when the exiles left the mother country.</p>
                <p>The Bruttii are the first native Italians whom we find striking a fair Greek
                    coinage. Their gold and silver is of late style, the gold presenting the head of
                    Poseidon and Amphitrite on a sea-horse, the silver the head of Amphitrite and
                    the figure of Poseidon, both with other subjects. Caulonia has early coins
                    running down to the early fine period, mythologically interesting in type, and
                    the later with a beautifully-designed stag on the reverse. For Croton the ruling
                    type is the tripod. The eagle occurs on the obverse and the tripod on the
                    reverse. The bird of Zeus is inferior to that at Agrigentum, as this again is
                    inferior to the eagle of Elis. We note also beautiful types of Heracles seated,
                    one of marvellously delicate work, on the reverse of which Apollo aims an arrow
                    at the Python from behind his tripod,—a remarkable composition. The other
                    Heracles types form a most interesting series of recollections, “memory
                    sketches,” of a famous statue, the pose of which recalls the so-called Theseus
                    of the Parthenon, while the obverse presents the head of the Hera Lacinia
                    worshipped on the promontory close by. The latest coins, like the parallel ones
                    of Metapontum, are weak and pretty. The money of the Locri Epizephyrii affords
                    two curious types of reverse, Eirene seated, of fine style, with the legend
                    ΕΙΡΗΝΗ ΛOKPΩN, and the later yet more remarkable subject of Roma seated while
                    Pistis crowns her, the legend being PΩMA ΠIΣTIΣ ΛOKPΩN. The historical reference
                    is as yet undiscovered. There are beautiful coins of the little-known town of
                    Pandosia, bearing the head of the nymph Pandosia (?); the reverse has the river
                    Crathis, a splendid head of the Lacinian Hera, and Pan, being signed by an
                    engraver who may be the same as the Φ of Thurium, though the style is different
                    and the execution gem-like.</p>
                <p>Rhegium was closely connected with Messene in Sicily opposite, and thus the great
                    Sicilian currency of tetradrachms prevails.</p>

                <p>Anaxilaus, tyrant of Rhegium from 494 to 476 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    early in his rule acquired Messene through Samian adventurers. The coins of both
                    towns at first present Samian types, and then, the Samians having been expelled,
                    Anaxilaus commemorates his Olympic victory in the mule-car. As this race only
                    lasted from 500 to 448 B. c., its occurrence here, represented only in the style
                    of the earliest quarter of the 5th century, is historically valuable. The same
                    type appears at Messene and lasts longer. In both cases the reverse bears a
                    running hare, a symbol of Pan.</p>
                <p>The little-known town of Terina is illustrious as having produced a series of
                    silver didrachms which, on the whole, is the most beautiful in Italy. The
                    obverse has the head of a goddess, who is portrayed winged on the reverse,—a
                    wonderfully fine subject, well conceived and most delicately executed in a
                    variety of different attitudes, some recalling the Nices which adorn the
                    balustrade of the temple of Wingless Victory at Athens. Very curiously, the
                    money of Terina begins with an archaic coin which bears on the reverse the named
                    figure of Wingless Victory, surrounded by the olive-wreath. Does all this
                    indicate a religious connexion with Athens? Though the Athenian temple was not
                    built till half a century or more after the date of the earlier coin, we may
                    well think that the worship was of older date. The artist of the later coins,
                    who signs Φ, is clearly the Φ of Thurium, Athenian in style if not in
                    nationality, and perhaps he had seen the sculptures at Athens. At Terina he
                    rules art; at Thurium he is one of several engravers; at Heraclea and Neapolis
                    he merely introduces the stronger style; perhaps he appears once' more executing
                    a masterpiece at Pandosia. He must have had a longlife and wide renown. It is
                    significant that at Terina the later coins have a merit most unusual in the
                    West.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Sicily is Greek. The Hellenic and Carthaginian colonies of the
                    coast left the barbarous natives undisturbed in the inland country, and both
                    issued Greek money, the Punic with a tincture of Phoenician style. The coinage
                    ranges from the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> until the subjugation
                    of the island by the Romans, after which a few cities struck colonial or
                    imperial coins for a short space. The marked periods are those of the
                    preponderance of Syracuse from 480 to 212 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    interrupted by the great Carthaginian wars, which were fatal to the cities of
                    the southern coast. The coinage is in gold, mainly issued at Syracuse, in
                    silver, and in bronze. The standard is Attic, except the earliest money of the
                    Chalcidian colonies Himera, Messene, and Naxos, which follows the Aeginetan
                    weight. The metrology of Sicily has a distinct relation to that of Italy. Here
                    also there is a double standard, silver and bronze, and in consequence an
                    intrusive silver coin, differing but little from the obol, weighing 13 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 instead of ll <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 25
                    grs., the silver equivalent of the bronze litra, whose name it borrows. The
                    litra in bronze was the Sicilian pound, equal to half an Attic mina, and to
                    two-thirds of the Roman libra or pound. So important was the litra in Sicily
                    that the silver litra supplanted the obol, and the didrachm was sometimes called
                    a stater of ten litrae, the decadrachm a piece of fifty litrae,
                    pentecontalitron. The leading coin is the tetradrachm, not, as in Italy, the
                    didrachm.</p>
                <p>The Sicilian money is of extremely careful artistic work, not unfrequently even
                    in the case of bronze allowing for a more rapid execution of the die; and the
                    highest technical excellence is attained. The art is that of the southern branch
                    of the great Western school, generally more skilful than the art of southern
                    Italy, but less varied. The earlier fine work has a naive beauty peculiar to the
                    West and almost confined to Sicily; all that follows is evidently gem-engravers’
                    work. These coins are remarkable for the frequency of artists’ signatures, which
                    for the short period of highest skill are almost universal on the larger silver
                    money of Syracuse, and occur less frequently on that of the other great cities.
                    As in Italy, the decline is more rapid than elsewhere in the Greek world, in
                    consequence of the inherent weakness of the style; but it is in part due to the
                    calamities of the island, as of lower Italy.</p>
                <p>The fame won by the tyranni and other leading aristocrats of Sicily in the great
                    national contests of Hellas, in the race with the quadriga, the mule-car, and
                    the horse, led to the introduction and supremacy of types commemorating these
                    victories, probably in most cases those achieved at Olympia. That these
                    victories are intended is shown principally by the mode in which a chariot is
                    portrayed at the critical moment of passing the turning-post, by the occurrence
                    of the turning-post itself, by the correspondence of the cities issuing the type
                    with those commemorated by Pindar, in whose <hi rend="italic">Olympic Odes</hi>
                    the six victories in the chariot-race are all won by Sicilians, and by the
                    direct evidence of Aristotle (ap. Poll., v. 75) that Anaxilaus of Rhegium
                    recorded on his coins his Olympic victory with the mule-car. It is obvious that
                    no success could be so appropriately figured on the coinage. The religious idea
                    was maintained; the charioteer or the horseman was not the victor, but at the
                    same time the renown of the city was indissolubly connected with the citizen who
                    won it. Hence these types are confined to states ruled by tyranni or
                    oligarchies; outside Sicily they are only found at Rhegium when it was closely
                    connected with Sicily, at Cyrene, and in the money of Philip II. of Macedon. The
                    horseman is not a frequent type; the mule - car is limited to Messene (and
                    Rhegium); but the quadriga becomes the stereotyped subject for the reverse of
                    the great Sicilian tetradrachms,—the bulk of the coinage,—and only escapes
                    heraldic sameness by a charming variety in the details. In the age of finest art
                    a divinity of the city takes, in Homeric guise, the place of the charioteer, or
                    Nice herself so wins the victory; commonly she hovers above about to crown the
                    charioteer. Yet more interesting are the types connected with nature-worship,
                    especially those portraying river-gods in the form of a man-headed bull, or a
                    youth with the budding horns of a calf, or in the shape of a dog, where
                    Phoenician influence is found, and also the subjects of the nymphs of fountains.
                    These types occur on either side of the coin. The obverse of all is usually held
                    by the head of a divinity, Persephone and Pallas taking the first place.</p>
                <p>The leading position which Syracuse held in the island makes it proper to notice
                    her splendid currency first, the finest for knowledge of the materials, for
                    skill in suitably filling the space, and for delicacy of execution in the whole
                    range of Greek money, though we miss the noble simplicity of Greece, the strong
                    feeling of western Asia Minor, and the simple picturesqueness of Crete. These
                    larger qualities are sacrificed to an excess of richness and even to tricks of
                    art. Yet the beauty of the coins and their completeness,—the artist having
                    satisfied his intention,—command our admiration; and our interest is raised by
                    the story they tell of the vicissitudes of the great city of the West, the
                    mother of liberty and the slave of tyrants, great in commerce, rich, luxurious,
                    loving the arts, yet able to defend herself even under base rulers against all
                    the power of Carthage and of Athens. Syracuse was founded in 734 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by Archias of Corinth, an origin which, remembered on
                    both sides, served her well in later history. In the 6th century, under the
                    oligarchy of the Geomori, she issued her most archaic silver money, which,
                    primitive as it is, gives promise of the care of the later coinage, and begins
                    the agonistic types, thus indicating some early victory at a great Hellenic
                    contest. Gelon, tyrant of Gela, won the chariot race at Olympia in 488 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> secured Syracuse in 485 B.c., and, when the
                    Carthaginians, probably by agreement with Xerxes, invaded Sicily, utterly routed
                    them at the great battle of Himera (480 B. c. ), the Salamis of the West. These
                    events find their record in the issue and subjects of his Syracusan money,
                    which, however, was struck, as usual in that age, in the name of the people. The
                    chariot type is varied, for Nice appears hovering above the victorious
                    charioteer, about to crown the horses, and the coins issued after the great
                    battle show the lion of Libya beneath the car in the exergue (Head, <hi
                    rend="italic">Syracuse,</hi> 9). These last pieces are fixed in date by the
                    famous story how Gelon’s wife Demarete, having gained favourable terms for the
                    vanquished Carthaginians, was presented by them with a hundred talents of gold,
                    by means of which she coined the great silver pieces of fifty litrae or ten
                    drachms, which were called after her demaretia. They bear the head of Nice, or
                    it may be Pallas, crowned with olive, and the quadriga and lion. The battle of
                    Himera and the death of Gelon (478 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> fix the date
                    of these remarkable coins, which close the archaic series of Syracuse and give
                    us a fixed point in Greek art, at about 479 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> There
                    is a touch of Egyptian in their style which makes us think that Syracuse may
                    have been influenced through Naucratis.</p>
                <p>Hieron (478-467 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> the brother and successor of
                    Gelon, continues the same types, alluding, as Head well remarks <hi
                    rend="italic">(loc. cit.),</hi> to his great victory over the Etruscans off
                    Cumae (474 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> by the marine monster in the exergue
                    of the reverse which denotes the vanquished maritime power. It is to be noted
                    that as Gelon introduces the Nice in the chariot type, so in the horseman type
                    we now first see Nice crowning the rider. Gelon had won an Olympic victory in
                    the four-horse contest, Hieron in the horse-race, though he also won with the
                    four horses in the Pythian games. With Hieron’s money we say farewell to archaic
                    art. The female heads on the obverse now have the eye in profile and show beauty
                    and variety, and the horses are even exceptionally represented in rapid action.
                    With the short rule of Thrasybulus, the last brother of the house, it came to an
                    end, and the age of the democracy (466-406 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    began. The victories by land and sea of Gelon and Hieron had established the
                    power of the city on a sure basis, and fifty years of prosperity followed. To
                    the earlier part of this age belong the beautiful transitional coins in which
                    the female heads are marked by a youthful simplicity of beauty combined with
                    fanciful and even fantastic treatment of the hair; the reverses remain extremely
                    severe. Towards the close of this age there are very fine works, the first
                    signed coins, with the old dignity yet with greater freedom of style, the horses
                    of the quadriga in rapid movement. The contest with Athens and the victory of
                    Syracuse (415-412 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) seem to have given the impulse
                    of which we here see the effect. To the democracy also belong the earliest gold
                    and bronze pieces.</p>
                <p>The tyranny of Dionysius and his successors (406-345 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) is the age of the most splendid Syracusan coins, and that which
                    shows the distinct beginning of decline. The wealth and prosperity of Dionysius
                    led to the issue of the magnificent decadrachms, commonly but erroneously called
                    medallions, with the heads of Persephone and Arethusa and the victorious
                    chariot, as λvell as a variety of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n696/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0696-0639"/> signed tetradrachms. The tyrant, defeated at
                    Olympia by a combination, seems to commemorate on these coins the victory he
                    could have won, and this explanation appears to be confirmed by such
                    indications, never all combined, as the fallen turning - post, the broken rein,
                    and the affrighted charioteer. The Dionysian dynasty closed in nine years of
                    anarchy, until Syracuse appealed to Corinth, and Timoleon was sent to restore
                    order (344 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The triumph of this public-spirited
                    statesman is witnessed by various changes in the coinage. The chief silver piece
                    is now a didrachm of Corinthian type, corresponding in weight to the tridrachm
                    of Corinth, and with the same types, the head of Pallas and the Pegasus; the
                    smaller coins present some Corinthian subjects. The democracy was overthrown in
                    317 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and the city seized by Agathocles (317-289
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), the worst of the tyrants of Syracuse. In the
                    course of his reign he adopted the royal style, and his coins, a reflexion of
                    earlier work, give his name first without and then with the title king,—a double
                    innovation. The tyrant Hicetas (287-278 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and the
                    next rule)·, Pyrrhus king of Epirus (278-276 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>),
                    continue the coinage, Pyrrhus issuing money in the name of the Syracusans and
                    also striking his own pieces. The departure of Pyrrhus led to the establishment
                    by a native, the second Hieron, of a dynasty which, so long as he ruled (276-216
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), restored the ancient prosperity and
                    preponderance of the rule of his namesake. At first content with inscribing his
                    name alone, he soon not only takes the title of king, conferred on him in the
                    early years of his reign, but also places his portrait on the money. Of his time
                    is the beautiful portrait of Queen Philistis, supposed to be his consort. The
                    heads have merit, but the reverse has become merely heraldic. The money of the
                    short reign of Hieronymus (216-215 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)andof the
                    brief democracy which fell before the Romans (215-212 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> close the independent series of this great city. But her name still
                    appears in bronze money issued after the conquest.</p>
                <p>Taking the rest of the money of Sicily in alphabetical order, we first note a
                    very fine bronze coin bearing a beautiful female head, perhaps that of Sicilia,
                    crowned with myrtle, and a lyre, the date of which is later than Tiinoleon’s
                    Syracusan issues, on one of which it is restruck. This coin is conjecturally
                    attributed to Adranum. Aetna, better known as Catana, is represented by a unique
                    tetradrachm, with a wonderful head of Silenus, and Zeus as the god of the
                    volcano hard by enthroned and hurling a thunderbolt. The first great town is
                    Agrigentum, represented by archaic, transitional, and fine coins, the fine
                    series ending with the overthrow of the city by the Carthaginians in 406 B.c.,—a
                    blow from which it never recovered. The usual types are the eagle and the crab,
                    but in the age of finest art we see two eagles devouring a hare, and a
                    victorious chariot; these occur in the rare decadrachm and the tetradrachms. The
                    eagle is superior to that of Croton, inferior to that of Elis. Is it a
                    sea-eagle, while the Olympian bird is the golden eagle? Many of the bronze coins
                    are of good work. The type most worthy of note is the head of a river-god, with
                    the name Acragas, which was that of the stream of the town, and on the reverse
                    an eagle standing on an Ionic capital, the Olympic turningpost. The success of
                    Agrigentum at the games is attested by Pindar, while Virgil <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aen.,</hi> iii. 704), Gratius <hi rend="italic">(Cyneg.,</hi> 526), and Silius
                    Italicus mention its ancient renown for horses. The lofty site (arduus Acragas),
                    overlooking the sea and on the bank of the stream of the same name, makes the
                    eagles, the crab, and the river appropriate devices, showing that Greek types
                    have a local fitness, while chosen with a religious intention.</p>
                <p>The money of Camarina is of especial beauty and interest. The fifth of Pindar’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Olympic Odes,</hi> to Psaumis the Camarinaean, affords an
                    excellent commentary upon it. The earliest coin we know is a didrachm of about
                    this time, whereas there are many pieces of from fifty to a hundred years
                    earlier of most of the other important cities of Sicily. Camarina, however, was
                    then but lately inhabited <hi rend="italic">(νόοι,κον έδραν),</hi> having been
                    recently twice devastated by the Syracusans. This piece has on the obverse a
                    helmet upon a round shield and on the reverse a pair of greaves, between which
                    is a dwarf palm <hi rend="italic">(Chamaerops</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >humilis).</hi> The arms are those of some divinity or hero; the palm may
                    represent the sacred grove (dλσos <hi rend="italic">àyvôv)</hi> in which the
                    temple of the chief divinity probably stood. This piece is followed by
                    tetradrachms and didrachms of the best period, most beautiful in style, and
                    varying a little from difference of age. The tetradrachms bear on the obverse
                    the head of Heracles in the lion’s skin, and on the reverse Pallas as a victor
                    at the Olympic games in a quadriga. It was Pallas, protector of the city
                    (τroλιdoχε ∏αλλds), whose sacred grove was made more illustrious by the success
                    of Psaumis. The didrachms have on the obverse the head of a river-god, portrayed
                    as a young man with small horns and with wet hair. Of the two rivers of
                    Camaτina, the Oanus and the Hipparis, the Hipparis is here represented, for in
                    one case the name is given on the coin. Pindar seems to show the same
                    preference, for, while he merely mentions the Oanus <hi rend="italic"
                    >{ποταμόν</hi><hi rend="italic">. . . "Ωavov),</hi> he speaks of the sacred
                    channels by which the Hipparis watered the city <hi rend="italic">(σεμνούς
                    οχετούς,</hi><hi rend="italic">"lππapις</hi><hi rend="italic">οΐσιν</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">S,ρδει</hi><hi rend="italic">στρατόν).</hi> On the reverse the
                    nymph Camarina <hi rend="italic">(Ωκεανού</hi><hi rend="italic">θυyaτεp . . .
                    ~K,aμaρlva)</hi> is seen carried across her lake <hi rend="italic">(εyχωpiav . .

                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> P <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> θading her veil in
                    the manner of a sail. Some of these didrachms have on either side, around the
                    chief device, fresh-water fishes. The series of Catana comprises fine archaic
                    tetradrachms and others of the time of the best art. The archaic tetradrachms
                    have the types of a river in the form of a man-headed bull and of the figure of
                    Nice. The head of Apollo succeeds, with for reverse the victorious quadriga, in
                    one case passing the turning-post, an Ionic column.</p>
                <p>Gela is represented by coins of which the archaic tetradrachms must be especially
                    mentioned. They have on the obverse the forepart of the river-god Gelas, whence
                    the city took its name. The Gelas is represented as a bull, having the face of a
                    bearded man. On the reverse is a victorious quadriga at the Olympic games, in
                    some examples represented passing an Ionic column, as on coins of Catana. A
                    tetradrachm of the later period of the age of good art has types of the head of
                    the Gelas as a young man horned, surrounded by three fishes, and on the reverse
                    Nice in a biga with a wreath above. The money of Himera is of great interest.
                    The oldest didrachms of Himera, which probably began in the 6th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> bear on the obverse a cock and on the reverse an
                    incuse pattern. They are succeeded by transitional tetradrachms, which bear on
                    the one side a victorious quadriga and on the other a nymph sacrificing, near
                    whom a little Silenus stands under the stream of a fountain issuing from a
                    lion’s head in a wall. Leontini is represented by tetradrachms with the head of
                    Apollo and the victorious car, which gives place to a lion’s head. The series of
                    Messene begins, when the town was called Zancle, or, as it is written upon the
                    coins, Dancle, with early drachms or smaller pieces of the Aeginetan weight, and
                    of very archaic work. On the obverse is a dolphin, and around it a sickle, and
                    on the reverse is a shell in the midst of an incuse pattern. The place is said
                    to have received its name on account of the resemblance of the harbour to a
                    sickle ((^αγ <hi rend="italic">κλov</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ξayκλη).</hi> Next
                    to these first coins of Zancle may be placed, as the oldest piece of the Attic
                    weight, a tetradrachm with the Samian types, a lion’s scalp on one side and on
                    the other the head of a bull, and bearing the inscription MEΣΣENION. This coin
                    was doubtless struck during the rule of the Samians, who took the place about
                    494 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> at the instigation of Anaxilaus tyrant of
                    Rhegium, by whom they were subsequently expelled (Thucyd., vi. 4). The next
                    pieces are the earliest of those which have on the obverse the mule-car and on
                    the reverse a running hare, like the contemporary coins of Rhegium, with the
                    same devices and equally of the rule of Anaxilaus. These types cease at Rhegium,
                    though they continue at Messene, some of the tetradrachms bearing them being of
                    the age of fine art. When the town had been seized by the Mamertini, money was
                    struck with their name, thus borne by the later coins, which are of bronze. They
                    are good, but not of the best style. Naxos is represented by handsome
                    transitional tetradrachms and others of the fine period, and by smaller silver
                    pieces, chiefly of the earlier time.</p>
                <p>There are some coins of the city of Panormus, but most of those which have been
                    classed to it are of the Carthaginians, issued both in Sicily and in Africa.
                    Nothing is more probable than that many of these pieces were struck at Panormus,
                    but there is no sure means of distinguishing any such, and, if there were, the
                    mere fact of their having been issued at the place would not justify us in
                    classing them to it. Segesta is represented by coins of the archaic and of the
                    good period. We first notice the head of the nymph Segesta and a hound, probably
                    a river-god, then the same type for obverse associated with a young hunter
                    accompanied by two hounds,—a charming composition. Another interesting type is a
                    victorious car driven by Persephone, who carries ears of corn.</p>
                <p>In the series of the city of Selinus the first coins are didrachms, bearing on
                    the obverse a leaf and on the reverse an incuse square. The city and the river
                    of the same name no doubt derived their name from the plant <hi rend="italic"
                    >σέλινον,</hi> the leaf of which must be here intended. There is some difficulty
                    as to its identification; the plant sacred at Selinus appears to be, as Colonel
                    Leake supposes, wild celery <hi rend="italic">(Apium graveolens)</hi>; but it
                    does not follorv that the “selinon” with which the victors at the Isthmian and
                    Nemean games were crowned was really the same species. Tetradrachms and
                    didrachms of transitional and of good art have devices of more than usual
                    interest. The obverse exhibits a river-god, sometimes the Selinus, sometimes the
                    Hypsas, sacrificing at the altar of Aesculapius, while on the didrachm a
                    wading-bird is sometimes seen behind him, as if departing. This subject appears
                    to allude to the draining of the pestiferous marshes. The reverse of the
                    tetradrachms generally shows a quadriga in which Apollo stands drawing his bow,
                    while Artemis is charioteer. The reference must be equally to the driving away
                    of the pestilence.</p>
                <p>We have still to mention the main characteristics of the true Siculo-Punic coins,
                    that is, those actually struck by the Carthaginians in Sicily. A careful
                    examination shows that the Punic money must be separated into three distinct
                    divisions—the coinage of the Carthaginians in Africa, in Sicily, and in Spain.
                    The Sicilian coins are adjusted to the Attic talent, like those of the Greek
                    cities of the island, and show Greek style modified by barbarian influence. The
                    known towns are Solus, Motya, Panormus (?), and Heraclea <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n697/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0697-0640"/> Minoa. The leading types are imitated from
                    Syracusan money. This series must not be confounded with the large Attic issues
                    of Carthage, which are distinguished by special types not found in Sicilian
                    money, such as the horse’s head and the palm-tree; the head of Persephone links
                    these coins with the true Siculo-Punic.</p>
                <p>The islands near Sicily issued coins which belong to the Carthaginian series,
                    except Lipara, of which there is heavy bronze money on the Sicilian system,
                    having on the obverse a head of Hephaestus, or sometimes a figure of the same
                    divinity seated, holding a hammer and a vase, which he seems to have just
                    formed.</p>
                <p>In the Tauric Chersonese there are interesting coins, in the three metals, of the
                    city of Panticapaeum, the modern Kertch. Their obverse usually bears the head of
                    Pan and their reverse a griffin and other subjects; some are of fine Greek
                    style. The money of Sarmatia, of Dacia, and of upper and lower Moesia is chiefly
                    bronze of the Graeco-Roman class. In Sarmatia we may notice the autonomous and
                    imperial pieces of Olbia, and in Dacia the series bearing the name of the
                    province. The Roman colonia Viminacium in upper Moesia is represented by
                    numerous coins of a late time. Of Istrus, in lower· Moesia, there are drachms
                    having a strange type on the obverse, representing two beardless heads, those of
                    the Dioscuri, side by side, the one upright and the other upside down; on the
                    reverse is an eagle devouring a fish. The style of these coins, it may be
                    noticed, is in general fair, though it sometimes approaches to barbarism. There
                    are abundant Greek imperial coins of Marcianopolis and Nicopolis, while Tomi is
                    represented in this class as well as by autonomous money.</p>
                <p>The coins of Thrace are of high interest. Here and in Macedonia we observe the
                    early efforts of barbarous tribes to coin the produce of their silver mines, and
                    the splendid issues of the Greek colonies; and we see in the weights the
                    influence of the Asiatic Greeks, the Athenians, and the Persians. The oldest
                    coins are of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and there are
                    others of all subsequent times, both while the country was independent and while
                    it was subject to the Romans, until the cessation of Greek coinage. Some of the
                    best period are of the highest artistic merit. So long as they maintain any
                    general distinctive peculiarities of fabric and design, that is, from their
                    commencement until the age of Philip, the Thracian coins resemble those of
                    Macedonia. The money of Abdera comprises tetradrachms and smaller coins of the
                    periods of archaic and line art, all but the latest of the Phoenician standard,
                    ultimately superseded by the Persic. The principal type is a seated griffin. The
                    reverse type, an incuse square, has at first four divisions, but in the age of
                    the finest art contains a variety of beautiful subjects. √Enus is remarkable for
                    the great beauty of some of its coins. These are tetradrachms of Attic weight,
                    of the late archaic and best ages. The interesting turning-point from growth to
                    maturity is seen in a vigorous head of Hermes in profile, wearing the petasus. A
                    little later is the splendid series of facing heads, the broad, severe, and
                    sculptural treatment of which is truly admirable, and far superior to the more
                    showy handling of the same subject in later drachms. A goat is the reverse type
                    of the larger coins. The money of the city of P&gt;yzantium begins with coins on
                    the Persic standard of good style, having on the obverse a bull above a dolphin
                    and on the reverse an incuse square of four divisions, and closes with the
                    series of bronze coins issued under the empire. The Roman colonia of Deultum and
                    the city of Hadrianopolis deserve a passing notice. Of Maronea, anciently famous
                    for its wine, there is an interesting series beginning with small archaic coins.
                    After these we notice fine tetradrachms of Phoenician weight, having on the
                    obverse a prancing horse and on the reverse a vine within a square. The standard
                    changes to Persic, of which there is a beautiful series of didrachms. Then the
                    series is interrupted by the rule of the Macedonian kings, and resumed in a
                    barbarous coinage of the native Thracians, issued in the second and first
                    centuries before the Christian era, consisting of spread Attic tetradrachms with
                    the types of the head of beardless Dionysus crowned with ivy and on the other
                    side his figure. The Greek imperial coins of Pautalia and Perinthus are worthy
                    of notice. Among those of the latter town we may mention fine pieces of
                    Antoninus Pius and Severus, and large coins, commonly called medallions, of
                    Caracalla and other emperors. The money of the imperial class issued by
                    Philippopolis, Serdica, and Trajanopolis should also be noticed. In the Thracian
                    Chersonese the most important series is one of small autonomous silver pieces,
                    probably of the town of Cardia. There is a limited but highly interesting group
                    of coins of Thracian kings and dynasts. The earliest are of kings of the
                    Odrysae, including Seuthes I., who began to reign in 4'24 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and whose monev bears the two remarkable inscriptions ΣEYΘA KOMMA
                    and ΣEYΘA APΓYPION. It closes with the issues of Roman vassals; they begin with
                    Coson, who puts on his gold staters the type of the Junia family, the first
                    consul between his lictors, marking his allegiance to Brutus, and an eagle.
                    Lysimachus, commonly classed as king of Thrace, belongs to the group of
                    Alexander’s western successors. Among the islands of Thrace, Iιnbros with its
                    trace of Pelasgic worship, and, equally with Lemnos, showing evidence of
                    Athenian dominion, and Samothrace with the Asiatic worship of Cybele yield in
                    interest to Thasos. Here a long and remarkable currency begins with very early
                    Persic didrachms, the obverse type a centaur carrying a nymph, the reverse an
                    incuse square of four divisions. Under the Athenian supremacy we see a decline
                    of weight, and in style the attainment of high excellence. The design of the
                    obverse noλv reminds us of the work of Alcamenes at Olympia, grand in spite of
                    careless execution. After this we observe coins of Phoenician weight, bearing
                    for their obverse types the head of Dionysus. These are of the best period of
                    art, and some tetradrachms are among the very finest Greek coins. The head of
                    Dionysus is treated in a sculptural style that is remarkably broad and grand.
                    The massive, powerful features, and the formal hair, nearly falling to the neck
                    in regular curls like those of the full beard, are relieved by a broad wreath of
                    ivy-leaves, designed with great delicacy and simplicity. The reverse bears a
                    Heracles kneeling on one knee and discharging his bow,—a subject powerfully
                    treated. Of a far later period there are large tetradrachms, much resembling
                    those of Maronea, with the same type of the beardless Dionysus, but on the
                    reverse Heracles. There are coins of Paeonian kings, which are chiefly silver,
                    and have a resemblance to those of the Macedonian sovereigns, although they are
                    somewhat barbarous. They range from 359 to 286 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The money of Macedonia both civic and regal is of great variety and interest. It
                    begins at an early time, probably towards the end of the 6th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The old pieces are of silver, bronze having come into
                    use a century later, and gold about the middle of the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The character of the coinage resembles that of
                    Thrace; the earliest pieces are of the Phoenician, Babylonie, and Attic
                    standards, the heavier form of the Babyionic, the Persic, appearing later. The
                    most remarkable denominations are the Phoenician octadrachms and dodecadrachms.
                    The largest coins are of the time of Alexander I. and somewhat earlier, and
                    indicate the metallic wealth of the country more than its commercial activity.
                    Philip II. adopted for gold money, which he was. the first Macedonian king to
                    issue, the Attic weight, striking staters on that system, while he maintained
                    the Phoenician standard for his silver coinage. Alexander the Great made the
                    weight of the gold and silver money the same by employing the Attic system for
                    both; and from his time no coins of kings of Macedonia in these metals were
                    struck on any other system. The series of Roman Macedonia begins with coins of
                    the “regions” issued by permission of the senate and bearing the name of the
                    Macedonians, from 158 to 146 B.c.; others follow of the Roman province. The
                    coinage of Acanthus comprises fine archaic tetradrachms of Attic weight and
                    others of Phoenician weight and very vigorous in style, of the commencement of
                    the period of good art. The type of their obverse is a lion seizing a bull. The
                    money of Aeneia is chiefly interesting from its bearing the head of the hero
                    Aeneas; and on one extraordinary coin of archaic fabric, an Attic tetradrachm,
                    the subject is the hero carrying Anchises from Troy, preceded by Creusa carrying
                    Ascanius; this is in date before 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and is
                    preserved in the Berlin Museum. The town of Amphipolis is represented by a long
                    series. There are Phoenician tetradrachms having on the obverse a head of
                    Apollo, facing, sometimes in a splendid style, which recalls the art of the
                    immediate successors of Phidias, as seen, for instance, in the famous bronze
                    female head in the British Museum. The reverse type is a flaming torch in an
                    incuse square. There are also many Greek imperial bronze pieces of this city.
                    The territory of Chalcidice is eminent for the excellence of some of its silver
                    coins. These are Phoenician tetradrachms of the best period struck by the
                    Chalcidian League (392-379 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and later), Olynthus
                    being probably the mint. The obverse bears the head of Apollo in profile crowned
                    with laurel. It is in very high relief and treated with great simplicity, though
                    not with the severity of somewhat earlier pieces. The delicacy of the features
                    is balanced by the simple treatment of the hair and the broad wreath of laurel.
                    On the reverse is a lyre. There is an early series of coins of Lete. Some are of
                    a remote date and none later than about the time of Alexander I. The obverse
                    type is a satyr with a nymph, and on the reverse is an incuse square divided
                    fourfold, first diagonally and then in squares. Mende has money of Attic weight,
                    the types being connected with Silenus, who on. a tetradrachm of fine art is
                    portrayed reclining, a wine-vase in his hand, on the back of an ass; the reverse
                    bears a vine. Of Neapolis (Datenon) there are early coins with the Gorgon’s head
                    and the incuse square, which changes, as at Lete, and in the period of fine art
                    gives way to a charming head of Nice crowned with olive. There is a very early
                    Attic tetradrachm of Olynthus, with a quadriga, an&lt;l an eagle within a double
                    square, the only coin, save Philip’s gold and silver and the money of Cyrene,
                    which repeats the idea of the great Sicilian currencies, the record of Olympic
                    victory. Orthagoria, better known as Aristotle’s birthplace Stageira, has a few
                    remarkable coins of good art and a peculiar style. The coins of Philippi in the
                    three metals are mainly of the time of Philip II., who, having found a rich gold
                    mine near Crenides, changed its name to Philippi. The gold coins are Attic
                    staters, the silver pieces of the Phoenician or Macedonian weight, like Philip’s
                    own money. All bear the head of young <pb break="no"

                    pieces were struck by the city as a colonia. There is a long series of
                    Thessalonica, beginning with Greek bronze coins, the latest of which are asses
                    with on the obverse the Roman head of Janus in strange combination with a Greek
                    inscription. Then follow pieces of imperial time and others with imperial
                    effigies. Uranopolis has a few coins with very curious astronomical types,
                    probably issued by the eccentric Alex-archus, brother of Cassander. The issues
                    of the Thraco-Macedonians are extremely interesting. They are all just anterior
                    to, or it may be contemporary with, Alexander I. of Macedon. The leading coins
                    are octadrachms of the Phoenician standard. They have usually but one type, the
                    reverse bearing a quadripartite incuse square. Their sudden appearance and heavy
                    weight are due to the working of the silver mines on the border of Macedonia and
                    Thrace. The usual types are a warrior leading a horse or a yoke of oxen. The
                    coins bear the names of the Bisaltae, Getas king of the Edoni (whose only two
                    coins, differing dialectically in their inscriptions, were found in the Tigris
                    in 1818, and are now in the British Museum), the Orrescii, and other tribes.
                    Besides these there are very curious Phoenician dodecadrachms of an unknown
                    tribe, bearing the unusual type of an ox-car, in which is a figure seated, and
                    on the reverse a triquetra.</p>
                <p>The oldest coins of the Macedonian kings are of Alexander I., from 498 to 454 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the contemporary of Xerxes. These are Phoenician
                    octadrachms, having on the obverse a hero by the side of a horse, and coins of a
                    lower denomination with the same or a similar type. The money of Alexander’s
                    successors illustrates the movement of art, but it is not until the reign of
                    Philip II. that we have an abundant coinage. He first strikes gold pieces,
                    chiefly Attic didrachms, from the produce of his mine near Philippi. They are of
                    fair but somewhat careless style, and bear on the obverse the head of Ares. On
                    the reverse is a victorious Olympic biga. These coins were afterwards known as
                    <hi rend="italic">Φιλιππeιoc</hi> and the gold money of Alexander as
                    Αλ⅛α∣'δpκoi—appellations which probably did not include larger or smaller
                    pieces. Horace calls the gold coins of Philip “Philips” (“regale nomisma
                    Philippos,” <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> ii. 1, 232). The silver coinage of
                    Philip is mainly composed of tetradrachms of the Phoenician talent. Their type
                    of obverse is a head of Zeus, and of reverse either a mounted hero wearing a
                    causia or a victor in the horse-race with a palm,—these last coins being the
                    best of Philip’s, although the horse is clumsy.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Alexander the Great, both in the number of the cities where it was
                    issued and in its abundance, excels all other Greek regal money; but its art is,
                    without being despicable, far below excellence. The types are not remarkable in
                    themselves, and there is a great sameness characterizing the entire series. The
                    system of both gold and silver is Attic. The gold coins are distaters or gold
                    tetradrachms, staters or didrachms, hemistaters or drachms, with their half or a
                    smaller denomination. The types of the distaters or staters, which last were the
                    most common pieces, are for the obverse the head of Pallas and for the reverse
                    Nice bearing a trophy-stand. The largest silver piece is the decadrachm, which
                    is of extreme rarity. The types of the tetradrachms and most of the lower coins
                    are on the obverse the head of Heracles in the lion’s skin and on the reverse
                    Zeus seated, bearing on his hand an eagle. The head has been supposed to be that
                    of Alexander, but this is not the case, although there may be some assimilation
                    to his portrait. The great currency was of tetradrachms. The coinage was struck
                    in different cities, distinguished by proper symbols and monograms. The
                    classification of the series is difficult, but is gradually advancing. The
                    bronze money is not remarkable.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Alexander is followed by that of Philip Arrhidaeus, with the same
                    types in gold and silver. That of Alexander IV. was alone issued by Ptolemy I.
                    In these coins the types of Alexander were modified. Meanwhile Seleucus,
                    Lysimachus, and Antigonus, king of Asia, struck Alexander’s money with their own
                    names, and the tetradrachms of Macedonia were generally of this kind until the
                    time of Philip V. The same coinage, marked by a large flat form, was reissued
                    later by the cities of western Asia, when the Romans, after the battle of
                    Magnesia in 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> restored the liberties which
                    Alexander had granted. The series of Alexandrine money is interrupted by various
                    small coinages and the later issues of Lysimachus, king of Thrace, with the
                    first Greek regal portrait, the head of Alexander with the ram’s horn, as the
                    son of Zeus Ammon, sometimes a work worthy of Lysippus and an excellent
                    indication of his style. The reverse has a figure of Pallas holding a little
                    Nice. The coins of Demetrius 1. (Poliorcetes) comprise fine tetradrachms, some
                    of the types of which have an historic reference. They bear either on the
                    obverse his portrait with a bull’s horn and on the reverse a figure of Poseidon,
                    or on the one side a winged female figure (Nice or Fame) on the prow of a
                    galley, blowing a trumpet, and on the other Poseidon striking with his trident.
                    The latter types cannot be doubted to relate to the great naval victory which
                    Demetrius gained over Ptolemy. The tetradrachms of Antigonus I. (Gonatas), which
                    are of inferior style and work to those of Demetrius, have types which appear to
                    refer in like manner to the great event of his time.</p>
                <p>Γhe obverse type is a Macedonian buckler with the head of Pan in the midst, and
                    the reverse type Pallas Promachos. The head of Pan is supposed to have been
                    taken as a device in consequence of the panic which led to the discomfiture of
                    the Gauls at Delphi. The money of Demetrius II. is unimportant, but Antigonus
                    Doson is represented by tetradrachms with the head of Poseidon and Apollo seated
                    on a galley. The tetradrachms of Philip V. have on the obverse a head in the
                    helmet of Perseus, representing Philip in the character of that hero, or else
                    the hero himself, perhaps assimilated to the king. The reverse bears a club.
                    Other tetradrachms and smaller coins have a simple portrait of Philip. The
                    tetradrachms of Perseus are of fair style, considering the time at which they
                    were strack. They bear on the one side the king’s head and on the other an eagle
                    on a thunderbolt.</p>
                <p>The coin systems of northern Greece, Thessaly, Epirus, Corcyra, Acarnania, and
                    Aetolia present certain difficulties which ’disappear if we consider them as
                    originally Aeginetan, modified in the west by Corinthian, and later by Roman,
                    influence. The coinage of Thessaly presents very few specimens of a remote
                    period, while pieces of the best time are numerous. These are in general
                    remarkably like the finest coins of Sicily and Italy, although the style is
                    simpler. The prevalence of the horse and horseman is significant. The money of
                    the Thessalian Confederacy, being of late date (196-146 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), is of little interest. The commonest types are the head of Zeus
                    crowned with oak and the Thessalian Pallas Itonia in a fighting attitude. The
                    coinage is resumed in imperial times. Of the town of Gomphi or Philippopolis
                    there is a beautiful drachm, having on the obverse a female head, facing, which
                    is probably that of a nymph as the city. The coins of Lamia are also to be
                    noticed for their beauty. The drachms bear the head of Lamia, the mistress of
                    Demetrius Poliorcetes, and young Heracles, who probably represents Demetrius.
                    The series of Larissa begins with archaic pieces and some of the early period of
                    good art, but sometimes of rather coarse execution. The small silver pieces have
                    very interesting reverse types relating to the nymph of the fountain, and to be
                    compared for mutual illustration with the didrachms of Terina and with some of
                    those of Elis. These are followed by coins of fine work. The usual obverse type
                    is the head of Larissa, the nymph of the fountain, facing, and on the reverse is
                    generally a horse, either free or drinking. The head is treated in a very rich
                    manner, like that of the fountain-nymph Arethusa, facing, on tetradrachms of
                    Syracuse; indeed, the resemblance to the Sicilian type is most remarkable. If it
                    be a copy, it is simpler and bolder than the original. The bronze money is also
                    good. The coins of Pharsalus and Pherae are also worthy of note. Of the tyrants
                    of Pherae Alexander is represented by coins.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Illyria is usually of inferior or rude art; the pieces are
                    Aeginetic, ultimately changing to Attic. Of Apollonia there is a large series.
                    The earliest have the Corcyraean types of the cow and the calf and the floral
                    pattern; the latest, usually, the head of Apollo and three nymphs dancing round
                    a fire, the outer ones holding torches. Dyrrachium, which never bears on its
                    coins the more famous name of Epidamnus, is represented by an important series.
                    First there are Aeginetan didrachms with Corcyraean types. These are succeeded
                    by tridrachms with Corinthian types, and, of course, on the Attic standard; and
                    then the old types are resumed, but apparently without a return to the former
                    weight. Dyrrachium, it must be remembered, was founded partly by Corcyraean and
                    partly by Corinthian colonists.</p>
                <p>The coins of Epirus are of higher interest and beauty than those of Illyria. Of
                    the Epirots there are bronze coins of the regal period, and both silver and
                    bronze of the republic (238-168 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), with the heads
                    of the Dodonaean Zeus and Dione, together or apart. The city of Ambracia is
                    represented by beautiful silver pieces, with on the one side a veiled female
                    head and on the other a kind of obelisk. The series of Greek imperial money of
                    Nicopolis must also be mentioned. The coinage known to us of the kings of Epirus
                    begins under Alexander I. His coins have been found in the three metals, but
                    they are rare. It is probable that both gold and silver were struck in Italy
                    while he was in that country. The coins of Pyιτhus in all metals are of high
                    interest, and remarkable for their beauty, though the style is usually florid.
                    There can be little doubt that they were for the most part struck in Italy and
                    Sicily, at Tarentum and Syracuse. The tetradrachm has for the type of the
                    obverse a head of the Dodonaean Zeus crowned with oak and for that of the
                    reverse Dione seated. A fine didrachm bears on the obverse a head of Achilles
                    helmeted, with for the reverse Thetis on a sea-horse carrying the shield of her
                    son. Among the copper coins of Pyrrhus we must remark the beautiful ones with
                    the portrait of his mother Phthia.</p>
                <p>The coinage of the island of Corcyra begins with very early didrachms and drachms
                    of the 6th century. The types are the cow suckling the calf and the floral
                    pattern, as at Dyrrachium. These leading subjects are varied in later times by
                    others illustrating the Corinthian origin of the nation, its maritime power, and
                    the fame of its wine. Not the least curious are the bronze pieces with ealleys
                    bearing their names, as Strength, Freedom, Glory, Orderly <pb break="no"

                <p>The coins of Acarnania are not remarkable for beauty or for variety in their
                    types. The money of several cities in the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> is that of Corinthian colonies. We must mention that of the
                    Acarnanian League (229 -168 B. c. ), which bears the head of the Achelous as a
                    man-headed bull and the seated Apollo Actius. Of Leucas there are silver coins
                    and an abundant series in bronze.</p>
                <p>In Aetolia the gold and silver coins of the Aetolian League have some merit
                    (279-168 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). The gold pieces have on the obverse
                    the head of Pallas or that of Heracles in the lion’s skin and on the reverse
                    Aetolia personified, seated on Gaulish and Macedonian shields,—a curious
                    historical type. These subjects recur, with others indicating the hunter-life of
                    the population, on the silver money; of especial interest is the head of
                    Atalanta and the Calydonian boar, and the spear-head with which he was slain, in
                    both silver and bronze. On some of the copper the spear-head and the jaw-bone of
                    the boar are seen.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Locris, Phocis, and Boeotia is entirely on the Aeginetic standard.
                    The coins of the Locri Epicnemidii are mainly didrachms, struck at Opus, with
                    the head of Persephone and the figure of the Lesser Ajax in a fighting attitude,
                    sometimes accompanied by his name. These coins were struck between 369 and 338
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and are remarkable for the manner in which a
                    Syracusan head is copied, and, as appears in other cases in Thessaly and
                    elsewhere, not weakened but presented in a stronger and purer form. So much
                    higher was the conception of art in Hellas than in the West.</p>
                <p>The money of Phocis begins at a very early age, perhaps the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and extends in silver down to the conquest by Philip
                    (346 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c. ).</hi> The prevalent types are a bull’s head and
                    that of a goddess or nymph. Delphi, geographically included in Phocis, strikes
                    very remarkable money, wholly distinct in types from the Phocian. The principal
                    subjects are heads of rams and goats, the symbols of Apollo as a pastoral
                    divinity, a dolphin (Apollo Delphinius), the omphalos and tripod, and a negro’s
                    head, which has not been satisfactorily explained. The Amphictyonie Council
                    struck beautiful didrachms, probably on the occasion of Philip’s presidency (346
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), with the head of Demeter, and the Delphian
                    Apollo seated on the omphalos. Under Hadrian and the Antonines there is an
                    imperial coinage of Delphi, some pieces bearing the representation of the temple
                    of Apollo, on one type the letter E appearing between the columns of the face,
                    representing the mystic Delphic El, on which Plutarch wrote a treatise.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Boeotia is chiefly of a period anterior to the reign of Alexander,
                    under whom the political importance of Thebes and the whole country came to an
                    end. The main characteristic of the money is the almost exclusive use of the
                    Bceotian shield as the obverse type, marking the federal character of the
                    issues. These were struck by various cities, or by Thebes as ruling the League.
                    The earliest pieces are drachms, presumably of Thebes, and certainly of
                    Haliartus and Tanagra, issued between 600 and 550 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    These are followed by didrachms of the same and other cities until the time of
                    the Persian War. The result of the unpatriotic policy of Thebes and most of the
                    towns of Boeotia was the degradation of the leading city, and the coins reveal
                    the curious fact that Tanagra then became the centre of the League-coinage. We
                    now notice the abandonment of the old incuse reverse and the adoption of regular
                    types, the wheel at Tanagra and the amphora at Thebes. These types increase and
                    indicate several cities during the short period of Athenian influence (456-446
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The democratic institutions were next
                    overthrown, and Thebes became again the head of Boeotia, and struck alone and in
                    her own name, not in that of the League. To the earlier part of this period
                    belong splendid didrachms with reverse types chiefly representing Heracles,
                    subsequently varied by heads of Dionysus in a series only less fine. With the
                    peace of Antalcidas (387 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> Thebes lost her power,
                    the League was dissolved, and the other Boeotian cities issued a coinage of some
                    merit. In 37 ’ 9 B. c. Thebes became the chief state in Greece, and the
                    patriotic policy of Pelopidas and Epaminondas is shown in the issue of the
                    Boeotian coins at the great city without any name but that of a magistrate.
                    Among those which occur is EΠAM or EΠAMI, who can scarcely be any other than the
                    illustrious general. The battle of Chaeronea (338 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi>), swiftly followed by the destruction of Thebes, closes the historic
                    coinage, save only for the appearance of new League-money of Attic weight, with
                    the head of Zeus and the figure of Poseidon, issued between 288 and 244 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.</hi> (On the whole subject see Head’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coinage of</hi><hi rend="italic">Boeotia.</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi></p>
                <p>In Attica the great series of Athens is dominant, Eleusis alone in that country
                    having issued an unimportant bronze coinage of good style while Athens was
                    independent. The Athenian money begins with the issues which were struck under
                    Solon’s monetary law, practically adopting the Euboic standard instead of the
                    Aeginetic, by which the Attic weights were divided into the commercial and the
                    monetary. The monetary standard became so famous through the widespread traffic
                    of Athens as to give the name Attic to all subsequent measures which followed it
                    except the Corinthian, and the term Euboic gradually fell into disuse. The
                    earliest coins are tetradrachms of full weight (270 grains), with an extremely
                    archaic head of Athene helmeted to the right, and within an incuse square an owl
                    to the right with the letters AΘE. These may be early in the 6th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Soon afterwards a sprig of olive appears in the upper
                    left corner of the square. The coins of the age of the Persian War have
                    olive-leaves forming an upright wreath on the helmet of Athene. To this period
                    belongs the decadrachm with the owl facing, its wings open. In the same age a
                    crescent is added—symbol of the lunar character of the goddess—between the
                    olive-sprig and the owl. These types continue during the period of fine art,
                    with slight modification and the abandonment of the incuse square, but with no
                    mark of the splendour of Athens as the centre of Greek sculpture. No doubt
                    commercial reasons dictated this conservative policy, which makes the coinage of
                    Athens a disappointment in numismatics. Her money was precious for its purity
                    not only in the Greek world but among distant barbarians, so that imitations
                    reach us from the Punjab and from southern Arabia, and any change would have
                    injured their wide reception. There are many divisions of silver coinage with
                    the types a little varied, and some different ones; and during the age of
                    supremacy gold was issued in small quantities and bronze introduced. The
                    Macedonian empire put an end to the autonomy of Athens, and when the money is
                    again issued it is of a wholly new style and the types are modified. The great
                    series of spread tetradrachms may be dated from the accession of Philip V. (220
                    B.C.), and lasted until the capture of the city by Sulla (86 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The obverse type is a head of Athene with a
                    richly-adorned helmet, unquestionably borrowed from the famous statue by Phidias
                    in ivory and gold, but a poor shadow of that splendid original, and an owl on an
                    amphora within an olive - wreath. The earliest coins have the monograms of two
                    magistrates, the later the names of two who are annual, and one changing about
                    every month, but ultimately dropped. The occurrence in these of the names of
                    Antiochus IV. (Epiphanes), before he came to the throne, of Mithradates VI. and
                    his creature Aristion, helps to fix the dates. The abundance of this money shows
                    the great commercial importance of Athens in these later times. Remarkable
                    bronze coins of a later age bear two representations of the Acropolis and the
                    great edifices. Both have on the obverse a head of Minerva. The reverse of one
                    represents the Acropolis, with the grotto of Pan, the statue of Pallas
                    Pro-machus, the Parthenon, and the Propylaea, with the steps leading up to the
                    latter. The reverse of the other shows the theatre of Dionysus, above which are
                    caverns in the rock, and higher still the Parthenon and the Propylaea. There are
                    also Greek imperial pieces of Megara.</p>
                <p>The money of the island of Aegina is of especial interest, since with it Greek
                    coinage is said to have originated. The story is that, at a time when Aegina was
                    a dependency of Argos, Phidon king of Argos struck the first Greek money there,
                    probably in the seventh century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is said that
                    previously silver was formed into spikes (δ∕3eλlσm), of which six made a handful
                    (δpαχμ⅛), and that thus the name of the drachm and its sixth, the obolus,
                    originated; but this account may be an invention of later times. There can be no
                    doubt, however, that the earliest Aeginetan coins are of extreme antiquity. The
                    weight is of course on the Aeginetic standard. The oldest pieces are very
                    primitive didrachms, bearing on the obverse a turtle and on the reverse a rude
                    incuse stamp. Afterwards the stamp becomes less rude, and later has a peculiar
                    shape. There are some coins of the early part of the fine period of excellent
                    work. The great currency was of didrachms. The bronze coins are not remarkable,
                    but some appear to be of an earlier time than most Greek pieces in this
                    metal.</p>
                <p>The series of Achaia begins under the Achaean League, some time after 330 B.C.,
                    when we first find coins of the Achaeans, with no distinction of cities,—a
                    purely federal coinage. The silver coins, like the later ones, are either Attic
                    tetrobols or Aeginetic hemidrachms. Then follows the money of the ten cities of
                    the Old League, beginning about 280 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> —Dyme,

                    strength to the little alliance; the towns of Arcadia and Argolis followed, then

                    Homagyrius, the reverse with the monogram of the Achaeans in a laurel-wreath.
                    After the earliest money the reverse bears the symbols or monograms of the
                    cities which struck. The oldest bronze repeats the silver types; the rest bears
                    a standing Zeus and a seated Demeter, with the name of the city at full
                    length.</p>
                <p>Corinth is represented by a very large series of coins, the weight of which is
                    always on the Corinthian standard, equivalent to Attic but differently divided,
                    — the Corinthian tridrachm, the chief coin, corresponding to the Attic didrachm.
                    The oldest pieces, of the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> bear on
                    the obverse Pegasus with the letter Ç, koppa, the initial of the name of
                    Corinth, and on the reverse an incuse pattern. In course of time the head of
                    Athene in an incuse square occupies the reverse. The incuse square disappears,
                    as generally elsewhere, in the early period of fine art Of the age of the

                    generally wanting in the severity of the highest Greek art. Pegasus is
                    ordinarily seen galloping, but sometimes standing or drinking, the koppa is
                    usually retained, and the helmet of Athene, always Corinthian, is sometimes
                    bound with an olive-wreath. The smaller coins have the same reverse, but on the
                    obverse a charming series of types, principally female heads, mostly
                    representing Aphrodite. There are some drachms with Bellerophon in a combatant
                    attitude mounted on Pegasus on the one side and the Chimaera on the other. The
                    autonomous bronze money is poor, but often of fair work, and interesting,
                    especially when the type relates to the myth of Bellerophon. Under the Romans
                    this city was made a colonia; and we have a large and interesting series of the
                    bronze coins struck by it as such, including the remarkable type of the tomb of
                    Lais. The colonies of Corinth form a long and important series, struck by
                    Acarnanian towns with Corcyra, and in the west by Locri Epizephyrii in Italy and
                    Syracuse. They range from the time of Timoleon, about 340 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> to the age of the earlier successors of Alexander, perhaps having
                    ended in the time of Pyrrhus, probably shortly after 295 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The colonies broke loose from Corinth and struck their own money,
                    retaining the old types for commercial purposes, and Syracuse and Locri found it
                    advisable to follow the same course, which in the case of Syracuse was not
                    uninfluenced by gratitude to the mother-city and her noble citizen Timoleon. The
                    coins are distinguished by the absence of the koppa and bear the names or
                    monograms of the cities.</p>
                <p>There are bronze coins of Patrae as an important Roman colonia, and silver and
                    bronze money of Phlius, both of the period of good art. The coinage of Sicyon,
                    on the Aeginetic standard dominant in the rest of the Peloponnesus, is
                    disappointing for a famous artistic centre. It begins shortly before the period
                    of fine art; in that age the silver is abundant and well executed, but the
                    leading types, the Chimaera and the flying dove within an olive-wreath, are
                    wearying in their repetition, and good work could not make the Chimaera an
                    agreeable subject. Small coins with types of Apollo are the only subjects which
                    suggest the designs of the great school of Sicyon.</p>
                <p>The money of Elis, or the Eleans, is inferior to none in the Greek world in its
                    art, which reaches the highest level of dignified restraint, and in the variety
                    of its types, which are suggested by a few subjects. The leading types are
                    connected, as we might expect, with the worship of Zeus and Hera and Nice, the
                    divinities of the great Panhellenic contest at Olympia. The prevalent
                    representations are the eagle and the winged thunderbolt of Zeus, the head of
                    Hera, and the figure of Nice. The series begins early in the 5th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> with coins, some of which are didrachms (Aeginetic),
                    having as subjects an eagle carrying a serpent or a hare and on the reverse a
                    thunderbolt or Nice bearing a wreath,—archaic types which in their vigour
                    promise the excellence of later days. From 4/1 to 421 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> while Elis was allied with the Spartans, such types continue; the
                    eagle and Nice (sometimes seated) are both treated with great force and beauty,
                    and the subject of seated Zeus is remarkable for its dignity. The Argive
                    alliance (421-400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) seems marked by the
                    pre-eminence given to Hera, whose head may suggest the famous statue of
                    Polyclitus at Argos. This alliance broken, the old types recur. Magnificent
                    eagles, some admirably designed on a shield, and eagles’ heads, the seated Nice,
                    and fantastically varied thunderbolts mark this age. The types of an eagle
                    struggling with a serpent and an eagle’s head are marked with the letters ΔA.
                    Professor Gardner has conjectured that they may be the work of the great
                    sculptor Daedalus of Sicyon, who at this very time produced a trophy for the
                    Eleans at Olympia. The political events of the age do not seem any longer to
                    affect the coinage. Thus the return of the heads of Hera has no historical
                    significance that we can trace. They are remarkable for their beauty, which is
                    still severe, while around there are marks of the luxurious style of decline,
                    and here the eagle-types have lost their vigour. The age of Philip is soon
                    reached, and shows a marked decline in the coinage. It closes with imperial
                    money, some types of which have a local interest, notably two of Hadrian bearing
                    the head and figure of Zeus, copied from the famous statue by Phidias, of which
                    the earlier currency appears to present no reflexion.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Cephallenia gives us the early silver coins of Cranii, the money of Pale, of
                    charming style, with the figure of Cephalus on the reverse, and that of Same,
                    all cities of this island. Of the island of Zacynthus there are silver pieces,
                    usually of rather coarse work, but sometimes of the style of the best
                    Cephallenian money. The coins of Ithaca are of bronze. They are of interest on
                    account of their common obverse type, λvhich is a head of Ulysses.</p>
                <p>Returning to the mainland, we first notice the money of Messene, or the
                    Messenians. The earliest coin is a splendid Aeginetic didrachm having on the
                    obverse a head of Persephone, and excels in design the similar subjects on the
                    money of Syracuse, from which it must have been copied, for it is of about the
                    time of Epaminondas. Still more than the Locrian type this shows the purer style
                    of Greece, which, copying Syracusan work, raised its character. On the reverse
                    is a figure of Zeus Ithomatas. The other silver coins are of about the period of
                    the Achaean League. The bronze money is plentiful, but not interesting.
                    Lacedaemon, as we might have expected has no early coins, the silver money
                    being, like so much of that of the Greek cities, of the age of the Achaean
                    League. Among the types of the autonomous bronze pieces may be noticed the head
                    of the Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus, with his name. The series of Argos m Argolis
                    begins with coins of an early period. The standard is Aeginetic. Γhe first
                    pieces are the drachm with a wolf on the obverse, and on the reverse A, the
                    initial letter of the name of the people, in an incuse square; the hemidrachm,
                    with the forepart of a wolf; and the diobolon, with a wolfs head. Among coins of
                    the period of good art we must especially notice those which have for the
                    obverse type the head of Hera wearing a Stephanos a design which is not equal to
                    that of the coins of Elis, the style being either careless or not so simple. The
                    reverse type of one of these coins, a drachm, represents Diomedes stealthily
                    advancing with the palladium in his left hand and a short sword in his right. Of
                    the town of Troezen there are silver coins of the best period ofart'.</p>
                <p>Of the money of Arcadia some pieces are doubtless among the most ancient struck
                    by the Greeks; and the types of these and later coins are often connected with
                    the remarkable myths of this primaeval part of Hellas, showing particularly the
                    remains of its old nature-worship. The first series to be noticed is that of the
                    Arcadian League; it begins about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> with
                    hemidrachms having the type of Zeus Lycaeus seated, the eagle represented as if
                    flying from his hand, and a female head. Of a later time, from the age of
                    Epaminondas, there are coins with the head of Zeus, and Pan seated on the
                    Arcadian Olympus, a series of which the didrachms are very fine. The coins of
                    Heraea begin deep in the 6th century B.c. The earliest have for obverse type the
                    veiled head of Hera, and on the reverse the beginning of the name of the town,
                    sometimes between wavy ornaments. The antiquity of Mantinea is in like manner
                    attested by its money. The silver coins of a very early time have on the obverse
                    a bear, representing Callisto the mother of Areas, who was worshipped here, and
                    on the reverse the letters MA, or three acorns, in an incuse square. Later
                    coins, especially the hronze, have subjects connected with the worship of
                    Poseidon at this inland town. The silver money of Megalopolis is important for
                    art, as we know the city to have been founded in 370 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The types are the same as those of the Arcadians of the same period,
                    the headsof Zeus and of Pan. The silver coins of Pheneus must be noticed as
                    being of fine work. The didrachms of the age of Epaminondas have a head of
                    Persephone, and Hermes carrying the child Areas. The obverse type is interesting
                    as a copy, improved on the original, of the Syracusan subject, as in Locris and
                    Messene. As in Locris, the merit is in the greater force and simplicity of the
                    face, here most successful, the hair being treated more after the Syracusan
                    manner than after that of the Messenians, who simplified the whole subject. The
                    finest coin attributed to Stymphalus is a magnificent didrachm of the age of
                    Epaminondas, with a head of the local Artemis laureate, and Heracles striking
                    with his club, no doubt a subject connected with the Stymphalian birds. The
                    smaller silver coins have on the one side a head of Heracles and on the other
                    the head and neck of a Stymphalian bird, most resembling those of a vulture.
                    There were representations of these birds in the temple of Artemis. The series
                    of Tegea is not important, but two of the reverse types of its bronze coins are
                    interesting as relating to the story that Athene gave a jar containing the hair
                    of Medusa to her priestess Sterope, daughter of Cepheus, in order that she might
                    terrify the Argives should they attack Tegea in the absence of Cepheus, when
                    Heracles desired his aid in an expedition agalħst Sparta.</p>
                <p>The peculiar position of Crete and her long isolation from the political,
                    artistic, and literary movements of Hellas have been already touched on. It is
                    not until the age when the Macedonians and the Achaean League are striving for
                    the leadership of Hellas that Crete appears in the field of history, but then
                    only as the battle-ground of rival powers. The most remarkable influence of this
                    age was when Athens, by the diplomacy of Cephisodorus, succeeded about 200 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> in drawing the Cretans into a great league against
                    Philip V. of Macedon. That this project took actual shape is proved by the issue
                    at all the chief mints of the island of tetradrachms with the well-known types
                    of Athens, to be distinguished from the Atticizing types of other cities at this
                    time. In the meanwhile the inborn love of adventure in her youth had been
                    satisfied by hired service to the surrounding kingdoms, and hence <hi
                    rend="italic">grew</hi> a piratical instinct which ultimately cost the Cretans
                    their freedom at the hand of Rome.</p>
                <p>The oldest coins are probably of about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but
                    few cities seem to have issued many until a hundred years later. Then there is a
                    great outburst of coinage, sometimes beautiful, sometimes barbarously careless,
                    which lasts until Alexander’s commercial policy is seen in the appearance of his
                    money with Cretan symbols in lieu of the old autonomous money. As Alexander’s
                    successors grew weak and no one of them could control Crete, the old rights were
                    restored and the Cretan cities again coin their own types until the Roman
                    conquest (67 or 66 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). The chief issue is of
                    silver; bronze is less abundant; and gold is unknown. The Cretan types <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n701/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0701-0644"/> have a markedly local character, yet they copy in
                    some instances other coinages. The chief divinities on the pieces are Zeus,
                    Hera, Poseidon, Heracles, and Britomartis, and the leading myths are those of
                    Minos, the story of the Minotaur and the labyrinth being prominent, and also
                    that of Europa. There is frequent reference to nature-worship as in Sicily, yet
                    with a distinctive preference for trees, the forms of which, however, lend
                    themselves readily to the free representation of Cretan art, which may in part
                    explain their prominence. The weight is at first Aeginetic, falling almost to
                    Attic; and in the resumption of the coinage after Alexander’s time it is
                    Attic.</p>
                <p>Of the island in general there are Roman silver coins of the earlier emperors,
                    some of which are of fine work for the period. The inscriptions are in Latin, or
                    partly in Latin and partly in Greek. In the autonomous civic series there are
                    didrachms of Aptera. The obverse bears a female head wearing a Stephane and the
                    reverse a warrior before a sacred tree. Of Chersonesus, the port of Lyctus,
                    called on the coins Chersonasus, there are didrachms of coarse style, mainly
                    copied from the splendid piece of Stymphalus in Arcadia. The head of Artemis is
                    here appropriated to Artemis Britomartis, who had a temple at the place, and the
                    reverse of Heracles striking with his club is varied by the substitution of the
                    figure of Apollo seated. The silver money of Cnossus is of great interest. The
                    oldest coins are archaic in style, and may be as early in date as the expedition
                    of Xerxes. They bear the figure of the Minotaur as a bull-headed man, kneeling
                    on one knee, and a maeander-pattern, in one case enclosing a star (the sun), in
                    another a female head (Ariadne ?). The antiquity of these coins disproves the
                    supposition that the Cretan labyrinth at Cnossus was an invention of the later
                    poets. Of the early time of good art there are didrachms of Cnossus with the
                    head of Persephone and an unknown divinity, and the labyrinthine pattern
                    enclosing the sun or the moon or a bull’s head for the Minotaur, and at length
                    becoming a regular maze. To this time belongs the wonderful coin in the Berlin
                    Museum with Minos seated, his name in the field, and the head of Persephone
                    within the maeander-pattern. In the later age of fine art a head of Hera wearing
                    a stephanos occupies the obverse of didrachms and drachms, and the reverse has a
                    maze through which the way may be clearly traced. The head is closely copied
                    from the same type of Argos, and despite its beauty shows a distinct
                    inferiority, unlike the copies of Syracuse by artists of the mainland. This
                    series closes with Alexander’s empire, and the native coinage disappears until
                    the league of Cephisodorus revives it with the Athenian tetradrachm of Attic
                    weight, bearing the name of the Cnossians. It is of inferior style, and is
                    followed by base coins with heads of Minos and Apollo, and the Labyrinth, either
                    square as before or in a new circular form, which is interesting as showing it
                    was a mere matter of tradition. There are interesting coins of Cydonia, some of
                    them of beautiful style and work. One is remarkably like a coin of Aptera, and
                    bears an engraver’s name, Neuantus,—a point showing the importance attached by
                    the Cretans to the designs of their money. The head is that of a Maenad, and the
                    reverse has a figure of the traditional founder Cydon, stringing his bow. The
                    style is good, but the execution poor. A drachm presents a most beautiful
                    repetition of the subject of Cydon. Gortys, or Gortyna, is represented by most
                    remarkable coins, which generally allude to the myth of Europa. Didrachms of
                    archaic style have on the obverse Europa carried by the bull and on the reverse
                    the lion’s scalp. These pieces are followed by a remarkably fine class of spread
                    didrachms; the best are of about 400 B. c. They have on the obverse Europa
                    seated in a pensive attitude on the trunk of a tree, doubtless the sacred plane
                    at Gortyna, mentioned by Pliny, which was said never to shed its leaves, and on
                    the reverse a bull suddenly turning his head as if stung by a fly. Nothing in
                    Greek art exceeds the skill and beauty of these designs. The truth with which
                    the tree is sketched, one engraver even indicating the letters cut by visitors
                    in the trunk, and the graceful position of the forlorn Europa are as much to be
                    admired as the fidelity with which the bull is drawn, even when foreshortened,
                    sharply turning his head, with his tongue out and his tail raised. These
                    designs, beautiful in themselves, are strikingly deficient in fitness, and
                    aflbrd equally strong illustrations of the excellencies and of the one great
                    fault of the art of Cretan coins. Many pieces of the same class are of rude
                    execution. There is a tetradrachm of the Athenian group having the symbol of a
                    butting bull. Later silver coins have the head of Minos. The coins of Hierapytna
                    are remarkable for bearing the representation of a date-palm. Of Itanus there
                    are remarkable coins, the earlier, some of which are of good style, with the
                    subject of a Tritonian sea-god (Glaucus?) and two sea-monsters, changed for a
                    head of Athene and an eagle, the Triton frequently appearing in the field as a
                    symbol. Lyctus, on the coins Lyttus, is represented by strangely rude pieces,
                    with the types of a flying eagle and a boar’s head which is curiously
                    foreshortened. The coins of Phaestus form a most interesting series. Among the
                    didrachms are some of admirable work, with on the obverse Heracles slaying the
                    Hydra with his club and on the reverse a bull. Others have on the obverse
                    Heracles seated on the ground, resting. Another noticeable obverse type is the
                    beardless Zeus seated in a tree, with his Cretan name EEΛXAN0Σ, where the E
                    stands for the digamma. On his knee is a cock in the attitude of crowing,
                    showing that he was a god of the dawn. The most remarkable coins of Phaestus
                    are, however, those that bear representations of Talus, the man of brass, said
                    to have been made by Hephaestus or Daedalus. One of these is a didrachm, on
                    which he is portrayed as a winged youth, naked, bearing in each hand a stone,
                    and in a combatant attitude. This figure is accompanied by his name. A similar
                    design is seen on a bronze coin. The reader will recollect that Apollonius
                    Rhodius <hi rend="italic">{Argonaut.,</hi> iv. 1638 <hi rend="italic">sq.}</hi>
                    relates that Talus prevented the Argonauts from landing in Crete by hurling
                    stones at them, until he was destroyed by the artifice of Medea.</p>
                <p>The important town of Polyrrhenium, or Polyrrhenia (but one <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> on the coins), is represented by carefully-executed coins with a head of
                    Zeus and a bull’s head. A later piece has a remarkable obverse type, a
                    λvhiskered head of Apollo, probably a Macedonian sovereign in that character.
                    This is of Attic weight. Praesus has on its earlier coins the Gorgon’s head and
                    an archer, or an archer and an eagle; later, Zeus seated, and, after the Cretan
                    fashion, foreshortened. The coins of Priansus comprise didrachms of an unusual
                    style and type, a Read of a goddess or nymph, the hair, bound by narrow bands
                    crossed diagonally, filling the large field. Priansus also shows the remarkable
                    type of Persephone seated beside a date-palm, placing her right hand on the head
                    of a serpent, in reference to the myth of the birth of Zagreus. As usual, the
                    figure is foreshortened. The reverse has a standing figure of Poseidon. Rhaucus
                    has Poseidon beside his horse. The rare didrachm of Sybrittia, or Sybrita, may
                    fitly close the series; the obverse has a charming subject, Dionysus seated on a
                    running panther, and the reverse Hermes drawing on his right buskin,— a
                    delightful figure. Another beautiful type is a seated Dionysus.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Euboea is all on the native standard, of which the Attic was a
                    variety. It includes some of the very earliest Greek money. The older coins
                    comprise tetradrachms, didrachms, and smaller pieces; the later are uniformly
                    tetrobols. The pieces which bear the name of the Euboeans date from the fine
                    period to the fall of Hellenic liberty, the silver lasting only to Alexander’s
                    time. They bear the head of a nymph and that of an ox. One variety is very
                    beautiful. The great cities have a far more interesting series. Carystus begins
                    in the time of the Persian War with the type of the cow and calf, as in Corcyra,
                    and its special badge is the cock. Chalcis, the mother of Western colonies, has
                    already in the 6th century a long series with the wheel-type and an incuse
                    diagonally divided, and later, a nymph’s head and an eagle devouring a serpent.
                    Eretria begins as early as Chalcis, but the obverse type is the Gorgon’s head.
                    This is succeeded by the same type and a panther’s head, and fine late archaic
                    coins bear the cow and the cuttle-fish. Of Histiaea the usual type is the head
                    of a Maenad and a female figure seated on the stern of a galley.</p>
                <p>Among the other islands classed after Euboea, Amorgos must not be passed by, as a
                    bronze coin of Aegiale, one of its towns, presents the curious type of a
                    cupping-glass. The silver money of Carthaea and Coressus in Ceos is extremely
                    old, beginning in each case in the 6th century and ending early in the 4th. The
                    weight is Aeginetic, and there are didrachms and smaller coins. The usual types
                    of Carthaea are an amphora and then a bunch of grapes; that of Coressus is a
                    cuttle-fish and dolphin. N ax os is represented by early Aeginetic didrachms and
                    coins of the fine period, the latter being chiefly bronze pieces of remarkably
                    delicate and good work. The types are Dionysiae. Of Paros there are early
                    Aeginetic didrachms with the type of a kneeling goat and beneath a dolphin. Of
                    the third and second centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> there are Attic
                    didrachms with a head, possibly of Artemis, at first of a charming style, and a
                    goat on the reverse. There are very archaic Aeginetic didrachms of Siphnos. Some
                    of the bronze pieces are of the best period and very fine. Ot Tenos there are
                    silver coins of the age of the kings. The head of the bearded Ammon occurs on
                    tetradrachms following the Attic standard, and on smaller pieces that of the
                    younger Ammon, both heads laureate as well as horned; the reverse type is
                    Poseidon.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Asia begins with that of Asia Minor. It falls into certain great
                    classes—first, the ancient gold and electrum, Lydian and Greek, in time
                    succeeded by electrum or gold and silver, all struck in the west and mainly on
                    the coast. Then the Persian dominion appears in the silver money of the satraps,
                    circulating with the gold and silver of Persia, and the Greek money is limited
                    to a few cities of the coast, none save the electrum of the great mint of
                    Cyzicus uninterrupted by the barbarian. With the decay of the barbarian empire
                    the renewed life of the Greek cities is witnessed by a beautiful coinage along
                    the coast from the Propontis to Cilicia. On Alexander’s conquest autonomy is
                    granted to the much-enduring Hellenic communities, and is again interrupted, but
                    only partially, by the rule of his successors, for there was no time at which
                    Asia Minor was wholly parcelled out among the kings, Greek or native. The
                    Romans, after the battle of Magnesia (190 B.C.), repeated Alexander’s policy so
                    far as the cities <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n702/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0702-0645"/> of the western coast were concerned, and there is
                    a fresh outburst of coinage, which, in remembrance, follows the well-known types
                    of Alexander. When the province of Asia was constituted and the neighbouring
                    states fell one by one under Roman rule, the autonomy of the great cities was
                    generally reduced to a shadow. Still the abundant issues of imperial coinage, if
                    devoid of high merit, are the best in style of late Greek coins, and for
                    mythology the richest in illustration.</p>
                <p>The oldest money is the electrum of Lydia, which spread in very early times along
                    the western coast. This coinage, dating from the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> has an equal claim with the Aeginetic silver to be
                    the oldest of all money. Probably the two currencies arose at the same period,
                    and by interchange became the recognized currency of the primaeval marts;
                    otherwise we can scarcely explain the absence of Asiatic silver, though it is
                    easy to explain that of European electrum or gold. The electrum of the coins is
                    gold—the precious metal washed down by the Pactolus—with a native alloy of a
                    fourth part of silver. Its durability recommended it to the Lydians, and it had
                    the advantage of exchanging decimally with gold, then in the ratio 13 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 to silver. But this commercial advantage allowed
                    the issue of electrum coins on silver standards, while it was natural to coin
                    them on those of gold; hence a variety of weight-systems perplexing to the
                    metrologist. The first coins were undoubtedly struck by a Lydian king, probably
                    as early as about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> They follow the Babyionic
                    silver standard. The obverse is plain and merely marked with lines, the original
                    rough surface of the die, while the reverse has three depressions, an oblong one
                    flanked by two squares. Later the same people issued money on the Phoenician
                    silver standard. This double currency, as Head suggests, was probably intended
                    for circulation in the interior and in the coast towns to the west, the
                    Babyionic weight being that of the land trade, the Phoenician that of the
                    commerce by sea. Ultimately Croesus abandoned electrum, and, reducing the
                    Phoenician weight by one-fourth, the proportion of silver in the electrum, he
                    produced a Babyionic gokl stater, and again by similarly reducing the Babyionic
                    weight he obtained a Euboic gold stater. His silver was Babyionic only, the
                    silver stater exchanging as the tenth of the Euboic gold stater. These results
                    are explained by the metrological data given earlier in this article. The Greek
                    marts of the western coast were not long in imitating the example of Lydia;
                    hence a series of early electrum staters, on the Phoenician weight, of Miletus,
                    Ephesus, Cyme, Chios, Clazomenae, Lampsacus, Abydos, and Samos, with smaller
                    pieces which add other mints to the list. The Euboic weight naturally found its
                    way into the currencies, but was as yet limited to Samos. Phocaea, Teos, and
                    Cyzicus, with other towns, followed from a very early period the Plιocaic
                    standard, which for practical purposes may be called the double of the Euboic.
                    Consequently their stater was twice as heavy as the Euboic gold stater. They
                    alone before Croesus issued gold money, which was superseded at Phocaea and
                    Cyzicus by electrum. This is the main outline of the native coinage of Asia
                    Minor before the Persian conquest. Its later history will appear under the
                    several great towns, the money of Persia being treated in a subsequent
                    place.</p>
                <p>The first countries of Asia Minor are Bosporus and Colchis, the coins of the
                    cities of which are few and unimportant. The autonomous coinages of the cities
                    of Pontus are more numerous, but none of them are archaic or deserve to be
                    characterized as fine. There are also imperial pieces. The bronze coins are
                    sometimes large and often thick. The only place meriting a special notice is
                    Amisus, which almost alone of the cities of Pontus seems to have issued
                    autonomous silver money. This is continued under the emperors in the form of
                    Roman denarii and larger pieces. The common subjects of the bronze money of this
                    place relate to the myth of Perseus and Medusa, a favourite one in this
                    country.</p>
                <p>The regal coins are of the old kingdoms of Pontus and of the Cimmerian Bosporus,
                    of the two united as the state of Bosporus and Pontus under Mithradates VI. (the
                    Great), and as reconstituted by the Romans when Polemon I. and II. still held
                    the kingdom of Mithradates, which was afterwards divided into the province of
                    Pontus and the kingdom of Bosporus. The early coinage of the kingdom of Bosporus
                    is of little interest. Of that of Pontus there are tetradrachms, two of which,
                    of Mithradates IV. and Pharnaces I., are remarkable for the unflinching realism
                    with which their barbarian type of features is preserved. Mithradates VI., king
                    of Bosporus and Pontus, is represented by gold staters and tetradrachms. The
                    portrait on the best of these is fine despite its dramatic quality,
                    characteristic of the later schools of Asia Minor. The kings of Bosporus struck
                    a long series of coins for the first three centuries after the Christian era.
                    Their gold money is gradually depreciated and becomes electrum, and ultimately
                    billon and bronze. They bear the heads of the king and the emperor and are dated
                    by the Pontic era.</p>
                <p>In Paphlagonia we must specially notice the coins of the cities Amastris and
                    Sinope. The silver pieces of the former place bear a youthful head in a laureate
                    Phrygian cap, probably representing Men or Lunns,—Amastris, the foundress, being
                    seated on the reverse. On the late bronze money the bust of Homer occurs. There
                    are also bronze coins of the imperial class. The silver pieces of Sinope aie
                    plentiful, ihe types are the head of the nymph Sinope and, as at Istrus, an
                    eagle preying on a dolphin. Bithynia is represented by a more important series.
                    Of the province generally there are Roman silver medallions of the weight of
                    cistophori (to be presently described), with Latin inscriptions, and imperial
                    bronze pieces with Greek inscriptions. There is a long series of imperial bronze
                    of Apamea as a colonia. The ordinary silver coins of Chalcedon strikingly
                    resemble on both sides those of Byzantium a circumstance confirmatory of the
                    statement that the two cities were co Ionized at nearly the same time from
                    Megara. Of Cius also called Prusias ad Mare, there are gold staters and smaller
                    imperial silver pieces. Hadriani and Hadrianutherae issued imperial bronze
                    money. Of Heraclea there are silver coins of good style; these are of the Persic
                    standard. The obverse type is a head of Heracles either bearded or beardless, in
                    the lion’s skin; the most interestin·’«· reverse type is a female head wearing a
                    tiara on which are three turrets, probably that of the town personified. Of the
                    tyrants of Heraclea there are silver coins of Clearchus, of Timotheus and
                    Dionysius ruling together, and of Dionysius ruling alone. Of the imperial class
                    there is a large series of Nicaea, and there are many coins of Nicomedia. The
                    series of Bithynia closes with the money of its kings, consisting of Attic
                    tetradrachms and bronze pieces. The tetradrachms bearing the name of Prusias are
                    of Prusias I. and II. The bronze coins with the same name, some of which are
                    fine, cannot be otherwise classed than to Prusias I. or II., since we do not
                    know by which of the two they were issued. Of Nicomedes II. and III. there are
                    only tetradrachms.</p>
                <p>The fine Greek coinage of Asia may be considered to begin with Mysia. Cyzicus is
                    in numismatics a most important city. The famous electrum Cyzicene staters were
                    struck here for nearly a century, from 478 to 387 B,c., as Head conclusively
                    argues (A⅛∞. <hi rend="italic">Chron.,</hi> 1876, p. 277). During that whole
                    period they were not only the leading gold coinage in Asia Minor but the chief
                    currency in that metal for the cities on both shores of the Aegean; for it must
                    be remembered that their alloy of silver was not allowed any value. The actual
                    weight is of the Phocaic standard, just over 248 grains, so as to be equivalent
                    to a Babyionic gold stater. The division was the hecta or sixth. The abundance
                    of the staters and hectae and the variety of their types, which usually are
                    common to both denominations, led some numismatists to suppose that Cyzicus was
                    a central mint striking for neighbouring cities their own coinage, but our
                    present knowledge of the types of these cities shows that this was not the case.
                    But it is certain that the staters of Cyzicus served as gold for other great
                    marts which struck little or no money in that metal, and contented themselves
                    with issuing the hecta; hence an instinct that they were striking for the use of
                    others may have led the Cyzicene moneyers to use great freedom in the choice of
                    subjects. Many they invented and some they borrowed, retaining for themselves
                    the distinctive badge of the tunny-fish beneath the type. This type occupied the
                    obverse of the coin, while the reverse was invariably the quadripartite incuse
                    square in four planes of the so-called mill-sail pattern. The coins are very
                    thick and the edges are rude. The art is frequently of great beauty, though
                    sometimes careless. After the earlier examples it shows the dominant influence
                    of painting, being characterized by flowing lines and an intensity of expression
                    in some of the finest examples, and always recalling painting or relief rather
                    than sculpture in the round. The subjects are heads, figures, groups, and
                    animals. The silver coinage of Cyzicus is distinctly local. It comprises
                    beautiful tetradrachms of the Rhodian standard. The obverse bears a head of
                    Persephone with a veil on the back, wound round her head, and a wreath of ears
                    of corn. This is an example of the best Greek art, equally simple, delicate, and
                    graceful, and in the expressive style of the Ionian school. Above the head is
                    the in scription ∑ΩTEIPA, which may be compared with ΚΟΡΗ ΣΩTEIPA KYZIKHNΩN, on
                    a late copper coin, accompanying a head which is probably that of the younger
                    Faustina in the character of Persephone. The reverse type of the finest
                    tetradrachms is a lion’s head in profile above a fish. Both late autonomous and
                    imperial coins in bronze are well executed and full of interest, the two classes
                    running parallel under the earlier emperors.</p>
                <p>Lampsacus is represented by a long series of coins. There are archaic and fine
                    silver coins with a janiform female head, and on the reverse that of Athene in a
                    Corinthian helmet, besides a few of other types. Contemporary with the later
                    silver are electrum staters of Rhodian weight with a half-Pegasus and peculiar
                    quadripartite incuse square. These are succeeded by splendid gold staters with
                    various types of obverse and the half-Pegasus on the reverse. The most
                    remarkable type is a bearded head with stι∙eaming hair in a conical cap, bound
                    with a wreath, singularly pictorial in treatment as well as in expression, and
                    roughly executed as if by a great artist unused to medal work. In contrast to
                    this is a most carefully executed head of a Maenad with goat’s ear, still
                    markedly in a painter’s style. This head is in repose; that of another Maenad
                    with human ear is marked by its expression of <pb break="no"

                    coins, interrupted and resumed in the period of good art. The leading type is
                    the Gorgon’s head.</p>
                <p>The money of the great city of Pergamus or Pergamum is chiefly of a late time.
                    There are, indeed, small gold and silver pieces of the good period, the former
                    being very rare; the leading type is an archaic figure of Pallas. The silver
                    coinage is next supplied by the money of the kings of Pergamum, followed by
                    cistophori, which began under the kingdom. The bronze pieces of the city are
                    numerous, both autonomous and imperial, the two classes overlapping, and there
                    are medallions of the emperors. The local worship of Aesculapius is especially
                    prominent under the Roman rule. The chief coin's of the kings are Attic
                    tetradrachms, with on the obverse a laureate head, supposed to be that of
                    Philetaerus, the founder of the state, and on the reverse a seated Athene, the
                    common type of Lysimachus, from whom Philetaerus revolted. This type is but
                    twice varied by the heads of later kings. The inscription is always ΦIΛETAIPOY,
                    a monogram sometimes indicating the name of the king by whom the coin was
                    issued. The absence of the regal style is noticeable, and, though in the usual
                    type the diadem is generally shown as wound round the laurel-wreath, it does not
                    always appear. There are also unimportant bronze coins of the kings. The
                    cistophorus was so called from its obverse type, the cista mystica, a basket
                    from which a serpent issues, the whole enclosed in an ivy-wreath. The reverse
                    type represents two serpents, and between them usually a bow-case. The half and
                    the quarter of the cistophorus have on one side a bunch of grapes on a leaf or
                    leaves of the vine, and the club with the lion’s skin of Heracles within an
                    ivy-wreath. They were tetradrachms equal in weight to three Attic drachms or
                    three denarii, and the half and the quarter would be exchangeable with Roman
                    coins, three quinarii and a quinarius and sestertius respectively. These coins
                    became abundant when the kingdom of Pergamum was transformed into the province
                    of Asia, and are struck at its chief cities, Pergamum, Parium, Adramyttium,
                    Thyatira, Sardis, Smyrna, Ephesus, Tralles, Nysa, Laodicea, and Apamea. They
                    have at first the names of Greek magistrates, afterwards coupled with those of
                    Roman proconsuls or propraetors. The silver medallions of Asia, the successors
                    of the cistophori, range from Mark Antony to Hadrian and Sabina. They bear no
                    names of cities, but some may be attributed by their references to local forms
                    of worship. The obverse bears an imperial head, the reverse a type either Greek
                    or Roman. The art is the best of this age, more delicate in design and execution
                    than that of any other pieces, the Roman medallions excepted.</p>
                <p>The coinage of theTroad is interesting from its traditional allusions to the
                    Trojan War. Of Abydos there is a fine gold stater, with the unusual subject of
                    Nice sacrificing a ram, and the eagle, which is the most constant type of the
                    silver money,—a series chiefly noticeable for the coarse style and bad fabric of
                    the late Attic tetradrachms. One of the few imperial coins commemorates the
                    legend of Hero and Leander. The late tetradrachms of Alexandria Troas bear the
                    head of Apollo Smintheus, and on the reverse his figure armed with a bow; the
                    inscription is ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝΟΣ ZMIΘE∩Σ AΛEΞ^ ANΔPE∩N. There is a long series of the
                    town as a colonia, of extremely poor work. Dardanus has remarkable silver coins,
                    both early and fine. Ilium Novum strikes late Attic tetradrachms with a head of
                    Athene, and on the reverse the same goddess carrying spear and distaff, with the
                    inscription ΑΘΗΝΑΣ ΪΛΙΑ.ΔΟΣ. On the autonomous and imperial bronze we notice
                    incidents of the tale of Troy, as Hector in his car, or slaying Patroclus, or
                    fighting; the other side, for this coin is autonomous, shows the wolf and twins,
                    and again the flight of Aeneas. Of Scepsis, which is said to have been the
                    capital of a Dardanian kingdom for a long period between the fall of Troy and
                    the age of Alexander, there are early silver coins, and some of its bronze money
                    is of good style. The island of Tenedos is represented by very early coins, and
                    others of the fine and late periods. The usual obverse type of all the silver
                    pieces is a Janus-like combination of two heads, probably those of a Zeus and a
                    Hera; and the reverse type of all but the oldest is a two-headed axe.</p>
                <p>In Aeolis the most noteworthy coins are the late tetradrachms of Cyme and Myrina,
                    both of the time of decline, yet with a certain strength which relieves them
                    from the general weakness of the work of that age. Cyme has the head of the
                    Amazon Cyme, and a horse within a laurel-wreath; Myrina, a head of Apollo and
                    his figure with lustral branch and patera. The rest of the coins of these and
                    other towns are bronze, autonomous and imperial.</p>
                <p>Lesbos is remarkable for having coined in base as well as pure silver, its early
                    billon coins being peculiar to the island, and not easily classed to the cities
                    like the silver. They are of various weights, as if the alloy had not been
                    reckoned at first, but afterwards admitted, unlike the electrum of the coast, in
                    which the silver was always excluded from the value. Methymna has very
                    interesting archaic silver coins, with the boar and the head of Athene, her
                    helmet adorned with a Pegasus rising above her forehead. There are later coins
                    of about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and about Alexander’s time. The
                    types are the head of Athene and the lyre. The weight is Attic. Of Mytilene
                    there are few coins until late in the Persian dominion.</p>
                <p>The types are the head of Apollo and the lyre. The style is fine for the period,
                    with the strongly expressive quality that marks the contemporary western Asiatic
                    currencies, and the execution is careful. There is a long and important series
                    of the imperial time, including very interesting commemorative coins, some
                    probably of persons of legend as Nausicaa, or of remote history as Sappho,
                    others of benefactors of the city as Theophanes the friend of Pompey, from whom
                    he obtained for this his native place the privileges of a free city. The usual
                    style for these persons is hero or heroine, but Theophanes is called a god, and
                    Archedamis, probably his wife, a goddess.</p>
                <p>The money of Ionia is abundant and beautiful. Clazomenae is the first city of
                    interest. Here we observe a very early tetradrachm of Attic weight with the
                    types of a lion gnawing his prey, and the forepart of a winged sow. Drachms and
                    smaller coins follow with the forepart of the sow and an incuse. Then there is
                    the break frequently noticeable in Asia Minor, and the coinage begins anew with
                    splendid coins of the age before Alexander, having for types the head of Apollo,
                    three-quarter face, and a swan. The chief pieces, the gold drachm and a half or
                    octobol, and the silver stater or tetradrachm, present two types of the head of
                    Apollo, very grand on the gold and the silver, with the signature of Theodotus,
                    the only known Asiatic engraver, and richly beautiful on the other silver piece.
                    These coins are marked by the intense expression of the school of western Asia
                    Minor. Colophon has a very early Attic didrachm, followed by transitional Persic
                    coins with the head of Apollo and the lyre, next the common break, during which
                    the famous pieces with a regal portrait, to be noticed under Persia, were
                    probably issued, and then, about Alexander’s time, an over-refined repetition of
                    the earlier type.</p>
                <p>The money of Ephesus is historically interesting, but very disappointing in its
                    art, which is limited by the small range of subjects and their lack of beauty.
                    The leading type is the bee; later the stag and the head of Artemis appear. Thus
                    the subjects relate to the worship of the famous shrine. The oldest coins are
                    electrum and silver, both on the Phoenician standard. The type is a bee and the
                    reverse is incuse. The silver coinage continues with the same types, unbroken by
                    the Persian dominion, until in 394 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> a remarkable
                    new coin appears. When Conon and Pharnabazus defeated the Lacedaemonian fleet
                    and liberated the Greek cities of Asia from Spartan tyranny a federal coinage
                    was issued by Rhodes, Cnidus, Samos, and Ephesus, with their proper types on the
                    reverse, but on the obverse the infant Heracles strangling two serpents; these
                    are Rhodian tridrachms. About this time the Rhodian standard was introduced, and
                    a series of tetradrachms began with the bee, having for reverse the forepart of
                    a stag looking back, and behind him a date-palm. This type continues till 301
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> on the Rhodian standard, which is then abandoned,
                    and the Attic supersedes it for a short time. Bronze now begins. The head of
                    Artemis as a Greek goddess next occupies the obverse, and the mint of Ephesus
                    also issues tetradrachms of Lysimachus. He subsequently gave the city the name
                    of Arsinoe, his wife, and a few coins record this short-lived change. The next
                    coins repeat the head of Artemis, and the forepart of the stag and the palm-tree
                    again occupy the reverse. The head is specially beautiful, and the whole coin of
                    most careful work. The Ptolemaic rule is commemorated by the splendid octadrachm
                    of Queen Berenice II. struck here. At this time the Attic standard was
                    abandoned, and the Rhodian, then very popular in the commerce of the eastern
                    Mediterranean, was adopted. The city afterwards fell into the hands of Antiochus
                    III. About this time Alexandrine tetradrachms were here minted; it would seem
                    most reasonable to date them from the peace of 189 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> when the Romans endeavoured to conciliate the cities of the coast,
                    but there are reasons for supposing that they began earlier with a monetary
                    alliance between Ephesus and the great Phoenician mart Aradus. The Attic weight
                    was thus restored, and there is a long issue of drachms on that standard, with
                    the types of the bee, and the stag standing on the nearer side of the palm-tree.
                    To the same age belong the Ephesian tetradrachms of the kings of Pergamum, to
                    whose territory the Romans had assigned Ephesus, and undated cistophori. When in
                    133 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. the Roman people inherited the kingdom of
                    Pergamum, an issue of dated cistophori began at Ephesus, which was the chief
                    city of the Roman province of Asia. This is not interrupted by the revolt, when
                    Ephesus took the side of Mithradates (87-84 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>),
                    which, however, is marked by a series of gold Attic didrachms and a solitary
                    coin of strange weight, which may be a half-aureus issued by Sulla (84 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.),</hi> as Mommsen ingeniously supposes. The Roman rule is
                    next marked by the issue of proconsular cistophori. After the disturbance caused
                    by the civil wars these cease, and there are only bronze pieces, which we may
                    suppose to be of the latest days of the republic. The imperial money follows, of
                    far higher interest than the autonomous. There are many representations of the
                    temples of the city, including that of the famous shrine of Artemis, which shows
                    the bands of sculpture on the columns, as well as many other remarkable
                    subjects, particularly the Zeus of rain seated on Mount Prion, a shower fallin"
                    from his left hand, while below are seen the temple of Artemis and the river-god
                    Caÿster; on another coin the strange Asiatic figure <pb break="no"

                    between the personified rivers Caÿster and Cenehrius (see Head’s <hi

                <p>Erythrae has fine coins, mainly transitional, with a horseman about to mount his
                    steed, and a flower. These are Persic, and after a long pause there is a series
                    of Rhodian weight of about Alexander’s age, and later Attic, having types
                    connected with Heracles. The series of autonomous bronze is large. The money of
                    the Ionian Magnesia begins with the issue of Themistocles, when he was dynast
                    under Persian protection. In the decline of the Oriental power the city strikes
                    her own money, with the types of an armed horseman and a humped bull butting,
                    surrounded by the labyrinth pattern which symbolizes the river Maeander. The
                    weight is Persic. After a long pause we observe the currency recommencing with
                    spread tetradrachms of the decline of art, more delicately executed than those
                    of Cyme and Myrina, with a bust of Artemis and a figure of Apollo standing on a
                    maeander and leaning against a lofty tripod, the whole in a laurel-wreath. The
                    great city of Miletus is disappointing in its money. The period of its highest
                    prosperity is too early for an abundant coinage, yet in the oldest electrum
                    issues we see the lion of Miletus. It is not, hoλvever, until the confederacy
                    with Athens after the battle of Mycale that there is a common silver coinage,
                    with the lion’s head and a star, of Attic weight. Later money with the same
                    types seems to show the influence of thé Carian princes. It closes with
                    beautiful coins bearing the head of Apollo facing and the lion looking back at a
                    star, with the inscription EΓ ΔΙΔΥΜΩΝ ΙΕΡΗ, showing, whatever be the word
                    understood, that this was the “sacred” money of the famous temple at Didyma.
                    Next come fine coins of about Alexander’s time, differing from the last in
                    having the head in profile. The weight is equally Phoenician. The types continue
                    through a series of various standards with very rare Attic gold staters. Phocaea
                    is represented by two very interesting currencies: an electrum series of hectae
                    like that of Cyzicus, but of inferior purity, characterized by a seal, the badge
                    of the town, beneath the type; and also a widespread early silver coinage,
                    apparently common to the Western colonies of the city. The autonomous money is
                    wholly anterior to the Persian conquest. Smyrna first strikes late Attic
                    tetradrachms, with the turreted head of Cybele or the city or the Amazon Smyrna,
                    and an oak-wreath sometimes enclosing a lion. A rare silver coin presents on the
                    reverse the seated figure of Homer, also occurring in the autonomous bronze, of
                    which there is very much, partly of imperial time as well as a long series of
                    imperial bronze. Among the bronze coins we notice those with the head of
                    Mithradates. The earlier imperial coins are of delicate work. Those of the young
                    Vespasian are historically interesting.</p>
                <p>Of Teos there are early Aeginetic didrachms, bearing on the one side a seated
                    griffin with curled wings and on the other a quadripartite incuse square. These
                    ceased at the moment when the population left the town, destroyed by the
                    Persians, and fled to Abdera, where we recognize their type on the coinage of
                    the time. There are much later coins of less importance.</p>
                <p>Chios and Samos, islands of Ionia, are represented by interesting currencies.
                    Chios struck electrum and abundant silver. The type was a seated sphinx with
                    curled wing, and before it stands an amphora, above which is a bunch of grapes;
                    the reverse has a quadripartite incuse. The coins begin before the Persian
                    conquest (490 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and are first archaic and then of
                    fine style. There is apparently a gap in the later Persian period. Afterwards
                    there is a cessation of money until Sulla’s time, when silver is again struck
                    and bronze seems to begin.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Samos is artistically disappointing, but as a whole has many
                    claims to interest. The earliest money must have included electrum, but we are
                    unable to discriminate between the rival claims of Lesbos and Samos; some
                    pieces, however, cannot reasonably be doubted to belong to Samos. The silver
                    begins before 494 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when history comes to our aid
                    to make a marked division. The types are the well-known lion’s scalp and bull’s
                    head, of Oriental origin, both probably connected with the worship of Hera. They
                    are continued in the next period, and the Athenian conquest (439 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) is only marked by the introduction of the
                    olive-spray as a constant symbol on the reverse and the more important change
                    from degraded Phoenician to Attic weight. Notwithstanding the regularity of
                    their coin type, the Samians, having joined the anti-Laconian alliance after
                    Conon’s victory in 394 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> struck the coin with
                    Heracles strangling the serpents already noticed under Ephesus; the Rhodian
                    weight is thus introduced. We next notice an Alexandrine tetradrachm of the
                    class of those issued after the battle of Magnesia. There is nothing further of
                    interest until the long series of imperial money, which, though wanting in
                    beauty of style, is not without interesting types. Of the mythological subjects
                    the most remarkable is the Asiatic figure of the Samian Hera, which clearly
                    associates her with the group of divinities to which the Ephesian Artemis
                    belongs. Very noticeable also are the representations of Pythagoras, seated or
                    standing, touching a globe with a wand (see Professor Gardner’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Samos).</hi></p>
                <p>The money of Caria does not present any one great series. Autonomous silver coins
                    are not numerous except at Cnidus, and rarely of good style. Antiochia has late
                    Attic silver pieces; as this city was founded, by Antiochus I., its coinage is
                    important as fixing the date of similar money of Miletus. There are imperial
                    coins of this town, and of Aphrodisias, worthy of notice. Cnidus is represented
                    at first by archaic coins going down to about 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Their weight is Aeginetic, and the types are a lion’s head and the head ot
                    Aphrodite. There are, after a break, coins of Rhodian weight about 400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> others preceding Alexander, and others, again, after
                    his age. An imperial coin represents the famous statue of Aphrodite by
                    Pιaxiteles. Of Halicarnassus there are small silver pieces of the age of good
                    art, and others of subsequent times, including that of the Carian kings, and the
                    silver money continues after Alexander. Among the imperial types the head of
                    Herodotus is noteworthy, there is late silver money of Iasus with the head of
                    Apollo, and a youth swimming beside a dolphin around which his arm is thrown. It
                    is interesting to compare this type with the similar subjects of Tarentum. Idyma
                    has silver pieces of fine style on which the head of Apollo is absolutely
                    facing, as sometimes at Catana in Sicily; the reverse type is a fig-leaf. Myndus
                    on its late silver perhaps shows in the head-dress of Isis a trace of the
                    Ptolemaic occupation. Tabae has also late silver; and of Termera we have the
                    rare coin of its tyrant Tymnes, dating about the middle of the 5th century and
                    struck on the Persic system.</p>
                <p>The Carian kings prove their wealth by their series of coins, which bear the
                    names of Mausolus, Hidrieus, and Pixodaτus, Artemisia, the widow of Mausolus,
                    being absent. The weight is Rhodian; the types are the three-quarter head of
                    Apollo, and Zeus Labrandeus standing, holding the labrys or two-headed axe.
                    Mausolus strikes tetradrachms, Pixodarus gold of Attic weight. His silver is the
                    best in the series, and clearly shows the Ionian style in its quality of
                    expression.</p>
                <p>Calymna heads the islands of Caria. Its money begins with curious archaic Persian
                    double drachms bearing a barbarous helmeted male head and on the reverse a lyre
                    incuse. Later there are coins of about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                    series of Cos begins with small archaic pieces, the type a crab and the reverse
                    incuse. Next come fine coins of transitional style and Attic weight, with the
                    types of a discobolus before a tripod, and a crab. The wrestlers of Aspendus may
                    be compared with the remarkable obverse type. The common break then interrupts
                    the issue, and a new coinage occurs before the time of Alexander. The weight is
                    Rhodian, the types the head of Heracles and the crab. After Alexander there is
                    another currency which ceases about 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> It is
                    resumed later with the new types of the head of Aesculapius and his serpent.
                    This continues in Roman times. The bronze of that age comprises a coin with the
                    head of Hippocrates and on the reverse the staff of Aesculapius. Xenophon’s head
                    likewise occurs, and the portrait of Nicias tyrant in Cos (c. 50 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) on his bronze. Imperial money ends the series. Of
                    the island of Megiste there are charming little silver pieces of about 400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> with Rhodian types, the head of Helios in profile and
                    the rose.</p>
                <p>The island of Rhodes, great in commerce and art, has a rich series of coins. The
                    want of variety in the types—at the city of Rhodes almost limited to the head of
                    Helios and the rose—is disappointing, but happily the principal subject could
                    not fail to illustrate the movements of art, one of which had here its centre,
                    and the continuity of the money affords valuable metrological evidence. The city
                    of Rhodes was founded <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 408 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> on the abandonment by their inhabitants of the three chief towns of
                    the island, Camirus, Ialysus, and Lindus. The money of Camirus seems to begin
                    before 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The type is the fig-leaf, the weight
                    Aeginetic, later degraded or changed to Persic. The coins of Ialysus, of the 5th
                    century, follow the Rhodian standard. Their types are the forepart of a winged
                    boar and an eagle’s head of a vulturine type. The money of Lindus, apparently
                    before 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is of Phoenician weight, with the
                    type of a lion’s head. The people of the new city of Rhodes adopted another
                    standard, the Attic, and very shortly abandoned it, except for gold money, using
                    instead that peculiar weight which has been called Rhodian but may better be
                    considered to be heavy Phoenician; this they retained until the last years of
                    their independent coinage, when they resumed the Attic. The types are the
                    three-quarter face of Helios and the rose. The first series was issued from the
                    building of Rhodes to 304 B.C., the chief coins being the gold stater and the
                    silver tetradrachm. There is a grandeur and noble outlook in the countenance of
                    Helios which well befits his character, but the pictorial style is evident in
                    the form of the hair and the expression, which, with all its reserve, has a
                    dramatic quality. From 304 to 186 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> there is a
                    change of type, and the head of Helios is radiate. The profile head which now
                    also occurs, and the constant pictorial handling of the hair, not, as before, in
                    its outlines only, but also in its masses, show the qualities of Lysippus. It is
                    perplexing to note that the standard of weight is below that of those coins
                    which Ptolemy I. struck for Alexander IV. on the Rhodian weight; but this
                    difficulty disappears if we regard the standard as Phoenician, and both the
                    Rhodians and Ptolemy as borrowers. The Alexandrine tetradrachms, which were
                    issued after the battle of Magnesia, find a place in the Rhodian mintage.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n705/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0705-0648"/>
                <p>Small coins follow this currency. In 166 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    favourable political circumstances cause a new issue of money. The Attic gold
                    staters of this age have a strikingly dramatic style, pointing to the great
                    local school; the silver, with the head of Helios in profile,—in the gold it is
                    three-quarter face,— is still marked by careful execution. In the latest coins,
                    from 88 to 43 B.C., the Attic standard, now universal, whether the chief coin
                    was called drachm or denarius, again appears. During the age after Alexander
                    there is an abundant bronze coinage, with some pieces of unusual size. The
                    series closes with a few imperial coins ranging from Nerva to Marcus
                    Aurelius.</p>
                <p>The early coinage of Lycia introduces us at once into a region of Asiatic
                    mythology, art, and language, raising many questions as yet without an answer.
                    The standard of the oldest coins is Persic, and it falls perhaps under Athenian
                    influence, until it becomes equivalent with the Attic. The Lycian character
                    belongs to the primitive alphabets of Asia Minor, which combine with archaic
                    Greek forms others which are unknown to the Greek alphabet, and it expresses a
                    native language as yet but imperfectly understood. The art is stiff and delights
                    in animal forms, sometimes of monstrous types, which recall the designs of
                    Phoenicia and Assyria. The most remarkable symbol is the so-called triquetra, an
                    object resembling a ring, to which three or four hooks are attached. It is
                    supposed to be a solar symbol like the swastika. The oldest money, probably
                    dating from about 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> has a boar or his
                    fore-part and an incuse. This is succeeded by a series in which the hooked ring
                    is the usual reverse type. It bears Lycian inscriptions, which may usually
                    denote tribes; one certainly indicates the town of Tlos. This coinage probably
                    reaches as late as Alexander’s time. It is followed by silver and bronze money
                    of the Lycian League before Augustus and under his reign, but ceasing in that of
                    Claudius,—the usual types of the chief silver piece, a hemidrachm, being the
                    head of Apollo and the lyre. Besides this general currency there are some
                    special ones of towns not in the League. The imperial money rarely goes beyond
                    the reign of Augustus, and is resumed during that of Gordian III. There is a
                    remarkable coin of Myra of this emperor, showing the goddess of the city, of a
                    type like the Ephesian Artemis, in a tree; two woodcutters, each armed with a
                    double axe, hew at the trunk, from which two serpents rise as if to protect it
                    and aid the goddess. Phaselis is an exceptional town, for it has early Greek
                    coins, the leading type being a galley.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Pamphylia offers some examples of good art distinctly marked by
                    the Asiatic formality. Aspendus shows a remarkable series of Persic didrachms,
                    extending from about 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to Alexander’s time. The
                    oldest coins have the types of a warrior and the triskelion or three legs, more
                    familiarly associated with Sicily; it is probably a solar symbol. One has an
                    extraordinary reverse type, in which the triskelion is engraved upon an
                    advancing lion, also, held to have a solar meaning. These coins are followed by
                    a long series with the types of two wrestlers engaged and a slinger. The main
                    legend is almost always in the Pamphylian character and language. There are also
                    very curious imperial types. The money of Perga is very interesting. It begins
                    in archaic style, and is resumed after the age of Alexander with Greek types of
                    the Artemis of Perga. Her figure in a remarkable Asiatic form occurs in the long
                    imperial series. Bronze coins earlier in date than the silver money with the
                    Greek types have the Pamphylian title of the goddess, read by W. Μ. Ramsay <hi
                    rend="italic">{Hellenic Journal),</hi> F ΑΝΑΣΣΑΣ ΠPEIIAΣ, “of the queen of

                    types being the head of Athene and Nice, of about the first century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> for they are imitated by Amyntas, king of
                    Galatia.</p>
                <p>The money of Pisidia is chiefly imperial. There is a long series of this class of
                    the colonia Antiochia. The autonomous coins of Selge have the wrestlers and the
                    slinger of Aspendus in inferior and even barbarous copies. Of Isauria and
                    Lycaonia a few cities strike coins of imperial class or time.</p>
                <p>Cilicia, a coastland, is numismatically of high interest. Celenderis, a colony of
                    Samos, has archaic coins of Aeginetic weight, their type a goat, the reverse
                    being incuse. These are followed by a splendid coinage of transitional and fine
                    art, with a horseman seated sideways on the obverse and on the reverse a goat
                    kneeling on one knee. The latest, about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> are
                    free from stiffness, and the horseman may be favourably compared with the
                    similar types of Tarentum. The weight is the Persic didrachm. Mallus has a most
                    interesting series of silver coins, some with curious Asiatic types. Of Nagidus
                    there are Persic didrachms of good style, one interesting type being Aphrodite
                    seated, before whom Eros flies crowning her, with, on the other side, a standing
                    Dionysus. Soli has silver coins of the same weight, the types being the head of
                    Athene, one variety imitated from remote Velia, and a bunch of grapes; they are
                    anterior to Alexander. The coinage of Tarsus begins with rough and thick
                    tetradrachms of Attic weight, evidently issued soon after Alexander’s reign, and
                    for no long time subsequently. The types are the Baal of Tarsus and a lion. The
                    autonomous bronze of the Seleucid age shows the remarkable subject of the pyre
                    of Sandan, the local form of Heracles; and there is a long and curious imperial
                    series.</p>
                <p>The coinage of the great island of Cyprus is, as we might expect from its
                    monuments, almost exclusively non-Hellenic in character. The weight-system,
                    except of gold, which is Attic, is Persic, save only in the later coins of the
                    kings of Salamis, who strike on the reduced Rhodian standard. The art is usually
                    very stiff’ down to about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> with types of
                    Egypto-Phoeuician or Phoenician or of Greek origin. The inscriptions are in the
                    Cyprian character, belonging to the interesting group of alphabets of Asia
                    Minor, of which the Lycian and Pamphylian are instances. The character has been
                    read, and the attributions of the coins are thus taking shape. The prevalent
                    types are animals or their heads, the chief subjects being the bull, eagle,
                    sheep, lion, the lion seizing the stag, the deer, and the mythical sphinx. The
                    divinities we can recognize are Aphrodite, Heracles, Athene, Hermes, and Zeus
                    Ammon. But the most curious mythological types are a goddess carried by a bull
                    or by a ram, in both cases probably Astarte, the Phoenician Aphrodite. The most
                    remarkable symbol is the well-known Egyptian sign of life. The coins appear to
                    have been struck by kings until before the age of Alexander, when civic money
                    appears. There are two well-defined currencies, that of the kings of Salamis,
                    who claimed a Greek origin, and that of the Phoenician dynasty of Citium. The
                    coins of the Salaminian line are in silver and gold. The earlier have Cyprian,
                    the later Greek inscriptions, the types generally being native, though after a
                    time under Hellenic influence. They are of Evagoras I., Nicocles, Evagoras II.,
                    Pnytagoras, and Nicocreon, and the coinage is closed by Menelaus, brother of
                    Ptolemy I., who, of course, does not take the regal title. The kings of Citium
                    from 448 to 332 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Baalmelek, Azbaal, Melekiaton,
                    and Pumiaton, strike silver and in one case gold, their general types being
                    Heracles, and the lion seizing the stag. Bronze begins soon after 400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and of the same age there are autonomous pieces, one
                    of Paphos in silver, and several of Salamis in bronze. There is Greek imperial
                    money from Augustus to Caracalla. The most remarkable type is the temple at
                    Paphos, represented as a structure of two stories with wings. Within the central
                    portion is the sacred stone, in front a semicirculaι ’ court.</p>
                <p>The earliest coinage of Lydia is no doubt that of the kings, already described.
                    The next currency must have been of Persian darics (gold) and drachms (silver),
                    followed by that of Alexander, the Seleucids, and the Attalids of Pergamum, and
                    then by the cistophori of the province of Asia. There is an abundant bronze
                    coinage of the cities, autonomous from the formation of the province, and of
                    imperial time, but mostly of the imperial class. The largest currencies are of
                    Magnesia, Philadelphia, Sardis, Thyatira, and Tralles. The art is not
                    remarkable, though good for the period, and the types are mostly Greek.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Phrygia has the same general characteristics as that of Lydia.
                    Among noteworthy types must be noticed Men or Lunus, the Phrygian moon-god, and
                    the legendary Minos. There are curious types of Apamea, surnamed Kibotos or the
                    Ark, and more anciently Celaenae. One of Severus represents the legend of the
                    invention of the double pipe, a type already described. Of the same and later
                    emperors are coins bearing the famous type of the ark of Noah and the name N∩E.
                    The town of Cibyra is remarkable for a silver coinage, of which the large pieces
                    have the weight of cistophori. They are of the first century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and were probably struck by one or more tyrants of
                    the four confederate cities of which Cibyra was the head, a state which came to
                    an end 84 B.c.</p>
                <p>Galatia has little to offer of interest. Trajan issued bronze imperial coins for
                    the province, and there is imperial money of Ancyra and Pessinus, besides other
                    series of less importance. The only remarkable regal issue is that of Amyntas,
                    Strabo’s contemporary, who struck tetradrachms, imitating the late money of
                    Side.</p>
                <p>With the coinage of Cappadocia we bid farewell to Greek art and enter on the
                    domain of Oriental conventionalism, succeeded by inferior Roman design coarsely
                    executed. There is one large imperial series, that of Caesarea, which
                    numismatists have unduly increased by the introduction of many uncertain coins,
                    all of which cannot even be proved to be Asiatic. The issues range from Tiberius
                    to Gordian HI., and are in silver and bronze. The most common type is the sacred
                    Mount Argaeus, on which a statue is sometimes seen,—a remarkable type curiously
                    varied. There are scanty issues of a few other towns. There is an interesting
                    series of coins of the kings of Cappadocia, who struck Attic drachms, and far
                    more rarely tetradrachms. The usual names are Ariarathes and Ariobarzanes, the
                    first being that of the old line who claimed descent from one of the Persian
                    chiefs who slew the Magian. The earliest coins are of Ariarathes IV. (220-163
                    B.C.). The rare tetradrachms of Orophernes, a successful claimant in the next
                    reign, bear a fine portrait. There are also tetradrachms of Ariarathes V. and of
                    another king of the same name, a son of Mithradates of Pontus, put by him on the
                    Cappadocian throne. The coins of Archelaus, the last king set up <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n706/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0706-0649"/> by Antony, have a good head on the obverse. Of
                    Armenia there are a few silver and bronze coins of late sovereigns.</p>
                <p>The great series of Syrian money begins with bronze coins of Trajan, struck,
                    according to his custom, for the province. From these we pass to the money of
                    the Seleucid kings of Syria, only rivalled for length and abundance by that of
                    the Ptolemies, which it excels in its series of portraits, though it is far
                    inferior in its gold money and wants the large and well-executed bronze pieces
                    which make the Egyptian currency complete. The gold of the Seleucids is scarce,
                    and their main coinage is a splendid series of tetradrachms bearing the
                    portraits of the successive sovereigns. The reverse types are varied for the
                    class of regal money. The execution of the portraits is good, and forms the best
                    continuous history of portraiture for the third and second centuries before our
                    era. The reverses are far less careful. The weight is Attic, but the cities of
                    Phoenicia were ultimately allowed to strike on their own standard. Seleucus I.
                    began by striking gold staters and tetradrachms with the types of Alexander the
                    Great. The same king, like his contemporaries, then took his own types: for gold
                    staters, his head with a bull’s horn, and on the reverse a horse’s head with
                    bull’s horns; for tetradrachms, Alexander’s head in a helmet of hide with bull’s
                    horn and lion’s skin, and Nice crowning a trophy, or the head of Zeus, and
                    Athene fighting in a car drawn by four or two elephants with bull’s horns. The
                    Zeus and elephant-car type is remarkable for presenting in some cases the names
                    of Seleucus I. and fiis son Antiochus I. as colleagues. Antiochus I., like his
                    father, first struck tetradrachms with Alexandrine types, and then with his own
                    head, Heracles seated and Apollo on the omphalos occupying the reverse. The
                    portrait of Antiochus has a characteristic realism, though marked by the deep
                    recessing of the eye which is a characteristic of the school of Lysippus. The
                    tetradrachms assigned to Antiochus II., Seleucus II., Antiochus Hierax (a
                    doubtful attribution), Seleucus I II., and young Antiochus his son are not
                    specially noteworthy. Antiochus III. is represented by a fine and interesting
                    series. He alone of the Seleucids seems to have struck the great octadrachm in
                    gold in rivalry of the Ptolemies. His portrait is vigorous, and the elephant
                    which varies the seated Apollo on the reverse of his silver tetradrachms
                    relieves the heraldic dryness of that type. Thêre are rare copper coins of the
                    rebel satraps Molon and Achaeus. The regal series is continued under Seleucus
                    IV., and again becomes interesting with the money of Antiochus IV. (Epiphanes).
                    His portrait is extremely characteristic, marked by the mad obstinacy which is
                    the key to the tyrant’s history. The most remarkable coin is a tetradrachm with
                    the head of Antiochus in the character of Zeus, an instance of audacity
                    unexampled in coinage. In his time mints became numerous in the bronze coinage,
                    and there is a remarkable series in that metal with Ptolemaic types, marking his
                    short-lived usurpation in Egypt. Passing by his son Antiochus V., we note a
                    great change in the coinage of Demetrius I. The silver tetradrachms now bear
                    both mints and dates, a custom that generally prevails henceforward. In one type
                    the heads of Demetrius and Queen Laodice occur side by side. One of these coins
                    in the British Museum is struck on a ietradrachm of Timarchus, the revolted
                    satrap of Babylon, who takes the style “Great King.” With Alexander I. (Balas)
                    Tyre and Sidon begin to strike royal tetradrachms on their own Phoenician
                    weight. The money of Demetrius II. follows, then that of the young Antiochus
                    VI., with the most carefully executed portrait in the whole series, which,
                    despite its weakness, has a certain charm of sweetness that marks it as a new
                    type in art. The same artist’s hand seems apparent in the fine portrait of the
                    cruel usurper Tryphon, whose features have a beauty of expression that must
                    surely be ideal, and also in the picturesque spiked Macedonian helmet with a
                    goat’s horn and cheek-piece which occupies the reverse, on which is written
                    after “King Tryphon” the strange title “autocrator.” Antiochus VII. continues
                    the series with, amongst other coins, the solitary bronze piece of Jerusalem,
                    bearing the lily and the Seleucid anchor. On his money of Tarsus we note the
                    first appearance of the pyre of the local Oriental divinity. The restored
                    Demetrius II. now reappears, the Phoenician money with his beardless head, the
                    rest usually with the beard he had grown in his Parthian captivity. Alexander
                    II. (Zebina) follows, and then Cleopatra, widow of Demetrius II., Alexander I.,
                    and Antiochus VII., next appears as colleague of her son Antiochus VIII. Her
                    coarse features are in keeping with the vileness of her character. Antiochus
                    VIII. alone amid the subsequent Seleucids has an interesting coinage, and the
                    empire closes with the coarse money of the Armenian Tigranes, his portrait with
                    the lofty native tiara, and for reverse Antioch seated, the Orontes swimming at
                    her feet.</p>
                <p>There is a copper coinage of the cities of Commagene, Samosata, and Zeugma, and
                    less important mints. The money of Samosata is of the time of the kings of
                    Commagene and also imperial, this showing the type of the city derived from the
                    famous statue of Antioch. The series of Zeugma is imperial, and has the subject
                    of a temple on a mountain. The money of the kings of Commagene is in bronze, of
                    late date, and not of much interest.</p>
                <p>Cyrrhestica has bronze coins of a few cities, nearly all imperial, the chief
                    mints being Cyrrhus and Hierapolis. The last bear thé inscription ΘΕΑΣ ∑YPIAΣ
                    IEPOΠOAITΩN, and have figures of the goddess seated on a throne flanked by lions
                    or riding on a lion, thus directly connecting her with Cybele.</p>
                <p>Of Chalcidene there are bronze coins of Chalcis and of the tetrarchs, and
                    Palmyrene shows only the small bronze pieces of I almyra, the money of Zenobia
                    and the family of Odenathus being found in the series of Alexandria.</p>
                <p>Seleucis and Pieria, the brother states (on the coins ΑΔΕΛΦΩΝ ΔΗΜΩΝ), have bronze
                    coins, dated (149-147 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) and undated. But the bulk
                    of the money of this territory is of the great city of Antioch on the Orontes.
                    This long series, second only to that of Alexandria in quantity, is of far less
                    interest from the want of variety in the types, but it is curious
                    chronologically. The coinage is both autonomous bronze before and of Roman
                    times, and imperial base metal and bronze. The base metal money is at first of
                    debased silver, then of potin, and at last of bronze washed with silver. The
                    imperial bronze coins have at the same time both Greek and Latin inscriptions,
                    the last with S.C. Trajan combines the Greek inscription with the Latin S.C.,
                    and when the city had been made a colonia by Caracalla this is indicated in
                    Greek inscriptions from Elagabalus downwards. No less than four eras are used.
                    The era of the Seleucids, the dates being from 97 to 37 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> occurs on the autonomous money; so also the Pharsalian era, from 38
                    to 22 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and on imperial coins as late as Titus;
                    the Actian era on autonomous coins, from 6 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 13
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> continuing under the early emperors; and the
                    Caesarian era on the autonomous class, from 55 to 158 A.D. The mass of imperial
                    coins and all after Titus are dated by the tribunitian years of the emperors.
                    The leading types are the figure of Antioch seated, the river Orontes swimming
                    at her feet, from the famous statue by Eutychides, and the eagle on a
                    thunderbolt, a palm in front. Under Hadrian the eagle is represented carrying an
                    ox’s leg, a reference to the story of the foundation of the city when an eagle
                    carried off part of the sacrifice and deposited it on the site which was
                    consequently chosen. There are few other types. The art is rude, though certain
                    base metal coins show a largeness and decision in the heads, while wanting
                    Hellenic refinement. The imperial series is very full and has an historical
                    value as showing what emperors ruled Syria. It includes money of Sulpicius
                    Antoninus, the Uranius Antoninus of Roman gold also struck in Syria. The series
                    ends with Valerian, though it begins anew in the Roman provincial money of the
                    reform of Diocletian, to be noticed later.</p>
                <p>Of Apamea there are bronze coins of the age of the Seleucids, the elephant type
                    which occurs being appropriate. At Emesa in the bronze imperial money Sulpicius
                    Antoninus reappears, one of his coins having for reverse the characteristically
                    Syrian type of a sacred conical stone in a temple. The money of Gabala is
                    autonomous and imperial, with, in this class, curious mythological types.
                    Laodicea has an important series. It begins with Phoenician tetradrachms and
                    bronze money of the later Seleucids. The tetradrachms have a turreted and veiled
                    female bust of the city, a favourite Syrian and Phoenician type. These
                    autonomous coins are followed by an imperial coinage like that of Antioch; from
                    Caracalla downwards Laodicea is a colonia; the inscriptions become Latin, then,
                    very strangely, Greek on the obverse of the coins and Latin on the reverse.
                    Seleucia has a similar autonomous and imperial currency, but does not become a
                    colonia. There is a curious type of an apparently open shrine of Zeus Casius
                    containing a sacred stone.</p>
                <p>In Coele-Syria there is bronze of Damascus, late autonomous and. imperial; the
                    city becomes a colonia. The imperial money of Heliopolis, a coloiιia, shows a
                    great temple in perspective, another temple containing an ear of corn as the
                    central object of worship, and a view of the Acropolis with the great temple
                    upon it, and steps leading up the rock.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Phoenicia is a large and highly interesting series. The autonomous
                    money is here important, and indicates the ancient wealth of the great marts of
                    the coast. The earliest coins were struck during and shortly after the Persian
                    rule, and the most important classes have not been certainly fixed. It is
                    therefore needful to speak of them before describing the attributed money of the
                    cities. These coins are of Phoenician weight, except one class, which follows
                    the Persic standard. The great currency is of silver octadrachms. The types,
                    limited in number, are Oriental in character; the leading one is the war-galley;
                    the king of Persia also occurs, and the fish-god Dagon. The art is hard, but has
                    a force that reminds us of archaic Greek; it is, however, Oriental. The
                    inscriptions are in the Phoenician character. Three great classes are
                    distinguished. Octadrachms range from about 400 B,c. to Alexander’s time. The
                    types are a war-galley in full sail and the king in a car; then for the obverse
                    the war-galley beneath the walls of a fort, and below two lions. Didrachms with
                    a similar obverse have for reverse the king slaying a lion. Octadrachms follow
                    with the war-galley and the king in his car apparently followed by a vassal.
                    These coins have been assigned to Sidon. A series of tetradrachms is of less
                    importance. The obverse has a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n707/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0707-0650"/> dolphin or the king as an archer on a sea-horse,
                    the reverse an owl with the Egyptian symbols of sovereignty, the crook with the
                    flail across it. These are after 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and have
                    been given to Tyre, but the Egyptian influence would perhaps suggest some town
                    nearer the southern border of Palestine. A third class of money of the same age
                    is of Persic weight. The earliest pieces have a head supposed to be of Melkarth
                    and a war-galley, the later examples bearing dates. The dated series continues,
                    but the obverse type changes to Dagon. These are assigned to Aradus. The series
                    bearing the names or symbols of cities would not be difficult to class were it
                    not for their constant interruption by Ptolemaic and Seleucid coins and by the
                    issue of Alexandrine tetradrachms. Berytus has bronze, both autonomous and of
                    the city as a colonia. The types of interest are the founding of the colonia,
                    Poseidon, not always of a purely Greek type, Poseidon and the nymph Berytus, the
                    temple of the same divinity, and the eight Phoenician gods or Cabiri. To Byblus
                    we may class with certainty a Phoenician currency, that of the native kings from
                    about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> to Alexander’s age. The imperial
                    coinage presents a very curious perspective representation of a temple in Graeco
                    - Phoenician style, with a conical edifice in the court. Caesarea ad Libanum
                    shows in its imperial money a strange type of Elagabalus, a half-figure of the
                    Syrian goddess in a shrine. She wears a cap like a papyrus head and is enwrapped
                    in shapeless drapery. The shrine is of Egyptian style, and a sceptre with a bird
                    upon it is beside the goddess. Marathus has a very fine Phoenician tetradrachm
                    of 226 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> with the head of the city turre ted and a
                    youth holding an aplustre and seated on bucklers. This is a work of Greek design
                    and style, as is also a small coin of the year following with the head of Queen
                    Berenice II., then reigning. The copper is dated from 198 to 153 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.</hi></p>
                <p>Tlιe undoubted money of Sidon begins with Alexandrine gold and silver, dated
                    shortly after the king’s reign. This was followed by other Alexandrine money,
                    interrupted by that of Ptolemy II., Arsinoe II., and Ptolemy III. Ptolemy IV.
                    also struck here and Antiochus IV. in bronze; and later Seleucids issued
                    tetradrachms from 151 to 114 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. The era of the
                    autonomy of Sidon was 111 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> There are tetradrachms
                    dated by this reckoning with the head of the city and an eagle on a rudder,
                    across him a palm. In the bronze we observe the type of Europa earned by the
                    bull. Some pieces of this class have Phoenician as well as Greek inscriptions.
                    The imperial money shows a curious shrine on wheels. In the time of Elagabalus
                    Sidon is characterized as a colonia. The type of a temple of Astarte as a local
                    Aphrodite is worth notice. The series closes with Julia Maesa. Tripolis has an
                    interesting but limited autonomous and imperial series. The worship of the
                    Dioscuri is here associated with Asiatic religion. Architecturally these coins
                    are highly curious.</p>
                <p>The early money that can be classed with certainty to Tyre exhibits similar
                    historical vicissitudes to that of Sidon. Before she gained her independence the
                    Seleucids struck here from 149 to 125 B. c., and in that very year the
                    autonomous era begins. The tetradrachms dated by this era bear the head of the
                    Tyrian Heracles in a Greek form, and the eagle on a rudder, across him the palm.
                    The latest coin of this series known to us is a didrachm of 66 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> There is also autonomous bronze. The imperial class
                    begins with Severus, and under him the constitution of the colonia is shown; but
                    the most interesting type is a serpent coiled round an egg, between a date-palm
                    (the phoenix or tree of Phoenicia) and a murex, the shell which produced the
                    Tyrian purple. The series ends with Gallienus. Aradus has Alexandrine coins, and
                    acquired its independence in 258 B. c. From this date it struck, first its chief
                    coins with Alexandrine types, then drachms with the types of Ephesus, the bee,
                    and the stag on this side of the date-palm, and lastly tetradrachms with the
                    bust of the city and Nice holding an aplustre and a palm within a wreath. These
                    are of heavy Phoenician weight. The imperial coinage ranges from Tiberius to
                    Gordian III.</p>
                <p>In Galilee there are a few autonomous and imperial coins of Ptolemais, which was
                    a great mint under the earlier Ptolemies; and other towns are represented. In
                    Peraea there is an imperial series of Gadara. Samaria has money of Caesarea,
                    both autonomous and imperial, the last for the most part colonial, and also
                    imperial of Neapolis, among the types of which occurs the interesting subject of
                    Mount Gerizim surmounted by the Samaritan temple. The coinage of Judaea is an
                    interesting series. The money of Jerusalem is of high interest, and more
                    extensive than appears at first sight. Here was struck the coin of Antiochus
                    VII., with the native lily as a type, the series of the Maccabaean princes, that
                    of the Roman procurators, and the bronze coins countermarked by the tenth
                    legion, quartered by Titus in the τuins of the city. One of these bears the
                    remarkable symbol of a pig. After the reduction of Judaea in the reign of
                    Hadrian, Jerusalem was rebuilt as a colonia with the name Aelia Capitolina. The
                    earliest coin commemorates the foundation. The coinage lasts as late as
                    Hostiliam Ascalon strikes autonomous silver and bronze, including remarkable
                    tetradrachms with the portraits of Ptolemy Auletes, of his elder son Ptolemy
                    XIV., and of his daughter Cleopatra. There is also money of Gaza of some
                    importance, and of Joppa, both previously mints of the earlier Ptolemies.</p>
                <p>The independent Jewish coinage begins with the famous shekels. They have been
                    assigned to various periods, but the preponderance of evidence would class them
                    to Simon Maccabaeus, to whom the right of coining was granted by Antiochus VII.
                    The series is of shekels and half-shekels, of the weight of Phoenician
                    tetradrachms and didrachms. The obverse of the shekel bears the inscription “the
                    shekel of Israel,” and for type the pot of manna, or it may be a sacred vessel
                    of the temple, above which is the initial of the word year, and the letter
                    indicating the year of issue. The reverse reads “Jerusalem the Holy,” and the
                    type is a flowering branch, either Aaron’s rod that budded or a native lily. The
                    half-shekel differs in having the inscription “half-shekel” on the obverse. The
                    types are markedly peculiar; the obverse inscription is equally so, for the
                    regular formula of the neighbouring cities would give nothing but the name of
                    the city; but the reverse inscription is like that of Tyre and Sidon, for
                    instance, “of Tyre sacred and inviolable,” of Sidon the same. This agreement is
                    confirmatory of the assignment to Simon Maccabaeus. This coinage bears the dates
                    of years 1, 2, 3, 4 (rare), and 5 (one specimen only). There is great difficulty
                    as to the date. It may be reckoned from the beginning of Simon’s actual rule
                    (142 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), or from that of his official rule, which
                    is stated to have been used by the Jews as an era (141 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> or from the decree of Antiochus VII. granting him the right of
                    coinage (c. 140-139 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). On the whole, the evidence
                    in favour of the official date is best. Any one of the three modes of dating
                    would allow five annual issues. There is another explanation which must not be
                    hastily dismissed. It may be that the computation is by sabbatical years, and
                    the fact that there are two types of year 1 lends some colour to this
                    supposition, though if it be admitted there would be a gap of six years between
                    the first and second issues, as both types of year· 1 have an inscription
                    modified on the coins of years 2 to 5. There are bronze “half-shekels” and
                    “quartershekels” of the year 4. These may be later. The certain coins of the
                    successors of Simon are small bronze pieces of John Hyrcanus, of Judas
                    Aristobulus, of Alexander Jannaeus, who strikes bilingual Hebrew and Greek and
                    also Hebrew coins, showing his native name to have been Jonathan, and of
                    Antigonus, who has the Hebrew name Mattathiah. The Maccabaean coinage is
                    followed by that of the Herodian family, equally of bronze, the two most
                    important issues being those of Herod the Great and Herod Agrippa II. The money
                    of the procurators of Judaea, in part parallel with the Herodian, is of small
                    bronze coins, struck between 6-7 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> and 58-59 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the latest period of their administration being as
                    yet unrepresented. These are followed by two important classes, the money of the
                    first revolt (66-70 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> and that of the second
                    (suppressed 135 A.n.). Both risings caused the issue of native silver coinage,
                    some of which may be assigned with certainty to each, while the assignment of
                    others is doubtful. Of the first revolt are silver and bronze pieces with the
                    name of Eleazar the priest, silver of Simon, and large and smaller bronze pieces
                    with the name of Simon the prince of Israel. Of the second revolt are restruck
                    denarii with the name of Simon, which appears to have been that of the leader
                    surnamed Bar-cochab or Bar-coziba. Of the first or second revolt are shekels
                    with the name of Simon, the obverse type a gate of the temple, and on the
                    reverse a bundle of branches and a citron, symbols of the feast of tabernacles.
                    Though these differ, it is rash to assign one variety to the earlier and another
                    to the later revolt. Besides this native currency there are coins struck in
                    Palestine by Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. (See Madden’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jewish Coinage,</hi> new ed. )</p>
                <p>Of Roman Arabia there are bronze imperial coins of Bostra and less important
                    mints. In Mesopotamia the colonia of Carrhae deserves notice, and the city of
                    Edessa, which issues imperial money as a colonia, and has a series of coins of
                    its kings, striking with Roman emperors in silver and bronze. Curiously, this
                    and the colonial issue are long contemporary. The colonial coinages of Nisibis
                    and of Rhesaena, which became a colonia, close the group. Assyria is remarkable
                    for the imperial money of the ancient city of Nineveh, which appears as a
                    colonia with the name Niniva Claudiopolis. The money of Babylon struck by the
                    usurpers Molon and Timarchus has been noticed under the Seleucids.</p>
                <p>The coins of Africa are far less numerous than those of the other two continents,
                    as Greek, Phoenician, and Roman civilization never penetrated beyond Egypt and
                    the northern coast to the west. The series of Egypt is first in geographical
                    order. As yet no coins have been here assigned of a date anterior to Alexander.
                    The old Egyptians kept their gold, electrum, and silver in rings, and weighed
                    them to ascertain the value. During the Persian rule the Persian money must have
                    been current, and the satrap Aryandes is said to have issued a coinage of silver
                    under Darius I. In the papyri of this age the argenteus of the temple of Ptah is
                    mentioned, and this has been thought to be a coin of Persian type generally
                    assigned to Phoenicia. (Revillout, in <hi rend="italic">Revue
                    Égyptologique.')</hi> With Alexander a regular Greek coinage must have begun,
                    and some of his coins may be of Egyptian mints. With Ptolemy I. the great
                    Ptolemaic currency begins which lasted for three centuries. The characteristics
                    of this coinage are its splendid series of gold pieces and the size of the
                    bronze money. The execution of the earlier heads <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n708/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0708-0651"/> is good; afterwards they become coarse and
                    careless. At first the fine pieces were issued by the Phoenician, Cyprian, and
                    other foreign mints, the Egyptian work being usually inferior. While the
                    Seleucids were still striking good coins, the Ptolemies allowed their money to
                    fall into barbarism in Egypt and even in Cyprus. The obverse type is a royal
                    head, that of Ptolemy I. being the ordinary silver type, while that of Arsinoe
                    II. was long but not uninterruptedly continued on the gold. The head of Zeus
                    Ammon is most usual on the bronze coinage. A type once adopted was usually
                    retained. Thus Ptolemy I., Arsinoe II., Ptolemy IV., Cleopatra 1., have a kind
                    of commemoration in the coinage on the analogy of the priesthoods established in
                    honour of each royal pair. The almost universal type of reverse of all metals is
                    the Ptolemaic badge, the eagle on the thunderbolt, which, in spite of variety,
                    is always heraldic. For art and iconography this series is far inferior to that
                    of the Seleucids. The weight after the earlier part of the reign of Ptolemy I.
                    is Phoenician for gold and silver and either Attic or Egyptian for the bronze.
                    The chief coins are octadrachms in gold and tetradrachms in silver, besides the
                    abundant bronze money. Ptolemy I. appears to have issued his money while regent
                    for Philip Arrhidaeus; it only differs in the royal name from that of Alexander;
                    but as yet it has not been possible to separate Ptolemy’s coinage from that of
                    the other generals. He then struck money for Alexander IV. on the Attic standard
                    with the head of Alexander the Great, with the horn of Ammon in the elephant’s
                    skin and Alexander’s reverse. He soon adopted a new reverse, that of Pallas
                    Promachos, and next lowered the coins to the Rhodian standard. This money he
                    continued to strike after the young king’s death until he himself took the royal
                    title, when he issued his own money, his portrait on the one side and the eagle
                    and thunderbolt with his name as king on the other, and adopted the Phoenician
                    standard. This type in silver, with the inscription “Ptolemy the king,” is
                    thenceforward the regular currency. He also issued pentadrachms in gold, and he
                    or his successor octadrachms in silver. Ptolemy II. (Philadelphus), the richest
                    of the family, continued his father’s coinage, and, having acquired the cities
                    of Phoenicia, struck money there with his father’s title Soter, while the
                    Egyptian coinage merely bore the title of king: the one was a commemorative
                    coinage, the other, though bearing the portrait of Ptolemy I., was issued in the
                    name of the reigning sovereign. Philadelphus probably began the issue of the
                    gold octadrachms with the busts of Ptolemy I. and Berenice I., Ptolemy II. and
                    Arsinoe II., and certainly struck beautiful octadrachms in gold and decadrachms
                    in silver of Arsinoe II., the gold being long afterwards continued. The
                    Phoenician octadrachms and tetradrachms are dated by the king’s reign.
                    Philadelphus also began the great bronze issues of the system which includes the
                    largest coin, sometimes exceeding 1400 grains in weight. Ptolemy III. (Euergetes
                    I. ) continued his father’s coinages, after a while abandoning the dates in
                    Phoenicia. He also struck fine gold octadrachms with his own portrait. His queen
                    Berenice II., striking in her own right as heiress of the Cyrenaica and also as
                    consort, but with the royal title only given to heiresses in the Ptolemaic line,
                    issued a beautiful currency with her portrait, both octadrachms and decadrachms
                    like those of Arsinoe, and a coinage for the Cyrenaica of peculiar divisions.
                    Under Ptolemy IV. (Philopator) the coinage in its scantiness bears witness to
                    the decline of the state, but the gold octadrachms are continued with his
                    portrait and that of Arsinoe III. Ptolemy V. (Epiphanes) still strikes
                    octadrachms with his portrait, and begins the continuous series of the
                    tetradrachms of the three great cities of Cyprus, which, bearing regnal years,
                    afford invaluable aid in the classing of his and the later coinages. Among the
                    money of the regency of Cleopatra I. must be noticed a copper coin with her
                    portrait. Contemporaneously with it begins the series of Ptolemy VI.
                    (Philometor), broken by the invasion of Antiochus IV. (Epiphanes). This and the
                    money of Philometor’s brother and successor Ptolemy Physcon are only remarkable
                    for the many dates they bear, and.so with the coinage of succeeding kings, all
                    showing a gradual degradation of art and ultimately a great debasement in metal.
                    In the latest series, the money of the famous Cleopatra VII., it is interesting
                    to note the Egyptian variety of her head, also occurring on Greek imperial money
                    and on that of Ascalon. In Egypt we have the best executed and one of the
                    youngest portraits, and it shows that her face was marked by strong
                    characteristics of acuteness and mobility rather than of beauty.</p>
                <p>Under the Roman rule the imperial money of Alexandria, the coinage of the
                    province of Egypt, is the most remarkable in its class for its extent and the
                    interest and variety of its types; and it deserves a more careful study than it
                    has received. It begins under Augustus and ends with the usurper or patriot
                    Achilleus, called on his money Domitius Domitianus, overthrown by Diocletian,
                    thus lasting longer than Greek imperial money elsewhere. In the earlier period
                    there are potin coins continuing the base tetradrachms struck by Auletes, and
                    bronze money of several sizes. The types are very various, and may be broadly
                    divided into Greek, Graeco-Roman, and Graeco-Egyptian. The Graeco-Roman types
                    have the closest analogy to those of Rome herself; the Graeco-Egyptian are of
                    high interest as a special class illustrative of the latest phase of Egyptian
                    mythology.</p>
                <p>These native types do not immediately appear, but from the time of Domitian they
                    are of great frequency. The money of Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius is
                    abundant and interesting. A coin θf Antoninus, dated in his sixth year, records
                    the beginning of a new Sothiac cycle of 1460 years, which happened in the
                    emperor’s second year (139 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> The reverse type is
                    a crested crane, the Egyptian bennu or phoenix, with a kind of radiate nimbus
                    round its head, and the inscription ΑΙΩΝ. Under Claudius II. (Gothicus) and
                    thenceforward there is but a single kind of coin of bronze washed with silver.
                    In this series we note the money of Zenobia, and of the sons of Odenathus,
                    Vabalathus and Athenodorus.</p>
                <p>Coins of the nomes of Egypt were struck only by Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus
                    Pius. Their metal is bronze, and they are of different sizes. They were struck
                    at the metropolis of each nome, and their types relate to the local worship, and
                    so illustrate the Egyptian religion under a form modified by Greek influence.
                    The inscriptions are the names of the nomes. There is an exceptional coin of the
                    town of Pelusium.</p>
                <p>Passing by the unimportant coinage of the Libyans, we reach the interesting
                    series of the Cyrenaica, the one truly Greek currency of Africa. It begins under
                    the line of Battus (640-450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>), and reaches to the
                    Roman rule as far as the reign of Augustus. There are coins without the name of
                    any city, which we may consider to be of the Cyrenaica generally, and others of
                    Cyrene, Barca, Euesperides, and smaller towns. The weight of the gold always,
                    and of the silver until some date not long after 450 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> is Attic; afterwards it is Phoenician, of the Samian variety. The
                    ruling types are the silphium plant and its fruit, and the head of Zeus Ammon,
                    first bearded then beardless. The art is vigorous, and in the transitional and
                    fine period has the best Greek qualities. It is clearly an outlying branch of
                    the school of central Greece. The oldest coins are of the class which is without
                    the name of any city. So archaic are they that they may vie in antiquity with
                    the first issues of Lydia and of Aegina, and date in the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The money of Cyrene begins later, it may be a little
                    before the fall of the kings in 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> It comprises
                    a fine gold series of Attic staters with the types of the Olympian Zeus, more
                    rarely Zeus Ammon, and a victorious quadriga. Barca has a smaller coinage than
                    Cyrene. It comprises a wonderful tetradrachm (Phoenician), with the head of
                    Ammon bearded, boldly represented, absolutely full face, and three silphiums
                    joined, between their heads an owl, a chameleon, and a jerboa. The money of
                    Euesperides is less important. The Ptolemaic currency of the Cyrenaica has been
                    already noticed.</p>
                <p>Syrtica and Byzacena offer little of interest. Their coins are late bronze, first
                    with Punic inscriptions, then in imperial times with Latin and Punic or Latin.
                    Latin and Greek are used in the same coins at Leptis Minor in Byzacena.</p>
                <p>In Zeugitana the great currency of Carthage is the last representative of Greek
                    money, for, despite its Orientalism, its origin is Hellenic, and of this origin
                    it is at first not unworthy. Its range in time is from about 400 B. c. to the
                    fall of Carthage in 146 B. c. The earliest coins are Attic tetradrachms of the
                    class usually called Siculo-Punic. It has been usual to consider these coins as
                    having been wholly struck by the Carthaginians in Sicily, like the undoubted
                    Sicilian money of their settlements there and those absolute imitations of
                    Syracusan money which may be as reasonably classed to the island. But those who
                    insist on the attribution of the whole so-called Siculo-Punic class to Sicily
                    leave Carthage without any but a provincial coinage for at least half a century.
                    It is far more reasonable to infer that the earliest coinage of Carthage was
                    struck for the whole dominion, that with purely Sicilian types being limited to
                    Sicily. The next issues are of gold and electrum and silver, degenerating into
                    potin. The weights are extremely difficult. In the silver money the Phoenician
                    standard is almost universal, and we note the drachm, didrachm, tetτadrachm,
                    hexadrachm, octadrachm, decadrachm, and dodecadrachm. Coins are also found which
                    appear to follow the Persic standard, unless they are octobols and their
                    doubles. While the silver is thus explicable, the gold and electrum money is
                    very puzzling, and its very varying weights can only be explained by the theory
                    that silver was the standard, and gold was constantly fluctuating in its
                    relation. The earlier types are the horse or half-horse crowned by Nice and the
                    date-palm, the head of Persephone and the horse and palm-tree, a female head in
                    a cap, in splendid style, and a lion and a palm, and a head of young Heracles
                    and a horse’s head with a palm. It will be noted that the horse and the
                    palm-tree are most constant. On the later coins the obverse is uniformly
                    occupied by the head of Persephone and the reverse by the horse, sometimes with
                    the palm, the horse’s head and Pegasus being rare varieties. The bronze money
                    imitates the later silver. The few inscriptions are extremely difficult. One
                    that seems certain is ΠCΠΠ Γ∏p, the “new city,” Carthage. The art of the earlier
                    coins is sometimes purely Greek of Sicilian style. There is even in the best
                    class a curious tendency to exaggeration, which gradually develops itself and
                    finally becomes very barbarous. Roman Carthage has a bronze coinage which is
                    insignificant. There are a few other towns which issued money with Roman
                    legends, Utica, however, having first Punic and then <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n709/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0709-0652"/> Latin inscriptions. The denarii of Clodius Macer,
                    who revolted in 68 A.D., are curiously illustrative of his policy, which was to
                    restore the Roman republic.</p>
                <p>The cities of Numidia have Punic inscriptions, and there are interesting coins of
                    Juba I., his denarii presenting his portrait of a characteristic Libyan type. Of
                    Mauretania there are civic coins, chiefly using Punic characters, and an
                    interesting regal series, mainly denarii, of Bogud II., Juba II. with his
                    consort Cleopatra, daughter of Mark Antony and the famous Egyptian queen, and of
                    Ptolemy their son, the last of the great family of the kings of Egypt.</p>
                <p>II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman Coins.</hi></p>
                <p>The Roman coinage is of two great classes,—the republican, commonly called the
                    family coinage, and the imperial; the first lasted from the origin of money at
                    Rome to the reform of Augustus in 16 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and the
                    second from this date to the fall of the Western empire in 476 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The origin of the republican coinage is one of the
                    hardest problems in archaeology. The evidence of the money is at variance with
                    that of the ancient writers, and in setting these aside we are at variance with
                    the best authorities of our time; but the general principles of criticism must
                    be maintained here as in other matters of early Roman story.</p>
                <p>The oldest money of Rome was of bronze, and it is stated that it was first cast
                    as <hi rend="italic">aes</hi><hi rend="italic">rude.</hi> This statement is
                    confirmed by the discovery of shapeless masses of bronze, evidently broken off
                    from large quadrilateral masses, and then rendered of a roughly uniform weight.
                    To the aes rude succeeded the <hi rend="italic">aes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >signatum,</hi> the stamped bronze. This step is attributed to Servius Tullius
                    by ancient authority; it is said that he adopted the types of a sheep, ox, or
                    pig; and large masses of bronze have been found which present animal types,
                    including the pig. These are held to represent the coinage traditionally
                    attributed to the regal age, though it is admitted that they are for the most
                    part contemporary with the first circular money, the libral, the origin of which
                    Mommsen dates about 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> All the masses, however,
                    which bear a distinct type are clearly later than 300 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> as is proved by their style; and in the case of the elephant type we
                    are forced, by the first appearance of the animal in Italy under Pyrrhus, to
                    adopt a still later date. Moreover, the date of 450 is too early for the origin
                    of the circular money; consequently the idea of any trace of the supposed regal
                    coinage must be abandoned, though the late ingot may be descended from a
                    currency intermediate between the aes rude and the libral circular money. The
                    first regular Roman coinage consists of a series of cast pieces, the as of a
                    pound weight, libral, and its chief divisions, the semis (half), triens (third),
                    quadrans (fourth), sextans (sixth), and uncia (twelfth). The as was not cast of
                    full weight; the older specimens usually weigh from 11 to 9 unciae, on an
                    average 10. The origin of this system is assigned by Mommsen to the decemvirs,
                    on the ground of their legal institution, and particularly from the condition in
                    the Lex Julia Papiria (430 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> that fines should not
                    be paid in cattle but in money. Admitting the law to be correctly stated in its
                    original form, it proves no more than that money was current in Rome. The libral
                    coinage cannot, either in style or in types, possibly be much anterior to 350
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is easy to mistake barbarism for archaism, but
                    a practised eye will see that the types of these coins do not present a trace of
                    archaism, and are imitations of the types which originated in the latter part of
                    the 5th century, and were in fashion in the fourth. The heads of Jupiter and the
                    beardless Hercules are of this class. We must therefore suppose that the fines
                    were paid in metal by weight or in Greek money, which if it was bronze no doubt
                    was also weighed.</p>
                <p>At first there was no corresponding gold or silver, but the pound of bronze was
                    held to be equal to a scruple of silver. Campanian gold and silver money with
                    the name of the Romans or Rome was next struck to supply the want. The silver is
                    of Greek weight, with types usually connected with Roman legend. From one of the
                    earlier reverses being distinctly borrowed from the money of the Syracusan
                    tyrant Agathocles, who began to reign in 317 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> we
                    cannot date the first issue before about 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                    scanty gold in two or three groups is evidently of later dates; it presents
                    great metrological difficulties. The libral as fell in course of time from a
                    weight of 10 to one of 8 unciae, and was at length reduced to a weight of 4, or
                    that of a triens, and thus became triental. This is shown by the colonial coins
                    of Italy to have occurred about 269 B. c., probably in that very year, when the
                    silver coinage of Rome began. The dupondius (2 asses), tressis (3), and decussis
                    (10) were now issued at Rome, also the semuncia (.⅞ oz.) and the quadruncia (⅛
                    oz. ). Casting was ultimately abandoned and all coins struck, and by about 254
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> or soon after, the triental system became
                    sextantai; the multiples of the as and divisions of the uncia now cease. The
                    silver coinage was first issued in 269 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.; it
                    consisted of the denarius of 4 scruples or 72 grains (72 denarii being struck to
                    the pound), the quinarius of 2 scruples, and the sestertius of 1. As the old as
                    libralis was equal to 2⅜ triental asses, the new sestertius was equal to the as
                    libralis; as the coin was still in circulation this was inevitable, and the
                    words sestertius and aes grave are used synonymously. The relative value of
                    silver to bronze being thus maintained, the silver sestertius was exchanged for
                    the old as of 10 unciae, which was a real coin, whereas the new as of 4 unciae
                    (triental) was a mere token. The value in the bronze, X, was inscribed on the
                    denarii instead of IV. The bronze money soon became a token currency. The
                    victoriatus was issued in 228 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> not much after the
                    denarius; it was of 3 scruples, or three - fourths of the heavier coin, and was
                    intended to serve in the provinces for the Illyrian drachms of light Attic
                    weight; it could pass at Rome. The first purely Roman gold money is that of
                    Sulla, probably struck in Greece. Julius Caesar struck similar coins in 49 B.c.
                    To Octavian is due the settlement of the gold coinage. In 217 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the standard was reduced; the denarius was struck at
                    80 to the pound, and the as became uncial. The denarius remained stationary for
                    nearly three centuries, and its purity was maintained. The fate of the divisions
                    of the denarius is too complicated to be here noticed, but it may be remarked
                    that in 104 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the quinarius appeared with the type
                    of the victoriatus, which had disappeared, but with its own mark Q. When the as
                    fell from sextantai to uncial, the value changed from one-tenth to one-sixteenth
                    of the denarius, but, as troops were still paid at 10 asses to the denarius, the
                    X almost always appears as the mark of value on the silver piece. By this
                    reduction the relation of silver to bronze fell to less than half the original
                    value still current in accounts, and became 1 to 112. Thus the bronze money
                    represented more than double its metal value. In 89 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> the semuncial as was introduced, and from 80 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> bronze coinage ceased until Augustus issued his new currency in that
                    metal.</p>
                <p>The Roman coinage was struck both in the city and elsewhere. Consequently the
                    Roman, Italian, and other issues must be carefully discriminated. In the city
                    the right of striking was delegated to the monetary triumvirs, who could coin
                    individually or together, but as a rule they acted independently. The earlier
                    bronze and silver coins have fixed types. The obverse types are—for the as the
                    head of Janus Bifrons, for the semis that of Jupiter, the triens Pallas, the
                    quadrans Hercules, the sextans Mercury, and the uncia Roma. The reverse type is
                    always a prow. The marks of value are—for the as I, for the semis S, and a
                    certain number of balls equivalent to the value in ounces for the lower
                    denominations. The original types of the denarius were for the obverse the head
                    of Roma with a winged helmet and the mark of value X behind, and for the reverse
                    the Dioscuri on horseback charging. In 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> a new
                    type is introduced for the obverse, and a new reverse appears a century earlier,
                    but the great abundance of types dates from 93 B. c. These are so characteristic
                    that it is necessary to notice them particularly. The primary religious motive
                    is to be traced in them as in the types of Greek money, but their having been
                    selected to distinguish families instead of cities or peoples gives them a
                    character of their own. It is this character which ultimately rendered the
                    introduction of contemporary portraits almost a matter of course. The subject of
                    the obverse is usually the head of a divinity, or a personification, or a
                    traditional or an historical personage, ultimately one living, and the reverse
                    bears a mythological, symbolical, traditional, or historical subject.</p>
                <p>The following are the chief classes to which the types may be reduced :—·</p>
                <p>1. Head or figure of a divinity worshipped at Rome; as head of Jupiter (fam.
                    Petillia), figures of the Dioscuri (Junia) or of a divinity worshipped by the
                    family or individual striking the coin, as head of Neptune (Pompeia, coin of
                    Sextus Pompeius).</p>
                <p>2. Sacred natural or artificial object; as pontifical implements (Antonia). This
                    class is not large; sacred animals rarely occur.</p>
                <p>3. Head or figure of a personification of a country or town; as heads of Hispania
                    (Carisia), Roma (Julia), Alexandria (Aemilia).</p>
                <p>4. Head or figure of an allegorical personage; as heads of Pavor (Hostilia),
                    Pallor (id.), Honos and Virtus (Fufia, Mucia).</p>
                <p>5. Fabulous monster; as Scylla (Pompeia).</p>
                <p>6. Head or figure of an ancestral personage; as head of Numa (Calpurnia), Ancus
                    Marcius (Marcia).</p>
                <p>7. Events connected with ancestors; as figure of Marcus Lepidus, as TVTOR
                    REG[IS], crowning Ptolemy Epiphanes (Aemilia).</p>
                <p>8. Places connected with historical exploits, and of a votive character; as
                    pharos of Messene (Pompeia, of Sextus, probably commemorating the sea-fight oft'
                    Messene, 38 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>).</p>
                <p>9. Symbolical representations of contemporary events; as a general welcomed on
                    landing by a country or city (Minatia).</p>
                <p>10. Heads of living personages exercising dictatorial power, or in very high
                    authority; as head of Sulla (Cornelia).</p>
                <p>11. Representations connected with military matters; as legionary standards
                    (Antonia).</p>
                <p>Besides the principal designs there are symbols and numerals, generally to be
                    regarded as having been indicative of successive issues from the mint. The
                    inscriptions, which are in the nominative, are usually on the obverse the name
                    of the personage represented and on the reverse the name of the person who
                    issued the coin; the latter sometimes occurs on the obverse. Some of the most
                    curious types strikingly illustrate Roman instinct. Being the choice of a
                    multitude of persons of different families, they have an individuality lacking
                    to the money of the Greek cities, which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n710/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0710-0653"/> gave little choice to the coining authority or to
                    the artist, and to the Greek royal coinages, which slipped speedily into
                    heraldry. The family coins show a delight in recording the achievements of the
                    house, and sometimes are so personal as to rank with modern medals, the spirit
                    of which is even outdone in such a subject as Sulla’s dream. With the Greeks the
                    historical sense is latent until the age of the kings, and then does not pass
                    beyond portraiture and at first a scanty symbolical commemoration of events;
                    with the Romans, even before portraits are introduced, the desire to record
                    events is intensely strong. Thus we have not only such legendary subjects as the
                    rape of the Sabines and Tarpeia crushed beneath the bucklers, which may be
                    classed with the Greek mythical types, but also past historical events, as
                    Marcus Aemilius Lepidus crowning Ptolemy Epiphanes, to whom he was governor, and
                    Paullus Aemilius raising a trophy, while Perseus, king of Macedon, and his two
                    children stand before him, and also events of the present, as the reverse type
                    of Brutus, the cap of liberty between two daggers with the inscription EID MAR,
                    and on a piece of Sextus Pompey the pharos of Messene above a Roman galley and
                    for reverse Scylla striking with a rudder. The special mythology and
                    superstition of Rome is not less fully illustrated, as well as the coming in of
                    Greek ideas, in such a manner that many types thoroughly Greek alternate with
                    purely Roman ones. The art of the republican coins reflects that of contemporary
                    Greek money, but is never equal to the better style of the late Hellenic
                    issues.</p>
                <p>i. The history of the imperial coinage is full of metrological difficulties.
                    These arise from the conditions fixed by Augustus (16-15 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), by which the emperor alone coined gold and silver, the senate alone
                    bronze. Consequently the senate was wholly at the mercy of the emperor. Augustus
                    struck the aureus at 40 to the pound, equal to 25 denarii at 84 to the pound. He
                    introduced a new bronze coinage in two metals, the sestertius of 4 asses and
                    dupondius of 2, both in fine yellow bronze (orichalcum), and the as semis and
                    quadrans in common red bronze. The finer coins were struck on the standard of
                    the as of a quarter of an uucia, the inferior ones on that of the half uncia.
                    This gives the following proportionate values :—</p>

                <p>The as is nearly equal in size and weight to the dupondius, but is distinguished
                    by its metal and inferior fabric. All the bronze bears the letters S.C., <hi
                    rend="italic">senatus consulto.</hi> Emperors not acknowledged by the senate are
                    without bronze money; thus we have no specimens of Otho or Pescennius Niger.</p>
                <p>Nero reduced the aureus to √ <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th of the pound, and
                    the denarius to <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> ⅛th, its purity being officially
                    reduced. Under Trajan there was a further debasement of the denarius. Marcus
                    Aurelius fixed the aureus, which had recovered its weight,' at ⅛th of the pound;
                    the denarius had already been further debased, and under Septimius Severus it
                    was half alloy. Caracalla introduced a new Coin, called after him the argenteus
                    Antoninianus. It was struck at √ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>,th to ⅛th of the
                    pound, and seems to have been originally a double denarius struck on a lower
                    standard. The characteristic of this coin is that the head of the emperor is
                    radiate as Sol, that of the empress on a crescent as Luna. Under Elagabalus the
                    taxes were paid in gold alone; this was ruinous, for the treasury paid in
                    debased silver at nominal value, which had to be used to purchase gold by the
                    taxpayer at real value. Under Severus Alexander there was the latest large issue
                    of denarii and sestertii. The senate made another effort to continue a bronze
                    currency by striking under Philip the large bronze quinarius or Philippus
                    aereus, while the base metal argenteus had become a piece of bronze washed with
                    silver. At length in the time of Gallienus the argenteus contained no silver
                    whatever, Aurelian (270-275 A. D.) attempted a reform of the coinage by which
                    the previous coin was reduced from its nominal to its intrinsic value. The coins
                    were now of tinned bronze and marked with their real value, 20 or 21 denarii of
                    account, the signs XXI, KA (Greek), and XX being used as indexes of value. These
                    coins replace at once the base silver and the bronze, which now disappear. The
                    moneying right of the senate had become illusory by the depreciation of silver,
                    which had ceased to have any real value. Aurelian entirely suppressed this
                    right; Tacitus and Florian restored it for a few years, after which the S.C.
                    disappears from the coinage. The reform of Aurelian caused an outbreak at Rome
                    which was of a serious character, but it was maintained by him and by Tacitus.
                    Aurelian also suppressed all local mints but Alexandria. It was the work of
                    Diocletian to restore the issue of relatively pure money in the three metals.
                    Before 293 A. D. the coinage of silver recommences with the denarius of the
                    standard of Nero, ⅛th of the pound, marked with the figures XCVI. Between 296
                    and 301 A. D. two tinned bronze coins were struck, the follis and the
                    centenionalis. The follis was marked XXI, like the similar but very much smaller
                    coin of Aurelian. The denarius was the unit of reckoning.</p>
                <p>Constantine, probably in 312 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> desiring to rectify
                    the gold coinage, which had long been quite irregular in weight, reduced the
                    chief gold piece to <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛d of the pound, and issued the
                    solidus, a piece destined to play a great part in commercial history. It was
                    never lowered in weight, though many centuries later it was debased, long after
                    it had become the parent of the gold coinages of Westerns and Easterns alike
                    throughout the civilized world. The index LXXII is sometimes found on the first
                    solidi; and after 367 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when the edict of
                    Constantine was renewed, the Greek equivalent OB was constantly used. Under
                    Constantius II. (360 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> and Julian the silver
                    denarius or argenteus was suppressed, and the siliqua of <hi rend="subscript">
                    7</hi> ⅛^th of the pound took its place. The follis having been withdrawn by
                    Arcadius and Honorius, was reissued a century later by Zeno, with XI. to
                    indicate the value of 40 denarii. It will be seen that a fuller system of bronze
                    was originated by Anastasius, the Byzantine emperor.</p>
                <p>Under Augustus the Roman monetary system became the official standard of the
                    empire, and no local mint could exist without the imperial licence. Thus the
                    Greek imperial money is strictly Roman money coined in the provinces, with the
                    legends and types of the towns. Many cities were allowed to strike bronze,
                    several silver, and one, Caesarea in Cappadocia, gold. The silver becomes
                    limited about Nero’s time, but lasts under the Antonines. Afterwards there are a
                    few currencies of base metal. The bronze increased in mints and quantity in the
                    second century, but, through the debasement of the Roman silver, one city after
                    another ceased to strike about the middle of the third. Only Alexandria and
                    Antioch survived by following the tactics of Rome with their own base metal
                    coins. Purely Roman gold and silver λvas coined in certain of the provinces, in
                    Spain and Gaul, and at the cities of Antioch and Ephesus. When the base silver
                    had driven the Greek imperial bronze out of circulation, Gallienus established
                    local mints which struck in pure Roman types. Diocletian increased the number of
                    these mints, which lasted until the fall of the empire of the West, and in the
                    East longer. These mints were, with others added later, Londinium (or Augusta),
                    Camulodunum, Treviri, Lugdunum, Arelate (or Constantina), Ambianum, Tarraco,
                    Carthago, Roma, Ostia, Aquileia, Mediolanum, Siscia, Serdica, Sirmium,
                    Thessalonica, Constantinopolis, Heraclea, Nicomedia, Cyzicus, Antiochia
                    (ultimately Theupolis), and Alexandria. A few were speedily abandoned.</p>
                <p>The obverse type of the imperial coins is the portrait of an imperial personage,
                    emperor, empress, or Caesar. It begins under Julius Caesar, though the
                    republican money goes on under Augustus, in whose reign the privileges of the
                    moneyers ceased. The type only varies in the treatment of the head or bust,—if
                    male, laureate, radiate, or bare; if female, sometimes veiled, but usually bare.
                    The reverse types of the pagan period are mythological of divinities,
                    allegorical of personifications, historical of the acts of the emperors. Thus
                    the coins of Hadrian, besides bearing the figures of the chief divinities of
                    Rome, commemorate by allegorical representations of countries or cities the
                    emperor’s progresses, and by actual representations his architectural works. The
                    inscriptions are either simply descriptive, such as the emperor’s names and
                    titles in the nominative on the obverse, or partly on the obverse and partly on
                    the reverse, and the name of the subject on the reverse; or else they are
                    dedicatory, the imperial names and titles being given on the obverse in the
                    dative and the name of the type on the reverse. Sometimes the reverse bears a
                    directly dedicatory inscription to the emperor. The inscriptions on the earlier
                    imperial coins from Tiberius to Severus Alexander are generally chronological,
                    usually giving the current or last consulship of the emperor and his tribunitian
                    year. In the latter part of the third century the mints are indicated by
                    abbreviations in the exergue of the reverse, with also the ntfmber of the issue.
                    There are sometimes signs of value in the field of the reverse. These
                    characteristics apply to the pagan empire; under the Christian empire there are
                    modifications, mainly in the character of the reverse types. These are generally
                    allegorical and free from pagan intention, though then-source is pagan, as in
                    the common types of Victory. Purely Christian types are rare. The most
                    remarkable is the Christian monogram formed of the Greek letters XP. The
                    inscriptions are simpler, and in the reverses necessarily show the same change
                    as the types. Of great interest is the inscription HOC SIGNO VICTOR ERIS, on
                    coins dating not long after the victory of Constantine over Licinius. There is
                    some variety in both types and inscriptions, but little that is absolutely
                    new.</p>
                <p>The art of Roman imperial coins, although far inferior, to that of Greek, is well
                    worthy of study in its best ages, for its intrinsic merit, for its illustration
                    of contemporary sculpture, and on account of the influence it exercised on
                    mediaeval and modern art. These coins were first designed under the revival of
                    Greek art, during the influence of the New Attic school. The Romans had properly
                    no art of their own. Their greatest temples and the statues of their gods were
                    copies or imitations by Greeks of Greek originals, besides such earlier statues
                    as were brought from Greece. The Greeks who were first called in to work for
                    their masters were the artists of a school which was emphatically imitative, not
                    in any way inventive, and their successors were debased by the false taste of
                    their patrons.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n711/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0711-0654"/>
                <p>There is a marked inferiority in the Roman coinage to the Graeco-Asiatic work of
                    the same times. With a tendency to follow the dramatic styles, the artists who
                    worked at Rome had power enough to produce fine and highly characteristic
                    portraits, of which the famous bust, miscalled Clytie, is the most striking
                    example. Thus, though the grandeur and the purity of design and execution of the
                    older masters are gone, we have in their place a strikingly faithful
                    portraiture, which is deeply gratifying to the historical sense. The best age is
                    the Augustan, which may be said to last through the rule of the Claudian
                    emperors, and is decidedly under New Attic influence. This is succeeded by the
                    second, that of the Antonines, from Trajan to Commodus. The Augustan work is
                    larger and more refined, that of the Antonines more elaborate and laborious.
                    Then follows a swift decline, with a temporary revival in the age of Diocletian
                    and Constantine, when an attempt, necessarily weak, was made to improve the art
                    of the coins; thenceforward it slowly declined. In the Augustan age two manners
                    may be recognized, the Greek and the Graeco-Roman, the one repeating earlier
                    works, the other portraying living persons and events. Under the Antonines we
                    notice, as a distinct reaction against the poor idealism of the age, which even
                    occasionally endeavoured to treat portraits in an ideal style, a vigorous
                    realism which looks like the actual parent of the Italian Renaissance in its
                    classical phase. Midway between these stands the realistic style of the age.
                    Among the finest examples of art in the Roman coinage are the portraits of Livia
                    as Pietas, Justitia, and Salus, and that of the elder Agrippina. For stern
                    realism the head of Nero is most remarkable, the growth of whose bad passions
                    may be seen in the increasing brutality of his features and expression. The
                    medallion series is full of charming subjects, though when they have been
                    treated by Greek artists of earlier ages the contrast is trying; the most
                    satisfactory are the representations of older statues; the purely new
                    compositions are either poor inventions, or have a theatrical air that removes
                    them from the province of good art.</p>
                <p>III.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Mediaeval</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">and Modern Coins of
                    Europe.</hi></p>
                <p>The period of the mediaeval and modern coins of Europe must be considered to
                    begin about the time of the fall of the Western empire, so that its length to
                    the present day is about 1400 years. It is impossible to separate the mediaeval
                    and modern coins, either in the entire class, because the time of change varies,
                    or in each group, since there are usually pieces indicative of transition which
                    display characteristics of both periods. The clearest division of the subject is
                    to place the Byzantine coinage first, then to notice the characteristics of its
                    descendants, and lastly to sketch the monetary history of each country.</p>
                <p>The Byzantine money is usually held to begin in the reign of Anastasius (491-518
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> The coinage is always in the three metals, but
                    the silver money is rare, and was probably struck in small quantities. At first
                    both the gold and the silver are fine, but towards the close of the empire they
                    are much alloyed. The gold coin is the solidus of Constantine, with its half and
                    its third, the so-called semissis and tremissis. The chief silver coin was the
                    miliarision, of a lower weight than the solidus, and its half, the keration.
                    Heraclius, in 615 A.D., coined a larger piece, the hexagram, weighing 105
                    grains. This coin was discontinued, an&gt;l afterwards the miliarision and
                    keration were coined until the conquest of Constantinople by the Latins. The
                    silver money of the restored Greek empire is obscure. In 498 Anastasius
                    introduced a new copper coinage, bearing on the reverse, at and about his time,
                    the following indexes of value as the main type: Μ, K, I, E, Δ, Γ, B, and A, or
                    40 nummi, 20, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. These coins bear beneath the indexes the
                    abbreviated name of the place of issue. Justinian I. added the regnal year in
                    538 A.D., his twelfth year. The money of this class presents extraordinary
                    variations of weight, which indicate the condition of the imperial finances. The
                    Alexandrian coins of this class begin under Anastasius and end with the capture
                    of the city by the Arabs. They have two denominations, IB and S, or 12 and 6,
                    and there is an isolated variety of Justinian with ΛΓ (33). The Alexandrian
                    bronze never lost its weight, while that of the empire generally fell, and thus
                    some of the pieces of Heraclius, while associated with his sons Heraclius
                    Constantinus and Heracleonas, have the double index IB and Μ. The Vandals of
                    Carthage had a peculiar double system of their own with the indexes XLII, XXI,
                    XII, and IIII. Under Basil I. the bronze money appears to have been reformed,
                    but the absence of indexes of value makes the whole later history of the coinage
                    in this metal very difficult. There was one curious change in the aspect of the
                    money. Early in the 11th century the solidus begins to assume a cup-shaped form,
                    and this subsequently became the shape of the whole coinage except the smaller
                    bronze pieces. These novel coins are called nummi scyphati. The types, except
                    when they refer simply to the sovereign, are of a religious, and consequently of
                    a Christian character. This feeling increases to the last. Thus, on the obverse
                    of the earlier coins the emperors are represented alone, but from about the 10th
                    century they are generally portrayed as aided or supported by some sacred
                    personage or saint. On the reverses of the oldest coins we have such tynes as a
                    Victory holding a cross, but on those of later ones a representation of Our
                    Saviour or of the Virgin Mary. Subsequently some allegorical religious types are
                    introduced, as that of the Virgin Mary supporting the walls of Constantinople.
                    The principal inscriptions for a long period almost invariably relate to the
                    sovereign, and express his name and titles. The secondaιy inscriptions of the
                    earlier coins indicate the town at which the piece was struck, and, in the case
                    of the larger bronze pieces, the year of the emperor’s reign is also given. From
                    about the 10th century there are generally two principal inscriptions, the one
                    relating to the emperor and the other to the sacred figure of the reverse, in
                    the form of a prayer. The secondary inscriptions at the same time are
                    descriptive, and are merely abbreviations of the names or titles of the sacred
                    personages near the representations of whom they are placed. From the time of
                    Alexius I. (Comnenus) the principal inscriptions are almost disused, and
                    descriptive ones alone given. These are nearly always abbreviations, like the
                    secondary ones of the earlier period. The language of the inscriptions was at
                    first Latin with a partial use of Greek; about the time of Heraclius Greek began
                    to take its place on a rude class of coins, probably local; by the 9th century
                    Greek inscriptions occur in the regular coinage; and at the time of Alexius I.
                    Latin wholly disappears. The Greek inscriptions are remarkable for their
                    orthography, which indicates the changes of the language. Of the art of these
                    coins little need be said. It has its importance in illustrating contemporary
                    ecclesiastical art in the West, but is generally inferior to it both in design
                    and in execution.</p>
                <p>Besides the regular series of the Byzantine empire, in which we include the money
                    assigned to the Latin emperors of Constantinople, there are several cognate
                    groups connected with it, either because of their similarity, or because the
                    sovereigns were of the imperial houses. There are the coinages of the barbarians
                    to be next noticed, and the money of the emperors of Nicaea, of Thessalonica,
                    and of Trebizond. The last group consists of small silver pieces, which were
                    prized for their purity; they were called Comnenian aspers (άσττρα <hi
                    rend="italic">Κομνήνατα),</hi> the princes of Trebizond having sprung from the
                    illustrious family of the Comneni.</p>
                <p>The coinage of the other states of Christian Europe will be best understood if we
                    view it generally in successive periods, afterwards more particularly describing
                    the currencies of the chief countries. The periods have been well defined as—(1)
                    transitionary period, from Roman to true mediaeval coinage, from the fall of
                    Rome (476) to the accession of Charlemagne (768); (2) true mediaeval age, during
                    which the Carlovingian money was the currency of western Europe, from
                    Charlemagne to the fall of the Swabian house (1268); (3) early Renaissance, from
                    the striking of the florin in Florence (1252) to the classical Renaissance
                    (1450); (4) the classical Renaissance, from 1450 to 1600; (5) the modern period.
                    (C. F. Keary in the <hi rend="italic">Antiquary,</hi> 1883.)</p>
                <p>1. The Roman money was adopted and imitated by the barbarian conquerors of the
                    empire. They struck in gold, silver, and bronze, gold being the favourite metal.
                    The names of the kings soon appear upon the silver and bronze, but the gold
                    money is at first a copy of the Byzantine, then monograms of kings appear, and
                    at last their names in full save when the money in the Frankish series is of
                    civic issues. The currencies of this period are those of the Ostrogoths in
                    Italy, the Vandals in Africa, the Visigoths in Spain, the Franks in Gaul, and
                    the Lombards in Italy. The most important coinages of this age are of gold.</p>
                <p>2. The inconvenience of gold money when it represents a very large value in the
                    necessaries of life must have caused its abandonment and the substitution of
                    silver by the Carlovingians. The denier (denarius) or penny of about 24 grains
                    was at first practically the sole coin. The solidus in gold was struck but very
                    rarely, perhaps as a kind of proof of the right of coining. The Byzantine
                    solidus or bezant was used and probably the equivalent Arab gold. The Arab
                    silver piece, the <hi rend="italic">dirhem,</hi> was almost exactly the double
                    of the denier, and seems to have been widely current in the north. The new
                    coinage spread from France, where it was first royal and then royal and feudal,
                    to Germany, Italy, where the Byzantine types did not wholly disappear, England,
                    Scandinavia, Castile, and Aragon. In Germany and France feudal money was soon
                    issued, and in Italy towns and ecclesiastical foundations largely acquired the
                    right of coinage from the empire, which was elsewhere rare. The consequence of
                    the extended right of coinage was a depreciation in weight, and in the middle of
                    the 12th century the one-sided pennies called bracteates appeared in Germany,
                    which were so thin that they could only be stamped on one side. The types of
                    this whole second coinage are new, except when the bust of the emperor is
                    engraved. The most usual are the cross; and the church as a temple also appears,
                    ultimately taking the form of a Gothic building. There are also sacred figures,
                    and more rarely heads in the later age.</p>
                <p>3. The true herald of the Renaissance was the emperor Frederick II. In restoring
                    the gold coinage, however, he followed in the steps of the Norman dukes of
                    Apulia. With a large Arab population, these <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n712/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0712-0655"/> princes had found it convenient to continue the
                    Oriental gold money of the country, part of the great currency at that time of
                    all the western Moslems, and Roger II. also struck Latin coins of his own as DVX
                    APVLIAE, the first ducats. Frederick II., continuing the Arab coinage, also
                    struck his own Roman gold money, solidi and half solidi, with his bust as
                    emperor of the Romans, Caesar Augustus, and on the reverse the imperial eagle.
                    But the calamities which overwhelmed the Swabian house and threw back the
                    Renaissance deprived this effort of any weight, and it was left to the great
                    republics to carry out the idea of a worthy coinage,— a necessity of their large
                    commercial schemes. The famous gold florin was first issued in 1252. The obverse
                    type is the standing figure of St John the Baptist, the reverse bears the lily
                    of Florence. The weight was about 54 grains, but the breadth of the coin and the
                    beauty of the work gave it dignity. The commercial greatness of Florence and the
                    purity of the florin caused the issue of similar coins in almost all parts of
                    Europe. Venice was not long in striking (in 1280) a gold coin of the same weight
                    as the florin, but with the types of a standing figure of Christ, and the doge
                    receiving the gonfalon at the hands of St Mark. It was first called the ducat,
                    the name it always bears in its inscription; later it is known as the zecchino
                    or sequin. Though not so largely imitated as the florin, the extreme purity of
                    the sequin was unquestioned to a time within the memory of living persons. Genoa
                    likewise had a great gold currency, and the other Italian states struck in this
                    metal. It is significant of the power of the Italian republics that the later
                    Mameluke sultans of Egypt found it convenient or necessary for their position
                    between Europe and India to adopt the weight of the florin and sequin for their
                    gold money. Many varieties of gold money appear in course of time in France,
                    England, and to a less extent in other countries. The need for a heavier silver
                    coinage caused the issue of the large denier (grossus denarius), afterwards
                    called the gros and groat. This coin appears in the 14th century, and at the
                    same time the large German bracteates are issued. The types are now very various
                    and distinctly worthy of the art of the time, which as yet is purely decorative
                    and conventional, so that portraits are not possible. The religious intention
                    also is gradually giving way to the desire to produce a beautiful result, and
                    the symbol of the cross is varied to suit the decorative needs of the coin.
                    Heraldic subjects also appear, and in the shield, which is frequently a reverse
                    type, we see the origin of the usual modern reverse of the most important
                    coins.</p>
                <p>4, 5. With the classical Renaissance we find ourselves in the presence of modern
                    ideas. The elaborate systems of coinage of the various states of Europe are soon
                    to begin, and the prevalence of a general currency to become for the time
                    impossible. Silver money now gains new importance with the issue of the thaler
                    or dollar in Germany, in 1515. This great coin speedily became the chief
                    European piece in its metal, but as it was coined of various weights and varying
                    purity it failed to acquire the general character of the denier. The style of
                    this age is at first excellent. The medals gave the tone to the coinage. Art had
                    wholly thrown off the rules of the age before and attained the faculty of
                    portraiture and the power of simply representing objects of nature and art.
                    Great masters now executed medals and even coins, but speedily this work became
                    a mere matter of commerce, and by the beginning of the modern period it was fast
                    falling into the poverty and barbarism in which it has ever since remained. The
                    details of the numismatics of these two periods belong to the notices of the
                    money of the several countries.</p>
                <p>A word must be added on money of account. While the denier was the chief and
                    practically the sole coin, the solidus passed from use as a foreign piece into a
                    money of account. The solidus was the German schilling (shilling), which
                    contained usually 12 deniers. As there were 20 shillings to the pound of silver,
                    we obtain the reckoning by £ s. d., librae, solidi, and denarii. The pound as a
                    weight contained 12 ounces, and its two-thirds was the German mark of 8
                    ounces.</p>
                <p>It would be interesting, did space permit, to notice fully the art of this entire
                    class, to examine its growth, and to trace its decline, but, as with that of
                    Greek and Roman coins, we must mainly limit ourselves to the best period. This
                    is a space of about a hundred and fifty years, the age of the classical
                    Renaissance, from the middle of the 15th century to the close of the 16th. The
                    finest works are limited to the first half century of this period, from a little
                    before 1450 to about 1500, in Italy, and for as long a time, beginning and
                    ending somewhat later, in Germany. The artists were then greater than
                    afterwards, and medal-making had not degenerated into a trade; but with the
                    larger production of the period following the work was more mechanical, and so
                    fell into the hands of inferior men. The medals of this first period may not
                    unworthily be placed by the side of its sculpture and its painting. Not only
                    have some of its medallists taken honourable places in a list where there was no
                    room for ignoble names, but to design medals was not thought an unworthy
                    occupation for the most famous artists. There are, as we should expect, two
                    principal schools, the Italian and the German. The former attained a higher
                    excellence, as possessing not merely a finer style but one especially adapted to
                    coins or medals. The object which the artists strove to attain was to present a
                    portrait or to commemorate an action in the best manner possible, without losing
                    sight of the fitness of the designs to the form and use of the piece on which
                    they were to be placed. For the successful attainment of this, purpose the style
                    of the later pre - Raphaelites was eminently suited. Its general love of truth,
                    symmetrical grouping, hard drapery, and severely faithful portraiture were
                    qualities especially fitted to produce a fine portrait and a good medal. It is
                    to be noted that their idea of portraiture did not depend on such a feeling for
                    beauty as influenced the Greeks. Rather did it set before it the moral
                    attainments and capabilities of the subject. The German art, a product of
                    engravers in metal, is really goldsmith’s work, except in Albert Diirer’s case.
                    Thus it is not so suitable to numismatic designs. The portraits of the German
                    coins and medals are sometimes even more characteristic than those of the
                    Italian, and the groups often show great vigour; but both are less appropriate.
                    They display also too great a profusion of detail, by which the effect of the
                    boldness of the outlines is frequently lost; yet they have much originality and
                    vigour, and will reward an attentive study. Both these schools, but especially
                    the Italian, afford the best foundation for a truly excellent modern medallic
                    art. The finest coins and medals of Italy and Germany have an object similar to
                    that which it is sought to fulfil in the English, and their nearness in time
                    makes many details entirely appropriate. Thus, without blindly imitating them,
                    modern artists may derive from them the greatest aid.</p>
                <p>There are some delicately beautiful Italian medals of the 16th century, too
                    closely imitated from the Roman style. A vigorous realistic school, the only
                    great one of modern times, arose in France before the close of the 16th century
                    and lasted into the next. It was rendered illustrious by Dupre and the inferior
                    but still powerful Warin. From this age until the time of Napoleon there is
                    nothing worthy of note. The style of his medallists is the weak classical manner
                    then in vogue, but yet is superior to what went before and what has
                    followed.</p>
                <p>It is not intended here to enter in any detail into the various divisions of the
                    subject already treated in its main outlines. The questions that would require
                    consideration are of too complicated and technical a nature to be illustrated
                    within reasonable limits; the principal matters of inquiry may, however, be
                    indicated.</p>
                <p>The money of the Iberian Peninsula begins with the Visigothic series, which
                    consists of gold pieces. The money of Portugal is regal, and not of great
                    interest except as affording indications of the wealth and commercial activity
                    of the state in the early part of the 18th century. The coinage of Spain is
                    almost without exception regal, but a more curious class than that of Portugal.
                    The coins of the early contemporary kingdoms, such as those of Aragon, and of
                    Castile and Leon, are especially worthy of examination. We may mention as of a
                    very peculiar character a large gold piece in the coinage of the latter state,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Dobla de la Vanda,</hi> from its bearing the shield
                    of the famous order of knighthood of the Vanda or Band. Of this there are
                    examples assigned to John I. (1379-90) and John II. (1406-54). The money of the
                    sole monarchy is less worthy of notice. The city of Barcelona is represented by
                    coins bearing the names of various kings. The medals of Spain are not
                    important.</p>
                <p>The coinage of France forms a large series. It begins with the money of the
                    Merovingian dynasty. This consists almost wholly of gold pieces, imitated from
                    those of the late Roman and Byzantine rulers, as already mentioned, the
                    commonest denomination being the tremissis, or third part of the sou d’or
                    (solidus). The coins are rare, Snd bear either the names of a king and a city or
                    of a moneyer and a city. They are barbarous in their art. Under the princes of
                    the Carlovingian dynasty the principal coins are deniers, and after a time
                    oboles also, gold money being extremely rare. They bear the name of the king and
                    that of the city where they were struck, and have a more original character than
                    the earlier pieces, although they are still barbarous. The money of the Capetian
                    house begins with coins like those of the line preceding it. By degrees the
                    coinage improves. In the 13th century gold pieces were issued. There are several
                    denominations of these and of silver coins, but to some different names are
                    applied for various types with the same weight, as the <hi rend="italic">denier
                    Parisis</hi> of Paris, and the <hi rend="italic">denier</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tournois</hi> of Tours, both of base metal. At the time of Philip VI. the coins
                    are fine. The modern coinage may be considered to begin under Henry II., whose
                    portrait is of good.work. During this period there is no very remarkable feature
                    in the current money, except the occurrence in the 17 th century of the pieces
                    of the sort termed <hi rend="italic">pied fort,</hi> which we must regard as a
                    kind of pattern. The seignorial coins of France during the Middle Ages are
                    important. The medals are far more interesting than the modern coins. Their
                    interest begins in the age of the last Λ alois kings and Henry IV.; there is a
                    long and historically important series of Louis XIV., and another of a new
                    artistic character under the first republic and the reign of Napoleon I. Almost
                    every great event, from the beginning of the power of that emperor until his <pb

                    unequalled in its class for completeness. The designs, notwithstanding their
                    false classical style and that mannerism which appears to be essential to modern
                    French art, are executed with great care and skill.</p>
                <p>The English coinage begins with two uncertain classes, which, wherever struck,
                    certainly formed the currency of the country during the interval from the
                    departure of the Romans, about 450 A.D., until the issue of money with royal
                    names by the Saxon kings, towards the end of the 8th century. One of these
                    classes consists of imitations of the latest Roman copper money, and the other
                    of the small silver pieces to which the name of <hi rend="italic">sceattas</hi>
                    is applied, having rude types which are sometimes of Roman origin, but sometimes
                    original, and occasionally with Runic inscriptions. The former were first issued
                    and then the latter. The regular coinage begins no doubt under the so-called
                    Heptarchy. There is money of the kingdoms of Mercia, Kent, the East Angles, and
                    Northumbria. The chief coins are silver pennies, but sceattas also occur; and of
                    Northumbria there are <hi rend="italic">stycas,</hi> which are pieces of a base
                    metal in the composition of which copper is the largest ingredient. The most
                    interesting coins of this group are those of Offa, king of Mercia; these are
                    silver pennies, remarkable for their quaint designs and their relatively careful
                    execution. Of this period, but extending into the earlier part of that of the
                    sole monarchs, there are coins issued by the archbishops of Canterbury and York.
                    The money of the sole monarchs, whether Saxons or Danes, is strictly a
                    continuation of that of the Heptarchy; it consists almost wholly of silver
                    pennies, which latterly were cut into halves and quarters to form halfpennies
                    and farthings. Under the Normans and earlier Plantagenets the same coinage
                    continues; but under Edward III. there is regular gold money, of which the chief
                    piece is the noble of six shillings and eightpence; and the silver groat now
                    appears. The obverse type of the noble, representing the king in a ship,
                    probably commemorates Edward’s victory over the French fleet off Sluys in 1340.
                    At this time there is a visible improvement in the art of the coinage, which
                    moves with the succession of styles until the close of the Tudor age. Of Henry
                    VIII. we have gold and silver coins of most existing denominations, as well as
                    of earlier ones long since abandoned. The finest piece is the sovereign, a large
                    flat coin of gold, bearing on its obverse the figure of the king (whence its
                    name) on his throne. The reign of Queen Elizabeth marks the transition from the
                    Gothic to the modern style and the introduction of the new method of coining
                    with the use of the mill. The coinage of Charles I. presents great varieties
                    owing to the civil war. The scarcity of gold in the royal treasury during the
                    troubles induced the king to coin twenty-and ten-shilling pieces of silver, in
                    addition to the crowns and smaller denominations. One of the most remarkable of
                    his pieces is a crown struck at Oxford. It bears on the obverse the king on
                    horseback, with a representation of the town beneath the horse, and on the
                    reverse the heads of the “Oxford Declaration.” Of equal interest are the
                    siege-pieces of many castles famous in the annals of those days. The coinage of
                    the Commonwealth is of a plainness proper to the principles of those who
                    sanctioned it. The great Protector, however, caused money to be designed of his
                    own bearing his head. It is not certain that this was ever sent forth, and it is
                    therefore put in the class of patterns. Simon, the chief of English medallists,
                    designed the coins which are unequalled in the whole series for the vigour of
                    the portrait (a worthy presentment of the head of Cromwell) and the beauty and
                    fitness of every portion of the work. Henceforward there is a decline in the
                    coinage, although skill is perceived in the portrait of William III., whose
                    grand features could scarcely have failed to stimulate an artist to more than a
                    common effort. Queen Anne’s money is also worthy of note, on account of the
                    attempt, on Dean Swift’s suggestion, to commemorate current history on the
                    copper coinage, which led to the issue of the famous farthings. These have been
                    the cause of an extraordinary delusion, to the effect that a very small number
                    (some say three) of these pieces were strack, and that their value is a thousand
                    pounds each, instead of usually some shillings. In consequence many imitations
                    have been forged, and such are constantly brought to collectors by unfortunate
                    labourers and the like, who imagine that they possess the greatest numismatic
                    treasure in the world. After this there is little to remark, except the baseness
                    of the art of the coins under the first three Georges, until the genius of
                    Pistrucci gave a worthier form to the currency. Besides the regal coinage there
                    is scarcely any baronial money, the class being represented by a few pieces,
                    generally struck by personages of the royal house, and all belonging to the
                    period of the close of the Norman line and the beginning of the Plantagenet.</p>
                <p>The English medals are far more interesting for their bearing on events than as
                    works of art. The best are almost all by foreigners, but the fine pieces of the
                    Simons form notable exceptions. The medals of the Tudors are good in style, and
                    show some excellent portraits, in particular those by Trezzo and Stephen of
                    Holland. There is one of Mary Queen of Scots by Primavera, representing her in
                    middle life, which is perhaps her most characteristic portrait. Elizabeth’s are
                    of historical importance, and the same is the case with the richer series of the
                    Stuart period, often of fine style. These include works by Warin, the Simons,
                    and the Roettiers, besides the excellent coin engravers Briot and Rawlins. The
                    most curious pieces are those popular issues relating to current events, such as
                    the so-called “Popish plot.” From this time there are no works deserving notice
                    except military and naval medals, the historical interest of which makes some
                    amends for their poverty of design and execution. The English tokens form a
                    curious class. They are of two periods: the earlier, wl⅛ich are generally of
                    copper, were issued at the middle of the 17th century and somewhat later; the
                    later, which are mainly of copper, were struck during the scarcity of the royal
                    coinage in this metal at the end of the last century, and during the earlier
                    years of the present century. Both were chiefly coined by tradesmen, and bear
                    their names. The colonial money of England was until lately unimportant, but now
                    it is not unworthy of the wealth and activity of the dependencies. The money
                    struck by the English kings for their French dominions forms a peculiar class,
                    mainly French in its character, termed the Anglo-Gallic. This may be used to
                    fill some gaps in the regal series of England; for instance, it supplies us with
                    money of Richard I., of whom no English coins bearing his name are known.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Scotland is allied to that of England, although generally ruder;
                    but it seems to have been more influenced in the early period from England, and
                    towards its close from France. The oldest pieces are silver pennies or
                    sterlings, resembling the contemporary English money, of the beginning of the
                    12th century. In the 15th and 16th centuries there is an important coinage, both
                    in gold and silver, not the least interesting pieces being those of Queen Mary,
                    many of which bear her portrait. The indifferent execution of the coins of this
                    period is traceable to the disturbed state of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The money of Ireland is more scanty and of less importance than that of Scotland.
                    The pieces most worthy of notice are the silver pennies of the early Danish
                    kings. Of later times there is little that is interesting, except the forced
                    currency of James II. during his attempt to maintain himself in the island.</p>
                <p>Belgium occupies the next place in our arrangement. Its coinage comprises many
                    pieces struck by foreign rulers, and has little of an independent character in
                    either the regal or the seignorial class. It closely resembles the money of
                    France and Germany. The series of Holland is similar in character until the
                    period of the revolt of the provinces. The medals are highly interesting, more
                    especially those which were struck by the Protestants in commemoration of
                    current events. Most of these are of silver, but a few are in gold. There is
                    also a remarkable series of bronze medallets or jettons, which form a continuous
                    commentary on history during the 16th and early part of the 17th centuries. Both
                    are interesting, as largely illustrating not only local events but also those of
                    the chief European states. Such are the pieces recording the raising of the
                    siege of Leyden, likened to the destruction of Sennacherib’s army, the
                    assassination of. William the Silent, and the discomfiture of the Armada,
                    affording striking indications of the zeal, the piety, and the confidence in the
                    right which built up the great political structure of the Dutch republic. After
                    this time the medals lose much of their interest.</p>
                <p>The money of Switzerland illustrates the varying fortunes of this central state,
                    and the gradual growth of the stronghold of European freedom. First we have the
                    gold money of the Frankish kings, among whose mints Basel, Lausanne, St Maurice,
                    Sitten (Sion), and Zurich already appear. The silver deniers, which Charlemagne
                    made the coinage of the empire, are issued by fewer mints; the dukes of Swabia
                    struck coins in Switzerland, and the empire granted during the 10th and to the
                    13th century the right of coinage to various ecclesiastical foundations,
                    bishoprics, and abbeys. Bern and Zofingen were allowed mints by the emperor
                    Frederick II., and the civic coinage of Switzerland then began in the period of
                    the bracteates. Other towns gained the same right, as well as the counts of
                    Kyburg, Hapsburg, &amp;c. The 14th century witnessed the rise of the Swiss
                    confederation, and by degrees the cantons struck their own money. These,
                    together with the coins of some few sees and abbacies, form the bulk of Swiss
                    money of the mediaeval and modern periods. The separate cantonal coinage,
                    interrupted by the French occupation, was finally suppressed in 1848, when a
                    uniform currency was adopted by the whole republic. The monetary systems of the
                    cantonal and ecclesiastical mints were extremely complicated. This was partly
                    due to the variety of coins, partly to the debasement practised by the
                    ecclesiastical mints. Geneva had a peculiar system of her own.</p>
                <p>The most interesting coinages are those of Basel (the see, canton, and city),
                    Bern, a large series, the see of Chur, the abbey of St Gallen, the great issue
                    of Geneva (the bishopric, the city, and the canton), the see of Lausanne,
                    Lucerne, the Forest Cantons, the bishopric of Sitten, and the long currency of
                    Zurich. Some of the earlier large coins of the Middle Ages, particularly
                    thalers, are interesting for their bold work and their sacred and heraldic
                    subjects. Throughout the Swiss series we are awakened to a higher than
                    archaeological sentiment by the traditions and records of two great periods, the
                    age when the Irish missionaries planted the <pb break="no"

                    days when the cantons fought for freedom and smote their powerful oppressors on
                    every side. The medals of Switzerland are mostly of modern times, and lack
                    beauty and historical value.</p>
                <p>Italy, with Sicily, has peculiar features. Here the barbaric coinages . were
                    mixed with the Byzantine issues which marked the recovery of the Eastern empire,
                    and left a lasting influence in the north at Venice, and in the south at
                    Beneventum. Later the Arab conquest left its mark in the curious Oriental
                    coinages of the Normans of Sicily and the emperor Frederick II., mixed after his
                    fashion with Latin coinage. Tlιe earliest money is that of the barbarians,
                    Ostrogoths and Lombards, and local Byzantine issues in Sicily. This is followed
                    by the deniers of Charlemagne and his successors, supplanted by the gold
                    currencies of the Normans and Frederick II. The age of the free cities is marked
                    by the great coinages of Florence, Venice, and Genoa, while the Angevin and
                    Aragonese princes coined in the south, and the popes began to issue a regular
                    currency of their own at Rome. The Italian princes of the next period coined in
                    Savoy, and at Florence, Modena, Mantua, and other cities, while Rome and the
                    foreign rulers of the south continued their mintages, Venice and Genoa of the
                    republics alone surviving. The Italian monetary systems have already been
                    touched on in the introductory notice. For art the series is invaluable. First
                    in Italy the revival influenced the coins, and in them every step of advance
                    found its record. The Italian medals are without rivals in the works of modern
                    times.</p>
                <p>Following the geographical order which is best suited to the Italian coinage, we
                    first notice the money of Savoy, which is inferior in art to that of the rest of
                    the country. It begins in early times, and merges in the class of the Sardinian
                    kingdom, which becomes the kingdom of Italy. Genoa is the first of the great
                    republics. She struck gold money from the time of the general origin of civic
                    coinage in that metal; these are ducats and their divisions, and afteι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> a time their multiples also. In the 17th century
                    there are very large silver pieces. In the money of Mantua there first occur
                    really fine coins of Gianfrancesco III. (1484-1519) and Vincenzo II.
                    (1626-1627), these last splendid examples of the late Renaissance, in large
                    pieces of gold and silver; the portrait is fine, and the hound on the reverse a
                    powerful design. The vicissitudes of the story of Milan find their record in no
                    less than nine groups of money—Carlovingian deniers, money of the republic, then
                    imperial again, next of the Visconti family, succeeded by that of the Sforza
                    line, next of Louis XII. of France, of the restored Sforza, of Charles V. by
                    Spanish right and his successors of Spain, and lastly of Austria. There are
                    extremely fine coins of the 15th century, showing great beauty in their
                    portraits. The money of Florence is disappointing in its art. The Athens of the
                    NIiddle Ages had the same reason as her prototype to preserve as faithfully as
                    might be the types and aspect of her most famous coin, the gold florin, and thus
                    those who expect to see in this series the story of Italian art will be much
                    disappointed. The silver florin was first struck in 1181. It is heavier than the
                    denier, weighing about 27 grains, and bears the lily of Florence and the bust of
                    St John the Baptist. These are thenceforward the leading types, the flower never
                    changing, but the representation of the saint being varied. On the gold florin
                    the Baptist is represented standing, while in the contemporary silver florins he
                    is seated. In the 14tlι century the arms of a moneyer appear in the field, two
                    such officers having had the right of striking yearly, each for six months. The
                    coins of the duchy from 1532, in spite of their new types, are not a fine
                    series; the best are those of Alessandro, designed by Cellini.</p>
                <p>Venice as a mint even surpasses Florence in conservatism, and, the early style
                    being distinctly Byzantine, this is the more striking in a great artistic city.
                    We find Venice as an imperial mint issuing Carlovingian deniers, but the doges
                    begin to coin, placing their own names on their currency, in the 12th century.
                    The most famous silver coin, the matapane, was first struck in the brilliant
                    time of Enrico Dandolo (1192-1205). This coin is a grossus weighing about 33
                    grains, with on the obverse St Mark giving the standard or gonfalon to the doge,
                    both figures standing, and on the reverse the seated figure of the Saviour. The
                    famous Venetian zecchino or sequin, the rival of the florin of Florence, appears
                    to have been first issued under Giovanni Dandolo (1280-1289). On the obverse St
                    Mark gives the gonfalon to the kneeling doge, and on the reverse is a standing
                    figure of the Saviour within an oval nimbus. The matapane slightly changes after
                    the second third of the 14th century, and at its close becomes a new coin, the
                    grossetto. Niccolo Trono (1471-1473) introduces his portrait on most of his
                    coins, but this custom is not continued. By the latest part of the 15th century
                    large silver coins appear. The archaic style changes in the beginning of the
                    16th century, but there is no later movement. The large silver pieces increase
                    in size, and large gold is also struck; the last doge, Ludovico Manin
                    (1788-1797), issued the 100-sequin piece in gold, a monstrous coin, worth over
                    £40. The doges of Venice issued a peculiar silver token or medallet, the osella,
                    five of which they annually presented to every member of the Great Council.
                    Antonio Grimani instituted this custom in 1521, and it lasted to the end of the
                    republic. Two dogaressas struck similar medallets. Their types are usually
                    allegorical; some are commemorative. As a class they resemble the Dutch copper
                    jettons, but are less historical and hence less interesting.</p>
                <p>The series of the coins of Rome is rather of historical than of artistic merit.
                    The popes begin to strike money with Adrian I. (772-794 A.D.), whose deniers are
                    in a Byzantino-Lombard style that characterizes the coinage of Beneventum.
                    Before the papal coinage closes the senate asserts the right to a mint. We then
                    see on the silver the style of the senate and Roman people, and ROMA CAPUT
                    MUNDI. Some coins have the figures of St Paul and St Peter, others Rome seated
                    and a lion. Charles of Anjou, king of Sicily, strikes as a senator. The gold
                    ducat of about 1300 imitates the types of the Venetian sequin. St Peter here
                    gives the gonfalon to a kneeling senator. The arms of the moneying senator next
                    appear in the field. There are small copper pieces of the famous tribune Rienzi.
                    The papal coinage is resumed at Avignon; and Urban V., on his return to Rome,
                    takes the sole right of the mint. The subsequent coins, though they have an
                    interest from their bearing on the history of art, are disappointing in style.
                    There is indeed a silver coin of Julius II. struck at Bologna and attributed to
                    Francia, with a very fine portrait. We haw beautiful gold coins of Giovanni
                    Bentivoglio, lord of Bologna, who employed Francia at his mint, and we know that
                    the artist remained at his post after Julius II. had taken the city. There are
                    also pieces of Clement VII. by Cellini, vigorous in design but careless in
                    execution. The papal portraits are highly characteristic and interesting. It is,
                    however, in the fine series of papal medals that we find a worthier artistic
                    record.</p>
                <p>The coinage of Sicily, afterwards that of the Two Sicilies, or Naples and Sicily,
                    begins with the Normans. Theirs is a curiously mixed series. The gold money is
                    almost wholly Arabic, though Roger II. struck the Latin ducat, the earliest of
                    its class; the silver is Arabic, except the great Latin scyphati of Roger II.
                    with Roger III.; the copper is both Latin and Arabic. The gold series of the
                    emperor Frederick II. shows the first sentiment of reviving classical art, its
                    work being far in advance of the age. These are Latin coins; he also struck
                    small Arabic pieces in gold. Under Conrad, Conradin, and Manfred there is an
                    insignificant coinage, copper only, but with Charles of Anjou (1266-1285) the
                    gold money in purely mediaeval style is very beautiful, quite equal to that of
                    his brother St Louis of France. After this time there is a great issue of
                    gigliati, silver coins with for reverse a cross fleurdelisée cantoned with
                    fleurs-de-lis. These coins acquired a great reputation in the Levant, and were
                    even struck by the emirs of Asia Minor. With Alphonso, the founder of the
                    Aragonese line, we note the old style of the coins, which are in singular
                    contrast to his fine medals. Good portraiture begins on the money of Ferdinand
                    I., his successor. The later coinage is interesting only for its illustration of
                    the varying fortunes of the Two Sicilies. There is a curious early gold coinage
                    of the Lombard dukes of Beneventum, which follows the Byzantine type.</p>
                <p>Italian medals are next in merit to the works of the Greek dieengravers. Their
                    true beginning and highest excellence are under Vittore Pisano, the Veronese
                    painter, who worked from 1439 to 1449. They are of two classes, the finer and
                    more original, struck in the 15th century, and the more classical of the 16th,
                    after which the style declines rapidly. In spite of classical influence, the
                    earlier medals are independent works, marked by simple vigorous truthfulness.
                    The designs are skilful and the portraits strongly characteristic, but deficient
                    in beauty. As the art became popular the execution of medals passed into the
                    hands of inferior artists, and by degrees striking became usual for the smaller
                    pieces; at the same time, a slavish imitation of the classical style weakened or
                    destroyed originality and stamped the works with the feebleness of copies. Yet
                    the delicacy of design and technical skill of these later medals often give them
                    an undeniable charm. The great medallists of the first age are Pisano, Matteo
                    de’ Pasti, Enzola, Boldu, Sperandio, Gentile Bellini, Bertoldi, Gambello,
                    Filippino Lippi, and Francesco Francia, who in style belongs to the next age, in
                    which must be mentioned Pomedello, Benvenuto Cellini, Leone Leoni, Giovanni
                    Cavino “the Paduan,” Pastorino of Siena, Giacomo da Trezzo, and Pietro Paolo
                    Galeotto, called Romano. Among the most important works are all the medals of
                    Pisano, particularly those of Alphonso the Magnanimous, with the reverses of the
                    boar-hunt and the eagle and lesser birds of prey, those of Sigismondo di
                    Malatesta, his brother surnamed Novello, Lionelle d’Este, John λ III.
                    (Palaeologus), Nicolo Piccinino, Inigo d’Avalos (marquis of Pescara),
                    Gianfrancesco di Gonzaga (marquis of Mantua), Ludovico III. of the same family,
                    the great humanist Vittorino da Feltre, and of the artist himself, a portrait
                    eminently witnessing his fidelity to nature. He is great in portraiture, great
                    in composition and design, and marvellously skilful in depicting animals. Pisano
                    alone represents the moral qualities of his subject in their highest expression
                    and even capability. That he has high ideal power is seen at once if we compare
                    with his portrait Pasti’s inferior though powerful head of Sigismondo di
                    Malatesta. Pasti’s medal of Isotta, wife of Sigismondo, is also noteworthy;
                    likewise Gentile Bellini’s head of Mehemet <pb break="no"

                    works, lacking Pisano’s technical skill. In the later age Cavino executed a
                    wonderful series of imitations of Roman sestertii, which have been frequently
                    mistaken for originals. In art these Italian works frequently surpass the
                    originals in spite of a degree of weakness inseparable from copies. A comparison
                    of the Italian with the Roman pieces is thus most instructive. The works of
                    Pastorino of Siena are especially charming. Historically the Italian medals
                    supply the defects of the coinages of Florence and Rome, and in a less degree of
                    Venice. The papal series is invaluable as a continuous chronicle of art.</p>
                <p>The money of Germany is like that of Italy far too various for it to be possible
                    here to do more than sketch some of its main features. The metrological systems
                    are Merovingian, Carlovingian, that of the bracteates, and those of the later
                    mediaeval and modern issues in a complicated form. There are several classes,
                    the coinages of the emperors, the electors, the smaller lords, the religious
                    houses, and the free towns. The art is behind that of Italy in time, and on the
                    whole far inferior to it in merit. Some of the later mediaeval examples are of
                    good style, and the Renaissance is ushered in by some beautiful pieces. Yet
                    other coins of this very time are surprisingly barbarous, and there is an
                    immediate decline in the better works. The imperial money, even when limited to
                    what is strictly German by the exclusion of the issues of the French and Italian
                    mints, forms a large series. It begins with the deniers of Charlemagne; and,
                    except the solidus of Louis I., for a long time there is no gold. The true
                    bracteates begin under Frederick I.; the money of Frederick II. is chiefly of
                    Sicily and Italy, and his gold Sicilian coins do not belong to the German
                    series. Under the house of Austria there are fine dollars of Maximilian I., and
                    a splendid double dollar· on which the emperor appears as a horseman. It is
                    after this time that art declines. Passing in review the currencies of the chief
                    states, we are arrested by the historical dollars of Louis I., king of Bavaria,
                    which have the merit of an excellent purpose. The series of Brandenburg,
                    ultimately merging in that of Prussia, is not noteworthy but for some fine early
                    medals. Brunswick shows the exceptional great mining-thalers, generally spread
                    coins, multiples of the dollar 1⅜, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10. Cologne has a
                    representative series. Striking under the Merovingian kings and the Carlovingian
                    emperors, it continued an imperial mint until the reign of Otho IV. (1198-1218).
                    The archbishops began to coin under Bruno (953-965), and only ceased in 1801.
                    The city had also the right of coinage after the emperors ceased to exercise it,
                    but her money is unimportant. The wealthy mart of Hamburg is chiefly remarkable
                    for the great gold pieces of the 16th and 17th centuries, of the weight of 2∣,
                    5, and 10 ducats, with the types of the city and the fleet and allegorical
                    subjects. The city of Magdeburg shows a variety of bracteates. Mainz has the
                    same features as Cologne, Merovingian and Carlovingian money, the imperial mint
                    going on to the reign of Sigismund, who granted the city the right of coinage in
                    1420, so that a few civic coins were issued before the privilege was surrendered
                    to the archbishops in 1462. The archbishops have a series of coins from 1021 to
                    1813. These comprise remarkable large bracteates of the 12th century, with
                    curious ecclesiastical types, combining figures of saints and prelates with
                    architectural detail. Of Nuremberg there is a long gold series, but the artistic
                    fame of the city is not supported by her coinage. The electors palatine have a
                    series in which we note the florin of Rupert IV. (1356-1390), followed by
                    ducats. The money of the archbishops of Salzburg comprises some early pieces,
                    but ranges mostly from the end of the 15th century, and is strong in gold. The
                    Saxon lines are well represented. They begin with large bracteates of the 12th
                    or 13th century, but the most interesting coins are of the age of the
                    Reformation, bad in style and execution, but bearing characteristic portraits.
                    The grandmasters of the Teutonic Order struck money second in importance to that
                    of the knights of St John issued at Rhodes and Malta. The archbishops of Treves
                    coined similar issues to those of their brethren of Cologne and Mainz to the
                    year 1803.</p>
                <p>The German medals stand in importance next to those of Italy. They have this
                    distinctive peculiarity of origin, that their first artists, instead of being,
                    as in Italy, painters or sculptors, were goldsmiths, the craftsmen of Nuremberg
                    and Augsburg. Consequently minute work and love of chasing make them technically
                    inferior as medals to the Italian works, though these qualities are balanced by
                    great vigour and truthfulness. Later in origin than the rival school, the German
                    dates from the early part of the 16th century. Albert Dürer is the greatest
                    medallist, and his medals are wholly superior to those of a mere worker in
                    metal. Heinrich Reitz is next in merit. The portrait of Albert Diirer <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s father by the artist, and a female bust in very low
                    relief, are of high excellence. For historical interest the heads of Luther,
                    Erasmus, Charles V., Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy are very noteworthy. The
                    subject of German medals has not yet been sufficiently studied.</p>
                <p>The coins of the Scandinavian states, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, are almost
                    wholly regal, there being few ecclesiastical and civic pieces. The origin of the
                    types is clearly English and due to the Danish conquest of England. The
                    Norwegian series begins with the pennies of Harold Hardrada, slain at Stamford
                    Bridge; there are next bracteates, and then coins of the Danish kings. The money
                    of Denmark begins with pennies of Cnut (Canute), which are like bis English
                    mintage; so also are those of Hardicanute, but Magnus and Svend Estridsen have
                    some very Byzantine obverse types, which is curious in connexion with the
                    relations of the Norsemen to the Byzantine emperors. Later coins are of German
                    types and barbarous work. A good mediaeval style begins with Erik of Pomerania.
                    Later coins are not remarkable. Sweden has very few early coins, their
                    denominations being the penny and the bracteate. There are good mediaeval coins
                    of Albert of Mecklenburg (1363 -1387). The money of Gustavus Adolphus is
                    historically interesting. Under Charles XII. there is highly curious money of
                    necessity. The daler is struck as a small copper coin, sometimes plated. The
                    types include the Roman divinities. At the same time and later there was a large
                    issue of enormous plates of copper, stamped with their full value in silver
                    money as a countermark.</p>
                <p>The Russian coinage begins in the 15th century. It consists of very curious
                    little silver pieces struck under Byzantine influence. Gold is common in the
                    reign of Peter the Great and of fair style, though the silver is at first of the
                    old barbarous type. Nicholas introduced a platinum coinage of about two-fifths
                    the value of gold. The series of Poland begins in the 11th century with
                    bracteates. There is a regular coinage from Uladislaus Jagello (1382-1434). The
                    town of Dantzic, while part of the kingdom, is remarkable for the issue of large
                    gold pieces with the kings’ portraits and civic reverses, the most important
                    being of the 16th and 17th centuries. Hungary has its own coinage from Stephen
                    I. (1000-1038). Under Charles Robert of Anjou (1308-1342) the florin is
                    introduced, and appears also with the type varied as a ducat. The money of the
                    illustrious John Hunyady as regent is of high interest. The abundance of gold
                    about this time and onwards shows the metallic wealth of the land. The Hungarian
                    money of the house of Austria presents no noteworthy features. The coinage of
                    the Transylvanian princes of the 16th and 17th centuries is chiefly of ducats,
                    witnessing, like the Hungarian, to the wealth of the soil. There are early coins
                    of the patriarchate of Aquileia and of the kingdom of Servia, now revived after
                    four centuries and a half of subjugation, whence the only interest of the modern
                    money as well as of that of Roumania and Greece.</p>
                <p>There is a most interesting class of coins struck during the Middle Ages within
                    the limits of the present Turkish empire, the money of the Crusaders and other
                    Latin princes of the East. The multitude of states thus designated have been
                    classed by Schlumberger, the authority on the subject, in the following order,
                    the chief divisions of which are here given :—first group, principalities of
                    Syria and Palestine, counts of Edessa, princes of Antioch, kings of Jerusalem,
                    counts of Tripoli, fiefs of Jerusalem, crusaders who struck imitations of Arab
                    coins, kings of Cyprus, lords of Rhodes, grandmasters of the order of St John at
                    Rhodes, to which may be added the later grandmasters at Malta; second group,
                    Latin emperors of Constantinople, Frankish princes and lords of Greece and the
                    Archipelago whose power was due to the crusade of 1204, such as the princes of
                    Achaia, the dukes of Athens, Neapolitan kings who struck money for their Eastern
                    possessions, Latin lords of the Archipelago, the Genoese at Chios, the Gattilusi
                    at Mytilene, the Genoese colonies, the Venetian colonies, the Turkoman emirs of
                    western Asia Minor who struck Latin coins. The most important currencies are the
                    copper of the counts of Edessa, the billon and copper of the princes of Antioch
                    and the kings of Jerusalem, the silver and copper of the counts of Tripoli, and
                    the gold imitations of Arab dinars, the currency in that metal of the crusaders
                    of Palestine. These <hi rend="italic">Bisantii Sarracenati,</hi> or Saracen
                    bezants, are at first imitations of Fatimite dinars, known to have been struck
                    by Venetian moneyers at Acre, and probably at Tyre and Tripoli also. After these
                    coins had been current for nearly a century and a half they were forbidden on
                    account of their Mohammedan aspect by Pope Innocent IV. The Venetians then
                    issued gold and silver coins with the same aspect but with Christian
                    inscriptions. The kings of Cyprus issued a really good coinage in the three
                    metals and in billon. The last money of the kingdom is the fixed currency of the
                    gallant Bragadin during the war which lost the island to the republic. The
                    coinage of the order of St John begins on the conquest of the island of Rhodes
                    and the suppression of the Templars; the earliest coins known are of Foulques de
                    Villaret, the first grandmaster at Rhodes in the earliest years of the 14th
                    century, and the last of the Rhodian series are of Villiers de ΓIsle-Adam, the
                    gallant defender of the island who was forced to capitulate to the Turks and
                    sail for a new home in 1523. The coinage is of fine gold, silver, billon, and
                    copper. On the establishment of the order at Malta in 1530 it is resumed there
                    till the capture of the island by the French at the close of last century; it
                    has little interest except as showing the wealth of the order. The other
                    currencies of the crusaders, notwithstanding their great historical interest,
                    are far less remarkable numismatically.</p>
                <p>Of the money of America little need be said here. Neither the coinages of the
                    Spanish and Portuguese dependencies, and of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n716/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0716-0659"/> states which succeeded them, nor those of the
                    English colonies and of the United States, present much that is worthy of note.
                    In style they all resemble those of the parent countries, but, originating in
                    the decline of art, they are inferior in style and work. They are most
                    remarkable in the south for the abundance of gold and silver. The chief coin is
                    the dollar. Some coins are of historical interest, and there are a few rarities,
                    such as the colonial money of Lord Baltimore struck for Maryland, the pine-tree
                    coins of Massachusetts, and the hog-money of Bermuda.</p>
                <p>IV.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Oriental Coins.</hi></p>
                <p>Oriental coins may be best classed as ancient Persian, Arab, modern Persian and
                    Afghan, Indian, and Chinese, and other issues of the far East. The first place
                    is held by the money of the old Persian empire, the Parthians, and the
                    Sasanians. The conquests of the Arabs introduce a new currency, carried on by
                    the Moslem inheritors of their empire. The modern Persian and Afghan money,
                    though of Arab origin, is distinguished by the use of the Persian language with
                    Arabic. The Indian currencies, though Greek, Sanskrit, Arab, and Persian in
                    their inscriptions, must be grouped together on account of their mutual
                    dependence. They rise with the Bactriau kings, whose Greek types are gradually
                    debased by the Indo-Scythians and Guptas; these are followed by a group of
                    currencies with Sanskrit legends; next follow the money of Arab conquerors and
                    the great series of the Pathans of Delhi and subsidiary dynasties, with Arabic
                    inscriptions; the main series is continued in the currency of the Moguls, who
                    largely use Persian, and the last series is closed by local currencies mainly
                    with Sanskrit or Arabic legends. The Chinese coinages form the source and centre
                    of the group of the far East, which, however, includes certain exceptional
                    issues. The order throughout is historical, each empire or kingdom being
                    followed by the smaller states into which it broke up, and then by the larger
                    ones which were formed by the union of these fragments.</p>
                <p>The Persian coinage was originated by Darius I. (Hystaspis) about the time that
                    he organized the empire in satrapies (516 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). The
                    regular taxation thus introduced made a uniform coinage necessary. Avoiding the
                    complex gold system of Croesus, which was intended to accommodate the Greek
                    cities in commercial relation with Lydia, Darius chose two weights, the gold
                    stater of Croesus of 126 grains and the silver drachm of 84. He raised the
                    weight of both, the gold to about 130 grains and the silver to 86. Thus one gold
                    piece was equal to twenty silver. The gold coin was called the daric, the silver
                    the siglus. The metal was very pure, especially that of the daric. Thus not only
                    were the Lydian gold and silver coins of inferior weight thrown out of
                    circulation, but the Persian gold, from its purity, became dominant, and was the
                    chief gold currency of the ancient world so long as the empire lasted. The
                    issuing of gold was a royal prerogative. Silver money was coined not only by the
                    king but in the provinces by satraps, who used local types, and by tributary
                    states. The following classes must be distinguished: (1) regal, (2) provincial
                    with regal types, (3) satrapal, (4) of tributary states. The art of Persian
                    coins varies according to the locality, from the beautiful work of the west
                    coast of Asia Minor to the more formal style of Cilicia and the thoroughly
                    hieratic stiffness of Phoenicia and Persia.</p>
                <p>The regal coinage is of darics and double darics in gold and of sigli in silver.
                    The obverse type is the king as an archer, the reverse an irregular oblong
                    incuse. The darics show differences of style, and must extend through the whole
                    period of the empire. The sigli no doubt run parallel with them. Both these
                    denominations are uninscribed. The double darics are of late style, and nearly
                    all bear either Greek letters or monograms or symbols, sometimes both. They are
                    undoubtedly of the last age of the empire or subsequent to its fall.</p>
                <p>The provincial coins with regal types appear to be mostly Phoenician; the most
                    important classes have been already noticed. But they also occur beyond this
                    territory, as at Malins in Cilicia, where the Persian regal archer is combined
                    with the reverse of Heracles strangling the Nemean lion, with the inscription
                    MAΛ.</p>
                <p>The satrapal coinage is very important and interesting. It belongs mainly to
                    Cilicia. The most remarkable series is that with a bearded head wearing a tiara,
                    with various reverses, certainly struck at Colophon, Cyzicus, and Lampsacus, and
                    in one instance bearing the name of the satrap Pharnabazus, but usually the word
                    “king” in Greek. The coin of Colophon shows a splendid portrait, one of the
                    finest instances of Ionian work. It has been held to represent Artaxerxes II.
                    (Mnemon), but has been lately assigned to Pharnabazus on the ground that the
                    head-dress is not the proper regal kidaris. This is an objection, yet it seems
                    inconceivable that the king of Persia would have countenanced the issue of the
                    portrait of a satrap at a time when no Greek dynast dared to place his head on
                    his own coinage. Of other satrapal issues those of Datames, of Tiribazus, and
                    Cilician issues, struck at Tarsus, are specially noteworthy. Their inscriptions
                    are Aramaic.</p>
                <p>The coinages of the tributary states have been in part noticed in their
                    geographical order; it is difficult to separate them from the provincial issues
                    with regal types.</p>
                <p>The conquest of Alexander did not wholly destroy the independence of Persia.
                    Within less than a century the warlike Parthians once subjects of Persia,
                    revolted (249-8 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) against the Seleueids and formed
                    a kingdom which speedily became an empire, ultimately the one successful rival
                    of Rome. Their money is Greek in standard and inscriptions, as well as in the
                    origin of types. The coins are silver, following the Attic weight, the chief
                    piece being the drachm, though the tetradrachm is not infrequent; there are also
                    bronze coins, but none in gold are known. The drachm has the head of the king on
                    the obverse, diademed or with a regal head-dress, and on the reverse the founder
                    Arsaces seated, holding a strung bow. the later tetradrachms varying this
                    uniformity. Every kind is styled Arsaces, to which many of the later sovereigns
                    add their proper names. The inscriptions are usually long, reaching a climax in
                    such as BAΣIΛEΩΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΑΡΣΑΚΟΥ ΜΕΓΑΛΟΥ ΔΙΚΑΙΟΥ ΕΠΙΦΑΝΟΥΣ ΘΕΟΥ ΕΥΠΑΤΟΡΟΣ
                    ΦΙΛΕΛΛΗ-ΝΟΣ of the 11th Arsacid, Mithradates III., where we see the double
                    influence of Persian and Seleucid styles and the desire to conciliate the Greek
                    cities. Very noticeable are the coins which bear the portraits of Phraataces
                    (14th king) and his mother, the Italian slave Musa, with the title queen (ΘΕΑΣ
                    ΟΥΡΑΝΙ ΑΣM0YΣHΣ BAΣIΛIΣΣHΣ).</p>
                <p>The Persian line of the Sasanians arose about 220 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    and wrested the empire from the Parthians in 226-7, under the leadership of
                    Ardashir or Artaxerxes. This dynasty issued a national and thus Oriental coinage
                    in gold and silver. The denominations follow the Roman system, and there are but
                    two coins, equivalent to the aureus or solidus and the denarius. The obverse has
                    the king’s bust, usually wearing a very large and elaborate head-dress, varied
                    with each sovereign, and on the reverse the sacred fire-altar, ordinarily
                    flanked by the king and a priest. The attachment which Ardashir, the founder,
                    bore to Zoroastrianism established this national reverse type, which endured
                    through the four hundred years of the sovereignty of his line. The inscriptions
                    are Pahlavi</p>
                <p>The Arab coinage forms the most important Oriental group. It has a duration of
                    twelve centuries and a half, and at its widest geographical extension was coined
                    from Morocco to the borders of China. When the Arabs made their great conquests
                    money became a necessity. They first adopted in the East imitations of the
                    current Persian silver pieces of the last Sasanians, but in Syria and Palestine
                    of the Byzantine copper, in Africa of the gold of the same currency. Of these
                    early coins the Sasanian imitations are very curious with Pahlavi inscriptions
                    and shorter ones in Arabie (Cufic). The regular coinage with purely Moslem
                    inscriptions begins with the issue of a silver coin at Basrah, in 40 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.,</hi> by the caliph 'Ali; after subsequent efforts thus to
                    replace the Sasanian currency, the orthodox mintage was finally established, in
                    76 A. <hi rend="smallcaps">h.,</hi> by 'Abd al-Melik. The names of the
                    denominations and the weight of that of gold are plainly indicative of Byzantine
                    influence. There were three coins. The dinar of gold took its name from the
                    aureus or denarius aureus, of which the solidus must have been held to be the
                    representative, for the weight of the Arab coin, 66 grains and a fraction, is
                    clearly derived from the Byzantine gold piece. The dirhem of silver is in name a
                    revival of the Greek drachm; it weighs at most 45 grains and a fraction. The
                    copper piece is the fels, taking its name from the follis of the Greek empire.
                    Commercially the gold easily exchanged, and the silver soon passed as the double
                    of the Carlovingian denier. For long these were the only coins issued, except,
                    and this but rarely, half and quarter dinars. There are properly no types. There
                    was indeed an attempt in the early Byzantino-Arab money to represent the caliph,
                    and in the course of ages we shall observe some deviations from the general
                    practice of Islam, particularly in the coinage of the atabegs and in Mohammedan
                    coinages not of the Arab group, the modern Persian and that of the Moguls of
                    Delhi. The inscriptions are uniformly religious, save in some Tatar coinages and
                    that of the Turks. In general the coins are for the first five centuries of
                    their issue remarkably uniform in fabric and general appearance. They are always
                    flat and generally thin. The whole of both sides of the coins is occupied by
                    inscriptions in the formal Cufic character, usually arranged horizontally in the
                    area and in a single or double band around. Towards the fall of the caliphate a
                    new type of coin begins, mainly differing in the greater size of the pieces.
                    There are new multiples of the dinar and ultimately of the dirhem, and the
                    silver pieces frequently have their inscriptions within and around a square, a
                    form also used for gold. The Cufic character becomes highly ornamental, and
                    speedily gives way to the flexuous naskln. of modern writing. The inscriptions
                    are religious, with the addition of the year by the era of the Flight, the month
                    sometimes being added, and the mint occurs uniformly on silver and copper, but
                    does not appear on the gold until after the fall of the Omayyad dynasty.
                    Subsequently the official name of the caliph occurs, lhe religious part of the
                    inscriptions is various, the most usual formulai being the profession of the
                    Moslem faith: “There is no deity but God; Mohammed is the apostle of God,” to
                    which the Shiites or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n717/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0717-0660"/> folloλvers of 'Ali in Persia and Africa add “
                    *Ali is the friend of God.” The Moorish coins give long formulae and religious
                    citations and ejaculations, and they, like the money of the Pathans of Delhi of
                    the Indian class, have occasionally admonitions urging or suggesting the purer
                    use of wealth. As Arab and other dynasties arose from the dismemberment of the
                    caliphate, the names of kings occur, but for centuries they continued to respect
                    the authority of their religious chief by coining in his name, even in the case
                    of the shadowy 'Abbasids of Egypt, adding their own names even when at war with
                    the caliph, as thouglι they were mere provincial governors. After the fall of
                    the caliphate some new denominations came in, chiefly of heavier weight than the
                    dirhem and dinar, but the influence of the commercial states of Italy made the
                    later Egyptian Mamelukes, the Turks, and the later Moors adopt the gold sequin.
                    In more modern times the dollar found its way into the Moslem coinage of the
                    states bordering on the Mediteιτanean. It can be readily seen that Arab coins
                    have no art in the same sense as those of the Greeks. The beautiful inscriptions
                    and the arabesque devices of the pieces of the close of the Middle Ages have,
                    however, a distinct artistic merit.</p>
                <p>The Omayyad coins owe their only historical value to the evidence which the
                    silver affords of the extent of the empire at different times. The first
                    separation of that empire dates from the overthrow of this dynasty by the
                    'Abbâsids, speedily followed by the formation of the rival Omayyad caliphate of
                    the West with its capital at Cordova. The 'Abbâsid money has the same interest
                    as that which it succeeded, but its information is fuller. Towards the fall of
                    the line it becomes very handsome in the great coins, which are multiples of the
                    dinar. The Spanish Omayyads struck silver almost exclusively. Their rise was
                    followed by that of various lesser lines—the Edrisids (Ae.) and Aghlabids (A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> chiefly) in western Africa, the Beni Τύΐΰη (À), and,
                    after a short interval, the Ikhshidids (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>), both
                    of Turkish origin, in Egypt. Meanwhile a new caliphate arose in western Africa
                    which subdued Egypt, the Fatimite of the line of Αli, and for a while the
                    allegiance of the Moslems was divided between three rival lines, the Omayyads of
                    Spain, the Fatimites of Africa, and the 'Abbâsids of Baghdad. The Fâtimites
                    introduced a new type of dinar, with the inscriptions in concentric circles, and
                    struck little but gold. In the interim the Persians, who had long exercised a
                    growing influence at the court of Baghdad, revived their power in a succession
                    of dynasties which acknowledged the supremacy of the caliphate of Baghdad, but
                    were virtually independent. ' These were the Tahirids, Saffarids, Sâmânids,
                    Ziyarids, and Buweyhids, who mostly struck silver, but the last gold also. As
                    the Persians had supplanted the Arabs, so they were in turn forced to give place
                    to the Turks. The Ghaznawids formed a powerful kingdom in Afghanistan (A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>, Ae), and the Seljιιks established an empire (A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi>), which divided into several kingdoms, occupying the
                    best part of the East. Of these dynasties the Seljuks of Bum or Asia Minor first
                    strike a modern type of Arab coinage (√R). The Seljuk dominions separated into
                    many small states, the central ruled by atabegs or generals, and the similar
                    Turkoman Urtukees. The atabeg money and that of the Turks of the house of Urtuk
                    are mainly large copper pieces bearing on one side a figure borrowed from Greek,
                    Roman, Byzantine, and other sources. They form a most remarkable innovation. In
                    the same age the great but short-lived empire of Kharezm arose in the far East.
                    The first caliphate to disappear was that of Spain, which broke up into small
                    dynasties, some claiming the prerogative of the caliphates. They chiefly struck
                    base silver (billon) coins. The Christian kings gradually overthrew most of
                    these lines. In the meantime various Berber families had gained power in western
                    Africa and the Murabits (Almoravids) and Muwahhids (Almohadis) crossed the
                    straits and restored the Moslem power in Spain. They struck gold money of fine
                    work, and that of the later Muwahhids is remarkable for its size and thinness.
                    At the fall of the Muwahhids the only powerful kingdom remaining was the Arab
                    house of Granada, which, supported by the Berbers of Africa, lingered on until
                    the days of Ferdinand and Isabella. The Fatimite dynasty was supplanted by the
                    Kurdish line of the Eiyùbis, the family of Saladin, who ruled Egypt, Syria, and
                    Mesopotamia, with a number of vassal states, some governed by princes of their
                    own family, some by the older lines of the atâbeg class which they allowed to
                    survive. In Egypt the Eiyιibi coinage is of gold, elsewhere of silver and
                    copper. The caliphate of Baghdad, which latterly was almost limited to that
                    town, though its abundant heavy gold coinage at this very time indicates great
                    wealth, was overtlιrown by the new power of the Mongols (1263 A.D.), who
                    established a group of empires and kingdoms, comprising the whole Eastern world
                    eastward of the Euphrates and thence extending northward and reaching into
                    Europe. The most important of these states for their money are that of the
                    Mongols of Persia, founded by Hulagu, the conqueror of Baghdad, and that of the
                    khans of the Golden Horde. Both struck silver, but there is also gold coinage of
                    the Mongols of Persia, who more frequently use the Mongol character for their
                    names and titles than is done under the kindred line. The power of the Mongols
                    was held in check by the Mameluke kings of Egypt, slave-princes, who struck
                    money in the three metals. The Mongol power waned, but was revived by Timur, who
                    during his rule (1397) recovered all that had been lost. He and his successors
                    struck silver, copper, and brass money. The Turks, whose power had been
                    gradually growing, after a desperate struggle with Timur, gradually absorbed the
                    whole Mohammedan world west of the Tigris, except only Morocco, where they had
                    but a momentary dominion. Their money, of gold, silver, base metal, and bronze,
                    is devoid of historical interest. In Tunis and Morocco a group of Berber lines
                    long maintained themselves, but at length only one survived, that of the sherifs
                    of Morocco, claiming Arab descent, now ruling as the sole independent Moslem
                    dynasty of northern Africa. Its recent coinage is singularly barbarous. It may
                    be remarked that Tunis and Egypt have long coined Turkish money in their own
                    mints, the more western state latterly adding the name of its hereditary prince
                    to that of the sultan.</p>
                <p>The coins of the shahs of Persia have their origin with Isma’il (1502). They are
                    struck in the three metals, and are remarkable for the elegance of their
                    inscriptions, sometimes in flowing Arabic, sometimes in the still more flexuous
                    native character. The inscriptions are at first Arabic; after a time the
                    religious formulae are in this language and the royal legend in Persian, usually
                    as a poetical distich. The Persian series is also remarkable for the autonomous
                    issues of its cities in copper, the obverse bearing some type, usually an
                    animal. The coins of the Afghans form a class resembling in inscriptions those
                    of the Persians, and equally using Persian distichs. They commence with Ahmad
                    Shah Durani.</p>
                <p>The Indian series begins with the money of the Greek kings of western India,
                    commonly known as Bactrian,—a misnomer, only the earlier sovereigns having ruled
                    Bactria. Between Alexander’s money and the Graeco-Indian series there is a
                    curious class, the very rare gold and silver of Andragoras, dynast of Parthia,
                    and the silver of an Indian prince, Sophytes. The Graeco-Indian weight is at
                    first Attic; coins are struck of gold, silver, bronze, and rarely nickel. The
                    gold stater is limited to the earlier kings; the silver tetradrachm is struck at
                    first with divisions; the Persic didrachm and drachm ultimately supersede it;
                    the bronze is either round or of the square form peculiar to India. The types
                    are Greek and very various. The inscriptions are at first Greek, but at an early
                    time a native Indian inscription appears as a concession; it occupies the
                    reverse of bronze, and in time of silver money, and gives a translation of the
                    Greek inscription. The character used is of two Indian alphabets, the common one
                    being styled Bactrian Pali. Diodotus, the first Graeco-Indian king, revolted
                    against the Syrian ruler about 250 B.c.; his money is Greek in its art. Under
                    Euthydemus I., the next king, begins that peculiar style which gives these coins
                    their special interest. It is realistic and vigorous, in portraiture reminding
                    us of the best Italian medals. This is in part due to the leading away of the
                    artists from Greek models to portray another race, for the heads are
                    unmistakably Indian; but it is also significant of an innate strength not to be
                    traced in the portraits of the Ptolemies and the Seleucids. Here we plainly see
                    the first impulse of Greece in the formation of Indian art, after it had been
                    influenced by working in a new atmosphere. The portrait of Demetrius in an
                    elephant’s skin is very remarkable, and should be compared with the wholly ideal
                    treatment of that of Alexander on the coins of Alexander IV. struck in Egypt.
                    After one reign later the order of kings becomes obscure, but the style gives
                    the relative ages of groups, which must be the money of contemporary lines.
                    Agathocles is noticeable for having struck commemorative coins of Alexander the
                    Great, Diodotus, and Euthydemus I. Another characteristic portrait is that of
                    Antimachus in the petasus or Greek hat. Eucratides struck the only Greek gold
                    medal known to us, the great piece weighing twenty staters, now in the French
                    cabinet. The later Greek money is of less interest; it ends with Hermaeus,
                    perhaps about 50 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Then follows a group of dynasts
                    with barbarous names, who adhere more or less closely to Greek originals. A
                    Parthian class breaks in in consequence of the conquests of Mithradates I. The
                    Indo-Scythian class, which is of much interest, is fixed approximately to
                    periods by finds in which aurei occur ranging from the earlier Roman emperors to
                    the Antonines. This coinage is of gold and bronze, silver being almost unknown.
                    The weights are Roman. The types are usually the figure or the bust of the king,
                    and on the reverse a divinity. The inscriptions are first Greek and the ordinary
                    Indian of the Graeco-Indian coins, then, strangely, Greek only, barbarous
                    enough. Cad-phises strikes the double aureus and the aureus. Under Canerces and
                    his successors we notice aurei with an uncommon variety of divinities of Indian,
                    Persian, Greek, and Roman mythology, as well as Buddha. The Gupta series is
                    contemporary with the Indo-Scythian. It was struck in Kanauj, in the centre of
                    northern India. It is a remarkable gold coinage, good and debased, as well as
                    bronze. The mythological types are Indian alone, interesting and in good native
                    style, which now first appears on coins in a pure form. The inscriptions are in
                    Sanskrit letters. There is a series of silver coins struck in Cacch (Cutch) by
                    the Sah kings of Saurastran; they are derived from the later money of the
                    Graeco-Indian class. The <pb break="no"

                <p>Quite as early as the invasion of Alexander, if not earlier, is a most curious
                    class of square silver and bronze coins, punch-marked with a variety of devices,
                    which circulated in northern India, and probably originated the square bronze
                    coinage of the Graeco-Indian kings.</p>
                <p>The Arabs in the first days of conquest had subdued Sind, and founded an
                    independent state on the banks of the Indus; but it is hard to subdue India from
                    this direction, and the strangers decayed and disappeared. The Pathan kings came
                    of the Ghuri stock which rose on the ruins of the empire of Ghazneh. Mohammad
                    ibn Sam made Delhi his capital, and here he and his successors, Pathans or
                    slave-kings, ruled in great splendour, latterly rivalled by a line of Pathans of
                    Bengal. Of the Pathans of Delhi we have an abundant coinage, the principal
                    pieces being the gold mohur of about 168 grains, and the silver rupee of about
                    the same weight, besides many pieces of bronze, and at one period of base metal.
                    The coins are large and thick, with the profession of Islam or the style of the
                    caliph on one side, on the other the name and titles of the reigning king.
                    Mohammad ibn Taghlak struck coins with a great variety of inscriptions, some in
                    the name of the shadowy 'Abbasid caliphs of Egypt, whose successors were for a
                    time similarly honoured by later sovereigns. Towards the close of the rule of
                    the Pathans several dynasties arose in central and southern India and struck
                    similar money, the kings of Guzerat, of Malwa, and of the Deccan. The Pathan
                    lines closed with Shér Shah, an Afghan, the last ruler of Bengal. Bahar, the
                    Turki, of the family of Timur, seeking a kingdom, adventured on the conquest of
                    Hindustan; and after long wars with Shér Shall, carried on by Bahar’s son
                    Humayιin, the famous Shah Akbar, grandson of the invader, was at length
                    peaceably settled on the throne of Delhi, and he and his successors, the
                    so-called Moguls of Delhi, practically subdued the whole of India. They retained
                    the existing standard, but used the Arabic and Persian languages like the shahs
                    of Persia. Akbar (1556) issued a splendid coinage in gold and silver, far more
                    elegant than that of the Pathans, but the money of his son, Jahangir, is still
                    more remarkable. He issued the famous zodiacal mohurs and rupees, as well as
                    those astonishing Bacchanalian mohurs on which he is represented holding the
                    winecup. Scarcely less strange is the money of the beautiful queen Nur-Jahân.
                    Under Shah Jahan there is a visible falling away in the merit of the coins, and
                    an ordinary modern style is reached in the reign of Aurungzeb. To the close of
                    the rule of Shah 'Alam, the last Mogul who actually reigned, gold and silver
                    money is abundant. Latterly, native states coin with Arabic and also with
                    Sanskrit inscriptions. The most important are the kings of Oude, the nizams of
                    the Deccan, and the kings of Mysore, besides the maharajas of Indore and the
                    kings of Nepal. The coinage of Tipu Sultan (Tippu Sahib) is extremely curious
                    from his innovations in the calendar. Besides these there are a multitude of
                    small states. Most of the Indian princes acknowledged the emperor of Delhi, but
                    some struck independently. At last the English coinage of India has swept away
                    nearly all these moneys, though some native states still issue their own, while
                    those under English protection occasionally acknowledge on their coins the
                    supremacy of the queen as empress.</p>
                <p>It is not yet possible to give a full summary of the strange coinages of China
                    and the farther East, the published researches having been generally uncritical
                    and unsupported by the examination of native literary sources. Thus only some
                    general facts may be safely stated.</p>
                <p>The money of China, more certainly than the square punch-marked coinage of India,
                    may claim an origin independent of the Lydian and Greek issues. The oldest
                    specimens may be assigned to the 6th century before our era, a time at which the
                    existing coins of other nations could scarcely have been known in the far East;
                    nor is there any connexion in form, type, or metal with the other currencies.
                    Like nearly all subsequent Chinese money, the earliest is of bronze and cast.
                    The shapes of the coins are most eccentric, representing knives, and, in De la
                    Couperie’s opinion, mining-tools. To these succeed the well-known round pieces
                    with a square hole in the centre for the purpose of stringing them together, the
                    coins to which the name “cash” is applied by Europeans. The value of these coins
                    depended on the weight, which is inscribed upon them. We must, however, bear in
                    mind that we have frequently to deal with a merely conventional weight and value
                    due to financial schemes. Thus the inscription always records official value,
                    but not always true weight or true value. There is no type whatever, but always
                    an inscription on one or both sides. The occurrence of an occasional symbol
                    cannot be held to be a deviation from this rule. The main inscription is usually
                    placed opposite the four sides of the central square on the obverse. As a rule
                    this inscription at its fullest gives the emperor’s official name during life,
                    and the value of the coin and an indication of its authoritative exactness. When
                    a reverse inscription is introduced, it gives the value of the coin. The
                    inscriptions are in Chinese characters of different kinds, and under the present
                    dynasty Manchu has also been employed. Some coins bear indications of mints. The
                    most interesting Chinese coins are those of small rival dynasties and of rebels,
                    the study of which is important for the elucidation of the obscurities of the
                    history of the country. The Chinese medals are talismans, usually larger than
                    the coins, and bear both subjects and inscriptions. They are distributed by
                    Taouist and Buddhist priests of temples. The money of Corea and Annam is similar
                    to that of China, and Chinese coins were long the currency of Java, which more
                    recently has issued the money of its Mohammedan princes.</p>
                <p>The empire of Japan shows in its coinage that Chinese source modified by the
                    influence of native independence which marks all its institutions. Thus, while
                    the copper currency closely resembles that of China, there is also a gold and
                    silver coinage. The gold consists of plates of the form of a flattened oval with
                    large inscriptions in indian ink painted on the surface, and small contermarks
                    punched into it. The “cobang,” which is the largest coin, was chiefly used for
                    presents by the Japanese princes. Its intrinsic value is about £25. There are
                    several lesser denominations in gold, and a series of silver pieces, the larger,
                    ingots, used as presents to inferiors, and the smaller, which are sometimes of a
                    long rectangular shape, more properly a silver currency. There are also temple
                    medals of a magical character like those already noticed as cast in China.</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding the general books covering many sections for which no special
                    works are indicated, it will be felt that this list is very deficient. This is
                    partly due to the multitude of essays in various periodicals, but mainly to the
                    neglect of certain branches of the subject and to the want of full catalogues of
                    the great collections of Europe. (R. 8. P.)</p>
