                    elevations of middle Russia (800 to 1000 feet), and contains the sources of all
                    the great rivers of the country. It is deeply furrowed by valleys with abrupt
                    slopes, which give it the aspect of a highland region, and descends rapidly
                    towards the valley of Lake Ilmen in the west, -which is only 107 feet above the
                    sea-level. The north-eastern part of the government belongs to the lake district
                    of north-western Russia. This tract, gently sloping towards Lakes Ladoga and
                    Onega in the north, is covered with innumerable sheets of water, of which
                    Byelo-ozero (White Lake) and Vozhe are the largest, while more than 3000 smaller
                    ones are figured on the maps. Immense marshes, relics of former lakes, covered
                    with thin forests of birch and elm, occupy the flat depressions and cover more
                    than one-sixth of the government; several of them have an area of from 300 to
                    450 square miles. In summer they are quite impassable; they admit of being
                    crossed only when frozen. Six centuries ago they were even less accessible, and
                    were perhaps the best protection Novgorod possessed against its enemies; but the
                    slow upheaval of north-western Russia, going on at a rate of three or more feet
                    per century, powerfully contributed towards the drainage of the country, as the
                    rivers more deeply excavated their gently-sloping beds. Of recent years
                    artificial drainage has been carried out on a large scale. The forests still
                    occupy more than two-thirds of the government.</p>
                <p>Geologically, Novgorod exhibits in the west vast beds of Devonian limestones and
                    sandstones; these are elsewhere overlaid with Carboniferous limestone, dolomite,
                    sandstones, and marls. The Devonian gives rise to saltsprings, especially at
                    Staraya Russa, and contains iron-ores, while the later formation has coal strata
                    of inferior quality. The whole is covered with a thick sheet of boulder-clay,
                    very often arranged in ridges or <hi rend="italic">asar,</hi> the bottom moraine
                    of the north European ice-sheet of the Glacial period. Numerous remains of the
                    neolithic stone age are found, especially around the deposits of extinct lakes.
                    The numerous rivers of Novgorod are distributed between the Arctic Ocean, Baltic
                    Sea, and Caspian Sea basins; the last <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n664/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0664-0607"/> two basins are further connected by the Mariinsk,
                    Tikhvin, and Vyshnii-Volochok canals, while the Alexander-von-Wiirteιnberg canal
                    connects the tributaries of the White Sea with those of the Baltic. The chief
                    river is the Volkhoff, which flows from Lake Ilmen into Lake Ladoga. Other
                    navigable rivers are the Syas, also flowing into Lake Ladoga, and the Sheksna
                    and the Mologa, tributaries of the Volga. A brisk traffic is steadily carried by
                    the Novgorod rivers, as all boats from the Volga to St Petersburg pass through
                    this government, while the goods embarked within the province itself amount to
                    more than 7,000,000 cwts., worth from 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 roubles.</p>
                <p>The climate is very harsh, the yearly average temperature at Novgorod being only
                    38 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 8 Fahr. (14° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5
                    in January, 62° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 in July). The severe climate,
                    the marshy or stony soil, and the want of grazing-grounds render agriculture
                    unprofitable; though it is carried on everywhere, only rye, oats, barley, and
                    some tobacco are raised, and this to so small an amount that nearly 1,000,000
                    quarters of grain have to be imported every year. Neither gardening nor the
                    raising of cattle is very flourishing; in 1877 there were only 212,000 horses,
                    364,000 cattle, and 253,000 sheep. A number of petty trades are successfully
                    canned on in the villages, all kinds of wooden λvares being made and exported;
                    the preparation of timber, pitch, tar, and charcoal is general, and shipbuilding
                    is widely diffused in several districts. The fisheries on the great lakes are
                    valued at 170,000 roubles annually, and, owing to the proximity of the capital,
                    hunting is still profitable. But the greater number of the inhabitants are
                    dependent on the river-boat traffic; and nearly onefourth of the able-bodied
                    male population are driven in search of work to other parts of Russia. The
                    Novgorod carpenters and masons still maintain their old-established renown. The
                    industrial establishments are few; in 1879 they numbered 245 (steam flour-mills,
                    distilleries, paper-mills, glass-works, and saw-mills), employing about 4500
                    hands, and turned out an aggregate production worth 6,313,000 roubles. Trade,
                    which is animated in several towns and at several points of the river-system, is
                    chiefly in grain and timber, and in manufactures and grocery wares from St
                    Petersburg. The fairs are numerous, and several of them (Kirilovsk monastery,
                    Staraya Russa, and Tcherepovets) show considerable returns. The inhabitants are
                    almost exclusively Great Russians, but they are distinguished by some historians
                    from the Great Russians of the basin of the Oka, as showing some remote
                    affinities with the Little Russians. They belong mostly to the Greek Church, but
                    there are many Nonconformists. Lutherans and Catholics number respectively 4000
                    and 2000. Novgorod, apart from the usual schools and gymnasiums, is betteι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> provided with educational institutions than many
                    other governments of Russia, and, through the successful efforts of its <hi
                    rend="italic">zemstvo,</hi> primary education is more widely diffused in the
                    villages. The government is but thinly inhabited, the population (1,011,500 in
                    1870) being only 1,090,000 in 1884. The chief towns of the eleven districts
                    are:—Novgorod, Borovichi (10,000 inhabitants), Byelozersk (6000), Tcherepovets
                    (3600), Demiansk (1500), Kiriloff (3200), Krestsy (3200), Staraya Russa (6000),
                    Ustyuzhna (7000), and Valdai (3800).</p>
