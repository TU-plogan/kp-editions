                <p><label type="entry">NUTMEG</label>. The spice known in commerce under this name
                    is the kernel of the seed of <hi rend="italic">Myristica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fragrans,</hi> Houtt., a dioecious evergreen tree, about 50 to 60 feet high,
                    found wild in the Banda Islands and a few of the neighbouring islands, extending
                    to New Guinea but not to the Philippines. Nutmeg and mace are almost exclusively
                    obtained from the Banda Islands, although the cultivation has been attempted
                    with varying success in Singapore, Penang, Bengal, Réunion, Brazil, French
                    Guiana, and the West Indies. The trees yield fruit in eight years after sowing
                    the seed, reach their prime in twenty-five years, and bear for sixty years or
                    longer. Almost the whole surface of the Banda Islands is planted with nutmeg
                    trees, which thrive under the shade of the lofty <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canarium</hi><hi rend="italic">commune.</hi> The light volcanic soil, shade,
                    and excessive moisture of these islands, where it rains more or less during the
                    whole year, seem exactly to suit the requirements of the nutmeg tree. In
                    Bencoolen the tree bears all the year round, but the chief harvest takes place
                    in the later months of the year, and a smaller one in April, May, and June. In
                    the Banda Islands the fruits are collected in small neatly-made oval baskets at
                    the end of a bamboo, which prevents bruising, the baskets being open for half
                    their length on one side and furnished with a couple of small prongs projecting
                    from the top, by which the fruit-stalk is broken, the fruit falling into the
                    basket. The ripe fruit is about 2 inches in diameter, of a rounded pear-shape,
                    and when mature splits into two halves, exposing a crimson arillus surrounding a
                    single seed. When the fruit is collected the pericarp is first removed; then the
                    arillus is carefully stripped off and dried, in which state it forms the mace of
                    commerce. The seed consists of a thin hard testa or shell enclosing a kernel,
                    which, when dried, is the nutmeg. To prepare the nutmegs for use, the seed
                    enclosing the kernel is dried at a gentle heat in a drying-house over a
                    smouldering fire for about two months, the seeds being turned every second or
                    third day. When thoroughly dried the shells are broken with a wooden mallet or
                    flat board and the nutmegs picked out and sorted, the smaller and inferior ones
                    being reserved for the expression of the fixed oil which they contain, and which
                    forms the so-called oil of mace.</p>
                <p>The dried nutmegs are then rubbed over with dry sifted lime. The process of
                    liming, which originated at the time when the Dutch held a monopoly of the
                    trade, was commenced with the view of preventing the germination of the seeds,
                    which were formerly immersed for three months in milk of lime for this purpose,
                    and a preference is still manifested in some countries for nutmegs so prepared.
                    It has, however, been shown that this treatment is by no means necessary, since
                    exposure to the sun for a week destroys the vitality of the kernel. Nor is the
                    dry liming process needful, for nutmegs keep well in their natural shell, in
                    which form they are usually exported to China. The weight of the shells,
                    however, adds one-third to the cost of freight, hence this plan is not generally
                    adopted. Penang nutmegs are never limed. The entire fruit preserved in syrup is
                    used as a sweetmeat in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
                <p>“Oil of mace,” or nutmeg butter, is a solid fatty substance of a reddish-broλvn
                    colour, obtained by grinding the refuse nutmegs to a fine powder, enclosing it
                    in bags and steaming it over large cauldrons for five or six hours, and then
                    compressing it while still warm between powerful wedges, the brownish fluid
                    which flows out being afterwards allowed to solidify. Nutmegs yield about
                    one-fourth of their weight of this substance. It is partly dissolved by cold
                    alcohol, the remainder being soluble in ether. The latter portion, about 10 per
                    cent, of the -weight of the nutmegs, consists chiefly of <hi rend="italic"
                    >myristin,</hi> which is a compound of <hi rend="italic">myristic acid,</hi> C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 14</hi> H., <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, with glycerin. The fat which is soluble in alcohol
                    appears to consist, according to Schmidt and Roemer <hi rend="italic">(Arch.
                    Pharm.</hi> [3], xxi. pp. 34-48), of free myristic and stearic acids; the brown
                    colouring matter has not been satisfactorily investigated. Nutmeg butter yields
                    on distillation with water a volatile oil to the extent of about 6 per cent.,
                    consisting almost entirely of a hydrocarbon called <hi rend="italic"
                    >myristicene,</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    10</hi>, boiling at 165° C. It is accompanied by a small quantity of an
                    oxygenated oil, <hi rend="italic">myristicol,</hi> isomeric with carvol, but
                    differing from it in not forming a crystalline compound with hydrosulphuric
                    acid. Mace contains a similar volatile oil, <hi rend="italic">macene,</hi>
                    boiling at 160° C., which is said by Cloëz to differ from that of nutmegs in
                    yielding a solid compound when treated with hydrochloric acid gas.</p>
                <p>The annual imports of nutmegs to the United Kingdom amount to from 400,000 to
                    800,000 lb, each lb consisting of about 110 fair-sized nutmegs, and of mace from
                    60,000 to 80,000 lb per annum. The former are valued at from three to five
                    shillings per ft), and mace at from one to three shillings per ft).<note

                    especial favourite with the people of the United States, since the export to

                    nutmegs, the produce of <hi rend="italic">Μ. tomentosa</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">fatua,</hi> are sometimes imported in
                    small quantities. Several species of <hi rend="italic">Myristica</hi> yield
                    fatty oils, which form commercial products, but none of these are remarkable for
                    fragrance.</p>
                <p>The name nutmeg is also applied to other fruits or seeds in different countries.
