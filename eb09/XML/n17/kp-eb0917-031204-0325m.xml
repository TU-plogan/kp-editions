                    been in use from prehistoric times in all places where mankind used the skins of
                    animals or woven fabrics for clothing. Originally the needle was made of
                    fish-bone, bone, or ivory, and its first form was probably a rude eyeless
                    bodkin. Needles of bone continue to this day to be used by uncivilized tribes;
                    but since the time of the discovery of bronze metal needles have been in use in
                    civilized communities. It is on record that needles of steel were made at
                    Nuremberg towards the end of the 14th century, and at a later period Spanish
                    needles acquired wide celebrity. For upwards of two centuries the manufacture
                    has been established in England,—Redditch in Worcestershire, with several other
                    small towns in Warwickshire, being the centre of the industry, first planted
                    there by Germans. Originally the trade was domestic in its character, but now it
                    is carried on in large manufactories where mechanical appliances have to a
                    certain extent supplanted handiwork, with much advantage to the health and the
                    wellbeing of the operatives.</p>
                <p>The raw material of the manufacture consists of steel wire of fine quality and
                    suitable gauge. The wire is supplied in coils of definite weight and diameter,
                    and the first operation consists in cutting the coil with powerful shears. With
                    the aid of a gauge the coil is cut with precision into lengths, each sufficient
                    for two needles. These lengths, having the curvature of the coil and other
                    inequalities, are next straightened. For this purpose a bundle containing
                    several thousand lengths is packed within two strong iron rings; the bundle is
                    heated to red heat, and then pressed on an iron plate having two parallel
                    grooves in which the iron rings run. Over this plate the bundle is worked
                    backward and forward by the pressure of an oblong slightly curved iron tool
                    having two longitudinal slits through which the edges of the rings project. Thus
                    by combined pressure and rolling the whole of the lengths quickly become
                    perfectly straight and even. The next operation consists in pointing both ends
                    of the wires, which, being done on a dry grindstone revolving at high speed, is,
                    from the sparks and dust created, very injurious to the operatives. A grinder,
                    holding at one time several dozen wires against the stone with his left hand,
                    and revolving them slightly with his right, will point about 100,000 needles in
                    a day. He is but imperfectly protected against the deadly dust he produces by a
                    cowl which, partly covering the grindstone, is connected with a pipe through
                    which a strong current of air is drawn, sucking away a large proportion of the
                    dust. For the operation of pointing various machines have been devised and have
                    come into extensive use, especially in Germany. In general principle these
                    machines consist of a wheel, to the periphery of which the wires to be pointed
                    are held by an india-rubber band. It revolves at right angles to the revolving
                    hollow grindstone, and, bringing each wire in rapid succession at the proper
                    angle for grinding against the stone, it points three times as many as a skilful
                    grinder. The succeeding series of operations have for their object the eyeing of
                    the needles. As a preliminary to this the oxidized scale at the centre of the
                    wire is ground off, and on the surface so prepared each wire is separately
                    stamped, by means of dies, with the grooved and rounded impression of two needle
                    heads set end to end. Through these stamped heads the eye-holes are next
                    perforated by means, of a screw-press working a pair of fine steel punches or
                    prongs. Each wire now forms two needles attached head to head by a broad thin
                    scarf of steel at the point of junction where the metal has been stamped for the
                    head. These double needles, taken to the number of about one hundred, are
                    threaded together with a fine wire passed through the eyes, giving the whole the
                    appearance of a fine close-set comb. Each side is clamped up tightly, and the
                    expansion of the scarf in the centre is removed by a file. The spitted row is
                    now ready to break over into separate needles, and as the point of junction of
                    the two sets of heads is weakened by the stamping process, the rows readily
                    break at that point by bending. These heads are then smoothed and rounded with
                    the file before the clamp is removed, the wire withdrawn, and the separate
                    needles set free. At this stage the needles are hardened and tempered in the
                    usual manner; that is, they are placed in an iron tray, heated to redness in a
                    muffle furnace, plunged <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n326/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0326-0313"/> into an oil bath, then re-heated in the muffle
                    till they assume a straw colour, and gradually cooled. Following the tempering
                    comes the process of scouring and fining or polishing, for which purpose the
                    needles are put up in bundles of several thousands mixed with soft soap, oil,
                    and emery powder, and tied tightly round with a canvas cover. A number of such
                    bundles are laid in the bed of a machine in which by rollers or other devices
                    they are kept rolling backward and forward, so that each individual needle rubs
                    against its neighbours. After sufficient time the bundles are withdrawn, the
                    needles cleaned by washing, dried, and again bundled up as before, but with a
                    mixture containing putty powder in place of emery. The rolling process is
                    continued till the needles acquire a sufficiently polished surface. The needles
                    are now unpacked, washed in an alkaline solution, and dried in sawdust. From
                    that they are conveyed to trays, where they are brought parallel to each other
                    by a sharp jerking motion. It is next necessary to bring all the heads in one
                    direction, which is dexterously done by a “header,” who with a cloth
                    finger-stool on the fourth finger presses a lot of needles against that cloth.
                    Points presented adhere, and thus at each operation a number of needles remain
                    sticking in the finger-stool. While this arrangement is going on, faulty and
                    imperfect needles are picked out. The heads being all now laid in one direction,
                    attention is given to the smoothing and rounding of the eye-holes, a work
                    essential for the prevention of the fraying and breaking of the thread in
                    sewing. The heads are blued by heating, an operation most neatly and perfectly
                    performed by bringing each head in succession in contact with a gas flame by
                    means of a revolving wheel, against the periphery of which the needles are
                    retained by an elastic band. The needles so blued are strung on a roughened
                    steel wire, over which is spread a fine paste of oil and emery. These wires are
                    suspended between uprights on a frame platform, to which a jerking motion is
                    communicated; thereby an oscillating motion is communicated to the suspended
                    needles, and the gentle friction thus set up between the needle eye and the
                    roughened wire and emery slowly but effectually secures the desired effect. Now
                    it only remains to free the head from the blue colour on a small grindstone, and
                    give a final polish to the needle on a rapidly revolving buff wheel aided by
                    putty powder. It has of late become a common practice to gild the heads of
                    needles. The variety of needles manufactured for sewing by hand and machine, for
                    packing, for upholstery and leather work, as well as for surgical purposes, is
                    very great, and demands many modifications of processes and appliances, (j. <hi
