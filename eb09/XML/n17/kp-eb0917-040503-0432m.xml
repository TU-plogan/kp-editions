                    scenery is picturesque; but the town is chiefly composed of a mean class of
                    houses, although there are many good villas in the suburbs. The old parish
                    church of St Woollos is one of the most curious churches in England. Originally
                    it consisted only of the present nave,—a fine specimen of grand though perfectly
                    unadorned Romanesque architecture; but a massive square tower (of the time of
                    Henry III.) and a chancel were subsequently added; a large western lady-chapel
                    is interposed between the nave and the tower. The old castle, built about 1130
                    by Robert earl of Gloucester, was a very extensive structure in the Late
                    Perpendicular. The two towers and the main central mass still remain; a portion
                    has been converted into a brewery. The old monastery of Friars Preachers
                    (Dominicans or Black Friars) has been entirely rebuilt, and is occupied as a
                    private residence. The other principal public buildings are the spacious
                    Victoria Hall, the Albert Hall, the new town-hall, the market-house, the
                    custom-house, the union workhouse, the infirmary, and the free library and
                    school of art. Newport owes its rapid increase to its situation on a deep and
                    spacious tidal river, which renders it a convenient outlet for the trade of a
                    very rich mineral district. It is now supplied with very extensive docks and
                    wharves, to which steamers of the largest size can have access at all tides. The
                    old dock of 4 j acres, opened in 1842, received in 1858 an addition of 7f acres;
                    and in 1875 the new Alexandra dock of 25 acres was opened, land being retained
                    surrounding it to the extent of 400 acres, available for the construction of
                    wharves and warehouses, and for extension of the dock area. There is regular
                    steam communication with Bristol, Liverpool, and Ireland. In 1882 the number of
                    vessels in the foreign and colonial trade that entered the port was 1656 of
                    734,264 tons, the number that cleared 2143 of 1,078,245 tons. In the same year
                    there entered in the coasting trade 8020 vessels of 1,048,626 tons, and cleared
                    7667 vessels of 700,500 tons. The town possesses large iron foundries and
                    engineering works, and among the other industries the principal are the
                    manufacture of waggons and wheels, patent nails, bolts, and wire. The
                    manufacture of steel in the district is rapidly increasing. Shipbuilding was
                    formerly carried on to a large extent. The building of iron ships has recently
                    been commenced by several firms. The population of the municipal borough, which
                    in 1801 was only 1135, had increased in 1831 to 7062, in 1851 to 20,279, in 1871
                    to 27,069, and in 1881 to 35,313. The population of the parliamentary borough
                    (area 1690 acres) in 1881 was 38,427.</p>
                <p>Newport is called Novus Burgus by Giraldus Cambrensis to distinguish it from the
                    old Roman city of Caerleon about 3 miles distant. The town is nowhere mentioned
                    in history before the beginning of the 10th century. Tradition states that
                    Ethelfleda was killed at a great battle at Castell Newydd (Newport), but
                    according to another account the Saxon sovereign slain was Ethelfred. The town
                    received its first charter from Edward II. It is included in the Monmouth
                    parliamentary district of boroughs.</p>
