                <p><label type="entry">NIÈVRE</label>, a central department of France, formed out of
                    the old province of Nivernais with a small portion of the Orléanais, lies
                    between 46° 40' and 47° 35' N. lat. and between 2° 50' and 4° 12' E. long., and
                    is bounded N.W. by Loiret, N. by Yonne, N.E. by Côte d’Or, E. and S.E. by
                    Saône-et-Loire, S.W. and W. by Allier, and W. by Cher. It belongs partly to the
                    basin of the Loire, partly to that of the Seine. Towards the west its limits are
                    marked by the Allier-Loire valley,—the Loire striking across the southwest
                    corner of the department by Decize and Nevers and then continuing the line of
                    its great affluent the Allier northwards by Fourchambault, La Charité, Pouilly,
                    and Cosne. Secondary feeders of the Loire are the Nièvre, which gives its name
                    to the department, and the Aron, whose valley is traversed by the Nivernais
                    Canal. The largest Seine tributary in Nièvre is the Yonne, which rises in the
                    southeast, passes by Clamecy, and carries along with it the northern part of the
                    Nivernais Canal. The Cure, the principal affluent of the Yonne (with which,
                    however, it does not unite till after it has left the department), is the outlet
                    of a lake, Lac des Settons, which serves as a reservoir for the practical
                    regulation of the river. The watershed between the two river systems runs, like
                    the general slope of the department, from south-east to north-west,—the highest
                    summits belonging to the Morvan, an uplift of granite, porphyry, and gneiss,
                    which extends into Saône-et-Loire, Côte d’Or, and Yonne. Here stands <pb

                    Nièvre; and 7 or 8 miles north-north-west, at an altitude of nearly 2000 feet,
                    is Château-Chinon, the highest town in the department. The lowest level in the
                    department is 443 feet, at the exit of the Loire. Nièvre is divided by the line
                    of the canal into two distinct geological districts: to the east the old
                    crystalline rocks of the Morvan, to the west the Jurassic limestones. Both are
                    partly covered by extensive stretches of woodland. Morvan (“Black Forest ”) is
                    one of the most picturesque portions of France; and the western district, known
                    as the “Bon Pays,” is one of its finest pastoral areas, terminating towards the
                    Loire in hills generally clad with vines. Owing to its greater elevation and the
                    retention of the rain-water on its hard surface in the shape of ponds and
                    streams, Morvan shows a mean temperature 6° Fahr, lower than that of the western
                    district, which, in the valley of the Loire, is almost identical with that of
                    Paris (52° Fahr.). At Nevers the annual rainfall amounts to only 18 inches; but
                    in Morvan it is about three times as great.</p>
                <p>The area of the department is 2631 square miles, one-half being arable land, a
                    third woods, and a tenth pasture, while 42 square miles are occupied by vines.
                    The live stock numbers 20,000 horses (mainly of Morvan breed, small but hardy
                    and strong), 500 mules, 7000 asses, 146,100 cattle (generally of
                    Nivernais-Charolais breeds), 210,000 sheep, 70,000 swine, 5700 goats; and there
                    are 18,600 beehives. In 1880 the department produced 2,984,000 bushels of wheat,
                    and about the same quantity of oats; barley, 1,122,000 bushels; rye, 521,000;
                    buckwheat, 211,000; potatoes, 4,620,000; besides beetroot (86,108 tons), pulse,
                    maize, hemp, colza, fruits. The vintage of 1881 yielded 5,304,816 gallons of
                    wine,—the best being the white wines of Pouilly, a locality which besides sends
                    a great quantity of its grapes to Paris for table use. The Nièvre forests,
                    consisting of oak, beech, hornbeam, and elm, supply about three-fifths of the
                    firewood required for the Parisian market. The coal-field of Decize, with its
                    seven seams making a total thickness of 40 feet, yielded 200,000 tons in 1882.
                    Fine building stone, a little white marble, sandstone, millstones, granite, and
                    kaolinic sands are all worked in the department. The best-known mineral springs
                    are those of Pougues and St Honore,— the former chalybeate and the latter
                    sulphurous, as at Eaux Bonnes in the Pyrenees. Of the iron-works for which
                    Nièvre is famous, the most important are those of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fourchambault</hi> (g ’.v.), employing more than 2000 workmen, and
                    manufacturing into bridges, building frames, rails, wheels, &amp;c., the product
                    of 40,000 tons of ore. At lmphy the staple is rails and Bessemer steel. The
                    Government works of La Chaussade at Guérigny employ 1300 λvorkmen, and make
                    armour-plates and the materials required in iron shipbuilding; wood charcoal is
                    used, which explains the selection for this industry of a department so well
                    supplied with timber. There are besides in the department minor foundries and
                    forges, manufactories of agricultural implements and hardware, potteries,
                    tile-works, chemical works, paper-mills, and wool-mills, as well as numerous
                    tanneries, breweries, and oil works (colza, poppy, and hemp). In the Morvan
                    district a large part of the population is engaged in the timber industry; the
                    logs carried down by the streams to Clamecy are then collected into rafts or put
                    into boats. Besides firewood and charcoal Nièvre exports cattle; but it has to
                    import cereals. A great deal of the traffic is by water: the canal along the
                    left bank of the Loire runs through the department for 38 miles, and the
                    Nivernais Canal (from Decize to Clamecy and so to the Yonne) for 47 miles. The
                    total length of the railways is 145 miles. The population of the department was
                    347,576 in 1881. Nièvre is divided into 4 arrondissements, 25 cantons, 313
                    communes. It forms the diocese of Nevers, and part of the districts dependent on
                    the corps d’armée and the court of appeal of Bourges. The chief towns of the
                    arrondissements are Nevers, Château Chinon (2613 inhabitants), Clamecy (5536),
                    and Cosne (7401). Other places of note are La Charite (4826), with an old church
                    of the order of Cluny; Decize (4927), with an old church and interesting ruins;
                    and St Pierre le Montier (3080), having an old Cluniae monastery.</p>
