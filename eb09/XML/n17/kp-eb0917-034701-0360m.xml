                    emperor, the only child of Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus and the younger Agrippina,
                    was born at Antium on December 15, 37 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> nine

                    to have predicted that he would one day be emperor, the circumstances of his
                    early life gave little presage of his future eminence. His father Domitius, at
                    best a violent, pleasure-seeking noble, died when Nero was scarcely three years
                    old. In the previous year (39 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> his mother had
                    been banished by order of her brother the emperor Caligula on a charge of
                    treasonable conspiracy, and Nero, thus early deprived <pb break="no"

                    house of his aunt Domitia, where two slaves, a barber and a dancer, commenced
                    the training of the future emperor. With the death of Caligula in 41 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> his prospects improved, for Agrippina was recalled
                    from exile by her uncle, the new emperor Claudius, and resumed the charge of her
                    young son. Nero’s history during the next thirteen years is summed up in the
                    determined struggle carried on by his mother to win for him the throne which it
                    had been predicted should be his. The fight was a hard one. Messalina,
                    Claudius’s wife, was all powerful with her husband, and her son Britannicus was
                    by common consent regarded as the next in succession. But on the other hand
                    Claudius was weak and easily led, and Agrippina daringly aspired to supplant
                    Messalina in his affections. To outweigh Britannicus’s claims as the son of the
                    reigning emperor, she relied on the double prestige which attached to her own
                    son, as being at once the grandson of the popular favourite Germanicus and the
                    lineal descendant of Augustus himself. Above all, she may well have put
                    confidence in her own great abilities, indomitable will, and untiring energy,
                    and in her readiness to sacrifice everything, even her personal honour, for the
                    attainment of the end she had in view. Her first decisive success was gained in
                    48 by the disgrace and execution of Messalina. In 49 followed her own marriage
                    with her uncle Claudius, and her recognition as his consort in the government of
                    the empire.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tac., <hi

                    interests of her son. The Roman populace already looked with favour on the
                    grandson of Germanicus, but in 50 his claims obtained a more formal recognition
                    from Claudius himself, and the young Domitius was adopted by the emperor under
                    the title of Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus.<note anchored="true"

                    training needed to fit him for the brilliant future which seemed opening before
                    him. The philosopher L. Annaeus Seneca was recalled from exile and appointed
                    tutor to the young prince. On December 15, 51, Nero completed his fourteenth
                    year, and Agrippina, in view of Claudius’s failing health, determined to delay
                    no longer his adoption of the toga virilis. The occasion was celebrated in a
                    manner which seemed to place Nero’s prospects of succession beyond the reach of
                    doubt. He was introduced to the senate by Claudius himself. The proconsular
                    imperium and the title of “princeps juventutis” were conferred upon him.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tac,, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ann.,</hi> xii. 41.</p></note> He was specially admitted as an extraordinary
                    member of the great priestly colleges, and his name was included by the Arvai
                    Brethren in their prayers for the safety of the emperor and his house. Largesses
                    and donations delighted the populace and the soldiery, and at the games in the
                    circus Nero’s appearance in triumphal dress contrasted significantly with the
                    simple toga praetexta worn by Britannicus. During the next two years Agrippina
                    followed up this great success with her usual energy. Britannicus’s leading
                    partisans were banished or put to death, and the all-important command of the
                    praetorian guard was transferred to Afranius Burrus, formerly a tutor of Nero’s,
                    and devoted to his service. Nero himself was put prominently forward whenever
                    occasion offered. The petitions addressed to the senate by the town of Bononia
                    and by the communities of Rhodes and Ilium were gracefully supported by him in
                    Latin and Greek speeches, and during Claudius’s absence in 52 at the Latin
                    festival it was Nero who, as prefect of the city, administered justice in the
                    forum to crowds of suitors. Early in 53 his marriage with Claudius’s daughter,
                    the ill-fated Octavia, drew still closer the ties which connected him with the
                    imperial house, and now nothing but Claudius’s death seemed wanting to secure
                    his final triumph. This event, which could not in the course of nature be long
                    delayed, Agrippina determined to hasten, and the absence, through illness, of
                    the emperor’s trusted freedman Narcissus, favoured her schemes. On October 13,
                    54, Claudius died, poisoned, as all our authorities declare, by the orders of
                    his unscrupulous wife. For some hours the fact of his death was concealed, but
                    at noon the gates of the palace were thrown open, and Nero was presented to the
                    soldiers on guard as their new sovereign. From the steps of the palace he
                    proceeded to the praetorian camp to receive the salutations of the troops, and
                    thence to the senate-house, where he was fully and promptly invested with all
                    the honours, titles, and. powers of emperor.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Agrippina’s bold stroke had been completely successful. Its suddenness had
                    disarmed opposition: only a few voices were raised for Britannicus; nor is there
                    any doubt that Rome was prepared to welcome the new emperor with genuine
                    enthusiasm. To his descent from Germanicus and from Augustus he owed a prestige
                    which was strengthened by the general belief in his own good qualities. He was
                    young, generous, and genial. His abilities, really considerable, were skilfully
                    assisted and magnified by Seneca’s ready dexterity, while the existence of his
                    worse qualities—his childish vanity, ungovernable selfishness, and savage temper
                    —was as yet unsuspected by all but those immediately about him. His first acts
                    confirmed the favourable impressions thus produced. With graceful modesty he
                    declined the venerable title of “pater patriae.” The memory of Claudius, and
                    that of his own father Domitius were duly honoured. The senate listened with
                    delight to his promises to rule according to the maxims of Augustus, and to
                    avoid the errors and abuses which had multiplied under the rule at once lax and
                    arbitrary of his predecessor, while his unfailing clemency, liberality, and
                    affability were the talk of Rome. Much no doubt of the credit of all this is due
                    to Seneca, and his faithful ally Burrus. Seneca had seen from the first that the
                    real danger with Nero lay in the savage vehemence of his passions, and he made
                    it his chief aim to stave off by every means in his power the dreaded outbreak
                    of “the wild beast” element in his pupil’s nature. He indulged him to the full
                    in all his tastes, smoothed away opposition, and, while relieving him as far as
                    possible of the more irksome duties of government, gave him every facility for
                    easily winning the applause he craved for by acts of generosity which cost him
                    little. Nor is it certain that any other policy would have succeeded better with
                    a nature like Nero’s, which had never known training or restraint, and now
                    revelled with childish delight in the consciousness of absolute power. Provided
                    only that the wild beast did not taste blood, it mattered little if respectable
                    society was scandalized at the sight of an emperor whose chief delight was in
                    pursuits hitherto left to Greek slaves and freedmen. At any rate the policy
                    succeeded for the time. During the first five years of his reign, the golden
                    “quinquennium Neronis,” little occurred to damp the hopes excited by his
                    behaviour on succeeding to the throne. His clemency of temper was unabated. His
                    promises of constitutional moderation were amply fulfilled, and the senate found
                    itself free to discuss and even to decide important administrative questions.
                    Abuses were remedied, the provincials protected from oppression, and the burdens
                    of taxation lightened. On the frontiers, thanks chiefly to Corbulo’s energy and
                    skill, no disaster occurred serious enough to shake the general confidence in
                    the government, and even the murder of Britannicus seems to have been easily
                    pardoned at the time as a necessary measure of self-defence<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0362-0349"/>. But Seneca’s fears of what the consequences
                    would be, should Nero’s sleeping passions once be roused, were fully verified by
                    the result, and he seems to have seen all along from what quarter danger was to
                    be apprehended. Agrippina’s imperious temper and insatiable love of power made
                    it certain that she would not willingly abandon her ascendency over her son, and
                    it was scarcely less certain that her efforts to retain it would bring her into
                    collision with his ungovernable self-will. At the same time the success of
                    Seneca’s own management of Nero largely depended on his being able gradually to
                    emancipate the emperor from his mother’s control. During the first few months of
                    Nero’s reign the chances of such an emancipation seemed remote, for he not only
                    treated his mother with elaborate respect, but consulted her on all affairs of
                    state. In 55, however, Seneca found a powerful ally in Nero’s passion for the
                    beautiful freedwoman Acte, a passion which he deliberately encouraged for his
                    own purposes. Agrippina’s injured pride provoked her to angry remonstrances,
                    which served only to irritate her wayward son, and the caresses by which she
                    endeavoured to repair her mistake equally failed in their object. Furious at her
                    discomfiture, she rashly tried intimidation, and threatened to espouse the cause
                    of the injured Britannicus. But her threats only served to show that her son, if
                    once his will was crossed, or his fears aroused, could be as unscrupulous and
                    headstrong as his mother. Britannicus was poisoned as he sat at table.
                    Agrippina, however, still persisted. She attempted to win over Nero’s neglected
                    wife Octavia, and to form a party of her own within the court. Nero replied by
                    dismissing her guards, and placing herself in a sort of honourable
                    confinement.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tac∙, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> xiii. 12-20.</p></note> This second defeat seems to
                    have decided Agrippina to acquiesce in her deposition from the leading position
                    she had filled since 49. During nearly three years she disappears from the
                    history, and with her retirement things again for the time went smoothly. In 58,
                    however, fresh cause for anxiety appeared. For the second time Nero was enslaved
                    by the charms of a mistress. But Poppaea Sabina, the new favourite, was a woman
                    of a very different stamp from her predecessor. High-born, wealthy, and
                    accomplished, she had no mind to be merely the emperor’s plaything. She was
                    resolved to be his wife, and with consummate skill she set herself at once to
                    remove the obstacles which stood in her way. Her first object was the final ruin
                    of Agrippina. By taunts and caresses she drove her weak and passionate lover
                    into a frenzy of fear and baulked desire. She taught him easily enough to hate
                    and dislike his mother as an irksome check on his freedom of action, and as
                    dangerous to his personal safety. To get rid of her, no matter how, became his
                    one object, and the diabolical ingenuity of Anicetus, a freedman, and now
                    prefect of the fleet at Misenum, devised a means of doing so without unnecessary
                    scandal. Agrippina was invited to Baiae, and after an affectionate reception by
                    her son, was conducted on board a vessel so constructed as, at a given signal,
                    to fall to pieces and precipitate its passengers into the waters of the lake.
                    But the manoeuvre failed. Agrippina saved herself by swimming to the shore, and
                    at once wrote to her son, announcing her escape, and affecting entire ignorance
                    of the plot against her. The news filled Nero with consternation, but once again
                    Anicetus came to his rescue. A body of soldiers under his command surrounded
                    Agrippina’s villa, and murdered her in her own chamber.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">-Ibid.,</hi> xiv.
                    1-13.</p></note> The deed done, Nero was for the moment horrorstruck at the
                    enormity of the crime, and terrified at its possible consequences to himself.
                    But a six months’ residence in Campania, and the congratulations which poured in
                    upon him from the neighbouring towns, where the report had been officially
                    spread that Agrippina had fallen a victim to her own treacherous designs upon
                    the emperor’s life, gradually restored his courage. In September 59 he
                    re-entered Rome amid universal rejoicing, fully resolved upon enjoying his
                    dearly bought freedom. A prolonged carnival followed, in which Nero revelled in
                    the public gratification of the tastes which he had hitherto ventured to indulge
                    only in comparative privacy. Chariot races, musical and dramatic exhibitions,
                    games in the Greek fashion, rapidly succeeded each other. In all the emperor was
                    a prominent figure, and the fashionable world of Rome, willingly or unwillingly,
                    followed the imperial example. These revels, however, extravagant as they were,
                    at least involved no bloodshed, and were humanizing and civilized compared with
                    the orthodox Roman gladiatorial shows. A far more serious result of the death of
                    Agrippina was the growing influence over Nero of Poppaea and her friends; and in
                    62 their influence was fatally strengthened by the removal of the trusty
                    advisers who had hitherto stood by the emperor’s side. Burrus died early in that
                    year, it was said from the effects of poison, and his death was immediately
                    followed by the retirement of Seneca from a position which he felt to be no
                    longer tenable. Their place was filled by Poppaea, and by the infamous
                    Tigellinus, whose sympathy with Nero’s sensual tastes had gained him the command
                    of the praetorian guards in succession to Burrus. The two now set themselves to
                    attain a complete mastery over the emperor. The haunting fear of conspiracy,
                    which had unnerved stronger Caesars before him, was skilfully used to direct
                    Nero’s fierce suspicions against possible opponents. Cornelius Sulla, who had
                    been banished to Massilia in 58, was put to death on the ground that his
                    residence in Gaul was likely to arouse disaffection in that province, and a
                    similar charge proved fatal to Rubellius Plautus, who had for two years been
                    living in retirement in Asia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> xiv. 59.</p></note>
                    Nero’s taste for blood thus whetted, a more illustrious victim was next found in
                    the person of the unhappy Octavia. At the instigation of Poppaea she was first
                    divorced and then banished to the island of Pandateria, where a few days later
                    she was barbarously murdered. Poppaea’s triumph was now complete. She was
                    formally married to Nero; her head appeared on the coins side by side with his;
                    and her statues were erected in the public places of Rome.</p>
                <p>This series of crimes, in spite of the unvarying applause which still greeted all
                    Nero’s acts, had excited gloomy forebodings of coming evil, and the general
                    uneasiness was increased by the events which followed. In 63 the partial
                    destruction of Pompeii by an earthquake, and the news of the evacuation of
                    Armenia by the Roman legions, seemed to confirm the belief that the blessing of
                    the gods was no longer with the emperor. A far deeper and more lasting
                    impression was produced by the great fire in Rome, an event which more than
                    almost any other has thrown a lurid light round Nero’s reign. The fire broke out
                    on the night of July 18, 64, among the wooden booths at the south-east end of
                    the Circus Maximus. Thence in one direction it rapidly spread over the Palatine
                    and Velia up to the low cliffs of the Esquiline, and in another it laid waste
                    the Aventine, the Forum Boarium, and Velabrum till it reached the Tiber and the
                    solid barrier of the Servian wall. After burning fiercely for six days, and when
                    its fury seemed to have exhausted itself, it suddenly started afresh in the
                    northern quarter of the city, and desolated the two regions of the Circus
                    Flaminius and the Via Lata. By the time that it was finally quenched only four
                    of the fourteen regiones remained untouched; three had been <pb break="no"

                    The conflagration is said by all authorities later than Tacitus to have been
                    deliberately caused by Nero himself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >N.H.,</hi> xvii. 5.</p></note> But Tacitus, though he mentions rumours to that
                    effect, declares that its origin was uncertain, and his description of Nero’s
                    energetic conduct at the time justifies us in acquitting the emperor of so
                    reckless a piece of incendiarism. By Nero’s orders, the open spaces in the
                    Campus Martius were utilized to give shelter to the homeless crowds, provisions
                    were brought up from Ostia, and the price of corn lowered. In rebuilding the
                    city every precaution was taken against the recurrence of such a calamity. Broad
                    regular streets replaced the narrow winding alleys. The new houses were limited
                    in height, built partly of hard stone, and protected by open spaces and
                    colonnades. The water supply, lastly, was carefully regulated. But there is
                    nevertheless no doubt that this great disaster told against Nero in the popular
                    mind. It was regarded as a direct manifestation of the wrath of the gods, even
                    by those who did not share the current suspicions of the emperor’s guilt. This
                    impression no religious ceremonies, nor even the execution of a number of
                    Christians, hastily pitched upon as convenient scapegoats, could altogether
                    dispel. Nero, however, undeterred by forebodings and rumours, proceeded with the
                    congenial work of repairing the damage inflicted by the flames. In addition to
                    the rebuilding of the streets, he gratified his love of magnificence by the
                    erection of a splendid palace for himself. The wonders of his “golden house”
                    were remembered and talked of long after its partial demolition by Vespasian. It
                    stretched from the Palatine across the low ground, afterwards occupied by the
                    Colosseum, to the Esquiline. Its walls blazed with gold and precious stones;
                    masterpieces of art from Greece adorned its walls; but most marvellous of all
                    were the grounds in which it stood, with their meadows and lakes, their shady
                    woods, and their distant views. To defray the enormous cost, Italy and the
                    provinces, says Tacitus, were ransacked, and in Asia and Achaia especially the
                    rapacity of the imperial commissioners recalled the days of Mummius and of
                    Sulla.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tac., <hi

                    which the provincials had suffered from Nero’s rule, and the discontent it
                    caused helped to weaken his hold over them at the very moment when the growing
                    discontent in Rome was gathering to a head. For early in 65 Nero was
                    panic-stricken amid his pleasures by the discovery of a formidable conspiracy
                    against his life and rule. Such conspiracies, prompted partly by the ambition of
                    powerful nobles and partly by their personal fears, had been of frequent
                    occurrence in the history of the Caesars, and now Nero’s recent excesses, and
                    his declining popularity, seemed to promise well for the success of the plot.
                    Among the conspirators were many who held important posts, or belonged to the
                    innermost circle of Nero’s friends, such as Faenius Rufus, Tigellinus’s
                    colleague in the prefecture of the praetorian guards, Plautius Lateranus, one of
                    the consuls elect, the poet Lucan, and, lastly, not a few of the tribunes and
                    centurions of the praetorian guard itself. Their chosen leader, whom they
                    destined to succeed Nero, was C. Calpurnius Piso, a handsome, wealthy, and
                    popular noble, and a boon companion of Nero himself. The plan was that Nero
                    should be murdered when he appeared as usual at the games in the circus, but the
                    design was frustrated by the treachery of a freedman Milichus, who, tempted by
                    the hope of a large reward, disclosed the whole plot to the emperor. In a frenzy
                    of sudden terror Nero struck right and left among the ranks of the conspirators.
                    Piso was put to death in his own house; and his fall was rapidly followed by the
                    execution of Faenius Rufus, Lucan, and many of their less prominent accomplices.
                    Even Seneca himself, though there seems to have been no evidence of his
                    complicity, could not escape the frantic suspiciousness of the emperor,
                    stimulated as it may have been in his case by the jealousy of Tigellinus and
                    Poppaea. The order for his death reached him in his country house near Rome, and
                    he met his fate with dignity and courage. For the moment Nero felt safe; but,
                    though largesses and thanksgivings celebrated the suppression of the conspiracy,
                    and the dazzling round of games and shows was renewed with even increased
                    splendour, the effects of the shock were visible in the long and dreary list of
                    victims who during the next few months were sacrificed to his restless fears and
                    savage resentment. Conspicuous among them was Paetus Thrasea, whose
                    irreconcilable non-conformity and unbending virtue had long made him distasteful
                    to Nero, and who was now suspected, possibly with reason, of sympathy with the
                    conspirators. The death of Poppaea in the autumn of 65 was probably not lamented
                    by any one but her husband, but the general gloom was deepened by a pestilence,
                    caused, it seems, by the overcrowding at the time of the fire, which decimated
                    the population of the capital. Early, however, in the summer of 66, the visit of
                    the Parthian prince Tiridates to Italy seemed to shed a ray of light over the
                    increasing darkness of Nero’s last years. Corbulo had settled matters
                    satisfactorily in Armenia. The Parthians were gratified by the elevation to the
                    Armenian throne of their king’s brother, and Tiridates, in return, consented to
                    receive his crown from the hands of the Roman emperor. In royal state he
                    travelled to Italy, and at Rome the ceremony of investiture was performed with
                    the utmost splendour. Delighted with this tribute to his greatness, Nero for a
                    moment dreamt of rivalling Alexander, and winning fame as a conqueror.
                    Expeditions were talked of to the shores of the Caspian Sea and against the
                    remote Ethiopians, but Nero was no soldier, and he quickly turned to a more
                    congenial field for triumph. He had long panted for an opportunity of displaying
                    his varied artistic gifts before a worthier and more sympathetic audience than
                    could be found in Rome. With this view he had already, in 64, appeared on the
                    stage before the half-Greek public of Naples. But his mind was now set on
                    challenging the applause of the Greeks themselves in the ancient home of art.
                    Towards the end of 66 he arrived in Greece, accompanied by a motley following of
                    soldiers, courtiers, musicians, and dancers, determined to forget for a time
                    Rome and the irksome affairs of Rome with its conspiracies and intrigues. No
                    episode in Nero’s reign has afforded such plentiful material for the imagination
                    of subsequent writers as his visit to Greece; but, when every allowance is made
                    for exaggeration and sheer invention, it must still be confessed that the
                    spectacle presented was unique.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    professedly as merely an enthusiastic worshipper of Greek art, and a humble
                    candidate for the suffrages of Greek judges. At each of the great festivals,
                    which to please him were for once crowded into a single year, he entered in
                    regular form for the various competitions, scrupulously conformed to the
                    tradition and rules of the arena, and awaited in nervous suspense the verdict of
                    the umpires. The dexterous Greeks, flattered by his genuine enthusiasm, humoured
                    him to the top of his bent. Everywhere the imperial competitor was victorious.
                    Crowns were showered upon him, and crowded audiences importuned him to display
                    his talents. The delighted emperor protested that only <pb break="no"

                    complaisance was rewarded when he left by the bestowal of immunity from the land
                    tax on the whole province, and the gift of the Roman franchise to his
                    appreciative judges, while as a more splendid and lasting memorial of his visit,
                    he planned and actually commenced the cutting of a canal through the Isthmus of
                    Corinth. If we may believe report, Nero found time in the intervals of his
                    artistic triumphs for more vicious excesses. The stories of his mock marriage
                    with Sporus, his execution of wealthy Greeks for the sake of their money, and
                    his wholesale plundering of the temples were evidently part of the accepted
                    tradition about him in the time of Suetonius, and are at least credible. Far
                    more certainly true is his ungrateful treatment of Domitius Corbulo, who, when
                    he landed at Cenchreae, fresh from his successes in Armenia, was met by an order
                    for his instant execution, and at once put an end to his own life.</p>
                <p>But while Nero was revelling in Greece the dissatisfaction with his rule, and the
                    fear and abhorrence excited by his crimes, were rapidly taking the shape of a
                    resolute determination to get rid of him. That movements in this direction were
                    on foot in Rome may be safely inferred from the urgency with which the imperial
                    freedman Helius insisted upon Nero’s return to Italy; but far more serious than
                    any amount of intrigue in Rome was the disaffection which now showed itself in
                    the rich and warlike provinces of the west. In northern Gaul, early in 68, the
                    standard of revolt was raised by Julius Vindex, governor of Gallia Lugdunensis,
                    and himself the head of an ancient and noble Celtic family. South of the
                    Pyrenees, P. Sulpicius Galba, governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, and Poppaea’s
                    former husband, Marcus Salvius Otho, governor of Lusitania, followed Vindex’s
                    example. At first, however, fortune seemed to favour Nero. It is very probable
                    that Vindex had other aims in view than the deposition of Nero and the
                    substitution of a fresh emperor in his place, and that the liberation of
                    northern Gaul from Roman rule was part of his plan.<note anchored="true"

                    the enthusiasm with which the chiefs of northern Gaul rallied to the standard of
                    a leader belonging to their own race, and the opposition which Vindex
                    encountered from the Roman colony of Lugdunum, and from the Roman legions on the
                    Rhine. For it is certain that the latter at any rate were not animated by
                    loyalty to Nero. They encountered Vindex and his Celtic levies at Vesontium
                    (Besançon), and in the battle which followed Vindex was defeated and slain. But
                    the next step of the victorious legionaries was to break the statues of Nero and
                    offer the imperial purple to their own commander Verginius Rufus; and the
                    latter, though he declined their offer, appealed to them to declare for the
                    senate and people of Rome. Meanwhile in Spain Galba had been saluted imperator
                    by his legions, had accepted the title, and was already on his march towards
                    Italy. On the road the news met him that Vindex had been crushed by the army of
                    the Rhine, and for the moment he resolved to abandon his attempt in despair, and
                    even thought of suicide. Had Nero acted with energy he might still have checked
                    the revolt. But he did nothing. He had reluctantly left Greece early in 68, but
                    returned to Italy only to renew his revels. When on March 19 the news reached
                    him at Naples of the rising in Gaul, he allowed a week to elapse before he could
                    tear himself away from his pleasures. When he did at last re-enter Rome, he
                    contented himself with the empty form of proscribing Vindex, and setting a price
                    on his head. In April the announcement that Spain also had revolted, and that
                    the legions in Germany had declared for a republic, terrified him into something
                    like energy. But it was too late. The news from the provinces fanned into flame
                    the smouldering disaffection in Rome. During the next few weeks the senate
                    almost openly intrigued against him, and the populace, once so lavish of their
                    applause, were silent or hostile. Every day brought fresh instances of
                    desertion, and the fidelity of the praetorian sentinels was more than doubtful
                    When finally even the palace guards forsook their posts, Nero despairingly stole
                    out of Rome to seek shelter in a freedman’s villa some four miles off. In this
                    hiding-place he heard of the senate’s proclamation of Galba as emperor, and of
                    the sentence of death passed on himself. On the approach of the horsemen sent to
                    drag him to execution, he collected sufficient courage to save himself by
                    suicide from this final ignominy, and the soldiers arrived only to find the
                    emperor in the agonies of death. Nero died on June 9, 68, in the thirty-first
                    year of his age and the fourteenth of his reign, and his remains were deposited
                    by the faithful hands of Acte in the family tomb of the Domitii on the Pincian
                    Hill. With his death ended the line of the Caesars, and Roman imperialism
                    entered upon a new phase. His statues were broken, his name everywhere erased,
                    and his golden house demolished; yet, in spite of all, no Roman emperor has left
                    a deeper mark upon subsequent tradition. His brief career, with its splendid
                    opening and its tragic close, its fantastic revels and frightful disasters,
                    acquired a firm hold over the imagination of succeeding generations. The Roman
                    populace continued for a long time to reverence his memory as that of an
                    open-handed patron, and in Greece the recollections of his magnificence, and his
                    enthusiasm for art, were still fresh when the traveller Pausanias visited the
                    country a century later. The belief that he had not really died, but would
                    return again to confound his foes, was long prevalent, not only in the remoter
                    provinces, but even in Rome itself; and more than one pretender was able to
                    collect a following by assuming the name of the last of the race of Augustus.
                    More lasting still in its effects was the implacable hatred cherished towards
                    his memory by those who had suffered from his cruelties. Roman literature,
                    faithfully reflecting the sentiments of the aristocratic salons of the capital,
                    while it almost canonized those who had been his victims, fully avenged their
                    wrongs by fainting Nero as a monster of wickedness. In Christian tradition he
                    appears in an even more terrible character, as the mystic Antichrist, who was
                    destined to come once again to trouble the saints. Even in the Middle Ages, Nero
                    is still the very incarnation of splendid iniquity, while the belief lingered
                    obstinately that he had only disappeared fcr a time, and as late as the 11th
                    century his restless spirit was supposed to haunt the slopes of the Pincian
                    Hill.</p>
