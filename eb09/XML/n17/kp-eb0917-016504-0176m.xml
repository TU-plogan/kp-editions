                    seventh among the minor prophets, is entirely directed against Nineveh, and
                    predicts the utter destruction of the bloody and rapacious city, its empire, and
                    its gods by the tardy but sure and irresistible vengeance of Jehovah. The fall
                    of Nineveh is the deliverance of Judah; Jehovah, so terrible to His adversaries,
                    so unfailing in His righteous judgments, is a sure and gracious defender to them
                    that take refuge with Him. It appears therefore that, when the prophet wrote,
                    the Judaeans were still suffering from Assyrian oppression, perhaps even from
                    present or recent invasion, for in i. 15 [ii. 1] he speaks of the annual feasts
                    and the sacrifices of the sanctuary as disturbed by the “ -wicked one” passing
                    through the land. It is not, however, from a merely patriotic standpoint that
                    Nahum regards the Assyrian harlot as Jehovah’s enemy; she is the enemy of
                    mankind, who sells all nations through her witchcrafts and whoredoms—that is, in
                    the strength of her heathenish religion (iii. 4),—and she shall perish with none
                    to pity her, for all have suffered continually from the wickedness of the
                    ruthless empire. The exordium in chap, i., which depicts Jehovah as the jealous
                    and avenging God, is a noble utterance of faith in the righteousness which rules
                    in the world’s history. The other two chapters are entirely occupied with the
                    catastrophe of Nineveh; the battle without and within the walls is described
                    with great poetic force, not in finished pictures but with broad effective
                    strokes and daring imagery, and apparently with some local knowledge, though the
                    latter is hardly so detailed as to justify the conclusion that the prophet had
                    himself seen the imperial city. It might be argued on the same principle that he
                    had also seen No-Ammon or Thebes, a description of the sack of which forms an
                    episode in chap, iii. 8 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> The reference here seems to
                    be to the taking of No by Assurbanipal (G. Smith, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of
                    Assurbanipal,</hi> 55, 70; Schrader, <hi rend="italic">K. A. T.,</hi> 2d ed., p.
                    450) about 660 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> —an event only known from the
                    Assyrian monuments. Nahum must have prophesied after this date, probably not
                    long after, that is, in the troublous times of Manasseh, which agrees well with
                    i. 15. To suppose that his prophecy was occasioned by the actual approach of the
                    Medes to destroy Nineveh, or by one of the earlier campaigns which preceded
                    their final success, is arbitrary; for the judgment is predicted on general
                    principles of divine justice, and there is no indication that the prophet knew
                    what nation was to execute it. His descriptions, though pictorially vivid, are
                    historically quite vague. The details of the decadence of the Assyrian empire
                    are in truth so obscure that to search for the immediate occasion of the
                    prophecy is mere guesswork.</p>

                    Jerome's mention of a ruined “viculus Elcesi” in Galilee stands quite alone;
                    Hitzig supports the idea that the prophet was a Galilaean by the name Capernaum,
                    which probably means “village of Nahum,” but of what Nahum we do not know. The
                    confused account by R. Jos. Schwarz (Z&gt;. <hi rend="italic">Heil. Land,</hi>
                    p. 149) of a grave shown as that of the prophet Nahum an hour north of Tiberias
                    lacks confirmation. Internal evidence leads us rather to conclude that Nahum was
                    a man of Judah, and John vii. 52 appears to show that he was n.ot held to be a
                    Galilaean in the time of Christ, when the fashion of localizing tombs of
                    prophets was already in full force (Matt, xxiii. 29). Later tradition associated
                    Nahum with the region against which he prophesied, and in the 12th century
                    Benjamin of Tudela visited his synagogue at Mosul and his tomb in Babylonia. It
                    was probably under Christian influence that the site of this tomb was ultimately
                    fixed at Alkôsh, the seat of the later Nestorian patriarchs, near the convent of
                    Rabban Hormizd, a few miles north of Mosul, where it is now reverenced by
                    Christians, Moslems, and Jews. The sepulchre is a simple plaster box without
                    signs of antiquity (Layard, <hi rend="italic">Nineveh,</hi> i. 233). The history
                    of this identification of Elkosh is obscure; it is mentioned in the 16th century
                    by Masius (ap. Assemani, <hi rend="italic">B. O.,</hi> i. 525), as also in two
                    Nestorian MSS. written at Alkôsh by the same scribe in 1709 (Wright, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cat.,</hi> 1068) and 1713 (Assem., iii. i. 352); it seems,
                    moreover, to be implied in a gloss of Bar Ali, given by Payne Smith <hi
                    rend="italic">(Thes. Syr.,</hi> 221), but not in Hoffmann’s edition. On the
                    other hand no very early notice either of the tomb or of the place has yet been
                    found. Alkôsh, but not the Nahum legend, is mentioned in a poem of the 11th
                    century in Cardahi, <hi rend="italic">Liber Thesaτιri</hi> (Rome, 1875); the
                    same author places one Israel of Alkôsh in the 8th century, but the date is
                    questionable (see Nöldeke in <hi rend="italic">Z. D. Μ. G.,</hi> xxxi. 165). The
                    grave is undoubtedly a fabrication, and the evidence is not favourable to
                    Ewald’s conjecture that the name is ancient and the place really the city of
                    Nahum. His further conjecture that some difficult words in Nahum may be Assyrian
                    has not been confirmed by students of the inscriptions.</p>
