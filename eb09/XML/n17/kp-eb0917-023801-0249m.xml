                    (1758-1840), portrait and landscape painter, was born in Edinburgh on September
                    9, 1758. He studied at the Trustees’ Academy under Runciman, and, having been
                    apprenticed as an heraldic painter to a coachbuilder, he, at the age of sixteen,
                    attracted the attention of Allan Ramsay, who took the youth with him to London,
                    and employed him upon the subordinate portions of his works. Nasmyth returned to
                    Edinburgh in 1778, and was soon largely patronized as a portrait painter. He
                    also assisted Mr Miller of Dalswinton, as draughtsman, in his mechanical
                    researches and experiments; and, this gentleman having generously offered the
                    painter a loan to enable him to pursue his studies abroad, he left in 1782 for
                    Italy, where he remained two years.</p>
                <p>On his return he painted the excellent portrait of Burns, now in the Scottish
                    National Gallery, so well known through Walker’s engraving. Political feeling at
                    that time ran high in Edinburgh, and Nasmyth’s pronounced Liberal opinions,
                    which he was too outspoken and sincere to disguise, gave offence to many of his
                    aristocratic patrons, and led to the diminution of his practice as a
                    portraitist. In his later years, accordingly, he devoted himself mainly to
                    landscape work, and did not disdain on occasion to set his hand to
                    scene-painting for the theatres. He has been styled, not unjustly, the “father
                    of Scottish landscape art.” His subjects are carefully finished and coloured,
                    but are wanting in boldness and freedom. Nasmyth was also largely employed by
                    noblemen throughout the country in the improving and beautifying of their
                    estates, in which his fine taste rendered him especially skilful; and he was
                    known as an architect, having designed the Dean Bridge, Edinburgh, and the
                    graceful circular temple covering St Bernard’s Well, which stands near it.
                    Nasmyth died in his native city on 10th April 1840. His youngest son, James, is
                    the w <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> ell-known inventor of the steam-hammer. His
                    six daughters all attained a certain local reputation as artists, but it was in
                    his eldest son, Patrick, that the artistic skill of his family was most
                    powerfully developed. For an interesting account of the Nasmyth family see James
