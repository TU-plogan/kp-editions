                <p><label type="entry">NIGER</label>, one of the most famous of African rivers, has
                    its headwaters on the north side of the mountains (known as Kong Mountains and
                    by various other local names) which run parallel with the coast of Upper Guinea
                    and Sierra Leone at a distance of about 200 miles, flows northeastward as far as
                    17° 30' N. lat. and the meridian of Greenwich, and then turning south-eastward
                    reaches the Gulf of Guinea after a total course of about 2600 miles. The main
                    stream bears in different districts a great variety of names—Joliba (Dholiba or
                    Dialiba), Kworra (Quorra), Mayo, Kaki ’n ruwa, &amp;c.; and the same is true of
                    the great eastern confluent the Benue, Shary or Tchadda.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These last two names really belong to another
                    river which discharges into Lake Chad, Tchad, or Tsad.</p></note> (For other

                    name for the whole river system, and to call the main stream the Kworra and the
                    confluent the Benue.</p>
                <p>Of the many headwaters which go to form the upper Kworra, the Tamincono, Falico,
                    and Tembi are the most important; and, as the largest of these, the Tembi, rises
                    in the Loma Mountains in 8° 36' N. lat. and 10° 33' W. long., this may be
                    considered the true position of the long-sought source of the Niger. The Falico
                    rises in 8° 45' N. lat. and 10° 25' W. long.; the Tamincono, of much less
                    significance, about 60 miles farther north. A narrow watershed separates these
                    headstreams from the headstreams of the Rokelle, which flows west through Sierra
                    Leone. At Farannah (now destroyed), in 10° N. lat., the river is about 100 yards
                    wide, and taking its Mandingo name of Joliba (or Great River) bends eastwards.
                    From the source of the Tembi to Kuruassa, where Caillié crossed in June 1825,
                    and found it 9 feet deep, the course of the river (nearly 300 miles) has not
                    been followed by any European; but the general character of the next 60 or 70
                    miles, down to Bora, is known because Caillié’s route skirted the eastern bank.
                    Below that point there is another unexplored stretch. At Bammako, after the
                    junction of the Milo, the Bating or Bafi (Black River), the Fan- <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0538-0497"/> dube, &amp;c., the depth is 6 feet, with a
                    breadth of 1300 feet. About 7 or 8 miles farther down the Sotuba rocks mark the
                    end of what may be regarded as the upper Kworra. Even in this section the stream
                    is probably navigable in small boats all the way from the union of the
                    headstreams to Sotuba. From Bammako begins a more rapid deflexion towards the
                    east, and it is not till the Mahel Balevel, a very important tributary, joins in
                    that a more directly northward direction is resumed. For several hundred miles
                    below this confluence the Kworra shows a great tendency to split into different
                    channels, often enclosing extensive tracts of country in their meshes, and
                    turning whole provinces into a perfect labyrinth of creeks, backwaters, and
                    lagoons. Kabara, the port of Timbuktu, is situated on one of the secondary
                    branches; but the main channel, at no great distance, is about a mile across. At
                    times the river rises so that boats can approach the walls of the city proper;
                    and in 1640 an exceptional inundation turned the central and lowest quarter into
                    a lake. The swamps and side-creeks continue to the east of Timbuktu, and, though
                    at Bamba (130 miles) the river is shut in by steep banks and narrows to 600 or
                    700 yards, it again spreads out for some distance farther down. At Tahont ’n
                    eggish (Entrance Rock), however, a great change is observed, the banks beginning
                    to be rocky and the channel definite; and at Tosaye the width is reduced to not
                    more than 150 yards, and the depth is enormously increased. At Burrum the valley
                    again widens out to about 3 miles, and tracts of level ground, swamps, or sandy
                    downs skirt the river on both sides. A ledge of rocks runs right across the
                    stream at Tazori; about 1500 yards below a passage is forced between two masses
                    30 or 40 feet high; and at Tiborawen there is a very labyrinth of rapids and
                    divided creeks. In the neighbourhood of Birni the hills close in so as to form a
                    kind of defile, but at Say the Kworra is again a noble stream about 700 yards in
                    breadth, with rocky banks 20 to 30 feet high on the one side and a comparatively
                    flat country on the other. Between Say (Barth’s southmost point) and Gompa
                    (Flegel’s northmost) the distance of 60 or 70 miles is practically unknown, and
                    forms the only complete break in the delineation of the river from Bammako. At
                    Gompa lies the mouth of the Gubbi ’n Gundi, a left hand tributary which brings
                    down the waters of the Mayo (Mao) Kebbi or river of Sokoto, the Mayo Ranco, the
                    Gubbi ’n Rimi, and other streams from the north-east and south. Between Yauri
                    (100 miles farther down) and Bussa or Bussan (60 miles) the Kworra is often
                    interrupted by rocks and islands, and below Bussa, where Park lost his life,
                    these obstructions increase so that a distance of 10 or 12 miles cannot be
                    passed by canoes, at least in November. The islands are occupied by considerable
                    villages. Just where the direction of the course turns eastward, a curious rock,
                    Mount Ketsa (Kesa or Kisey of Lander), rises in mid. channel to a height of 300
                    feet. At Rabba (130 miles below Bussa) the width of the stream is about 2 miles,
                    and opposite the town lies the low and populous island of Zagozhi. About 60
                    miles farther down is the mouth of the left hand tributary the Kadina, which
                    passes near the important town of Bida (Crowther, 1857).</p>
                <p>In 7° 50' N. lat. and 6° 45' E. long., the Kworra is joined by the Benue or Binue
                    (“Mother of Waters” in the Batta tongue). This magnificent confluent rises in
                    Adamaua a little to the north of Ngaundere (Ngamdere of the Houssas), about 7°
                    10' N. lat. and 13° 20' E. long., at a height of between 3000 and 5000 feet
                    above the sea, and in the early part of its course it is separated by a narrow
                    waterparting from the headstreams of the Logone or Serbewel, which probably
                    flows eastward to Lake Chad. For the first 100 miles of its course it remains a
                    rocky mountain stream, but after the junction (at about 800 feet above the sea)
                    of the Mayo Kebbi (itself probably navigable to Dawa in the Tuburi country, and
                    there possibly forming a bifurcation between the basins of the Niger and Lake
                    Tchad) it takes a western direction and becomes navigable for boats drawing 4
                    feet of water. For some 40 miles below Ribago (Reborn)—the farthest point
                    reached by exploration upward—the Benue has an average width of 180 to 200
                    yards, and flows with a strong steady current, although a broad strip of country
                    on each side is swampy or submerged. Below the junction of the Faro the width
                    increases to 1000 or 1500 yards, and, though it narrows at the somewhat
                    dangerous rapids of Rumde Gilla to 150 or 180, it soon expands again. It flows
                    onwards with comparatively unobstructed current through a beautiful country, its
                    valley marked out for the most part by ranges of hills, and its banks
                    diversified with forests, villages, and cultivated tracts. (See Crowther in <hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc.,</hi> 1877; Hutchinson, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ibid.,</hi> 1880; Flegel in <hi rend="italic">Petermanrts Mitth.,</hi>
                    1880.)</p>
                <p>At their confluence the Kworra is about f mile broad and the Benue rather more
                    than a mile. The united stream is like a lake about 2 miles in width, dotted
                    with islands and sandbanks; and the peninsula at the junction is low, swampy,
                    and intersected by numerous channels. From this point the course of the Niger is
                    well known. As far south as Iddah or Idah, a town on the east bank, it rushes
                    through a deep valley cut between the hills, the sandstone cliffs at some places
                    rising 150 feet high. Between Iddah and Onitsha (destroyed by British gunboats
                    in 1879), 80 miles, the banks are lower and the country flatter, and to the
                    south of Onitsha the whole land is laid under water during the annual floods.
                    From this point, consequently, may be said to begin the great delta of the
                    Niger, which, extending along the coast for about 120 miles, and 140 or 150
                    miles inland, forms one of the most remarkable of all the swampy regions of
                    Africa. The river soon breaks up into an intricate network of channels, dividing
                    and subdividing, and intercrossing not only with each other but with the
                    branches of other streams that drain the neighbouring coast, so that it is
                    practically impossible to say where the Niger delta ends and another river
                    system begins. Westwards the anastomosis probably extends to the lagoons at
                    Lagos, and eastwards to the Old Calabar or Cross River. Hitherto the channel
                    almost regularly followed is the Rio Nun, a direct continuation of the line of
                    the undivided river. From the sea the only indication of a river mouth is a
                    break in the dark green mangroves which here universally fringe the coast. The
                    crossing of the bar requires considerable care, and at ebb tide the outward
                    current runs 5 J knots per hour. For the first 20 miles (or as far as Sunday
                    Island, the limit of the sea tide in the dry season), dense lines of mangroves
                    40, 50, or 60 feet in height shut in the channel, so that nothing is visible
                    save a narrow strip of sky overhead; then palm and other trees begin to appear,
                    and. the widening river has regular banks; and before long little villages and
                    plantations of plantains and sugar-cane show that even in this region of miasma
                    and mud human beings find means to exist.</p>
                <p>As the Kworra and the Benue have quite different gathering grounds they are not
                    in flood at the same time. The upper Kworra rises in June as the result of the
                    tropical rains, and decreases in December, its breadth at Turella expanding from
                    between 2000 and 2500 feet to not less than 1⅜ miles. The middle Kworra,
                    however, reaches its maximum near Timbuktu only in January; in February and
                    March it sinks slowly above the narrows of Tinsherifen (Tosaye), and more
                    rapidly below them, the level being kept up by supplies from backwaters and
                    lakes; and by April there is a decrease of about 5 feet. In August the channel
                    near Timbuktu is again navigable owing to rain in the Wangara highlands. The
                    Benue reaches its greatest heis⅛t in August or September, begins to fall <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n539/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0539-0498"/> in October, falls rapidly in November, and slowly
                    in the next three months, and reaches its lowest in March and April, when it is
                    fordable in many places, has no perceptible flow, and at the confluence begins
                    to be covered with the water-weed <hi rend="italic">Pistia Stratiotes.</hi> The
                    flood rises with great rapidity, and reaches 50, 60, or even 75 feet above the
                    low-water mark. The two confluents being so unlike, the united Niger differs
                    from each under the influence of the other. Here the river is at its lowest in
                    April and May; in June it is subject to great fluctuations; about the middle of
                    August it usually begins to rise; and its maximum is reached in September. In
                    October it sinks, often rapidly. A slight rise in January, known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">yangbe,</hi> is occasioned by water from the Kworra. Between high
                    and low water-mark the difference is as much as 35 feet.</p>
                <p>As a highway of commerce the Niger has been little used, trading steamers having
                    mainly confined their operations to the river below the confluence. But since
                    1857 the area of supply has been considerably extended, the quantity of goods
                    (chiefly oil and shea butter) collected has greatly increased, and steamers five
                    or six times the size of the vessels formerly used have been introduced. The
                    delta region has become more populous, and trading posts more frequent. The
                    Church Missionary Society, which, except the British Government, has done more
                    than any other agency for opening up the lower Niger, has stations at four
                    places on the coast, at Osamare (120 miles inland), Onitsha (20 miles farther),
                    Lokoja (90 miles), Kipo Hill, Egan (90 miles), Shonga (94 miles farther, and
                    only 12 or 15 short of Rabba). Lokoja is near the site of the experimental farm
                    maintained by the Government for some years from 1841.</p>
                <p>Pliny mentions a river Nigris of the same nature with the Nile separating Africa
                    and Ethiopia, and forming the boundary of Gaetulia; and it is not improbable
                    that this is, in fact, the same with the modern Niger. In Ptolemy, too, appears
                    along with Gir a certain Nigir (Niγeφ) as one of the largest rivers of the
                    interior; but so vague is his description that, while D’Anville and Leake
                    strongly maintain that this, also, is the Niger, Walckenaer and Vivien St Martin
                    insist on the negative view, and Mr Bunbury is almost inclined to follow them.
                    When the Arabian geographers became acquainted with the river near Timbuktu they
                    called it the Nile of the Negroes, and down to the present century European
                    authorities (such as Jackson in his <hi rend="italic">Empire of Morocco,</hi>
                    1800) fought zealously for the identity of this Nile with the river of
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>The following dates show the progressive exploration of the river. 1788.
                    Formation of the African Association in England. 1795. Mungo Park (African
                    Association) saw the Niger near Sego “glittering in the morning sun as broad as
                    the Thames at Westminster, and flowing slowly to the eastward.” In this first
                    expedition he went down the river as far as Sella and up as far as Bammako; in
                    his second he sailed down to Bussa, where he was drowned. Park adopted the
                    opinion that the Niger and the Congo were one. Major Peddie’s expedition to the
                    Niger, and Tuckey’s expedition to the Congo, threw no light on the relation of
                    the rivers. 1802. Reichard, a German, suggested that the Rio Formoso was the
                    mouth of the Niger. 1822. Laing learned that the sources of the Niger lay not
                    far from Sulima. 1826. Caillié sailed down the river from Jenne to the port of
                    Timbuktu. Clapperton and Richard Lander visited Bussa. 1830. Richard and John
                    Lander passed down from Yauri to the mouth of the Rio Nun, thus settling the
                    doubt as to the outlet of the river. 1832. Macgregor Laird established the
                    African Steamship Company, and Richard Lander and Oldfield (as members of its
                    first expedition) ascended the Niger to Rabba and the Benue (or, as it was then
                    called, the Shary or Tchadda) as far as Dagbo (80 miles). 1840. Consul Beecroft
                    ascended beyond Rabba in the “Ethiope.” 1841. An expedition, consisting of three
                    steamers of the royal navy, under Captain (afterwards Admiral) H. D. Trotter,
                    went up to Egga (Egam), but was forced to return owing to sickness and
                    mortality. 1851. Barth crossed the Benue at the junction of the Faro, and
