                <p><label type="entry">NEWCASTLE, or in full</label>, for the sake of distinction,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Newcastle-upon-Tyne,</hi> a city (with the constitution of
                    a county), municipal and parliamentary borough, markettown, and seaport in the
                    county of Northumberland, England, is situated on the north bank of the river
                    Tyne, 8 miles above its mouth, and on the main line of the North-Eastern
                    Railway, 275 miles north of London and 70 east of Carlisle. Some of the streets
                    in the older portion of the town along the river side are narrow and steep, and
                    still contain several of the quaint gable-fronted houses of the time of
                    Elizabeth. The business portions of the town—principally erected from the plans
                    of Richard Grainger—are characterized generally by spacious streets with
                    imposing buildings and fine shops: and in the northern and western suburbs there
                    are numerous terraces and villas inhabited by the wealthier classes. The
                    important town of <hi rend="smallcaps">Gateshead</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.υ.),</hi> on the south side of the river, is connected with Newcastle by
                    three bridges—a high level bridge, an hydraulic swing bridge, and a suspension
                    bridge. The high level bridge has been already described (see vol. iv. p. 337).
                    The hydraulic swing bridge, on the low level a little farther down the river,
                    was built to replace a stone structure erected in 1781 on the site of a bridge
                    dating from 1250, and destroyed by a flood in 1771. The Roman bridge, the Pons
                    Aelii, probably built by the emperor Hadrian, is said to have spanned the river
                    at the same point. The hydraulic bridge was begun in 1868, and opened for
                    traffic 15th June 1876, at a cost of about &lt;£200,000. It consists of one
                    large centre pier, two midstream piers, and two abutments; and its foundations
                    are iron cylinders resting on the solid rock, 60 feet below the bed of the
                    river. Two spans, which open simultaneously by machines impelled by steam, allow
                    103 feet of waterway for vessels going up and down the river. About half a mile
                    farther up the stream is the Redheugh bridge, commenced in 1867, and opened in
                    1871 at a cost of £40,000.</p>
                <p>Newcastle is well supplied with public parks and recreation grounds. To the north
                    of the city is the Leazes ornamental park of 35 acres, and beyond this the town
                    moor and racecourse, an extensive common, the survival of the pasture land of
                    the township. Eastward from the. town moor is Brandling Park. The picturesque
                    grounds of Armstrong Park to the north-east of the city extend to about 50
                    acres, the larger half of which was presented by Sir W. G. Armstrong, who also
                    has presented the beautifully wooded grounds of Jesmond Dene. Elswick Parkin the
                    south-west of the city, extending to 8f acres, and including Elswick Hall, was
                    purchased by the corporation and opened as a recreation ground in November
                    1878.</p>
                <p>The earliest artificial method of water supply for Newcastle was by pipes of
                    elmwood from Heworth and from springs about 3 miles north of the town. In 1845 a
                    water company was formed to supply the town with water from Whittle Dene. The
                    reservoirs of the company have been extended from time to time, and the water of
                    various other streams utilized to meet the increasing necessities of the town.
                    The gas supply is also in the hands of a company.</p>
                <p>Of the old walls of the town, which, according to Leland, “for strength and
                    magnificence far surpassed all the walls of the cities of England and of most of
                    the towns of Europe,” and the circuit of which was 2 miles 239 yards, there
                    still remain some towers in good preservation, although the fortifications were
                    allowed to go into disrepair after the union of Scotland and England. The
                    castle, from which the town takes its name, stood on a slight elevation rising
                    abruptly from the river, and was erected by Henry II. between 1172 and 1177 on
                    the site of an older structure built in 1080 by Robert eldest son of the
                    Conqueror. It was originally the strongest fortress in the north of England, and
                    its keep is now one of the finest specimens of the Norman stronghold remaining
                    in the country. While it was still incomplete, William the Lion was led within
                    its walls after his capture at Alnwick; and within its great hall Baliol, on
                    26th December 1292, did homage for the crown of Scotland to Edward I. The area
                    of the castle within its outer walls and fosse was 3 acres*. Fragments of these
                    walls, with the principal entrance or Blackgate (portions of which are, however,
                    of later construction), and the Watergate or southern postern, still remain, but
                    the inner wall surrounding the keep has been entirely removed. The massive keep,
                    with walls 14 feet thick, is in a state of good preservation, as is also the
                    chapel, a beautiful specimen of the Late Norman style, for some time used as the
                    cellar of a public house. The castle was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n395/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0395-0378"/> purchased by the corporation in 1809 for
                    &lt;£600, and is now under the charge of the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries,
                    who have fitted up a portion of it as an antiquarian museum. Near the castle is
                    St Nicholas church, now forming the cathedral of the diocese of Newcastle
                    (instituted in 1882). The church, which is principally Decorated, consists of
                    nave, aisles, chancel, and transepts, the total length of the interior from east
                    to west being 245 feet, and the width at the transepts 128 feet. The principal
                    feature of the church is the lantern tower, a later addition and a very fine
                    specimen of Early Perpendicular. The church has been frequently repaired, and
                    underwent extensive renovation (1873-76) at a cost of &lt;£30,000. Among other
                    interesting old churches is St Andrew’s church, erected in the 11th century,
                    principally Norman, with a low square tower and a peal of six bells. During the
                    siege by the Parliamentary army in 1644 it was greatly damaged. St John’s church
                    is a stone building of the 14th century with an ancient font. Of the nine
                    conventual buildings at one time existing in Newcastle or its immediate
                    neighbourhood, a few fragments of the monastery of the Black Friars still
                    remain, and the chapel of the hospital of St Mary at Jesinond forms a
                    picturesque ruin.</p>
                <p>The most important public buildings are the corporation buildings, including a
                    large public hall, and a corn exchange, erected (1863) at a cost of
                    &lt;£100,000; the guildhall, originally a hospital called the Maison de Dieu,
                    and afterwards used as “the stately court of merchant adventurers,” re-erected
                    in 1658; the moot-hall (1810) for the meetings of assizes and sessions and the
                    transaction of county business; the exchange (1860); the central news-room and
                    art gallery (1838); the assembly-rooms</p>
                <p>(1774, re-erected 1876); the barracks (1806); the market (1835); the central
                    railway station, opened 1849, at a cost of &lt;£130,000; the police courts
                    (1874); the general post office (1876); the Wood memorial hall (1870), used for
                    the meetings of the North of England Institute of Engineers; the custom-house;
                    the theatre royal; Trinity house, with a chapel dating from 1491; and the
                    (branch) Bank of England.</p>
                <p>The Grey monument in Grey Street, an Ionic column surmounted by a statue of Earl
                    Grey, was erected in 1836 to commemorate the passing of the Reform Bill; the
                    Stephenson monument near the railway station was erected in 1862.</p>
                <p>The principal educational establishments are the colleges of medicine and of
                    physical science, affiliated to the university of Durham; the royal free grammar
                    school, founded in 1525, and rebuilt by the town council in 1870 out of the
                    funds of the hospital of St Mary; the school of science and art in connexion
                    with South Kensington, opened in 1879; and Allan’s endowed schools, founded in
                    1705, and reorganized by the charity commissioners in 1877. Among the clubs and
                    similar institutions are the Literary and Philosophical Society, founded in
                    1793, possessing buildings erected in 1825 at a cost of £16,000; the Society of
                    Antiquaries, founded in 1813, with a museum in the castle; the Natural History
                    Society; the Tyneside Naturalists’ Club, established in 1846; the Mechanics’
                    Institution, 1824; the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers, 1852; the
                    Fine Arts Society; the Farmers’ Club; the Northern Counties Club; the Union
                    Club; and the University Club. There is a public library and news-room, erected
                    at a cost of £20,000. The benevolent institutions include the infirmary
                    (originally founded in 1751 and enlarged in 1801 and 1851), the dispensary
                    (1777), the fever house (1803), the lying-in hospital (1760), the eye infirmary
                    (1822), Trinity almshouses (1492), the hospital of the Holy Jesus (1682), the

                    penitentiary (1831), the Royal Victoria asylum for the blind (1838), the
                    Northern Counties institution for the deaf and dumb(1839), the Northern Counties
                    female orphan institution, and the Philipson memorial orphanage for boys
                    (1876).</p>
                <p>Newcastle owes its prosperity to its convenient situation on a tidal river, and
                    to the immense stores of coal in the neighbourhood, which, besides being largely
                    exported, have stimulated a great .variety of industries which are dependent on
                    their use. It began to export coal about the end of the 13th century, but the
                    trade received a severe check by the Act of Edward I. which made the burning of
                    it in London a capital offence. In the reign of Edward III. licence was granted
                    to the inhabitants “to dig coals and stones in the common soil of the town
                    without the walls thereof in the place called the Castle Field and the Forth.”
                    North and South Shields are both important ports at the mouth of the Tyne, and
                    the whole of the river to about 10 miles from its mouth is lined on both sides
                    with quays, shipbuilding yards, chemical works, furnaces, and numerous
                    manufactories. The quay in front of the town, extending from the hydraulic
                    bridge to the Ouseburn, forms a fine thoroughfare of about a mile in length; and
                    by means of dredging a depth of water has been obtained at the shore permitting
                    vessels of large tonnage to approach, although the berths of the ocean steamers
                    are a little farther down the river. The quay is supplied with the most improved
                    mechanical appliances, and by a double line of rails has direct communication
                    with the North-Eastern Railway.</p>
                <p>In 1853 the number of sailing vessels in the coasting trade that entered with
                    cargoes was 2132 of 164,440 tons, cleared 11,172 of 1,502,813 tons; of
                    steamers—entered 399 of 81,886 tons, cleared 429 of 97,154 tons. In the same
                    year, in the foreign and colonial trade, the entrances with cargoes were 2555
                    sailing vessels of 350,190 tons, and 70 steamers of 17,243 tons; the clearances
                    5396 sailing vessels of 864,291 tons, and 70 steamers of 17,243 tons. In the
                    annual statement of the shipping of the United Kingdom for 1882 the returns for
                    the coasting trade are not given for Newcastle separately; but for the Tyne
                    ports, which include, in addition to Newcastle, North and South Shields, the
                    numbers were—entered with cargoes and in ballast 10,152 of 3,377,108 tons,
                    cleared 8214 of 2,361,248 tons. The following table gives similar details of the
                    foreign and colonial trade of the Tyne ports for the same year :—</p>

                <p>In 1878 the value of the imports of foreign and colonial merchandise for
                    Newcastle was £5,367,931, and for the whole Tyne ports £6,540,359; in 1882 the
                    values were £7,650,085 and £9,028,925 respectively. The value of the exports of
                    the produce of the United Kingdom for Newcastle in 1878 was £3,712,899, and in
                    1882 £4,597,700,—the value for the whole Tyne ports being £4,128,227 in 1878,
                    and £5,337,983 for 1882. Besides coal, which is brought down the river in broad
                    boats called keels, and of which 4,557,277 tons left Newcastle by sea in 1882,
                    the principal exports are coke, iron, machinery, chemicals, alkali, glass,
                    hardware, earthenware, and pig and sheet lead. The imports include various ores
                    and chemical substances, timber, corn, provisions, and cattle. There is regular
                    steam communication with the principal British ports, the Baltic ports, Norway,
                    Montreal, and New York. The number of vessels built at Newcastle in 1882 for
                    British owners was 75 of 85,121 tons, of which 68 with a tonnage of 82,468 were
                    iron, and 3 with a tonnage of 1785 were steel. In the same year there were built
                    for foreigners 25 ships of 27,102 tons burden. The principal other industrial
                    establishments of the town and neighbourhood are engineering and machinery
                    shops, ordnance works, including the well-known Armstrong factory at Elswick,
                    alkali manufactories, sheet and plate glass works, bottle works, stained glass
                    works, potteries for earthenware, coachbuilding yards, hat factories, chemical
                    works, sail, cable, and anchor works, and manufactories of nails, files, and
                    spades and shovels. Within the present century the population of Newcastle has
                    more than quadrupled. In 1781 the houses numbered 2389, with an estimated
                    population of 30,000. The census of 1801 gave the number of houses as 3141 and
                    the population as 28,294; the numbers in 1821 were 4031 and 35,181; in 1871 they
                    were 16,460 and 128,443; and in 1881 they had increased to 20,264 and 145,359.
                    The number of males in 1881 was 71,100, and of females 74,259. The area of the
                    municipal and parliamentary borough is 5371 acres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Newcastle owes its origin to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pons</hi><hi rend="italic">Aelii</hi> mentioned above. The most
                    important relics of Roman occupation are a well in the centre of the buildings
                    of the old castle, a mutilated statue of Hercules and a figure of Mercury
                    preserved in the castle, numerous coins, altars, and various specimens of Roman
                    pottery. The foundations of the old Roman bridge, with the remains of the piers,
                    were discovered during the dredging operations after the destruction of the old
                    wooden bridge in 1771. On account of its position as a fortified town affording
                    protection to the inhabitants of the monasteries of Tynemouth, Jarrow,
                    Lindisfarne, and Wearmouth, Newcastle was known in early times as Monkceastre or
                    Monkchester; along with these monasteries it was ravaged by the Danes, who
                    massacred the monks and nuns within its walls. After the union of the kingdom
                    under Egbert it continued till the Conquest to be the residence of the earls of
                    Westmoreland and Northumberland. The town was destroyed by William the Conqueror
                    in 1068, after he had defeated Edgar Atheling and Malcolm of Scotland on
                    Gateshead Fell, but in 1080 a fortress was reared at it by Robert Courthose,
                    eldest son of the Conqueror, which, in contradistinction to the old fortress,
                    was named Newcastle, and formed the nucleus of the present town, burgesses being
                    gathered round the fortress to defend the country against the Scots. After the
                    conspiracy of the barons under Earl Mowbray the town was stormed and taken by
                    William Rufus in 1095. After the death of Henry I. it was seized by the Scots
                    under David, and it remained in their possession until 1157, when it was
                    restored by treaty to Henry II., who established at it a mint. The town was,
                    under the three Edwards, the chief rendezvous of troops for the invasion of
                    Scotland. In the reign of Edward I. it was surrounded by walls, after which it
                    withstood attempts of the Scots to capture it in 1322, 1342, and 1389. In 1640
                    it was taken by the Scottish Covenanters under Leslie, who held it for a year,
                    and are said to have destroyed most of the public documents. After the battle of
                    Marston Moor it was besieged and taken by the Scots in October 1644, from which
                    time it was held by the Parliament till the close of the war. When Charles gave
                    himself up to the Scottish army at Newark-upon-Trent, they took him to
                    Newcastle, where he remained in their hands until, on the 28th January 1647, he
                    was delivered up to the Parliament.</p>
                <p>Newcastle is a borough by prescription, and was first incorporated by Henry II.
                    In the reign of Henry III. the government was vested in a mayor chosen by the
                    burgesses, in lieu of a provost appointed by the crown. In 1400 it obtained a
                    charter from Henry IV. constituting it a county in itself, with lord-lieutenant,
                    sheriff, and magistrates of its own. Its privileges were confirmed and extended
                    by Queen Elizabeth in 1589. Though it still retains the constitution of a
                    county, the old corporation was dissolved by the Municipal Act of 1835, and the
                    government vested in a mayor, sixteen aidermen, and forty-eight town
                    councillors. Since 1282 it has returned two members to parliament. The gross
                    estimated rental of the borough in 1871 was £457,868, and the rateable value
                    £402,030; in 1882 these were £803,961 and £714,470.</p>
