                    captain of his regiment. He was aide-decamp to General Lamarque in March 1793,
                    and soon after became lieutenant-colonel, when Kléber perceived his eminent
                    military ability, and made him adjutantgeneral in August 1794. He was promoted
                    colonel in September, and his merits were so great that Jourdan and Kléber
                    actually quarrelled which should have the advantage of his services. In February
                    1795 he might have become general of brigade, but modestly refused the rank,
                    alleging his own unworthiness. He commanded the advanced guard of Kléber at the
                    battle of Altenkirchen, and was made general of brigade on the field of
                    Forchheim. He then commanded the right wing of Hoche’s army, and in 1798 took
                    Mannheim. Sent next to Switzerland, he there reorganized Masséna’s cavalry, and
                    immensely distinguished himself in Masséna’s great campaign, in which he was
                    three times wounded, and after which he was made general of division. In 1799 he
                    commanded on the Rhine, and by his skilful operations obtained the armistice
                    during which the coup d’état of Brumaire took place. In 1801 he was present at
                    Hohenlinden, and in May 1802 he married Mademoiselle Auguié, whom Josephine had
                    chosen for him at Bonaparte’s request. He became inspectorgeneral of cavalry,
                    and, after a short residence as minister in Switzerland, commandant of the camp
                    of Montreuil. It was while there that in the name of the army he begged Napoleon
                    to declare himself emperor, and on the establishment<pb break="no"

                    grand cross of the Legion of Honour. In 1805 he commanded the 6th corps of the
                    grand army, and by his victory at Elchingen, for which he was made duke of
                    Elchingen, secured the surrender of General Mack at Ulm. He was then ordered to
                    the upper Adige, and missed the battle of Austerlitz, but was present at Jena
                    and Eylau, and was so instrumental in winning the battle of Friedland that
                    Napoleon called him the <hi rend="italic">brave des braves,</hi> and gave him
                    the grand eagle of the Legion of Honour. In 1808 he was ordered to Spain with
                    the 6th corps, and received the command of Galicia, which he managed to keep in
                    subjection to the French in spite of the mountainous nature of the country. In
                    1810, in command of a corps d’armée under Masséna, he advanced into Portugal,
                    but he was so disgusted at being under Masséna’s command that perpetual quarrels
                    resulted, and not only were the French defeated at Busaco, but Ney, when
                    conducting the last column on the retreat from Torres Vedras, received more than
                    one repulse from Lord Wellington at Pombal, Redinha, and Foz d’Aronce. For his
                    opposition to Masséna Ney was recalled from Spain, but received the command of
                    the 3d corps in the grand army of 1812. At the battle of the Moskva he so
                    distinguished himself that he was made Prince de la Moskowa on the field, and in
                    the disastrous retreat from Moscow it was Ney who commanded the rear-guard, and
                    kept the relics of the grand army together. He served at Lützen and Leipsic, and
                    in the last defensive campaign of 1814, and with Macdonald remained faithful to
                    Napoleon to the last. At the Restoration he was made a peer, and in 1815 was
                    given the command of the army sent to check Napoleon on escaping from Elba. But
                    the sight of the old colours and of his old master was too much for him, and he
                    led his troops over to Napoleon’s side. In the Flemish campaign he fought the
                    battle of Quatre Bras against the English on the same day that Napoleon defeated
                    the Prussians at Ligny, and at Waterloo he commanded in person the last charge
                    of the Old Guard. He made no attempt to leave France, and was arrested as a
                    traitor; on December 5 he was found guilty of high treason by the House of Peers
                    by 169 votes to 17, and two days later he was shot in the gardens of the
                    Luxembourg. His execution caused a cry of horror; while no one would have
                    regretted the death of Fouché or many another of the innumerable traitors, it is
                    to be lamented that Ney was chosen to suffer, whose honesty was well known, and
                    had only once failed him.</p>
                <p>The character of Ney was that of a simple soldier; intensely brave, though
                    without the rash impetuosity of a Murat, he was yet as modest as he was brave;
                    as a general his conduct of the two retreats from Portugal and Russia are his
                    chief titles to fame; and, if he was not faithful to the Bourbons, he paid with
                    his life for his defection.</p>
