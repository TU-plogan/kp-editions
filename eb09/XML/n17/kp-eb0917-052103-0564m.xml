                    place, or at any rate the abode of his father, was in the hills of Kumm, but as
                    he spent almost all his days in Ganjah in Arrân (the present Elisabethpol) he is
                    generally known as Nizâmi of Ganjah or Ganjawf. The early death of his parents,
                    which illustrated to him in the most forcible manner the unstableness of all
                    human existence, threw a gloom over his whole life, and fostered in him that
                    earnest piety and fervent love for solitude and meditation which have left
                    numerous traces in his poetical writings, and served him throughout his literary
                    career as a powerful antidote against the enticing favours of princely courts,
                    for which he, unlike most of his contemporaries, never sacrificed a tittle of
                    his self-esteem. The religious atmosphere of Ganjah, besides, was most
                    favourable to such a state of mind; the inhabitants, being zealous Sunnites,
                    allowed nobody to dwell among them who did not come up to their standard of
                    orthodoxy, and it is therefore not surprising to find that Nizâmi abandoned
                    himself at an early age to a stern ascetic life, as full of intolerance to
                    others as dry and unprofitable to himself. He was rescued at last from this
                    monkish idleness by his inborn genius, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n565/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0565-0522"/> which, not being able to give free vent to its
                    poetical inspirations under the crushing weight of bigotry, claimed a greater
                    share in the legitimate enjoyments of life and the appreciation of the beauties
                    of nature, as well as a more enlightened faith of tolerance, benevolence, and
                    liberality. The first poetical work in which Nizâmi embodied his thoughts on God
                    and man, and all the experiences he had gained, was necessarily of a didactic
                    character, and very appropriately styled <hi rend="italic">Makhzan-ulasτdr,</hi>
                    or “Storehouse of Mysteries,” as it bears the unmistakable stamp of Sιific
                    speculations (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Hafiz,</hi> vol. xi. p. 368). It
                    shows, moreover, a strong resemblance to Nâsir Khosrau’s ethical poems and
                    Sanâ’i’s <hi rend="italic">Hadîkat-ulhakîkat,</hi> or “Garden of Truth.” The
                    date of composition, which varies in the different copies from 552 to 582 A.H.,
                    must be fixed in 574 or 575 (1178-79 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> as the
                    author states himself in the prologue that he was forty years old when he wrote
                    it, and the prince to whom he dedicated it—complying so far with the usual
                    custom of his time—was Faklιr∙ uddin Bahrâmshâh, the ruler of the principality
                    of Arzanjân, who died after a very long reign 622 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi>
                    Although the <hi rend="italic">Makhzan</hi> is mainly devoted to philosophic
                    meditations, the propensity of Nizâmi’s genius to purely epic poetry, which was
                    soon to assert itself in a more independent form, makes itself felt even here,
                    all the twenty chapters being interspersed with short tales illustrative of the
                    maxims set forth in each. His claim to the title of the foremost Persian
                    romanticist he fully established only a year or two after the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Makhzan</hi> by the publication of his first epic masterpiece <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khosrau and Shirin,</hi> composed, according to the oldest copies, in 576 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (1180 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> As in all his
                    following epopees the subject was taken from what pious Moslems call the time of
                    “heathendom,”— here, for instance, from the old Sassânian story of Shâh Khosrau
                    Parwiz, his love affairs with the princess Shirin of Armenia, his jealousy
                    against the architect Ferhâd, for some time his successful rival, of whom he got
                    rid at last by a very ingenious trick, and his final reconciliation and marriage
                    with Shirin; and it is a noteworthy fact that the once so devout Nizâmi never
                    chose a strictly Mohammedan legend for his works of fiction. Nothing could prove
                    better the complete revolution in his views, not only on religion, but also on
                    art. He felt, no doubt, that the object of epic poetry was not to teach moral
                    lessons or doctrines of faith, but to depict the good and bad tendencies of the
                    human mind, the struggles and passions of men; and indeed in the whole range of
                    Persian literature only Firdausi and Fakhr-uddin As'ad Jorjâni, the author of
                    the older epopee <hi rend="italic">Wis and Ramin</hi> (about the middle of the
                    11th century), can compete with Nizâmi in the wonderful delineation of character
                    and the brilliant painting of human affections, especially of the joys and
                    sorrows of a loving and beloved heart.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Khosrau and Shirin</hi> was inscribed to the reigning atâbeg of
                    Azerbaijân, Abù Ja'far Mohammed Pahlawân, and his brother Kizil Arslân, who,
                    soon after his accession to the throne in 582 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.,</hi>
                    showed his gratitude to the poet by summoning him to his court, loading him with
                    honours, and bestowing upon him the revenue of two villages, Hamd and Nijân.
                    Nizâmi accepted the royal gift, but his resolve to keep aloof from a servile
                    court-life was not shaken by it, and he forthwith returned to his quiet retreat.
                    Meanwhile his genius had not been dormant, and two years after his reception at
                    court, in 584 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (1188 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.),</hi> he completed his <hi rend="italic">Diwan,</hi> or collection of
                    kasidas and ghazals (mostly of an ethical and parenetic character), which are
                    said to have numbered 20,000 distichs, although the few copies which have come
                    to us contain only a very small number of verses. About the same time he
                    commenced, at the desire of the ruler of the neighbouring Shïrwân, his second
                    romantic poem, the famous Bedouin love-story of <hi rend="italic">Laila</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and Majnun,</hi> which has so many points in common with Ariosto’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso,</hi> and finished it in
                    the short space of four months. A more heroic subject, and the only one in which
                    he made a certain attempt to rival Firdausi, was selected by our poet for his
                    third epopee, the <hi rend="italic">Iskandarnama,</hi> or “Book of Alexander,”
                    also called <hi rend="italic">Sharafndma or Iqbdlndma-i-Iskandari</hi> (“The
                    Fortunes of Alexander ”), which is split into two divisions. The first or
                    semi-historical part shows us Alexander the Great as the conqueror of the world,
                    while the second, of a more ethical tendency, describes him in the character of
                    a prophet and philosopher, and narrates his second tour through the world and
                    his adventures in the west, south, east, and north. There are frequent Sùfic
                    allegories, just as in the <hi rend="italic">Makhzan;</hi> and quite imbued with
                    pantheistic ideas is, for instance, the final episode of the first part, the
                    mysterious expedition of Alexander to the fountain of life in the land of
                    darkness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare Dr
                    Ethé’s essay, “Alexander’s Zug zum Lebensquell,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sitzungsber. d. bayerisch. Akad.,</hi> 1871, pp. 343-405.</p></note> As for the
                    date of composition, it is evident, from the conflicting statements in the
                    different MSS., that there must have been an earlier and a later recension, the
                    former belonging to 587-589 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.,</hi> and dedicated to the
                    prince of Mosul, 'Izz-uddin Mas'ιid, the latter made for the atâbeg Nusrat-uddin
                    Abιi Bakr of Tabriz after 593 A.H., since we find in it a mention of Nizâmi’s
                    last romance <hi rend="italic">Haft Paikar,</hi> or the “Seven Beauties,” which
                    comprises seven tales related by the seven favourite wives of the Sassânian king
                    Bahrâmgùr. In this poem, which was written 593 A.H., at the request of Nùr-uddin
                    Arslân of Mosul, the son and successor of the above-mentioned 'Izzuddin, Nizâmi
                    returned once more from his excursion into the field of heroic deeds to his old
                    favourite domain of romantic fiction, and added a fresh leaf to the laurel crown
                    of immortal fame with which the unanimous consent of Eastern and Western critics
                    has adorned his venerable head. The most interesting of the seven tales is the
                    fourth, the story of the Russian princess, in which we recognize at once the
                    prototype of Gozzi’s well-known <hi rend="italic">Turandot,</hi> which was
                    afterwards adapted by Schiller for the German stage. The five mathnawis, from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Makhzan</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Haft Paikar,</hi>
                    form Nizâmi’s so-called “Quintuple” <hi rend="italic">(Khamsalι)</hi> or “Five
                    Treasures” <hi rend="italic">(Panj Ganf),</hi> and have been taken as pattern by
                    all the later epic poets in the Persian, Turkish, Chaghatâi, and Hindustâni
                    languages. Nizâmi died at Ganiah in his sixty-fourth year, 599 <hi
