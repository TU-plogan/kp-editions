                <p><label type="entry">NEW MEXICO</label>, a Territory of the United States, is
                    bounded on the N. by Colorado, on the E. by Texas and unorganized “public lands”
                    adjacent to the Indian Territory, on the S. by Texas and Mexico, and on the W.
                    by Arizona. It forms nearly a square, being about 335 miles in width from east
                    to west and 345 miles in length from north to south on the eastern border, which
                    lengthens to 390 miles on the west. As formed originally by the Organic Act of
                    1850, the Territory embraced Arizona and southern Colorado. In 1854 the “Gadsden
                    Purchase” from Mexico added a strip along the southern boundary. In 1863 Arizona
                    was detached and made into a separate Territory, and in 1867 the portion of New
                    Mexico north of the 37th parallel was added to Colorado, leaving the Territory
                    with its present boundaries, and an area of 122,460 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> The whole area is elevated far above
                    the ocean, the table-lands of the north being 6000 to 6500, those of the centre
                    5000, and those of the south about 4000 feet above sea-level. The fall in the
                    Rio Grande from the Colorado line to that of Mexico is about 3500 feet. The
                    whole except the eastern portion is traversed by mountains, passing from north
                    to south, not continuously but in broken ranges, which, for convenience of
                    description, may be divided into three parts. The main range of the Rocky
                    Mountains enters the Territory from the north, the highest peaks being the
                    Costilla (12,615 feet), Taos, Mora (12,020), Truchas (13,150), and Baldy
                    (12,661). This range disappears as a continuous chain near Glorieta. Running
                    east from this as a kind of spur along the Colorado line are the Raton
                    Mountains, the pass in which, south of Trinidad, is 7893 feet high. The railroad
                    crosses this range through a tunnel. Commencing about 20 miles south of Santa
                    Fé, and extending southwards on the east side of the Rio Grande, is a broken
                    range, known variously in localities from north to south as the Cerrillos,
                    Placer, Sandia, Chilili, Manzana, Jumanes, Oscura, San Andres, and Organ
                    Mountains,—the last-named crossing into Mexico near El Paso. Nearer to the Rio
                    Grande in Socorro county are the Fra Cristobal and Caballo Mountains. East of
                    the above chain is a series of ranges, generally short, locally known as the
                    Gallinas, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n427/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0427-0400"/> Jicarilla, Carrizo, Capitan, Sierra Blanca,
                    Sacramento, Hueco, and Guadalupe Mountains. On the west of the Rio Grande
                    another broken range runs south, commencing at the singularly conspicuous San
                    Antonio mountain, close to the Colorado line, and known in its several parts as
                    the Petaca, Valles, Nacimiento, Jemez, San Mateo, Ladrones, Oso, Madalena,
                    Socorro, San Mateo (of Socorro), Black Range, Mimbres, and Florida Mountains,
                    the latter extending into Mexico. Still farther to the west, and near the
                    Arizona boundary, yet another series of comparatively short ranges is found,
                    consisting of the Carrizo, Tunicha, and Chusca Mountains, which constitute part
                    of the “great continental divide” separating the waters flowing into the Gulf of
                    Mexico from those running into the Pacific, and more to the south the Zuni,
                    Datil, San Francisco, Escudilla, Tulerosa, Luera, Mogollon, Diablo, Pinos Altos,
                    Burro, Sarampion, Hacha, Perro, Animas, and Peloncillo Mountains. These
                    mountains are seamed with great “canons,” which also penetrate the larger
                    “mesas” or table-lands in various places, where in some way the covering of lava
                    which is their usual protection has been removed. Between contiguous ranges or
                    spurs of the same range are frequently found “parks” of great beauty and
                    fertility. These specially abound in the western part of Colfax county.</p>
                <p>New Mexico, while generally requiring irrigation for its cultivation, is more
                    fully provided with rivers than any of the other mining States or Territories.
                    Its waters flow east to the Mississippi, south to the Gulf of Mexico, and west
                    through the Colorado and Gila to the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean.
                    The Rio Grande, called also the Rio Bravo del Norte, passes completely through
                    the centre of the Territory from north to south. It receives many tributaries,
                    the principal being the Santa Fé and Galisteo from the east, and the Chama,
                    Jemez, Puerco, and Alamosa from the west. Its valley is of great fertility, and
                    capable of supporting a large population. The northeastern part of the
                    Territory, including the greater part of the counties of Colfax, Mora, and San
                    Miguel, is drained by the Canadian or Red River, which flows into the Arkansas.
                    The branches of this stream are very numerous, the principal ones being the
                    Cimarron, Mora, Concha, Pajarito, and Ute. The Pecos rises north-east of Santa
                    Fé, and, flowing south, gives value to a vast belt of land, until it crosses the
                    Texas line and finally joins the Rio Grande itself. Its valley is unsurpassed
                    for fertility and agricultural worth. Among other streams, the Tecolote,
                    Gallinas, Hondo, and Penasco are tributaries to it. In the north-west is the Rio
                    San Juan, from which that whole section is called the “San Juan country.” It
                    flows west to the Great Colorado, and has as its principal branches in New
                    Mexico the Animas from the north and the Chaco from the south. In the central
                    west are the headwaters of the Little Colorado, and in the south-west those of
                    the Gila, with the Mimbres, which flows south into Mexico.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> In almost all parts of the Territory, except
                    the pastoral plains, the precious metals are found, the mineral extending from
                    the extreme north to the southern boundary. The eastern slope of the Rocky
                    Mountains, in Colfax county, abounds in gold, and Elizabethtown, its chief
                    village, was the scene of great mining prosperity a few years ago. The metal is
                    found in “leads” as well as in extensive “placers.” On the opposite side of the
                    range are <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> both gold and silver, and a little
                    farther south, near Picuris, are large deposits of copper. Travelling southwards
                    we find various minerals of value in the mountains east of Santa Fé; and the
                    Cerrillos mining district, about 20 miles south of the capital, presents a rich
                    deposit of silver not as yet fully developed. Here also are the famous turquoise
                    mines, the largest in America, which played so important a part in the early
                    history of the Territory. To the west in the Nacimiento region is a great body
                    of copper. At the “Old Placers” and “New Placers,” in the southern extremity of
                    Santa Fé county, are inexhaustible supplies of placer gold, which were washed
                    for many years by the rude methods of former times, but work here has been
                    suspended pending the completion of extensive works now in progress which will
                    provide a sufficient supply of water for large operations. The Manzana, Ladrone,
                    and Madalena ranges, and, indeed, nearly all the mountains on both sides of the
                    Rio Grande, contain rich mineral. Silver mines of great value are worked in the
                    Socorro Mountains, directly west of the city of that name. The Black Range
                    country is rich in silver and copper; and the more recent discoveries on the
                    Percha river and at Lake Valley promise to be of extraordinary richness and
                    extent. The vicinity of White Oaks in Lincoln county is specially noted for its
                    free gold, and the San Andres, Caballo, and. Organ ranges abound in valuable
                    ores. The greatest development has taken place in Grant county, whose “Santa
                    Rita,” “Hanover,” and other copper mines are well known; the vicinity of Silver
                    City and Georgetown produce great quantities of silver, while the newer
                    districts in the south-west, in the vicinity of Shakespeare and Lordsburg, ⅞j∙e
                    also rich in the last-mentioned metal. To the north of Silver City are the
                    Mogollon Mountains, where valuable mineral deposits are found. The mines,
                    especially those of silver, were extensively worked by the Spaniards down to the
                    year 1680, when the revolt of the Pueblos, caused by the cruel slavery to which
                    they were reduced in working for the precious metals, resulted in the filling up
                    and concealment of every mine in the country during the thirteen years of Pueblo
                    control. The shafts of these mines are frequently discovered. Development in
                    recent times has been greatly retarded by Indian occupancy in some sections and
                    their incursions into others; but now that these difficulties have ceased it is
                    very rapidly progressing.</p>
                <p>Bituminous coal is found in inexhaustible quantities in very many sections of the
                    Territory, notably near Raton in Colfax county, along the Galisteo river on the
                    line of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, and near the Chama river in the
                    north-west. Anthracite coal of an exceedingly fine quality exists in large
                    amounts near Cerrillos station, being superior to many of the coals of
                    Pennsylvania, and by <hi rend="superscript">;</hi> far the best fuel thus far
                    discovered west of the Mississippi river. Iron is found in many localities, but
                    has not yet been worked, the more valuable metals monopolizing attention. Mica
                    mines of large extent and excellent quality are at Petaca, Mora, near Nambé, and
                    in other localities. Lead abounds in many sections carrying silver, and notably
                    in the Cerrillos mines. Plumbago is found in Colfax county; and cement of a very
                    superior quality is made at Springer. Gypsum, fire-clay, and mineral paints are
                    among the mineral resources of the Territory; and marbles and other excellent
                    building stones abound.</p>
                <p>Mineral springs of various kinds of great excellence are found in difierent
                    localities. Prominent among them are the Las Vegas hot springs, the Ojo Caliente
                    in Taos county, the Jemez hot springs, and the Hudson springs. These all have
                    special medicinal qualities, and are of high temperature, the Ojo Caliente water
                    being of 114° and the Jemez 168°. There are also important springs south of El
                    Rancho in Taos county and east of Santa Fé.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate is dry and the air clear throughout
                    almost the entire year. The temperature at Santa Fé, which is considered to have
                    the best climate in the Territory, is sometimes as low in the winter as at New
                    York, but <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n428/mode/1up"

                    from being felt to anything like the same extent. The more southerly towns are
                    of course warmer, not only on account of the difference in latitude, but also
                    because of their decreased altitude.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The elevations at some of the principal points are—Costilla,

                    Albuquerque, 4918; Socorro, 4655; Las Cruces, 3844.</p></note> The rainy season
                    occupies about a month, varying in time from the middle of July to the middle of
                    September, but even then a wholly cloudy day is seldom seen, the mornings being
                    bright, with showers in the afternoon. The comparative death-rate from
                    tubercular diseases in New Mexico is less than anywhere else in the United
                    States, the proportions being—New England 25, Minnesota 14, Southern States 6,
                    New Mexico 3.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The army
                    statistics for six years lead to the same result, the ratio of deaths per 1000
                    from diseases of the respiratory organs being—west coast of Florida, 6*9; New
                    York, 5*9; New England, 4’8; Great Lakes, 4'5; Texas coast, 4; western Texas,

                    eight years (1874-81) was a little less than 14∣ inches, whereas the average at
                    New York was 43, Boston 45, Philadelphia 44, Washington 37, St Louis 42, and
                    Savannah 48. The mean temperature was 48J <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>. The
                    atmosphere is so clear and pure as to be proverbial. From the first
                    characteristic arises the deception as to distances so generally experienced by
                    strangers; and the second is evidenced by the fact that everywhere throughout
                    the Territory the natives hang up their meat out-of-doors to dry, and use pieces
                    of it as required, not the slightest taint arising from it during a series of
                    months.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture, die.—</hi> The greater portion of New Mexico is
                    pastoral, being unfitted for agriculture from lack of water for irrigation.
                    Wherever there is sufficient water either in streams or springs to supply the
                    wants of animals, the grass is amply sufficient to support either cattle or
                    sheep. The Territory abounds in the most nutritious grasses, which retain their
                    virtues during the winter; and the climate is such that shelter is not required
                    other than that afforded by nature, in valleys and woods. ' The number of sheep
                    is variously estimated from 7,000,000 to 10,000,000, and they are raised in
                    every county. Within the past few years the breed has been much improved by the
                    introduction of merino, Cotswold, and •other fine-woolled varieties. The cattle
                    business has reached enormous proportions within a few years, and is steadily
                    advancing in importance. The immense profits received have induced the
                    investment of large amounts of capital, and all the desirable ranches are being
                    rapidly taken up and stocked. The business is changing in its character in two
                    ways. Large corporations are taking the place of small owners, and, instead of
                    ranging over the plains, the cattle are now generally confined to tracts
                    exclusively owned or occupied, and fenced. Colfax county alone is thought to
                    contain nearly 100,000 head of cattle, and the number in the whole Territory is
                    very large, and rapidly increasing.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is mainly limited to the valleys. Those of the Rio Grande, the Pecos,
                    the Canadian, the San Juan, and their tributaries, though generally narrow,
                    contain large areas of arable land of extraordinary fertility. They produce
                    large crops of grain and of most kinds of vegetables, especially onions, beets,
                    turnips, cabbages, cauliflowers, &amp;c. Potatoes succeed best in the
                    mountainous regions. The Taos valley is an exceptionally fine wheat country, and
                    before the advent of railroads supplied a great part of the Territory with its
                    flour. The Mora valley is also celebrated for its wheat. It is as a
                    fruit-producing region, however, that a large portion of the irrigated laud in
                    the Territory specially excels. The Rio Grande valley from Embudo to Mesilla is
                    particularly adapted to this purpose. The area of fruit and vine culture is
                    being yearly extended. Peaches, plums, and apricots come to great perfection in
                    the north, and pears, apples, quinces, cherries, &amp;c., as well as the stone
                    fruits, throughout the middle and southern sections. Grapes flourish from
                    Bernalillo to El Paso, and in some favoured spots like La Joya farther north.
                    The grape principally cultivated is the ‘ ‘ Mission,” which produces excellent
                    wine. Hardy American varieties like the Concord will do well anywhere, and the
                    less hardy European varieties, such as the White Muscat, Flamed Tokay, &amp;c.,
                    succeed admirably in the vicinity of Las Cruces. The Pecos valley also produces
                    fruit of extraordinary size and beauty.</p>
                <p>The supply of timber, especially of pine, is almost inexhaustible.</p>
                <p>It exists in nearly all the hilly and mountainous parts of the Territory, but is
                    of very superior quality as regards both height and straightness in the vicinity
                    of Tierra Amarilla. Cedar abounds in many localities, and the pinon makes an
                    excellent fuel. Oak, maple, walnut, and ash are found to a more limited extent.
                    The varieties of poplar commonly known as cottonwood and quaking aspen are the
                    most common deciduous trees, and grow in almost afl parts of the Territory.
                    Several other native plants are proving of value. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yucca</hi> of different varieties abounds,— <hi rend="italic">Y.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">filamentosa,</hi> commonly called amole or soap-weed, covering
                    immense tracts. Experiments have recently been made with a view to utilizing the
                    fibre of the large serrated variety abundant in the south in the manufacture of
                    rope, and the smaller kinds in paper-making, as well as using the root in
                    preparing a substitute for soap. These bid fair to make this very abundant plant
                    of large commercial value. The canaigre has long been known to possess powerful
                    tanning properties, and recent experiments by the department of agriculture and
                    elsewhere have demonstrated its value as a substitute for bark and other agents.
                    The plant grows wild over a large extent of country, and its importance in a
                    district producing so many hides and skins can hardly be overestimated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government and Administration.—</hi> The executive officers are
                    a governor and a secretary. The higher judiciary consists of a chief justice and
                    two associates, each of whom presides over the courts in one district, all three
                    sitting together as an appellate supreme court in January of each year. The
                    legislature consists of a council of twelve members and a house of
                    representatives of twenty-four, elected by counties biennially. The governor
                    possesses the veto power. The territorial officials are a treasurer, auditor,
                    attorneygeneral and two district attorneys, and an adjutant-general. In each
                    county there are a probate judge, sheriff, and other local officers, the chief
                    authority being vested in a board of county commissioners of three members
                    elected by the people. The counties are divided into precincts, in each of which
                    there is a justice of the peace and a constable. At present there are twelve
                    counties in the Territory. Public education is in charge of a board of three
                    school commissioners in each county. A tax of ⅛ per cent, is levied for the
                    support of public schools. Precincts may become independent school districts at
                    their option.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population of the Territory was 91,874 in
                    1870 and 119,565 in 1880. Since that time it has steadily increased. The
                    capital, Santa Fé, had 6635 inhabitants in 1880.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The first European that traversed the Territory
                    was Cabeza de Vaca (Nunez), the treasurer of the unfortunate expedition of
                    Panfilo Narvaez to Florida, who, being cast ashore on the coast of Texas,
                    crossed the continent with three companions, and after encountering infinite
                    difficulties and dangers arrived at Spanish settlements near the Gulf of
                    California. On the way he passed through a land of “fixed habitations,” which
                    were evidently the Pueblo towns, followed the Rio Grande for many miles, and on
                    his return to civilization gave such an account of his travels that great
                    interest was excited. In consequence, Coronado, the governor of New Galicia,
                    sent Marcos de Niza, a Franciscan monk, with Stephen, a negro who had been one
                    of Vaca’s companions, to reconnoitre the country. They penetrated as far as
                    Zufii, then called Cibola, where Stephen was killed; but Marcos made up for the
                    lack of substantial success by the marvellous nature of the report he presented.
                    The next year, 1540, Coronado himself headed an expedition of 300 Spaniards and
                    800 Indians, and started from Culiacan on Easter Monday. He succeeded in finding
                    Cibola, which he subjugated with the surrounding country, and then proceeded to
                    the province of Tiguex (on the Puerco river). After this expedition several
                    friars at various times entered the country, establishing missions, often at the
                    cost of their lives. Among them one of the most prominent was Agustin Ruiz, who
                    was killed in 1581. Almost immediately after this came the expedition of Espejo,
                    who was sent by the viceroy to protect the missions. The next expedition of note
                    was that of Ofiate, toward the close of the century, which carried a large
                    number of additional colonists into the Territory. From this time the Spanish
                    population increased rapidly, and mining was extensively engaged in, the natives
                    being reduced to a virtual condition of slavery in the mines. In 1680 the
                    Indians, who had long been on the verge of rebellion, revolted, and under the
                    lead of Pope, a chief of large influence, marched on Santa Fé, and there
                    besieged Governor Otermin and the Spanish army, who were finally compelled to
                    evacuate the town and retreat to El Paso. For thirteen years the Pueblos
                    continued to control the country, defeating successive Spanish expeditions,
                    until in 1693 Diego de Vargas, the new governor, succeeded in cortquering them
                    and a peace was made, one of the terms of which was that there should be no more
                    slavery in the mines. In fact the Indians had filled up all the shafts in the
                    meantime. For over a century afterwards little occurred to disturb the
                    tranquillity of the Territory, except occasional wars with the surrounding
                    savage tribes. In 1804 Lieutenant Pike, exploring the head-waters of the
                    Arkansas, by mistake camped on Mexican soil and was brought into Santa Fé and
                    sent to Chihuahua as a prisoner. About this time the first <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n429/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0429-0402"/> Eods were brought across the plains to the New
                    Mexican market,, ing the commencement of the overland traffic of the Santé Fé
                    “Trail,” which increased yearly in importance until the railroads took the place
                    of the “prairie schooner.” In 1820 Mexico became independent, and New Mexico
                    began to be governed by political chiefs instead of Spanish “Gobernadores.”</p>
                <p>By a change in the constitution in 1835, governors were appointed instead of
                    elected, and Albino Perez was sent from Mexico as the new ruler. This excited
                    much discontent, which was increased by the enactment of a new tax law two years
                    later. About August 1, 1837, a revolutionary movement commenced in the north of
                    the Territory among both Mexicans and Pueblos, having for its centre the town of
                    Canada or Santa Cruz. Governor Perez marched to meet the insurgents, but was
                    deserted by nearly all his troops and compelled to fly, and was soon after
                    overtaken and killed near Agua Fria. A number of other prominent officials were
                    also killed; and on August 10 Jose Gonzalez, a Taos Indian, was installed as
                    governor in the palace. General Manuel Armijo, who had held high positions
                    before, raised troops at Albuquerque to suppress the revolt, and finally
                    defeated the rebels at Canada. The Mexican Government confirmed his acts and
                    appointed him governor, which office he held with some intermissions until the
                    coming of an American army in 1846 under General Kearney, who marched from the
                    Missouri and took possession of the Territory without bloodshed,—General Armijo
                    retiring southwards. A provisional government was established by the Americans,
                    and Charles Bent, an old resident, appointed governor, but he was killed in a
                    revolt in January 1847. The treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo made New Mexico a part
                    of the United States, and by an Act of Congress of September 9,1850, it was
                    organized as a Territory with a regular government. Early in 1862 a Confederate
                    army from Texas invaded the country and occupied Santa Fé, March 10; they were
                    defeated, however, at Glorieta on March 28, and evacuated the capital April 8.
                    The people of the Territory were commendably loyal, and supplied 6000 men to the
                    Union army.</p>
                <p>The first rail was laid in New Mexico, November 30,1878, by the Atchison, Topeka,
                    and Santa Fé Railroad, which reached Las Vegas July 1, 1879, Santa Fé February
                    9, 1880, and connected with the Southern Pacific at Deming March 18, 1881. This,
                    and the construction of the Denver and Rio Grande and the Atlantic and Pacific
                    Railroads, have given a great impetus to the Territory. (J. B. PR.)</p>
