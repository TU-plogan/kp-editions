                <p><label type="entry">NORTHUMBERLAND</label>, the northernmost county of England,
                    is of a somewhat triangular form, roughly resembling that of England itself. It
                    lies between 54° 47' and 55° 46' N. lat. and 1° 25' and 2° 4Γ W. long., and is
                    in its extremes about 70 miles long and 53 broad. Its area is 2016 square miles,
                    ranking it fifth among English counties. Northumberland lies entirely on the
                    easterly slope of the country. Its boundaries are the German Ocean, Scotland,
                    and the counties of Cumberland and Durham. In physical aspect it is a tumbled
                    incline of fells and ridges, intersected by valleys and subsiding eastwards from
                    the hill-borders of Scotland and Cumberland into lessening undulations and a
                    shelving coast. The Cheviot range (separating Northumberland from Scotland) is
                    divided by <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0616-0565"/> nature into two groups. What may be called the
                    northern Cheviots are green hills of conical and high-arched forms, finely
                    grouped, with the peat-capped Cheviot itself (2676 feet) at their centre, deep
                    steep glens radiating into all parts of their mass, and generally more or less
                    of hollow and enclosed ground separating them from the slopes at their base. The
                    southern Cheviots (south-westwards from Thirl-moor) are the highest part of the
                    county,—moory hills, lower and more confluent, and sometimes curiously
                    equal-topped. On the Cumberland side of the county these watershed heights sink
                    into a monotonous rolling tract, separated only by the river Irthing from the
                    “wastes” of Bewcastle. They again swell up in the south-west towards Killhope
                    Law (2208 feet) and the Pennine range. Few eminences break the general incline,
                    which stretches in a far-spread billowy sea of confluent hills that for six
                    months of the year mingle their browns, russets, and duns in a pattern of
                    Oriental richness, and at all times communicate a fine sense of altitude and
                    expanse. The Simonside Hills (1447 feet) form one not very conspicuous
                    exception. The configuration of much of these uplands has a certain linearity in
                    its details due to groups and ranges of ridges, crags, and terrace-like tiers,
                    picturesquely termed “edges” (escarpments) by the country folk, and generally
                    facing the interior, like broad ends of wedges. The line of pillared crags and
                    prow-like headlands between the North and South Tynes along the verge of which
                    the Romans carried their wall is a fine specimen. Passing eastwards from the
                    uplands we exchange the moors for enclosed grounds, “drystone” walls for
                    hedgerows, rare sprinklings of birch for a sufficiently varied wooding, and
                    towards the south-east we approach the smoke of the coal-field and the roar of
                    the Tyne.</p>
                <p>The chief rivers and valleys are the Derwent, the Irthing, the Tyne (with its
                    North and South branches, the Allendales, and Redesdale), the Wansbeck with its
                    twin the Font, the Coquet, the Alne, the Till with its feeders the Breamish,
                    Glen, and College, and the Tweed. The Tyne is the “coaly Tyne” only from Wylam
                    downwards. For 19 miles (its tidal portion) it has been dredged into a small
                    estuary,—“a river of coal, iron, and chemicals.” The rivers and streams in
                    general are greatly diversified with numbers of rocky gorges and rich “denes.”
                    The deepest glen-scenery is at the head of the Breamish and College burns; and
                    the North Tyne gathers its waters from surrounding moorlands into a vale of
                    surpassing beauty.</p>
                <p>The coast is a succession of sands, flat tidal rocks, and low cliffs. Its bays
                    are edged by blown sandhills; its borders are severely wind-swept. Several
                    islands lie over against it. 1 oly Island, the classic Lindisfarne, 1051 acres
                    in extent, but half “links” and sandbanks, is annexed to the mainland and
                    accessible to conveyances every tide. The Farne Islands are a group of rocky
                    islets farther south, —the scene of many saintly austerities, and of the nobler
                    devotion of Grace Darling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The core of the county, in a geological aspect,
                    is the northern Cheviots from Redesdale head nearly to the Tweed. Its oldest
                    rocks are gritty and slaty beds of Silurian age, about the head of the rivers
                    Rede and Coquet and near the Breamish south of Ingram,—a part of the great
                    Silurian mass of the southern uplands of Scotland. Even before the times of the
                    Old Red Sandstone these rocks had been crushed and folded, upraised into a
                    continental land, and much wasted. The largest hollows in that ancient continent
                    held the great lakes in which the “Old Red” was deposited. Volcanic activity
                    near one of the lake-group (now to be known as Lake Cheviot) resulted in the
                    felspathic porphyrites passing into the syenites and granites that form the mass
                    of the northern Cheviots.</p>
                <p>Round this core there now lie relays of Carboniferous strata dipping east and
                    south, much faulted and repeated in places, but passing into Coal-measures and
                    Magnesian Limestone in the south-eastern part of the county. The dawn of the
                    Carboniferous ages saw the volcanic piles of the Cheviots becoming shapeless
                    with waste. Then ensued a general settling down of the land, the gathering of a
                    long series of deposits around its subsiding borders, the burying of
                    Cheviot-land, and the gradual formation of the whole great succession of the
                    Carboniferous system. The builders thereof were three. After every sufficient
                    subsidence the limestone sea that covered Derbyshire sent incursions of marine
                    life northwards; the waste of the land in the north then spread out in sheets of
                    sand and silt; and over the mud-flats thus prepared came slow migrations of
                    dense plant-growth. Limestones, sandstones, shales, and coals were the result;
                    and the whole system now consists of—(1) the Carboniferous Limestone series in
                    three divisions, first detected by the accurate eye of George Tate of Alnwick;
                    (2) the Millstone Grit; and (3) the Coal-measures. Lowest in Northumberland lies
                    Tate’s Tuedian group, the first envelope of sinking Cheviot-land. Some reddish
                    shore-like conglomerates lie in places at its base, as at Roddam Dene; its
                    shales are often tinged with distemper greens; its coals are scarcely worthy of
                    the name; its limestones are thin, except near Rothbury; and its marine fossils
                    are few and incursive. The Tuedian group is overlaid by the Carbonaceous group;
                    its shales are carbonaceous-grey, its coals, though mostly small, very numerous,
                    its limestones often plant-limestones, and its calcareous matter much diffused.
                    Upon this lies the Calcareous group; its lime occurs in well-individualized
                    marine beds, cropping up to the surface in green-vested strips; its fossils are
                    found in recurrent cycles, with the limestones and coals forming their extremes.
                    These three groups now range round the northern Cheviots in curved belts
                    broadening southwards, and occupy nearly all the rolling ground between the
                    Tweed and the South Tyne, the sandstones forming the chief eminences. The middle
                    division becomes thinner and more like the Coal-measures in passing northwards,
                    and the upper division, thinning also, loses many of its limestones. The
                    Millstone Grit is a characterless succession of grits and shales. The
                    Coal-measures possess the same zone-like arrangement that prevails in the
                    Limestone series, but are without limestones. They also are divided, very
                    artificially, into three groups The lowest, from the Brockwell seam downwards,
                    has some traces of Gannister beds, and its coal-seams are but thin. The famous
                    Hutton collection of plants was made chiefly from the roof-shales of two
                    seams,—the Bensham and the Low Main. The unique Atthey collection of fishes and
                    Amphibia comes from the latter. The Coal-measures lie along the coast in a long
                    triangle, of which the base, at the Tyne, is produced westwards on to the moors
                    south of that river, where it is wedged against lower beds on the south by a
                    fault. The strata within the triangle give signs of departing from the easterly
                    dip that has brought them where they are, and along a line between its apex
                    (near Amble) and an easterly point in its base (near Jarrow) they turn up
                    north-eastwards, promising coal-crops under the sea.</p>
                <p>The top of the Coal-measures is wanting. After a slight tilting of the strata and
                    the denudation that removed it, the Permian rocks were deposited, consisting of
                    Magnesian Limestone, a thin fish-bed below it, and yellow sands and some Red
                    Sandstone (with plants of Coal-measure species) at the base. These rocks are now
                    all but removed. They form Tynemouth rock, and lie notched-in against the 90-
                    fathom dyke at Cullercoates, and again are touched (the base only) at Seaton
                    Sluice. No higher strata have been preserved. The chief faults of the county
                    extend <hi rend="italic">across</hi> it. Its igneous rocks, other than the
                    Cheviot porphyrites and a few contemporaneous traps in the lowest Carboniferous,
                    are all intrusive. An irregular sheet of basalt forced between <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0617-0566"/> planes of bedding (perhaps at the close of the
                    Carboniferous period) forms the crag-making line of the Great Whinsill, which,
                    with many shifts, breaks, and gaps, extends from Greenhead near Gilsland to the
                    Kyloe Hills. Numbers of basalt dykes cross the county, and were probably
                    connected with the plateau of Miocene volcanic rocks in the Hebrides. Everywhere
                    the Glacial period has left rocks rounded and scored, and rock-fragments from
                    far and near rubbed up into boulder-clay. The glaciers at first held with the
                    valleys, but as the ice-inundation grew they spread out into one sheet,—the
                    Cheviot tops, heavily ice-capped, alone rising above it. Two great currents met
                    in confluence around these hills,—one from across the western watershed, the
                    other skirting the coast from the north. Boulders from Galloway, Criffel, the
                    English lake district, and other places adjacent, and from the Lammermuirs and
                    Berwickshire, lie in their track. Of moraines there are only a few towards the
                    hills. The “great submergence” has left no unequivocal signs of its presence.
                    Glaciated shell-fragments have been detected at Tynemouth. Laminated brick clays
                    occur among the boulder-clays. Sheets and mounds of gravel of the nature of
                    kames exist here and there on the low grounds, and stretch in a chain over the
                    low watershed between Haltwhistle and Gilsland, sparsely dotting also some more
                    upland valleys. An upper boulder-clay, containing flints, skirts the coast.</p>
                <p>The older valleys are all pre-Glacial, and may date from the Miocene period. They
                    are much choked up with Glacial deposits, and lie so deep below the surface
                    that, if they were cleared-out arms of the sea, one of them, 140 feet deep at
                    Newcastle, would extend for miles inland. After the departure of the glaciers
                    the streams here and there wandered into new positions, and hence arises a great
                    variety of smooth slope and rocky gorge. In the open country atmospheric waste
                    has hollowed out the shales at their outcrops, leaving the sandstones, &amp;c.,
                    as protruding “edges,” roughened here and there into crags. In the lower
                    grounds, where this surface-dissection first began, the “edges” have much run
                    together; on the heights, whose turn came last, they are often prominent and
                    crest-like, but have glacier-rounded brows. Many old tarns are now sheeted over
                    with peat. The sloping peat-fields are often the sites of straggling
                    birch-woods, now buried.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals, &amp;c.—</hi> The main portion of the great northern
                    coal-field that extends into Northumberland is an uneven triangle, with its base
                    stretching 14 miles inland from the mouth of the Tyne, and its apex on the coast
                    24 miles northwards. There are eighteen or twenty seams of workable thickness,
                    all of them of varieties known as bituminous or “caking” coal, amounting in the
                    aggregate to nearly 60 feet in thickness. The familiar “Wallsend” was the
                    product of a seam now worked out (the High Main), and its name has sunk into a
                    trade term. The Low Main or Hutton seam ranks first in thickness and value; it
                    runs nearly through the whole length of the northern coal-field, and yields at
                    one point or another the best description of three varieties of coal, viz.,
                    household, gas, and steam coals,—in Northumberland chiefly steam coal. The seams
                    below it, including five seams averaging about a yard in thickness, are still un
                    worked at Newcastle. The best coking coals are furnished from the lower seams.
                    Three little coal-basins lie against a fault on the moors south of the Tyne. In
                    the Limestone series there also exist coal-seams of some value, worked here and
                    there, generally singly and for land sale purposes. The Scremerston lower coals,
                    eight of which are workable seams with an aggregate thickness of 23 feet, form a
                    little coal-field in the Carbonaceous group in the north of the county.
                    Numberless little seams are dug into by farmers and shepherds for their own use,
                    chiefly in the same group in the southern half of the county.</p>
                <p>According to the mineral statistics the output of coal from the 176 collieries
                    worked in Northumberland in 1882 was 14,518,789 tons, as against 36,299,597 tons
                    from the whole coal-field, and 156,499,977 tons from the United Kingdom. The net
                    quantity of coal in Northumberland available for the future was estimated before
                    the Coal Commission in 1870 as 2,576,000,000 tons, besides 403,000,000 tons
                    under the sea within 2 miles of land. About 350 millions of tons have since been
                    realized. The rate of production is increasing annually.</p>
                <p>The “lead-measures” in Northumberland chiefly lie in South Tynedale and
                    Allendale, and belong to the Upper Limestone series or Yoredale rocks. From
                    these lead-mines in 1882 there were raised 6817 tons of ore, having a value of
                    £54,719. The product of the ore was 5252 tons of lead and 9547 ounces of silver.
                    The industry has recently suffered from the effects of foreign competition.</p>
                <p>The Cleveland ironstone and cheap foreign import have repressed iron-mining in
                    Northumberland. An abundance of nodular calcareous ironstone in the Upper
                    Limestone series awaits future development. For many years a shale bed at
                    Redesdale furnished Sir W. G. Armstrong with some of his best materials, but it
                    was abandoned in 1877.</p>
                <p>Among other mineral products are building freestones in profusion; millstone
                    grits, not at all restricted to the strata bearing the name; fireclays, chiefly
                    of value among the Coal-measures; brick clays from glacial beds; and
                    disintegrated shales. The Whinsill yields hard paving-stones and kerbstones;
                    Newcastle grindstones, from a hard sandstone near the town, are as familiar as
                    “Wallsend”; and limekilns are numerous in the broad belt occupied by the upper
                    limestones. The uplands are rich in springs issuing from the sandstones and
                    limestones. Chalybeate springs or “red wells” abound; “sulphur wells”
                    (sulphuretted hydrogen) are by no means rare.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Natural History.—</hi> The fauna and flora of the county have
                    been worked out with a care and completeness chiefly due to the Naturalists’
                    Field Clubs of Tyneside and Berwickshire. The catalogue of plants in
                    Northumberland (with Durham) contains 936 species out of the 1425 of the British
                    list, Ireland excluded. The facies of the flora is intermediate between the
                    northern and southern types of the island. Forty-six species enter
                    Northumberland from the south which do not reach Scotland. There is a distinct
                    preponderance of damp-loving kinds. No plants are restricted to the county.
                    Numerous aliens, enumerated as 117 species, grow upon the large ballast-hills
                    beside the Tyne and elsewhere, and there are 87 other “casual introductions.”

                <p>The richness of bird-life in the county is accounted for by the situation of the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Governmental and Ecclesiastical Divisions.—</hi> Northumberland
                    comprises the nine wards (answering to hundreds and wapentakes) of Bamburgh,
                    Glendale, Coquetdale, Morpeth, Tynedale, Castle, Norhamshire, Islandshire, and
                    Bedlingtonshire. The last three formed detached portions of Durham until 1844.
                    It contains 76 mother-parishes and 162 benefices, together forming (with Alston
                    and Nenthead in Cumberland) the diocese of Newcastle, erected in 1882. There are
                    541 civil parishes in which poor-rate is separately levied. The county has one
                    court of quarter-sessions, is divided into 13 petty and special sessional
                    divisions, and for parliamentary purposes into a northern and a southern
                    division, each of which returns two members. Berwick-upon-Tweed (which has been
                    joined to this county for election purposes) and Newcastle-upon-Tyne have
                    separate courts of quarter-sessions and commissions of the peace, and, together
                    with Morpeth and Tynemouth, the latter of which has also a commission of the
                    peace, are municipal and parliamentary boroughs. Berwick and Newcastle each

                <p><hi rend="italic">Population and People. —</hi> The population in 1881 numbered
                    434,086 persons, 215,882 males and 218,204 females,—showing an increase since
                    1871 of 47,440 persons, and of 256,008 since the first census in 1801. The
                    average number of persons to an acre was 0'34, and of acres to a person 2'97.
                    The number of inhabited houses was 70,682. The population of its chief towns was
                    as follows:—Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 145,359 (or with Gateshead upon the Durham
                    side, 211,162); North Shields and Tynemouth, 44,118; Berwick-on-Tweed, 13,998;
                    Alnwick, 7440; Morpeth, 6946; and Hexham, 5919. The Tyne ports are rapidly
                    becoming one continuous town. Walker had a population of 9522 persons, Wallsend
                    6515, and Willington Quay 5105. Persons engaged as miners or in mine service
                    numbered 21,607, of whom 20,752 λvere coal-miners. Persons engaged in
                    agriculture numbered 18,901.</p>
                <p>In physique the Northumbrian is stalwart and robust, and seldom corpulent. The
                    people have mostly grey eyes, brown hair, and good complexions. The inhabitants
                    of the fishing villages appear to be Scandinavian; and parts of the county
                    probably contain some admixture of the old Brit-Celt, and a trace of the Gipsy
                    blood of the Faas of Yetholm. The natives have fine characteristics: they are
                    clean, thrifty, and plodding, honest and sincere, shrewd, and very independent.
                    Their virtues lie rather in solidity than in aspiration.</p>
                <p>Northumbrian speech is characterized by a “rough vibration of the soft palate” or
                    pharynx in pronouncing the letter <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> well known as the
                    <hi rend="italic">burr,</hi> a peculiarity extending to the town and liberties
                    of Berwick, and absent only in a narrow strip along the north-west. Over the
                    southern part of the county there is the same duplication of vowel-sounds, such
                    as “peöl” for “pool,” that is met in the English countiesadjacent. Many charming
                    Old-English forms of speech strike the ear, such as “to butch a beef,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to kill a bullock, and curious inversions, such as
                    “they not can help.” There is the Old-English distinction in the use of “thou”
                    to familiars and “ye” to superiors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ownership of Land.—</hi> According to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Owners of Land Returns</hi> 1873, the distribution of land-property in
                    Northumberland was as follows:—there were 22 proprietors of more than 10,000
                    acres; of 100 and less than 1000, 507; of 10 and less than 100, 771; of 1 and
                    less than 10, 820; and of less than 1, 10,036. The gross estimated rental was
                    £2,144,743. Six proprietors held lands exceeding 20,000 acres. The duke of
                    Northumberland, the largest land-proprietor in England, held 181,616 acres; the
                    earl of Tankerville, Chillingham Park, held 28,930; Sir John Swinburne of
                    Capheaton, 28,057; Walter C. Selby of Biddlestone, 25,327; Sir W. C. Trevelyan
                    (now Sir Charles) of Wallington, 21,342; and the lords of the Admiralty, who
                    held the old Derwentwater estate, 20,642. The mansions and parks attached to
                    these estates are all beautiful or interesting. Biddlestone is uplying, but in
                    some respects is the original of Scott’s Osbaldistone Hall.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture, Ac.—</hi> More than half of the county is
                    pastoral. South of the river Coquet there is a single broad tract of cultivation
                    towards thé coast that sends lessening strips up the valleys into the interior.
                    From the Coquet north wards another breadth of enclosed ground stretches almost
                    continuously along the base of the Cheviot hills. In the basin of the Till it
                    becomes eminently fertile, and towards the Tweed the two breadths unite. In the
                    porphyritic Cheviots the lower hills show a great extent of sound surface and
                    good grass. The average hill-farms support about one sheep to two acres. A
                    coarser pasturage covers the Carboniferous hills, and the proportion of stock to
                    surface is somewhat less. Their highest fells are a rough-and-tumble of bogs,
                    hags, and sandstone scars, with many acres dangerous to sheep and worth less
                    than nothing to the farmer. I he lower uplands are a patch work of coarse
                    grasses (mown by “the muirmen” into “bent-hay”) and heather, or, in the popular
                    terms, heather and “white ground,” for it is blanched for eight months in the
                    year. Heather is the natural cover of the sandstones (which form most of the
                    eminences) and of the sandy glacier-débris near them. The limestone crops are
                    bright green strips or <hi rend="italic">gairs.</hi> Sheets of boulder-clay are
                    common on the eastern sides of eminences, in the valleys, and on the low
                    grounds. On the uplands they grow bents; lower down they are apt to be cold and
                    strong, but are much relieved by patches and inworkings of gravel, especially
                    north of the Wansbeck. The prevalent stream-alluvium is sandy loam, with a
                    tincture of peat. The arable regions are very variable. Changes of soil are
                    probably as numerous as fields. Fencing has now reached the watershed tracts;
                    draining is following; but there is room to doubt whether the latter will be
                    altogether an unmixed good. The peat mosses act retentively, like sponges,
                    softening the air, nourishing the early-springing deer-grass and cotton-grass,
                    and preventing precipitation of drainage on the rivers, which are now more
                    liable to floods than formerly.</p>
                <p>Northumberland contains 1,290,312 acres. In the <hi rend="italic">Agricultural
                    Returns</hi> for 1883 the cultivated area of the county stands as 712,615 acres,
                    exclusive of orchards and market gardens, embracing—corn crops, 126,439 acres
                    (λvheat 19,980, barley 40,696, and oats 58,989); green crops, 55,202 acres
                    (turnips and swedes 46,066, and potatoes 5384); clover, sanfoins, and grasses
                    under rotation, 84,562 acres; permanent pasture not under rotation, exclusive of
                    heath or mountain land, 431,031 acres. Of orchards there were 184 acres; of
                    market gardens, 659; of nursery gardens, 81; and of woods(in 1881), 39,977.
                    Since 1866 55,626 acres have been reclaimed from mountain land. The corn area
                    has meanwhile diminished by 27,277 acres, and turnip-culture has not increased;
                    but the permanent pastures are more extensive by nearly one-fourth, or 101,207
                    acres. The turnip-culture of the northern parts of the county takes rank with
                    the best districts in Scotland. A five-or four-course shift is the usual
                    rotation.</p>
                <p>By the census of live-stock (1883) the returns are as follows :— horses and
                    ponies, 18,147, including 13,538 used for agricultural purposes; cattle, 93,550,
                    of which 21,930 were in milk or in calf; sheep, 880,230, including 336,702 under
                    one year old; pigs, exclusive of those kept in towns and by cottagers, 14,883.
                    The sheep, which are celebrated, fall into three groups. The half-breds—crosses
                    between the Leicester (or Shropshire) and Cheviot breeds—occupy the lower
                    enclosed grounds, the pure Cheviots are on the uplands, and the hardier
                    blackfaced breeds lie out on the exposed heathery heights. The cattle are
                    chiefly shorthorns and Galloways.</p>
                <p>The size of the agricultural holdings was returned in 1875 and 1880. Holdings of
                    50 acres and under numbered in these years 3070 and 3329 respectively; of 100 to
                    300 acres, 1313 and 1273; of 1000 acres and upwards, 38 and 36. Leases of
                    fourteen and nineteen years “usually without compensation clauses, and more or
                    less restricted as to cropping,” have hitherto been in fashion. In the large
                    part of the county owned by the duke of Northumberland (nearly one-seventh of
                    the whole) there obtains a system of yearly agreements, except in the case of
                    hill-pastures. In the recent uncertain years annual arrangements have been more
                    in favour generally. Large farms have now much absorbed the smaller holdings of
                    earlier times. In Allendale the mining population includes many small occupiers,
                    and the commons are still unbroken. In other parts of the county the commons
                    have mostly been divided. Between 1702 and 1877 commons to the number of 59, and
                    with an aggregate extent of 194,917 acres, are known to have been enclosed.
                    There is no authentic account of the unenclosed remainder.</p>
                <p>The management of many Northumbrian farms is excellent, “far in advance of
                    ordinary practice.” Wages are high, but “the cost per acre of labour does not
                    exceed and is often much lower than that of districts where wages are from 25 to
                    40 per cent, lower. This is attributable to (1) the superior quality of the
                    labour, both physical and moral, (2) the extensive use of women-workers (the
                    employment of whom is not found to be demoralizing when properly safe -
                    guarded), and (3) more systematic and economical management” (Coleman, <hi
                    rend="italic">Report, Royal Commission,</hi> 1882).</p>
                <p>The practice of paying wages in kind has passed greatly into disuse. Some of the
                    shepherds still receive “stock-wages, being allowed to keep forty or fifty sheep
                    and several cows on their employers’ farms in lieu of pay. This arrangement,
                    which makes them really copartners, has probably done much to render them the
                    singularly fine class of men they are.</p>

                    river from a commercial point of view in England and Wales. The richness of its
                    fisheries is mentioned in the time of Henry I. According to Professor Huxley’s
                    report, the estimated catch in 1882 was 41,110 salmon and 10,336 salmon-trout.
                    The salmon catch has doubled within the last four years, and is not known to
                    have been exceeded except in three abnormal years, 1871-73. The fish taken by
                    the Berwick Salmon Fishery Company in 1882 were 8808 salmon, 3104 grilse, and
                    12,390 trout. Bull-trout abound in the Coquet. The sea-fisheries include
                    herrings, whitefish, and some crabs and lobsters. In 1872 the number of boats
                    employed was 1163, chiefly cobles. Beyond Holy Island the boats and fishing are
                    essentially Scotch.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities, &lt;L∙c.—</hi> The pre-Roman antiquities of
                    Northumberland are camps, cairns, standing-stones (both monoliths and
                    fragmentary circles), sculptures on rock, hand-made pottery, and weapons,
                    ornaments, &amp;c., of stone, bronze, iron, jet, glass, and gold. The camps are
                    entrenched enclosures rudely rounded or quadrate, with their main entrances and
                    those of the hut-circles, or foundations of huts, always facing sunrise. They
                    differ from the camps of the Romans in their want of symmetry, and in an absence
                    of plan in distribution, due to the desultory clan-warfare of their inhabitants.
                    The primitive village of Greaves Ash near the Breamish, the strong defensive
                    earthwork at Elsdon, and the camps at Old Bewick, Lordenshaw near Rothbury, and
                    Warden Hill near Hexham are a few instances from among the great numbers that
                    are preserved on the eminences girdling the northern Cheviots and on the lower
                    untilled grounds. Traces of occupation by Romans, Saxons, and marauders of later
                    times sometimes mingle with the remains of the original occupants. The
                    sculptured cups and circles, now familiar to antiquaries, were first brought
                    into observation at Rowtin Linn near Ford in 1852. Numerous instances and varied
                    designs have since been found, both on “fast” rock and on slabs associated with
                    burials. The uplands are dotted with round barrows and cairns containing cists
                    and interments, sometimes cremated, sometimes inhumed, and in some instances
                    both together. The county scarcely affords material as yet for a separation into
                    periods of stone, bronze, and iron. The older interments are associated only
                    with stone, but not necessarily precedent to bronze; in the “late Celtic” or
                    “early iron” ages all three were in use together.</p>
                <p>In Roman military antiquities this is the premier county of Britain. For the
                    great wall between the Tyne and the Solway, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hadrian’s
                    Wall.</hi> The Roman road from London nearly bisects the county, and still goes
                    familiarly under the name of “the Watling Street.” It passes numbers of
                    quadrangular camps, three of which were permanent stations. Its eastern branch,
                    the Devil’s Causeway, leaves it near the Tyne for Berwick. In the south-west of
                    the county lay the Maiden Way, making for Liddisdale. Coal, iron, and lead
                    appear to have been worked by the Romans. Numerous heaps of heavy iron slag,
                    mingled with charcoal, are the sites of little “bloomeries” on the uplands. They
                    may be of different ages, from that of the Britons downwards.</p>
                <p>Of Anglo-Saxon buildings the Danes left almost nothing. The crypt of Wilfrid’s
                    abbey of St Andrew at Hexham is one undoubted remnant; portions of several other
                    churches are very doubtfully pre-Norman. Some thousand Saxon <hi rend="italic"
                    >stycas</hi> found buried at Hexham, the “fridstool” there, and an ornate cross
                    now shared between Rothbury and Newcastle are the other principal vestiges of
                    Saxon times. The Black Dyke, a bank and ditch crossing the line of the Roman
                    wall about three miles east of the Irthing, is supposed by some antiquaries to
                    be the continuation of the Catrail at Peel Fell; the latter was the probable
                    boundary-fence between the Saxon Bernicia and the British Strathclyde.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical architecture of the county suffered greatly at the hands of
                    the Scots. Not a few of the churches were massive structures, tower-like in
                    strength, and fit to defend on occasion. Lindisfarne Priory, the oldest monastic
                    ruin in the county, dates from 1093. Hexham Abbey Church (early 12th century),
                    raised over the crypt of Wilfrid’s cathedral, has been termed a “text-book of
                    Early English architecture it lacks the nave, destroyed by the Scots under
                    λVallace. Of Brinkburn Priory the church remains, and has been well restored.
                    Hulne Abbey, now surrounded by the sylvan loveliness of the Alnwick demesnes,
                    was the first Carmelite monastery in Britain. Besides these there are fragments
                    of Neλv-minster Abbey (1139), Alnwick Abbey (1147), and others. An exquisitely
                    graceful fragment of Tynemouth church is associated with some remains of the
                    older priory. Among churches ought first to be named St Nicholas’s, Newcastle
                    (1350), the prototype of St Giles’s, Edinburgh, and now the cathedral-church of
                    the new diocese. There is a massive Norman church at Norham, and other Norman
                    and Early English churches at Mitford, Bamburgh, Warkworth, Alnwick (St
                    Michael’s), &amp;c., most of them with square towers. The stone roof of the
                    little church at Bellingham, with its heavy semicircular girders, is said to be
                    now unique.</p>
                <p>“It may be said of the houses of the gentry herein,” writes old Fuller, “ ‘quot
                    mansiones, tot munitiones,’ as being all castles or castle-like.” Except a few
                    dwellings of the 16th century in Newcastle, and some mansions built after the
                    Union, the older houses are all castles. A survey of 1460 mentions thirty-seven
                    castles and seventy-eight towers in Northumberland, not probably including all
                    the bastle-houses or small peels of the yeomen. At the Conquest Bamburgh, the
                    seat of the Saxon kings, was the only fortress north of York. Norham Castle was
                    built in 1121. None of the baronial castles are older than the time of Henry I.
                    A grass mound represents Wark Castle. Alnwick Castle is an array of walls and
                    towers covering about five acres. The interior was restored in Italian palace
                    style by the late Duke Algernon. Wark worth, Prudhoe, and Dunstanburgh castles
                    are fine groups of ruins. Dilston Castle has still its romantic memories of the
                    earl of Derwentwater. Bel-say, Haughton, Featherstone, and Chipchase castles are
                    joined with modern mansions. The peel-towers of Elsdon, Whitton (Rothbury), and
                    Embleton were used as fortified rectory-houses. Seaton Délavai was the work of
                    Vanbrugh.</p>
                <p>The place-names of the county may be viewed as its etymological antiquities. The
                    Danish test-word <hi rend="italic">by</hi> we find to be absent. Saxon <hi
                    rend="italic">tons, hams, cleughs</hi> (clefts or ravines), and various
                    patronymics are met with in great numbers; and the Gaelic <hi rend="italic"
                    >knock</hi> (hill) and Cymric <hi rend="italic">caer, dwr</hi> (water), <hi
                    rend="italic">cefn</hi> (ridge), <hi rend="italic">bryn</hi> (brow), &amp;c.,
                    mingle with the Saxon. Many curiosities of nomenclature exist, some strange,
                    some expressive, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Blink-bonny, Blaw-wearie,
                    Skirl-naked.</p>
                <p>A few gleanings of folk-lore still remain for the discriminating collector. The
                    virtues of certain holy wells in ailments or barrenness and of a south-running
                    stream in sickness, the powers of Irish men and cattle over snakes and
                    snake-bites, and the growing of boulders in the earth like bulbs are still
                    latently believed in by many; and there is a general aversion to burying on the
                    sunless side of the churchyard, which is left to suicides and unchristened
                    infants.</p>
                <p>The literary antiquities are the Border ballads. ‘ ‘ I never heard the old song
                    of Percy and Douglas, that I found not my heart more moved than with a trumpet”
                    (Sir Philip Sidney).</p>
