                    Newton Abbot, a markettown of Devonshire, England, on the Teign, 5 miles south
                    by west of Teignmouth, and 6 north of Torquay. The beauty of the neighbouring
                    scenery and the salubrity of the climate have tended of late years to increase
                    the demand for residences, while the situation of the town at the head of the
                    Teign navigation enables it to carry on a considerable shipping trade. St
                    Mary’s, the parish church of Wolborough, about half a mile south of the town, is
                    in the Perpendicular style, as is also the parish church of Highweek, about a
                    mile to the north-west. A very extensive nunnery, called St Augustine’s Priory,
                    was erected near the town in 1861. To the east of the town is Forde House, an
                    Elizabethan structure belonging to the earl of Devon, visited by Charles I. and
                    William of Orange. The other principal buildings are the union workhouse, the
                    town-hall, and the markets. There are two fine public parks, Courtenay Park and
                    Forde Park. The town possesses iron foundries, malt-houses, flour-mills, a
                    tannery, and a brewery. The engine-works of the Great Western Railway have
                    lately been established in the town. Fine potters’ clay and pipeclay are
                    obtained in the neighbourhood, about 6000 tons being exported annually to the
                    potteries. There is a considerable trade in cattle, corn, and agricultural
                    produce. The population of Wolborough with Newton Abbot in 1881 was 7662, and of
                    Highweek 2164.</p>

                    William Lord Brewer, founder of the monastery. Newton Bushel was so called from
                    Robert Bussell or Bushell, foster-child and kinsman of Theobald de Englishville,
                    who was made lord of the manor by Henry III. in 1246.</p>

                    and urban sanitary district of Lancashire, is situated on a branch of the London
                    and North-Western Railway between Liverpool and Manchester, about 15f miles from
                    each. The original town of Newton consists principally of one broad street, but
                    many new buildings have sprung up in the immediate neighbourhood, especially at
                    Earlestown junction, about half a mile distant. There is a town-hall, a
                    mechanics’ institute, and a grammar school. At a short distance from the town is
                    a moated timber-house, and also an ancient barrow of great extent. The Liverpool
                    farm reformatory school is in the neighbourhood. The industrial establishments
                    include the waggon factory of the London and North-Western Railway Company
                    (employing about 1000 hands), a large foundry, printing and stationery works,
                    paper-mills, and sugar refineries. Coal abounds in the neighbourhood. The <pb

                    the Confessor, but after the Conquest it was given to the Langtons. Near the
                    town a party of Highlanders were in 1648 taken prisoners by Cromwell’s troops,
                    and hanged in an adjoining wood, still called Gallow’s Cross. The town possessed
                    the privilege of returning two members to parliament from the 5th of Elizabeth,
                    but was disfranchised in 1832. The population of the urban sanitary district in
                    1871 was 8244, and in 1881 it was 10,580.</p>
