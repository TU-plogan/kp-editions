                <p><label type="entry">NOVATIANUS</label>, Roman presbyter, and one of the earliest
                    antipopes, founder of the sect of the Novatiani or Novatians, was born about the
                    beginning of the 3d century. On the authority of Philostorgius (2/. <hi
                        rend="italic">E.,</hi> viii. 15), he has often been called a native of
                    Phrygia, but perhaps the historian intended by this nothing more than to
                    indicate the Montanistic complexion of Novatian’s creed. Of the facts of his
                    life very little is known, and that only from his opponents. His conversion is
                    said to have taken place after an intense mental struggle; he was baptized by
                    sprinkling, and without episcopal confirmation, when on a sick-bed in hourly
                    expectation of death; and on his recovery his Christianity retained all the
                    stern and gloomy character of its earliest stages. He was ordained to the
                    priesthood at Rome by Fabian, or perhaps by an earlier bishop; and during the
                    Decian persecution he maintained very strenuously the severer view of the
                    church’s disciplinary function, which would have excluded for ever from
                    ecclesiastical communion all those (lapsi) who after baptism had ever sacrificed
                    to idols,—a view which had frequently found expression within the church
                    previously, and which had indeed been the occasion of the schism of Hippolytus.
                    Bishop Fabian suffered martyrdom in January 250, and, when Cornelius was elected
                    his successor in March or April 251, Novatian objected to the new bishop on
                    account of his known laxity on the above-mentioned point of discipline, and
                    allowed himself to be consecrated bishop by the minority who shared his views.
                    He and his followers were excommunicated by the synod held at Rome in October of
                    the same year. He is said by Socrates <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> iv. 28) to
                    have suffered martyrdom under the emperor Valerian. After his death the
                    Novatians, in spite of much opposition, increased, and spread rapidly to almost
                    every province of the empire; they called themselves <hi rend="italic"
                        >καθαροί,</hi> or Puritans, and insisted on rebaptizing their converts from
                    the Catholic view. The eighth canon of the council of Nice provides in a spirit
                    of considerable liberality for the readmission of the clergy of the <hi
                        rend="italic">καθαροί</hi> to the Catholic <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n661/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0917-0661-0604"/> Church, and the sect finally disappeared some
                    two centuries after its origin. Novatian has sometimes been confounded with his
                    contemporary Novatus, a Carthaginian presbyter, who held similar views.</p>
                <p>Novatian was the first Roman Christian who wrote to any considerable extent in
                    Latin. Of his numerous writings three are extant: (1) a letter written in the
                    name of the Roman clergy to Cyprian in 250; (2) a treatise in thirty-one
                    chapters, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Trinitate·,</hi> (3) a
                    letter written at the request of the Roman laity, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Cibis Judaicis.</hi> They are well-arranged compositions,
                    written in an elegant and vigorous style. The best editions are by Welchman
                    (Oxford, 1724) and by Jackson (London, 1728); they are translated in vol. ii. of
                    Cyprian’s works in the <hi rend="italic">Ante-Nicene Theol. Libr.</hi>
                    (Edinburgh, 1869). The Novatian controversy can be advantageously studied in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> of Cyprian.</p>
