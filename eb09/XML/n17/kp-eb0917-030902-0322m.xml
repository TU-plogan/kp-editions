                <p><label type="entry">NEBULAR THEORY</label>. The nebular theory is a famous
                    hypothesis which has been advanced with the view of accounting for the origin of
                    the solar system. It is emphatically a speculation; it cannot be demonstrated by
                    observation or established by mathematical calculation. Yet the boldness and the
                    splendour of the nebular theory have always given it a dignity not usually
                    attached to a doctrine which has so little direct evidence in its favour. It
                    will also be admitted that from the very nature of the case a theory of the
                    origin of the solar system must be devoid of direct testimony. All we could
                    expect to find would be features in that system whose existence the theory would
                    account for; or possibly by looking at other systems we might observe them in
                    phases suggesting the early phases of our own system. It is hard to see what
                    other kind of evidence would be attainable. Now as a matter of fact our system
                    does present many most striking features which could be accounted for by the
                    nebular theory, and the theory also derives as much corroboration from the study
                    of other systems as we could reasonably expect. Hence, as all attainable
                    evidence is on the whole in favour of the nebular theory (though here and there
                    there are exceptional phenomena), astronomers have generally regarded this
                    theory with considerable approval.</p>
                <p>There are very remarkable features in the solar system which point unmistakably
                    to some common origin of many of the different bodies which it contains. We must
                    at once put the comets out of view. It does not appear that they bear any
                    testimony on either side of the question. We do not know whether the comets are
                    really indigenous to the solar system or whether they may not be merely imported
                    into the system from the depths of space. Even if the comets be indigenous to
                    the system, they may, as many suppose, be merely ejections from the sun, or in
                    any case their orbits are exposed to such tremendous perturbations from the
                    planets that it is quite unsafe from the present orbit of a comet to attempt any
                    estimate of what that orbit may have been countless ages ago. On all these
                    grounds we must put the comets on one side for the present, and discuss the
                    nebular theory without any reference thereto. But even with this omission we
                    still muster in the solar system from two to three hundred bodies, almost every
                    one of which pronounces distinctly, though with varying emphasis, in favour of
                    the nebular theory. The first great fact to which we refer is the common
                    direction in which the planets revolve around the sun. This is true not only of
                    the great planets Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
                    Neptune; it is also true of the host of more than two hundred small planets. All
                    these bodies perform their revolution in the same direction. It is also
                    extremely remarkable that all the great planets and many of the small ones have
                    their orbits very nearly in the same plane, and nearly circular in form. Viewed
                    as a question in probabilities, we may ask what the chance is that out of two
                    hundred and fifty bodies revolving around the sun all shall be moving in one
                    direction. If the direction of movement were merely decided by chance, the
                    probability against such an arrangement is of stupendous magnitude. It is
                    represented by the ratio of unity to a number containing about sixty figures,
                    and so we are at once forced to the conclusion that this remarkable feature of
                    the planetary motions must have some physical explanation. In a minor degree
                    this conclusion is strengthened by observing the satellites. Discarding those of
                    Uranus, in which the orbits of the satellites are highly inclined to the
                    ecliptic, and in which manifestly some exceptional though unknown influences
                    have been at work, we may say that the satellites revolve around the primaries
                    also in the same direction; while, to make the picture complete, we find that
                    the planets, so far as they can be observed, rotate on their axes in the same
                    manner.</p>
                <p>The nebular theory here steps in and offers an explanation of this most
                    remarkable uniformity. Laplace supposed that our sun had once a stupendous
                    nebulous atmosphere which extended so far out as to fill all the space at
                    present occupied by the planets. This gigantic nebulous mass, of which the sun
                    was only the central and somewhat more condensed portion, is supposed to have a
                    movement of rotation on its axis. There is no difficulty in conceiving how a
                    nebula, quite independently of any internal motion of its parts, shall also have
                    had as a whole a movement of rotation. In fact a little consideration will show
                    from the law of probabilities that it is infinitely probable that such an object
                    should really have <hi rend="italic">some</hi> movement of rotation, no matter
                    by what causes the nebula may have originated. As this vast mass cooled it must
                    by the laws of heat have contracted towards the centre, and as it contracted it
                    must, according to a well-known law of dynamics, rotate more rapidly. The time
                    would then come when the centrifugal force on the outer parts of the mass would
                    more than counterbalance the attraction of the centre, and thus we would have
                    the outer parts left as a ring. The inner portion will still continue to
                    contract, the same process will be repeated, and thus a second ring will be
                    formed. We have thus grounds for believing that the original nebula will
                    separate into a series of rings all revolving in the same direction with a
                    central nebulous mass in the interior. The materials of each ring would continue
                    to cool and to contract until they passed from the gaseous to the liquid
                    condition. If the consolidation took place with comparative uniformity we might
                    then anticipate the formation of a vast multitude of small planets such as those
                    we actually do find in the region between the orbit of Mars and that of Jupiter.
                    More usually, however, the ring might be expected not to be uniform, and
                    therefore to condense in some parts more rapidly than in others. The effect of
                    such contraction would be to draw into a single mass the materials of the ring,
                    and thus we would have a planet formed, while the satellites of that planet
                    would be developed from the still nascent planet in the same way as the planet
                    itself originated from the sun. In this way we account most simply for the
                    uniformity in the direction in which the planets revolve, and for the mutual
                    proximity of the planes in which their orbits are contained. The rotation of the
                    planets on their axes is also explained, for at the time of the first formation
                    of the planet it must have participated in the rotation of the whole nebula, and
                    by the subsequent contraction of the planet the speed with which the rotation
                    was performed must have been accelerated.</p>

                <p>There is quite a different method of approaching the subject, which leads in a
                    very striking . manner to conclusions practically identical with those we have
                    just sketched. We may commence by dealing with the sun as we find it at the
                    present moment, and then reasoning back to what must have been the case in the
                    earlier epochs of the history of our system. The stupendous daily outpour of
                    heat from the sun at the present time is really, when properly studied, a
                    profound argument in support of the nebular theory. The amount of the sun’s heat
                    has been estimated. We receive on the earth less than one two-thousand-millionth
                    part of the whole radiation. It would seem that the greater part of the rest of
                    that torrent flows away to be be lost in space. Now what supplies this heat? We
                    might at first suppose that the sun was really a mightily heated body radiating
                    out its heat as white hot iron does, but this explanation cannot be admitted in
                    face of the notorious fact that there is no historical evidence that the sun is
                    growing colder. We have not the slightest reason to think that the radiation
                    from the sun is measurably weaker now than it was a couple of thousand years
                    ago, yet it can be shown that, if the sun were merely radiating heat as simply a
                    hot body, then it would cool some degrees every year, and must have cooled many
                    thousands of degrees within the time covered by historical records. We therefore
                    conclude that the sun has some other source of heat than that due simply to
                    incandescence. We can also conceive that the heat of the sun might be supplied
                    by something analogous to combustion. It would take 20 tons of coal a day burned
                    on each square foot of the sun’s surface to supply the daily radiation. Even if
                    the sun were made of one mass of fuel as efficient as coal, that mass must be
                    entirely expended in a few thousand years. We cannot therefore admit that the
                    source of the heat in the sun is to be found in any chemical combination taking
                    place in its mass. Where then can we find an adequate supply of heat? Only one
                    external source can be named: the falling of meteors into the sun must yield
                    some heat just as the flash of a shooting star yields some heat to our
                    atmosphere, but the question is whether the quantity of heat obtainable from the
                    shooting stars is at all adequate for the purpose. It can be shown that unless a
                    quantity of meteors in collective mass equal to our moon were to plunge into the
                    sun every year the supply of heat could not be sustained from this source. Now
                    there is no reason to believe that meteors in anything like this quantity can be
                    supplied to the sun, and therefore we must reject this source as also
                    inadequate.</p>
                <p>The truth about the sun’s heat appears to be that the sun is really an
                    incandescent body losing heat, but that the operation of cooling is immensely
                    retarded owing to a curious circumstance due jointly to the stupendous mass of
                    the sun and to a remarkable law of heat. It is of course well known that if
                    energy disappears in one form it reappears in another, and this principle
                    applied to the sun will explain the famous difficulty.</p>
                <p>As the sun loses heat it contracts, and every pair of particles in the sun are
                    nearer to each other after the contraction than they were before. The energy due
                    to their separation is thus less in the contracted state than in the original
                    state, and as that energy cannot be lost it must reappear in heat. The sun is
                    thus slowly contracting; but as it contracts it gains heat by the operation of
                    the law just referred to, and thus the further cooling and further contraction
                    of the sun is protracted until the additional heat obtained is radiated away. In
                    this way we can reconcile the fact that the sun is certainly losing heat with
                    the fact that the change in temperature has not been large enough to be
                    perceived within historic times.</p>
                <p>It can be shown that the sun is at present contracting, so that its diameter
                    diminishes four miles every century. This is of course an inappreciable distance
                    when compared with the diameter of the sun, which is nearly a million of miles,
                    but the significance for our present purpose depends upon the fact that this
                    contraction is always taking place. A thousand years ago the sun must have had a
                    diameter 40 miles greater than at present, ten thousand years ago that diameter
                    must have been 400 miles more than it is now, and so on. We cannot perhaps
                    assert that the same rate is to be continued for very many centuries, but it is
                    plain that the further we look back into past time the greater must the sun have
                    been.</p>
                <p>Dealing then simply with the laws of nature as we know them, we can see no
                    boundary to the growth of the sun as we look back. We must conceive a time when
                    the sun was swollen to such an extent that it filled up the entire space girdled
                    by the orbit of Mercury. Earlier still the sun must have reached to the Earth.
                    Earlier still the sun must have reached to where Neptune now revolves on the
                    confines of our system, but the mass of the sun could not undergo an expansion
                    so prodigious without being made vastly more rarefied than at present, and hence
                    we are led by this mode of reasoning to the conception of the primaeval nebula
                    from which our system has originated.</p>
                <p>Considering that our sun is but a star, or but one of the millions of stars, it
                    becomes a question of great interest to see whether any other systems present
                    indication of a nebulous origin analogous to that which Laplace proposed for the
                    solar system. In one of his most memorable papers, Sir W. Herschel marshals the
                    evidence which can be collected on this point. He arranges in this paper a
                    selection from his observations on the nebulae in such a way as to give great
                    plausibility to his view of the gradual transmutation of nebulae into stars.
                    Herschel begins by showing us that there are regions in the heavens where a
                    faint diffused nebulosity is all that can be detected by the telescope. There
                    are other nebulae in which a nucleus can be just discerned, others again in
                    which the nucleus is easily seen, and still others where the nucleus is a
                    brilliant star-like point. The transition from an object of this kind to a
                    nebulous star is very natural, while the nebulous stars pass into the ordinary
                    stars by a few graduated stages. It is thus possible to enumerate a series of
                    objects beginning at one end with the most diffused nebulosity and ending at the
                    other with an ordinary fixed star or group of stars. Each object in the series
                    differs but slightly from the object just before it and the object just after
                    it. It seemed to Herschel that he was thus able to view the actual changes by
                    which masses of phosphorescent or glowing vapour became actually condensed down
                    into stars. The condensation of a nebula could be followed in the same manner as
                    we can study the growth of the trees in the forest, by comparing the trees of
                    various ages which the forest contains at the same time. In attempting to
                    pronounce on the evidence with regard to Herschel’s theory, we must at once
                    admit that the transmutation of a nebula into a star has never been seen. It is
                    indeed very doubtful whether any changes of a nebula have ever been seen which
                    are of the same character as the changes Herschel’s theory would require. It
                    seems, however, most likely that the periods of time required for such changes
                    are so stupendous that the changes accomplished in a century or two are
                    absolutely inappreciable.</p>
                <p>The nebular theory is a noble speculation supported by plausible argument, and
                    the verdict of science on the whole subject cannot be better expressed than in
                    the words of Newcomb:—“At the present time we can only'say that the nebular
                    hypothesis is indicated by the general tendencies of the laws of nature, that it
                    has not been proved <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0324-0311"/> to be inconsistent with any fact, that it is
                    almost a necessary consequence of the only theory by which we can account for
                    the origin and conservation of the sun’s heat, but that it rests on the
                    assumption that this conservation is to be explained by the laws of nature as we
                    now see them in operation. Should any one be sceptical as to the sufficiency of
                    these laws to account for the present state of things, science can furnish no
                    evidence strong enough to overthrow his doubts until the sun shall be found
                    growing smaller by actual measurement, or the nebulae be actually seen to
                    condense into stars and systems.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. s. b.)</hi></p>
