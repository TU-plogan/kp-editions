                <p><label type="entry">NIELLO</label> (Italian form of Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >nigellum,</hi> diminutive of <hi rend="italic">niger,</hi> “black”; late Greek,
                    <hi rend="italic">μελανόν),</hi> a method of producing delicate and minute
                    decoration on a polished metal surface by incised lines filled in with a black
                    metallic amalgam. In some cases it is very difficult to distinguish niello from
                    black enamel; but the black substance differs from true enamel in being
                    metallic, not vitreous. Our knowledge of the process and materials employed in
                    niello-work is derived mainly from four writers,—Eraclius the Roman (a writer
                    probably of the 11th century), Theophilus the monk, who wrote in the 12 th or
                    13th century,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Disegno.</hi></p></note> These, with the exception of Eraclius, whose account is
                    slightly different, agree closely in their description of the process. The
                    design was cut with a sharp graving tool on the smooth surface of the metal,
                    which was usually silver, but occasionally gold or even bronze. An alloy was
                    formed of two parts silver, one-third copper, and one-sixth lead; to this
                    mixture, while fluid in the crucible, powdered sulphur in excess was added; and
                    the brittle amalgam, when cold, was finely pounded, and sealed up in large
                    quills for future use. A solution of borax to act as a flux was brushed over the
                    metal plate and thoroughly worked into its incised lines. The powdered amalgam
                    was then shaken out of the quills on to the plate, so as to completely cover all
                    the engraved pattern. The plate was now carefully heated over a charcoal fire,
                    fresh amalgam being added, as the powder fused, upon any defective places. When
                    the powder had become thoroughly liquid, so as to fill all the lines, the plate
                    was allowed to cool, and the whole surface was scraped, so as to remove the
                    superfluous niello, leaving only what had sunk into and filled up the engraved
                    pattern. Last of all the nielloed plate was very highly polished, till it
                    presented the appearance of a smooth metal surface enriched with a delicate
                    design in fine grey-black lines. This process was chiefly used for silver work,
                    on account of the vivid contrast between the whiteness of the silver and the
                    darkness of the niello. As the slightest scratch upon the metal received the
                    niello, and became a distinct black line, ornament of the most minute and
                    refined description could easily be produced.</p>
                <p>The earliest specimens of niello now existing belong to the Roman period. Two
                    fine examples are in the British Museum. One is a bronze statuette of a Roman
                    general, nearly 2 feet high, found at Barking Hall in Suffolk. The dress and
                    armour have patterns partly inlaid in silver and partly in niello. The dark tint
                    of the bronze rather prevents the niello from showing out distinctly. This
                    statuette is apparently a work of the 1st century.<note anchored="true"

                    4th century. It is a silver casket or lady’s toilet box, in which were found an
                    ampulla and other small objects, enriched with niellowork.<note anchored="true"

                <p>From Roman times till the end of the 16th century the art of working in niello
                    seems to have been constantly practised in some part at least of Europe, while
                    in Russia and India it has survived down to the present day. From the 6th to the
                    12th century an enormous number of most massive and splendid works in the
                    precious metals were produced at Byzantium or under Byzantine influence, many of
                    which were largely decorated with niello; the silver dome of the baldacchino
                    over the high altar of S. Sophia was probably one of the most important of
                    these. Niello is frequently mentioned in the inventories of the treasures
                    belonging to the great basilicas of Rome and Byzantium. The Paia d’Oro at S.
                    Mark’s, Venice, 10th century (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Metal-Work),</hi> owes
                    much of its refined beauty to niello patterns in the borders. This art was also
                    practised by Bernward, artist-bishop of Hildesheim <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi>
                    1023); a fine silver paten, decorated with figures in niello, attributed to his
                    hand, still exists among the many rich treasures in the church of Hanover
                    Palace. Other nielli, probably the work of the same bishop, are preserved in the
                    cathedral of Hildesheim. In France too, judging both from existing specimens of
                    ecclesiastical plate and many records preserved in church inventories, this mode
                    of decoration must have been frequently applied all through the Middle Ages:
                    especially fine examples once existed at Notre Dame, Paris, and at Cluny, where
                    the columns of the sanctuary were covered with plates of -silver in the 11th
                    century, each plate being richly ornamented with designs in niello. Among the
                    early Teutonic and Celtic races, especially from the 8th to the 11th centuries,
                    both in Britain and other countries, niello was frequently used to decorate the
                    very beautiful personal ornaments of which so many specimens enrich the museums
                    of Europe. The British Museum possesses a fine fibula of silver decorated with a
                    simple pattern in niello and thin plates of repoussé gold. This, though very
                    similar in design to many fibulae from Scandinavia and Britain, was found, in a
                    tomb at Kertch (Panticapaeum).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of Kertch,</hi> pl.
                    v.</p></note> Several interesting gold rings of Saxon workmanship have been
                    found at different times, on which the owner’s name and ornamental patterns are
                    formed in gold with a background of niello. One with the name of Ethelwulf, king
                    of Wessex (836-838), is now in the British Museum (see figure). Another in the
                    South Kensington Museum has the name of Alhstan, who was bishop of Sherborne
                    from 823 to 867. The metal-workers of Ireland, whose skill was quite unrivalled,
                    practised largely the art of niello from the 10 th to the 12 th cen tury, and
                    possibly even earlier. Fine croziers, shrines, fibulae, and other objects of
                    Irish workmanship, most skilfully enriched with elaborate niello-work, exist in
                    considerable numbers. From the 13th to the 16th century but little niello-work
                    appears to have been produced in England. Two specimens have been found, one at
                    Matlask, Norfolk, and the other at Devizes, which from the character of the
                    design appear to be English. They are both of gold, and seem to be the covering
                    plates of small pendent reliquaries, about an inch long, dating about the end of
                    the 15th century. One has a crucifix between St John the Baptist and a bishop;
                    the other, that found at Devizes, has the two latter figures, but no
                    crucifix.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    art of niello-work was brought to greatest perfection. During the whole
                    mediaeval period it was much used to decorate church plate, silver
                    altar-frontals, and the like. The magnificent frontals of Pistoia cathedral and
                    the Florence baptistery are notable instances of this.<note anchored="true"

                    Diptychorum,</hi> vol. iii., Florence, 1759.</p></note> During the 15th century,
                    especially at Florence, the art of niello-work was practised by almost all the
                    great artist-goldsmiths<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n536/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0536-0495"/> of that period. Apart from the beauty of the
                    works they produced, this art had a special importance and interest from its
                    having led the way to the invention of printing from engravings on metal plates.
                    For the description of how this happened see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Engraving,</hi> vol. viii. p. 439. Vasari’s account of this invention, given in
                    his lives of Pollajuolo and Maso Finiguerra (<hi rend="italic">Vite dei Pittori
                    e S</hi><hi rend="italic">cultori),</hi> is very interesting, but he is probably
                    wrong in asserting that Maso was the first worker in niello who took proofs or
                    impressions of his plates. The most important work of this sort by Maso
                    Finiguerra, described at length by Vasari, still exists in the Opera del Duomo
                    at Florence. It is a pax with a very rich and delicate niello picture of the
                    coronation of the virgin; the composition is very full, and the work almost
                    microscopic in minuteness; it was made in 1452. Impressions from it are
                    preserved in the British Museum, the Louvre, and other collections. Among the
                    many great Italian artists who were also niellists occur the names of
                    Brunelleschi, Ant. Pollajuolo, Baccio Baldini, Francia, Pellegrino da Cesena,
                    Cellini, Caradosso, and Foppa. Some fine specimens signed by Francia are
                    preserved in the Bargello at Florence. The British Museum, the Louvre, the
                    Berlin Museum, and the royal gallery of Vienna are especially rich both in
                    nielli and in sulphur and paper impressions. The British Museum also possesses
                    the finest existing example of 15th-century German niello. It is a silver
                    beaker, covered with graceful scroll-work, forming medallions, in which are
                    figures of cupids employed in various occupations;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is well illustrated in Shaw’s <hi

                    and beauty of execution. The art of niello-work is still practised with
                    considerable skill both in Russia and in various parts of India. The “bidri
                    work,” so called from Bedar in Hyderabad, is a variety of niello, in which the
                    pattern shows as silver on a niello ground. The modern revival of the art in
                    Paris has been hitherto very unsuccessful.</p>
