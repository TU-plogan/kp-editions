                <p><label type="entry">NEW ORLEANS</label>, a city of the United States, situated on
                    the left bank of the Mississippi, 107 miles from its mouth, in that portion of
                    the State of Louisiana which constitutes the river’s larger delta. This peculiar
                    region is an irregular expanse of densely-wooded swgmps, wide prairies, and
                    sea-marshes, interlaced by innumerable lakes, streams, and bays, formed by the
                    periodic overflows of the river upon the alluvium of its own deposit, and by
                    remnants of the sea which this natural process of land-making has not yet
                    conquered. It embraces the whole coast of Louisiana on its southern border, and,
                    narrowing rapidly northward, presents a total area of some 20,000 square miles
                    of land and water. Through this region the Mississippi, as in its southward
                    course it reaches the 30th parallel of latitude, turns and runs tortuously
                    eastward a few miles south of and parallel with a chain of these delta
                    lakes—Lake Pontchartrain being the chief—which marks the course of the same
                    river in prehistoric, but not geologically remote, ages. At the 90th degree of
                    longitude it bends abruptly southward, then as suddenly eastward again, then
                    northward and again eastward, thus portioning off on the low, concave land,
                    which is always highest at the river’s margin, a shallow basin rudely square in
                    shape and not unlike the palm of one’s hand. This deep three-sided bend, some 9
                    miles in total length, is the harbour of New Orleans, and on the low tract
                    walled in by the dyke or levée that lines its bank, and by a similar defence
                    where Lake Pontchartrain, some 4 to 6 miles to the northward, shuts in the
                    fourth side, lies New Orleans, the principal seaport of the Mississippi valley,
                    and a city of 216,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The river at this point varies from 1500 to 3000 feet in width, and its broad
                    channel often stretches almost from shore to shore, with a depth varying
                    frequently at short intervals from 60 to more than 200 feet. Around the margins
                    of this fine harbour a line of steamers and shipping extends for 7 miles on
                    either shore, moored, in the busy season, from two to five abreast, to the outer
                    end of short, broad, unsheltered wooden wharves that rest on piles driven firmly
                    into the tenacious clay of the river’s bed. The speed of the current reaches, in
                    times of high water, a rate of 5 miles an hour. Along the immediate front of the
                    city’s principal commercial quarter, this current, losing some of its force by
                    change of direction, deposits its alluvium in such quantities as to produce a
                    constant encroachment of the shore upon the harbour. At its widest this new
                    land, or batture, with wharves, streets, and warehouses following eagerly after
                    it, has advanced nearly 1500 feet beyond the water-line of a century and a half
                    ago.</p>
                <p>New Orleans is emphatically a commercial city. It was its commercial value as the
                    southern gateway of the immense valley behind it, and as the key to the free
                    navigation’ of that vast natural system of waterways of which the Mississippi is
                    the great main artery that, upon the achievement of American national autonomy,
                    gave a small, poor, and remote Franco-Spanish-American port its political
                    importance, and in 1803 led to its purchase by the United States, and the
                    purchase with it of the entire province of Louisiana, of which it was the
                    capital in embryo; and it is almost solely as the dispenser of the products of
                    this greatest agricultural valley in the world that New Orleans has grown from
                    the wild and indolent little frontier town of 10,000 inhabitants it then was to
                    the dimensions of a great city. Along its winding harbour front one sees, in the
                    season that follows the harvests of the south and west, the energies and
                    activities of an exporting movement not excelled in volume or value on the
                    American continent save by New York. The levée, the wharves, and the contiguous
                    streets teem with strenuous life, and are gorged with the raw staples of the
                    countries far and near that lie about the Mississippi and its greater and lesser
                    tributaries,—sugar, molasses, rice, tobacco, Indian corn, pork, staves, whisky,
                    wheat, oats, flour in immense quantities, and, over and above all else, nearly
                    one-fourth of the world’s entire supply of cotton. All other movement is
                    subsidiary or insignificant: the import trade is small; <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0430-0403"/> manufactures are inconsiderable; mining interests
                    are almost unknown. There are no fisheries, no naval construction, no large
                    transit of immigrants, no notable Government establishments except a branch mint
                    and the customhouse. There are no great educational and scientific institutions
                    or important conservatories of art—only the promising germs of such; no famous
                    galleries or museums; no noted monuments; in short, well-nigh none of that
                    multiplicity of pursuits and opportunities that retains and multiplies rapidly a
                    city’s wealth, and makes the inspiring tumult of metropolitan life. On any hand
                    it requires but a step or two aside from the current of commercial movement to
                    carry one into the bowery repose of a huge suburb rather than of a city, or, if
                    of a city, a city of villas and cottages, of umbrageous gardens, intersected by
                    470 miles of unpaved streets shaded by forest trees, haunted by song birds,
                    fragrant with a wealth of flowers that never fails a day in the year, and
                    abundant, in season, with fruit—the fig, the plum, the pomegranate, the orange.
                    No other large city in America is so laid open to the sunshine and the air.
                    Neither St Louis, nor Chicago, nor Philadelphia, nor New York covers so large a
                    site as New Orleans, whose inhabitants, considerably under a quarter of a
                    million in number, have spread out their town over an area of 155 square
                    miles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This has not been
                    entirely within the boundaries already described. A modern part of the city, of
                    some extent, lies on the right bank of the harbour, opposite these older
                    portions that occupy the river front where it turns from north to
                    east.</p></note></p>
                <p>New Orleans is exceptionally interesting among cities of the United States for
                    the picturesqueness of its older sections, and the language, tastes, and customs
                    of a large portion of its people. Its history is comparatively short; but it is
                    as sombre and unique as the dark, wet cypress forest draped in long, pendent
                    Spanish moss that once occupied its site, and which still encircles its low
                    horizon. It was founded in 1718 by Jean Baptiste Lemoyne de Bienville, a French
                    Canadian, governor of the French colony which nineteen years earlier had been
                    planted by his brother D’Iberville on the neighbouring shores of the Gulf, along
                    the eastern margin of the Bay of Biloxi. A few years after its founding, and
                    while it was still but little more than a squalid village of deported
                    galley-slaves, trappers, and gold hunters, it was made the capital of that vast
                    Louisiana which loosely comprised the whole Mississippi valley to Canada on the
                    north and without boundary on the west, under the commercial domain and monopoly
                    of John Law’s scheme, so famed in history under the merited nickname of the
                    Mississippi Bubble. The names remaining in vogue in that part of the city still
                    distinguished as the “vieux carré,” or “old French quarter,” continue to
                    preserve an interesting record of these humble beginnings. The memory of French
                    Bourbon dominion is retained in the titles, and in the foreign aspect as well,
                    of Toulouse, and Orleans, and Du Maine, and Conti, and Bourbon, and Dauphiné,
                    and Chartres Streets; while . even more distinctly the Bourbon of Spain has
                    superimposed his impress on frequent stuccoed wall and iron lattice, huge locks
                    and hinges, arches and gratings, balconies, jalousies, corrugated roofs of
                    tiles, dim corridors, com pavements, and inner courts brightened with parterres,
                    urns, and basins, statues half hid in roses and vines, and sound of trickling
                    water. There are streets named from his governors, too:—Unzaga, Galvez, Miro,
                    Salcedo, Casa Calvo, Carondelet, and the Baron Carondelet’s Baronne. The moated
                    and palisaded boundaries constructed in wild and unsafe days are indicated by
                    the wide, tree-planted, and grassy avenues named respectively from the Canal,
                    the Rampart, and the Esplanade that lay along their course; and the old parade
                    ground in the midst of the early town’s river front, now laid off in
                    flower-beds, white-shelled walks, and shaven shrubbery, and known as Jackson
                    Square, still retains, with that official title, its older name of the Place
                    d’Armes. In this quaint, sunny, and dusty old garden, surrounded by an
                    unconscious picturesqueness of architecture not seen elsewhere in America save
                    in one or two remote nooks, by the old cabildo and calaboza, the court-house
                    (once the presbytery of Capuchin friars), the cathedral of St Louis, and the
                    long row of red shops shaded by broad verandas in the streets of St Peter and St
                    Ann,—in this square is commemorated nearly every event in the colonial history
                    of Louisiana. Here in early days were landed those cargoes of French girls
                    supplied each with a chest of clothing by the king, and proudly famed long
                    afterward by their numerous and prosperous descendants as the ‘ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> filles à la cassette ”— the girls with trflnks. Here
                    from 1729 to 1739 rallied these motley gatherings of men—white, red, and
                    black—in the buckskin and feathers of the wilderness, the gay colours, gold
                    braid, and ruffles of royal uniforms, and the black nakedness of slavery, that
                    with varying success made ten years’ war against Natchez, Yazoo, Choctaw, and
                    Chickasaw savages. Here in 1765 the people welcomed with tears and open arms
                    their exiled brethren from far <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n431/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0431-0404"/> Acadia, as thirty-six years before on the same
                    spot they had received the women and children of Fort Rosalie (Natchez),
                    recaptured from the hands of the savages who had massacred their husbands and
                    fathers. Here in 1768, the town being then a place of about 3200 souls, the
                    people within the walls and from the farms and plantations of the surrounding
                    delta mustered under arms almost to a man, repudiated the cession of Louisiana
                    to Spain, and compelled the holder of the Spanish king’s commission to leave
                    their town and return to Havana. Here again, in the following year, Don
                    Alexandro O’Reilly landed from a fleet of twenty-four vessels with 2600 Spanish
                    troops and fifty pieces of artillery, and restored the Spanish power by mere
                    terror of such an overwhelming force. Here stood under Spanish sentence and fell
                    under a volley of Spanish musketry the leaders in this the first attempt made in
                    America to overthrow by force of arms the dominion of a European sovereign. It
                    was here, again, that in 1779 the brilliant young Spanish governor Galvez,
                    laying before the people the proposal to head them in defence of their homes,
                    and intending to lead them against the neighbouring British posts along the
                    shores of the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico east of it, was answered by
                    their acclamations, and was followed to repeated and uninterrupted victory.
                    Here, when in 1788 and 1794 the heart of the frail wooden town was plucked out
                    by fire, the houseless sufferers covered the rank sward with booths and tents
                    until that Spanish-American architecture could rise out of the ashes whose brick
                    and stucco and coloured limewashes, and flowery inner courts seen through
                    covered carriage-ways, and overhanging balconies, and confusion of heights and
                    breadths and shapes, with here and there a palm tree lifting its stately top
                    among them, heavy with yellow dates, still offer to the eye a moss-grown and
                    crumbling picture whose variety and poetry tempts description to repeat
                    itself.</p>
                <p>On the 30th of November 1803, in the council hall of the old cabildo that still
                    overlooks the square, the aged governor Salcedo handed the keys of the city back
                    to the representatives of the French Government, the marquis of Casa Calvo
                    declared the people of Louisiana absolved from their allegiance to the Spanish
                    king, and on the flagstaff in the open plaza the yellow flag of Spain came down
                    and the tricolor of France arose in its place. And here, at length, only twenty
                    days afterward, with similar ceremonies, the keys of the city passed from the
                    hands of the French colonial prefect to those of the commissioners for the
                    United States, and through their tears the creoles saw the ensign of the French
                    republic sink and the American flag unfurl over what is to-day, as it was then,
                    the least American of all the cities within the bounds of the American States. A
                    bronze equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson stands in the middle of the ground on
                    the spot where, in January 1815, when he had driven back to its ships from the
                    plains just below the city the bleeding remnant of a formidable British
                    invasion, he passed, amid all the evidences of joy that a delivered city could
                    display— cheers and salvos and rolling drums, arms and banners and maidens’
                    garlands—under an arch of triumph and into the cathedral, and so onward in later
                    years to the highest seat in the nation.</p>
                <p>At the time (1803) when New Orleans with its 10,000 inhabitants, mostly French
                    creoles and their slaves, passed into the political bond of the United States,
                    the prospect of its future commercial greatness was not only appreciated but was
                    exaggerated even by the most sagacious minds; for they regarded it in the light
                    of its remarkable geographical position, and of those stirrings of revolution
                    which were beginning to promise the birth of other republics round about the
                    broad circuit of the Mexican Gulf, with maritime powers and commercial energies
                    that must give the position of New Orleans an inestimable value. But, as the
                    future gradually unfolded, on the one hand the provinces that did throw off the
                    Spanish yoke failed persistently to establish internal peace and stability or
                    obtain the confidence of the commercial world, and on the other hand the
                    invention of railway transit revolutionized commerce itself and turned its
                    courses across the natural highways and barriers of the continent; and when,
                    moreover, the pestilence of yellow fever, the plague of the Gulf, made New
                    Orleans one of its most famous ambuscades, and the provincialism and lethargy of
                    an isolated and indolent civilization allowed this last unfortunate condition to
                    remain uncorrected, the limitations to the city’s commercial grandeur were
                    distinctly drawn around it, and a port that had promised to become one of the
                    greatest in the world became, even while it was expanding to metropolitan
                    dimensions, a monument of golden possibilities dwarfed by unforeseen and
                    overpowering disadvantages.</p>
                <p>New Orleans held its highest place on the comparative scale of cities in the
                    United States when, by the census of 1840, only New York, Philadelphia, and
                    Baltimore were greater in population. In the decade that followed, these cities
                    left it far behind and others overtook it and passed it by. In the second decade
                    after the junction of the great west and the Atlantic seaboard by canals and
                    railways many other conditions came in to the great disadvantage of New Orleans.
                    The development of the carrying trade on the lakes of the far north, the
                    adoption by the world’s maritime trade of ships and steamers drawing too much
                    water to pass the bars at the mouth of the Mississippi, and in the city the riot
                    made by death, which in three years (1853-55) from a population diminished by
                    flight to barely 145,000 carried off over 35,000 persons,—these things and
                    others combined to impede the town’s progress at a period when the growth of
                    American cities was a marvel of the times, and to reduce her comparative
                    importance in population, wealth, enlightenment, and architectural dignity.</p>
                <p>However, turning from these comparisons and contrasting the city only with
                    itself, we see the trading post described by the priest-chronicler Charlevoix in
                    1721 as a place of a hundred wretched hovels in a malarious wet thicket of
                    willows and dwarf palmettos, infested by serpents and alligators, changed in
                    1860 to a metropolis whose exports, imports, and domestic receipts aggregated
                    $324,000,000. In that year the election of a president from the Republican party
                    was made the occasion of acts that led to war between the Northern and Southern
                    States of the Union. The commerce of New Orleans experienced an early paralysis:
                    the port was soon blockaded by the United States navy; the city fell into the
                    hands of the Federal forces; and its aggrandizement suffered a recoil from which
                    it has taken nearly a quarter of a century to recover. Only in the present year
                    (1883) will its total commerce again distinctly reach the magnitude it enjoyed
                    in 1860. Its wealth in 1882 was $112,000,000. In the present year it is closely
                    estimated that 2,000,000 bales of cotton will be received across its levee for
                    shipment to the world’s markets. It appears highly probable that those drawbacks
                    which have been enumerated have at length expended their power, and that New
                    Orleans now looks out upon a future of more genuine promise than ever before. A
                    system of jetties at the mouth of the Mississippi, built by the distinguished
                    engineer Eads in 1879, has opened the city’s deep and spacious harbour to the
                    largest ocean craft. Lines of steamers to the great ports of Europe are
                    replacing with their great carrying capacity the light tonnage of other days. An
                    active sanitary system, which grows every year better, gives reasonable promise
                    of immunity from the deadly epidemics of former years; street paving has
                    recommenced; the inadequate and superficial drainage is being improved, under
                    the direction of a sanitary association auxiliary to the board of health, a
                    diligent house-to-house inspection is being performed, and the open gutters that
                    are in all the streets are daily flushed during the warm months with water
                    thrown into them by powerful pumps at the river front. The annual mortality-rate
                    of the three years 1879 to 1881 averaged 26 ’ 52 per 1000. The old spirit of
                    dependence upon natural advantages which once deluded the people of the city is
                    yielding to a more energetic acceptance of the principles of modern commerce,
                    and railway connexions, near and remote, are increasing year by year. The
                    immense increase of population and products in that wide south-west that
                    stretches out beyond to the Mexican border offers new accessions of commercial
                    tribute. Mexico holds out fair assurance of a new era of political order and
                    material development; and within the city’s immediate bounds both the
                    convictions of her citizens and the movement of capital are recognizing
                    theoretically and practically the necessity and advantage of manufactures. About
                    ten million dollars are at present invested in this direction, and the aggregate
                    is steadily growing.</p>
                <p>Within the last two years (1882-83) a new impulse towards architectural
                    improvement has shown itself, and several edifices of comparatively imposing
                    character have been erected. Chief among them is the new Cotton Exchange. The
                    small public squares here and there in the city have been laid out in lawns and
                    adorned with fountains; but, as long as the great body of the people is not
                    subjected to the discomforts of pent-up living, the larger reservations of
                    ground intended for public parks are likely to remain as they are, unimproved.
                    Suburban pleasure resorts are few, the principal being two waterside gardens of
                    moderate pretension on the neighbouring margin of Lake Ponchartrain.</p>
                <p>The creoles of New Orleans and the surrounding delta are a handsome, graceful,
                    intelligent race, of a decidedly Gallic type, though softened in features,
                    speech, and carriage, and somewhat relaxed in physical and mental energies by
                    the enervating influences that blow from the West Indies and the Spanish Main.
                    Their better class does not offer to the eye that unpleasing evidence of gross
                    admixture of race which distinguishes those Latin-American communities around
                    the borders of the adjacent seas; and the name they have borrowed from those
                    regions does not necessarily imply, any more than it excludes, a departure from
                    a pure double line of Latin descent. They are brave, proud, courteous, slow to
                    offend, quick to resent, gay, fond of pomp, and display an ardent relish for
                    pageantries of such childish sort as offers a strong hint of their
                    Spanish-American relationship. They are very musical, yet not, as a class,
                    highly trained in music, have some love of the fine arts, but are little
                    acquainted with or interested in its modern developments, and are comparatively
                    unproductive of art work. The famous carnival displays of New Orleans are
                    participated in largely by the <hi rend="italic">“Américain,"</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Anglo-American; but they mark one of the victories
                    of Spanish-American over North-American tastes, and probably owe mainly to the
                    <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Américain</hi>” their pretentious
                    dignity and to the creole théïr more legitimate harlequin frivolity. Out of the
                    simple <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n432/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0432-0405"/> idea of masked revelry in the open streets, as
                    borrowed from the great Italian cities, the American bent for organization
                    appears to have developed, by a natural growth, the costly fashion of gorgeous
                    torch-lighted processions of elaborately equipped masques in tableaux drawn on
                    immense cars by teams of caparisoned mules, and combining to illustrate in a
                    symmetrical whole some theme chosen from the great faiths or literatures of
                    history. This carnival has grown to last two or three days, during which time
                    its extravagances quite engross public attention with an elaborate
                    mockrestoration of the gaudiest Oriental and feudal European life and times; the
                    daily press shows long lists of names of citizens knighted or invested with
                    imaginary dukedoms (at a fixed price); and many thousands of visitors from all
                    parts of America come, or tarry, yearly to see these laborious pomps.</p>
                <p>The first settlers of New Orleans were such men as colonies in America were
                    generally made of when planted by royal commercial enterprise, and such wives as
                    could be gathered hap-hazard from the ranks of Indian allies, African slave
                    cargoes, and the inmates of French houses of correction. As time passed, gentler
                    and often better blood was infused by the advent of the filles à la cassette, by
                    victims of lettres-de-cachet, by the cadets of noble families, holding land
                    grants or military commissions, by Spanish officials glad to strengthen their
                    influence in the colony through matrimonial alliances, and by royalists fleeing
                    the terrors of the French Revolution. The creole civilization that grew from
                    these sources acquired two of its strongest characteristics from the facts,
                    first that it developed under the evil reigns of French and Spanish Bourbons,
                    and second that it was founded on the system of African slavery. The influences
                    of the climate and landscape were such as to emphasize rather than counteract
                    the effects of these conditions; and, when in the year 1809 Napoleon’s wars
                    caused an exodus of West Indian creoles into New Orleans that immediately
                    doubled the town’s population, the place naturally and easily became the one
                    stronghold of Latin-American ideas in the United States, a harbour of
                    contrabandists, Guadeloupian pirates, and Spanish-American revolutionists and
                    filibusters. Under the glacier-like pressure of Anglo-American immigration,
                    capital, enterprise, and education, this creole civilization has slowly and with
                    stubborn reluctance yielded ground, and is at length fairly beginning to
                    amalgamate with the better social system of the American nation. And yet the
                    creole has stamped his initials upon well-nigh every aspect in the life of the
                    city that has broadened out so widely on every side of his antique town. Some
                    effect, of course, is attributable to those natural surroundings that have so
                    qualified the creole’s own Gallic energies. Between the two influences the whole
                    life of the j&gt;lace shows an apathy of desire, a langour of performance, and
                    an intolerance of all sorts of rigour, that makes it unlike those sister cities
                    from which it is separated both by the entire breadth and by the peculiar
                    sentiment of that great belt of States which still distinguishes itself, more
                    proudly than profitably, as the South.</p>
                <p>Churches, both Catholic and Protestant, are very numerous in New Orleans, though
                    not generally fine or imposing. St Patrick’s, however, has a majestic tower; the
                    First Presbyterian church, in Lafayette Square, is a tasteful Gothic structure;
                    and the cathedral of St Louis, the church of the Immaculate Conception, in
                    Baronne Street, and some others have handsome interiors. The number of private
                    charitable institutions is also large, and their management excellent. Those
                    under municipal control are not nearly so good, but are improving. The system of
                    public education is a large and excellent one deserving much praise. It embraces
                    the youth both of the white and of the black and mulatto populations, is carried
                    up through a full high-school grade, and is steadily improving. The police force
                    is small, ill-paid, and inefficient, and the whole police system dilapidated and
                    bad.</p>
                <p>The coloured population, notwithstanding the presence among it of that noted free
                    quadroon class which has enjoyed a certain legal freedom for many generations,
                    has not greatly improved since the date of emancipation. A conventional system
                    of caste cuts them off from the stimulating hope of attaining social rank, and
                    confines them closely to servile employments. The probability seems to be that
                    their decided elevation must wait upon their acquisition of material wealth, an
                    achievement which the conditions mentioned and some inherent deficiencies of the
                    race tend to make extremely difficult. Besides the large Anglo-American and
                    creole populations, there are in New Orleans weighty fractions of Irish and
                    Germans and an appreciable number of Italians, Sicilians, and Spaniards. The
                    Babel of tongues in the “French Market” immediately below Jackson Square and at
                    the “Picayunè Tier” just adjacent is famed as far as the city of which it is a
                    feature. Another noted feature of New Orleans is its cemeteries. Owing to the
                    undrained condition of the subsoil, burials are made entirely above ground, in
                    tombs of stuccoed brick and of granite and marble. Some of these are very
                    elegant and costly, and many of the burial-grounds, with their long alleys of
                    these tombs of diverse designs deeply shaded by avenues of cedars and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Magnolia grandiflora,</hi> possess a severe but emphatic
                    beauty.</p>
                <p>The climate is not marked by extremes of heat or cold. The wide reaches of water
                    and wet lands that lie about the city on every side temper all airs, and the
                    thermometer rarely passes above 95° or below 27° F. The consequent humidity of
                    the atmosphere, however, gives the climate an enervating quality and an apparent
                    warmth and cold beyond the actual temperature. It is rarely invigorating, and
                    during the long summer between June and October is distinctly though not
                    severely debilitating; but in the absence of epidemic yellow fever, whose
                    visitations are becoming more and more infrequent, there is no “sickly season”;
                    and those who visit the city between the months of November and June, the term
                    in which the commercial movement is at its height, may enjoy from its beginning
                    to its end the delights and beauties of a redundant spring time, and find easy
                    entrance into the social gaieties of a high-spirited pleasure-loving people. (G.
