                    CRUZ. These islands form part of the long chain of groups in the west Pacific
                    known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Melanesia</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.),</hi>
                    having the Solomon Islands about 200 miles west and north-west of their northern
                    and New Caledonia at the same distance west of their southern extremity. They
                    extend for about 700 miles between 9° 45' and 20° 16' S. lat., and between 165°
                    40' and 170° 30' E. long.,—the Santa Cruz group lying about 100 miles north of
                    the New Hebrides. Excepting the small Torres group in the North New Hebrides,
                    and some other small islands north of Santa Cruz which are all perched on reefs,
                    but without lagoons, all the islands are of volcanic formation, the larger ones
                    lying on both sides of the line of volcanic activity. The largest of them, being
                    thought by its discoverer, Quiros (1606), to be the long-sought Terra Australis,
                    was named by him Australia del Espiritu Santo. It is 75 by 40 miles; its peaks
                    and mountains have a fine appearance from the sea. Pottery is made here as in
                    Fiji and New Caledonia, the manufacture being suggested, it is said, by the form
                    and material of the hornet’s nest <hi rend="italic">(Fumenes · xanthura).</hi>
                    South-east from Espiritu Santo lie Mallicolo (56 by 20 miles), with a fine
                    harbour, and Ambrym (22 by 17 miles), very beautiful, with a great volcano, 2800
                    feet; south of this Lopevi, a perfect volcanic cone, also active, rises to 5000
                    feet. Farther south are Vaté or Sandwich Island (30 by 15 miles), with the very
                    fine harbour of Havannah; Erromango (30 by 22 miles; 3000 feet), where
                    sandalwood is still found; Tanna (18 by 10 miles), containing Yasowa, the
                    largest volcano of the group; and Aneiteum, the most southerly (2788 feet).
                    Sulphur from the volcanoes is exported. Santa Cruz or Nitendi Island was the
                    scene of Mendana’s ill-fated attempt in 1595 to found a colony; and on Vanikoro,
                    south of Santa Cruz, La Pérouse’s expedition was lost (1788). Except in the two
                    localities above mentioned, and at Aneiteum, the coasts are almost free from
                    reefs (the subterranean heat being probably fatal to zoophyte life), and the
                    shores rise abruptly from deep water, the hills being densely wooded, and the
                    scenery and vegetation singularly varied and beautiful. The trees— <hi
                    rend="italic">Casuaτina,</hi> candle nut <hi rend="italic">(Aleurites
                    triloba),</hi> kaurie pine (on Tanna), various species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ficus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Myrtaceae,</hi> and many others—are magnificent;
                    the cocoa-nut is not confined to the coast, but grows high up the valleys on the
                    hill-sides. Beautiful crotons and dracaenas abound. Besides the breadfruit,
                    sago-palm, banana, sugar, yam, taro, arrowroot, and several forest fruits, the
                    orange, pine-apple, and other imported species flourish; and European vegetables
                    are exported to Sydney. The fibres of various <hi rend="italic">Urticeae</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Malvaceae</hi> are used.</p>
                <p>No land mammals are known except the rat and <hi rend="italic">Pteropidae.</hi>
                    Birds (species) are less numerous than in the Solomon Islands. Pigeons, parrots,
                    ducks, and swallows are common, and a <hi rend="italic">Megapodius</hi> is
                    found. Of fish more than one hundred kinds are known, mostly inferior as food,
                    and some poisonous. Whales and bêche-de-mer abound and are fished for. There are
                    two kinds of serpents (harmless), three or four lizards, and two turtles;
                    locusts, grasshoppers, butterflies, and hornets are numerous.</p>
                <p>The population is perhaps 50,000. Isolated Polynesian communities occur on the
                    smaller islands; and on Vaté—and perhaps also on Santa Cruz and Vanua La
                    vu—there is an infusion of Polynesian blood, producing a taller, fairer, and
                    less savage population. The people, however, vary on every island. At Aneiteum
                    they are all Christians, and this influence predominates in the neighbouring
                    southern islands of the group; on Vaté and Tanna, too, there are European
                    factories (cotton and copra), but the population is dwindling rapidly. Motu, in
                    the Santa Cruz group, was the late Bishop Patteson’s principal island station.
                    The general type is an ugly one: below the middle height, fairer than the
                    typical Papuan, with low receding foreheads, broad faces, and flat noses. They
                    wear nose-and ear-rings and bracelets of shells, and frequently nothing else.
                    The men, but not the women, drink kava. They are constantly fighting; their
                    weapons are bows and arrows, often beautifully designed, clubs of elaborate
                    patterns, spears, and latterly muskets. Their houses are either the round huts
                    described by Mendana three hundred years ago, or rectangular with pitched roofs
                    resting on three parallel rows of posts; in Vate the reception houses are
                    adorned with festoons of bones and shells. In Aurora the roof is set directly on
                    the ground, with a square doorway 2 feet high in a deep gable at the end. The
                    villages are scrupulously clean and neat, and ornamented with flowering shrubs,
                    crotons, and dracaenas. .</p>
                <p>In character the people differ in different islands, but much of their
                    inhospitality and savagery, disastrously shown in the murder of several
                    missionaries, Bishop Patteson, and Captain Goodenough, is traced to the
                    misconduct and cruelty of traders and labour agents, or to revenge for the
                    introduction of epidemic diseases. In some islands there is the objection also
                    found among Malays to mention their names, or as in Australia the name of the
                    mother-, sister-, and daughter-in-law. They are inveterate cannibals, with a few
                    exceptions<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n419/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0419-0396"/>, as at Santa Cruz and Banks’s Islands (North New
                    Hebrides). They believe much in sorceries and omens; but prayer and offerings
                    (usually of shell money<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The <hi rend="italic">Cypraea</hi><hi rend="italic">moneta</hi> is used
                    here, as in New Caledonia, as a medium of exchange.</p></note>) are addressed
                    mainly to the spirits of the (recently) dead, and there is another class of
                    spirits, called Vui, who are appealed to when incorporate in certain stones or
                    animals; of one or two such the divinity is recognized generally. By the
                    villages a space shadowed by a great banyan tree is often set apart for dances
                    and public meetings. A certain sacredness attaches also sometimes to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Casuarina</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Cycas.</hi> An important
                    institution is the club-house, in which there are various grades, whereon a
                    man’s rank and influence mainly depend, his grade being recognized even if he
                    goes to another island where his language is unintelligible. In like manner a
                    division into two great exogamous groups prevails, at all events throughout the
                    northern islands. It would therefore seem that the present diversity of
                    languages in the group must be of relatively recent origin. These languages or
                    dialects are numerous, and mutually unintelligible, but alike as to grammatical
                    construction, and belonging to the Melanesian class.</p>
