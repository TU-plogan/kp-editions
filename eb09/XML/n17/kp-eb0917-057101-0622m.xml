                    districts of Bengal, Rewah, the Bundelkhand states, and the Central Provinces,
                    and on the W. by Gwalior, Ràjputàna, and the Punjab, with an area under British

                    lieutenant-governor at Allahâbâd, but in respect of its land and courts it still
                    remains a distinct chief-commissionership. With this exception, the
                    North-Western Provinces include the whole upper portion of the Gangetic basin
                    from the Himâlayas and the Punjab plain to the Vindhyân plateau and the
                    low-lying rice-fields of Bengal. Taken as a whole, the lieutenant-governorship
                    consists of the richest wheat-bearing country in India. It contains many of the
                    most famous cities of Indian history and is studded with thriving villages,
                    interspersed at distances with large commercial towns. Except during the hot
                    months, when the crops are off the fields, the general aspect is that of a
                    verdant and well-tilled but monotonous plain, merging into hilly or mountainous
                    country at the extreme northern and southern edges of the basin.</p>
                <p>The extreme north-western or Himâlayan region comprises the native state of
                    Garhwâl, with the British districts of Dehra Dùn, Garhwâl, and Kumâun. The
                    economic value of this mountainous tract is confined to the growth of tea in
                    Kumâun and the export of forest produce. South of the Himâlayas, from which it
                    is separated by valleys or <hi rend="italic">dans,</hi> is the Siwâlik range,
                    which slopes down to the fruitful plain of the Doâb (two waters), a large
                    irregular hornshaped tongue of land enclosed between the Ganges and Jumna. The
                    great boundary rivers flow through low-lying valleys fertilized by their
                    overflow or percolation, while a high bank leads up to the central upland,
                    which, though naturally dry and unproductive except where irrigated by wells,
                    has been transformed into an almost unbroken sheet of cultivation by various
                    canals and their distributaries. This favoured inter-fluvial region may be fitly
                    regarded as the granary of upper India. North of the Ganges, and enclosed
                    between that river and the Himâlayas and Oudh, lies the triangular plain of
                    Rohilkhand. This tract presents the same general features as the Gangetic
                    valley, varied by the damp and pestilential submontane region of the Tarâi on
                    the north-east, at the foot of the Kumâun hills. South of the Jumna is the poor
                    and backward region of Bundelkhand, comprising the districts of Jalâun, Jhânsi,
                    Lâlitpur, Hamirpur, and Bânda, besides several petty native states under the
                    administrative control of the Government of India. The soil is generally rocky
                    and unfertile, and the population impoverished, scanty, and ignorant. The
                    southernmost portion of Bundelkhand is much cut up by spurs of sandstone and
                    granite hills, running down from the Vindhyân system; but the northern half near
                    the Jumna has a somewhat richer soil, and conies nearer in character to the
                    plain of the Doâb. Below the junction of the Ganges and the Jumna at Allahâbâd
                    the country begins to assume the appearance of the Bengal plains, and also once
                    more expands northwards to the foot of the Nepâl Himâlayas. This tract consists
                    of three portions, separated by the Ganges and the Gogra. The division south of
                    the Ganges comprises portions of Allahâbâd, Benares, and Ghâzipur, together with
                    the whole of Mirzâpur, and in general features somewhat resembles Bundelkhand,
                    but the lowlands along the river bank are more fertile. The triangular tract
                    between the Ganges and the Gogra and the boundary of Oudh is the most fertile
                    corner of the Gangetic plain, and contains the densest population. It comprises
                    part of Allahâbâd, Jaunpur, parts of Benares and Ghâzipur, and the whole of
                    Azamgarh. The trans-Gogra region, comprising Basti and Gorakhpur districts,
                    presents a wilder, submontane appearance. But even here cultivation has widely
                    extended, and the general aspect is that of a well-tilled and verdant plain.</p>
                <p>Besides the three great rivers—the Ganges, Jumna, and Gogra—there are the
                    following secondary streams, each with numerous minor tributaries :—the East and
                    West Kâli and the Hindan flow through the Doâb; the Chambal intersects the
                    trans-Jumna tract; in Bundelkhand the principal streams are the Betwâ and the
                    Ken; the Râmgangâ, rising in Garhwâl, pursues a very tortuous course through
                    Rohilkhand; the Gumti enters the Provinces from Oudh, and flows past Jaunpur to
                    join the Ganges; the trans-Gogra region is divided into two nearly equal parts
                    by the Râpti. All the drainage of the country falls directly or indirectly into
                    the Ganges.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate, &lt;L∙c.—</hi> The climate of the North-Western
                    Provinces as a whole may be classed as hot and dry. The Himalayan districts are,
                    of course, cool, and have a much greater rainfall than the plains. They are
                    succeeded by a broad submontane belt, the Tarai, which is rendered moist by the
                    mountain torrents, and is covered by forest from end to end. This region bears a
                    singularly bad reputation as the most unhealthy in all India, and in many parts
                    only the acclimatized aborigines can withstand its deadly malaria. The plain
                    country is generally warm and dry, the heat becoming more oppressive as the
                    general level of the country sinks towards Allahabad and Benares, or among the
                    hills of Bundelkhand. The monthly temperature of twelve stations in 1881-82 was
                    as follows :—maximum, 112° Fahr.; minimum, 40° T Fahr.; general mean, 77 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 8 Fahr. The maximum was 82° at Chakrâta in Dehra
                    Dun, 109° in Meerut, 114° in Allahabad, and 116° in Jhânsi; the minimum was 28°
                    at Chakrata, 35° at Meerut, 41° at Allahâbâd, and 44° at Jhânsi. The general
                    mean was 57° '7 at Chakrâta, 76° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 at Meerut,
                    78°'4 at Allahâbâd, 78°’8 at Benares, and 79°'1 at Jhânsi. The total rainfall
                    during the same year amounted to 54’03 inches at Chakrâta, 97’49 at Dehra, 29’63
                    at Meerut, 35’43 at Bareli, 34 Ό1 at Allahâbâd, 33’77 at Benares, and 52’62 at
                    Jhânsi. The chief disease is fever, to which a large proportion of deaths are
                    due.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The North-Western Provinces contain a denser
                    population than any country of Europe, excepting Belgium and England. The census
                    of 1881 returned the population of the British districts at 32,720,128 (males
                    17,060,901, females 15,659,227), distributed among 81,274 villages and towns.
                    Including the two attached native states of Garhwâl and Râmpur, the area
                    amounted to 86,983 square miles, and the population to 33,461,878. The following
                    table exhibits the area (in square miles) and population of each district and
                    state separately (exclusive of Oudh).</p>

                    in 1881-82 by Government works amounted to 1,395,217 acres. There are two
                    principal harvests, in autumn and spring. The great agricultural staple is
                    wheat. The chief commercial crops include indigo, cotton, sugar, oil-seeds, and
                    opium. The cultivation of tea is confined to the submontane districts of Kumâun,
                    Garhwâl, and Debra Dun. The produce is chiefly manufactured into green tea,
                    which finds a ready sale across the frontier in Central Asia, and is also
                    exported to England. Rice and sugar-cane grow chiefly in the river valleys or in
                    irrigated fields; wheat is raised on the uplands by the aid of canals and wells;
                    millets and cotton grow on the drier soils, while tobacco, vegetables, and other
                    richer crops occupy manured plots in the neighbourhood of villages. The three
                    principal recognized tenures are—(1) <hi rend="italic">zaminddri,</hi> in which
                    the whole land is held and managed in common, the rents and profits of the
                    entire estate being thrown into a common stock and divided among the
                    shareholders; (2) <hi rend="italic">pattiddri,</hi> in which the lands are held
                    severally by the different proprietors, all of whom are jointly responsible for
                    the Government revenue; (3) <hi rend="italic">bhdydchdra,</hi> in which portions
                    of the soil are held severally, while other portions may be held in common, with
                    joint responsibility for the Government demand. In the hill tracts the peasantry
                    are well off and independent; in the more favoured plain districts they are in
                    fairly comfortable circumstances; but in Bundelkhand they still suffer from the
                    effects of former misrule and from the effects of recent famines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce and Trade; Communication, &lt;L∙c.—</hi> The exports
                    of the North-Western Provinces are principally confined to its raw agricultural
                    produce—wheat, oil-seeds, cotton, indigo, sugar, molasses, timber and forest
                    produce, dye-stuffs, <hi rend="italic">ghi,</hi> opium, and tobacco. The imports
                    consist mainly of Manchester piece-goods, metal-work, manufactured wares, salt,
                    and European goods. The principal manufactures are sugar, indigo, and coarse
                    cotton cloth. Ornamental metal-work is made at Benares. The only factories on
                    the English model are the Elgin and Muir cotton mills at Cawnpur, the
                    Shahjahânpur rum distillery, and breweries at Masuri and Nâini Tai. The largest
                    and most valuable portion of the trade of the Provinces is now conducted by rail
                    direct with Calcutta, but the great waterways of the Ganges and Jumna still
                    carry a large part of the heavy traffic. The Gogra forms the main channel for
                    the grain and cotton of Gorakhpur, Basti, and Azamgarh, and for the forest
                    produce of Nepal. The lines of railway are the East Indian, which enters the
                    North-Western Provinces from Bengal, and has its terminus at Delhi; the Sind,
                    Punjab, and Delhi line; the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway; and the R∣ijputana
                    State Railway, connecting Agra with Bhartpur. The great trunk road traverses the
                    heart of the Provinces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The North-Western Provinces are under the
                    administrative charge of a lieutenant-governor, who resides at Allahabad. The
                    total revenue (including that of Oudh) in 1881-82 amounted to £9,075,727, and
                    the expenditure to £4,362,274. The chief item of receipt is the land-tax, which
                    produced during the same year £5,751,104. Education is making steady progress
                    throughout the central Gangetic plain, though still very backward in the
                    Himalayan districts, in Bundelkhand, and in the remoter parts of Rohilkhand and
                    the trans-Gogra tract. The total number of colleges and schools in the
                    North-Western Provinces in 1881-82 was 5063, with a roll of 170,966 pupils, of
                    whom 142,190 were Hindus and 24,437 Mohammedans. The principal institutions for
                    higher English education are the Muir Central College at Allahabad, and the
                    Government and Church Missionary Society’s Colleges at Agra. The Benares College
                    gives high Sanskrit education, while Delhi College, just beyond the borders,
                    gives instruction in Arabic and Persian. Primary education is afforded by a
                    complete system of village schools, the Provinces being divided into three
                    circles of inspection, and elementary instruction is now brought within easy
                    reach of all who choose to avail themselves of it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The traditions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahdbhdrata</hi> cluster round the city of Hastinapur in Meerut district,
                    which, with Indraprastha, whose shapeless ruins are still to be seen near Delhi,
                    formed the respective capitals of the Pandavas and Kauravas. The earliest empire
                    in this part of India, however, of which any certain monuments remain was that
                    of the Buddhist dynasty of Magadha, which attained its greatest development
                    under Asoka (see vol. xii. p. 784 <hi rend="italic">sq. ).</hi></p>
                <p>Continuous history begins with the Mohammedan invasion of Mahmιid of Ghazni, who
                    sacked the sacred cities of Kanauj and Muttra in 1017 A.D. Mohammed Ghori,
                    however, was the real founder of the Moslem power in Hindustan. In 1193 the seat
                    of the Moslem empire was fixed at Delhi, where it remained, with few
                    intermissions, till the British conquest.</p>
                <p>The British first came into connexion with the North-Western Provinces as they
                    advanced along the valley of the Ganges from Bengal. In 1763 the nawâb wazir of
                    Oudh, with the phantom emperor Shah Alam, invaded Bengal. They received a
                    crushing defeat at Baxar, and the emperor, with Balwant Sinh, râjâ of Benares,
                    joined the British camp. In 1775 the nawâb of Oudh, Asaf-ud-daula, ceded
                    Benares, Jaunpur, and Ghâzipur to the British, retaining Allahabad and Korah,
                    which had been taken from the emperor in the previous year, when the British
                    sold them to Oudh.</p>
                <p>The nawâb wazir, having agreed to pay a subsidy for the English troops maintained
                    for his aid, and being always in arrear, signed in 1801 the treaty of Lucknow,
                    by which he made over to the British the whole of his Oudh dominions in the
                    Doab, together with Rohilkhand. For Lord Lake’s campaign in 1803 against
                    Sindhia, which brought the whole remaining portion of the North-Western
                    Provinces under British rule, see vol. xii. p. 804. The Himalayan districts of
                    Kumâun and Garhwâl were not acquired until after the Gurkha war of 1814-15,
                    while the Delhi territory remained the personal apanage of the Mughal royal
                    family until 1832, when it passed to the direct government of the East India
                    Company.</p>
                <p>The first half-century of the British occupation was a period of peaceful
                    progress. The Doâb especially rose into a great agricultural and commercial
                    tract, filled with new and growing cities, such as Cawnpur, Meerut, Aligarh,
                    Rιirki (Roorkee), and Sahâranpur. This peaceful period, was interrupted by the
                    mutiny of 1857, which first broke out in the North -Western Provinces, and
                    produced more disastrous effects in this tract than in any other part of India.
                    Since the repression of the rebellion the principal event of importance in the
                    Provinces has been the rapid development of the railway system, which is
                    revolutionizing the commercial condition of the country and throwing open fresh
                    outlets for its agricultural wealth. The outlying chief-commissionership of Oudh
                    was placed under the administration of the lieutenant-governor of the
                    North-Western Provinces from January 1877. (W. W. H.)</p>
