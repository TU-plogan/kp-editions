                    and, as during that period Japanese art was in its early vigour, and was largely
                    patronized by the Shinto and Buddhist religions, it rapidly became a great and
                    sumptuous city. At present (though hardly a tenth of its former size) it has a
                    population of about 21,500, living in 6000 houses; and in antiquarian interest
                    it is hardly second to any place in the empire. The site of the old imperial
                    palace, which stood about four miles from the town on the way to Ozaka, is now
                    indicated only by a small Shinto temple; but about a mile off are the tombs of
                    Gemmei Tenno and Gen-cho Tenno. Of the many religious buildings still extant,
                    two especially demand attention—the Shinto temple of Kusuga and the Buddhist
                    To-dai-ji (Great Temple of the East). The former was founded in 767 in the time
                    of Sho-to-ku Tenno; and its Kami chapels with their rough red-painted log-work
                    afford fine examples of primitive Japanese architecture. A rough wooden building
                    constructed for storing the mikado’s furniture in the 8th century is still
                    extant, and among the articles accumulated within are many of those mentioned in
                    the original inventory. In the temple-park are herds of tame deer <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cervus</hi><hi rend="italic">shika,</hi> Sieb.); and little
                    images of deer and trinkets from deer’s horn are the favourite charms purchased
                    by the pilgrims. Within the enclosure stands a curious old trunk on which are
                    growing the camellia, the cherry, the nandina, the wistaria, and what the
                    Japanese call the seven-colour bush (nana-iro-iro ri). The To-dai-ji was begun
                    by Shömu Tenno in the 8th century, and was last restored in the 18th. At present
                    the buildings enclose a quadrangle 520 feet by 620,—the south side being mainly
                    occupied by the huge, ungainly, and no longer perpendicular hall containing the
                    Dai Butsu, or colossal statue of Buddha. The casting of this wonderful piece of
                    work was, after eight failures, accomplished in 749 by Takusho, an artist from
                    Corea. On two occasions the head has been melted during the burning of the
                    temple (1180 and 1567), and from 1567 to 1697 the statue stood exposed to the
                    weather; but in the main it is marvellously perfect. The height of the figure is
                    55 feet, the face is 13 feet long, the ears 8, the nose 3, and the great halo
                    has a diameter of 80 feet. On a hill to the east of the temple stands a
                    bellhouse with a monster bell, cast in 732, 13∣ feet high, 9 feet across the
                    mouth, and weighing 37 tons. Of the great Buddhist temple Ko-buku-ji, which was
                    founded in 710, and burnt for the third time in 1717, there remains little save
                    a five-storied pagoda 150 feet high, dating from 730.</p>
