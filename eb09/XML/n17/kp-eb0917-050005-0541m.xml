                    >Nijniy-Novgorod</hi></label>, a government of Central Russia, bounded by
                    Vladimir on the W., by Yaroslaff and Vyatka on the N. and N.E., by Kazan and
                    Simbirsk on the E., and by Penza and Tamboff on the S., with an area of 19,800
                    square miles, two-thirds being on the right and the rest on the left bank of the
                    Volga. The smaller portion, with the exception of the better-drained lands close
                    to the river, is a k&gt;w flat marshy district, covered with thick forests and
                    sandy hills, and is but thinly peopled. The space between the Oka and Volga is
                    also flat and covered with forests, but offers somewhat greater advantages to
                    the settler. The best part of th^government is that to t⅛e east of the Oka; it
                    is hilly, traversed by deep ravines, and better drained, and has patches of
                    fertile black earth in the south. Geologically, Nijni-Novgorod belongs chiefly
                    to the Permian system; the Carboniferous appears only in the lowest formations,
                    and the Permian limestones are covered with a stratum 450 feet in thickness, of
                    variegated marls, formerly considered as Permian, but now supposed to be
                    Triassic. It is watered by the Volga with its tributaries, the Kcrjenetz and
                    Vetluga on the left, and the Sura (with the Piana) <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n542/mode/1up"

                    tributaries offer great facilities both for navigation and for the transit of
                    timber. Very numerous lakes dot the government, especially in the north; and
                    one-third of its entire surface is still covered with forests, which occupy
                    nearly the whole of the Zavoljie (to the north of the Volga), and extend without
                    a break for 50 and 80 miles to the west and south-west. The climate is severe,
                    especially in the Zavoljie, where the average yearly temperature is 5 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 6 Fahr, lower than at Nijni. The population in 1880
                    reached 1,376,000; they are mostly Great-Russians, Mordvinians (50,600), and
                    Tartars (42,650); the Tcheremisses numbered 5630, and the Jews about 1500. Of
                    the total, 1,266,550 belong to the Greek Church, 63,850 (probably much
                    understated) are registered as Old Believers and Raskolniks, 42,650 are
                    Mohammedans, 750 Protestants, and 740 Catholics. The urban population is only
                    101,000. The yearly increase of the population is estimated at 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 43 per cent., and the mortality at 47 per 1000.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture, but only 38 per cent, of
                    the area is under crops. Cattle breeding is falling off rapidly, and in 1880
                    there were only 229,000 horses (as against 326,000 in 1848 and 264,000 in 1865),
                    232,000 horned cattle, 444,000 sheep (585,000 in 1865), and 74,000 pigs.
                    Kitchengardens are a source of income in several districts. Agriculture, on the
                    whole, has to contend with great difficulties on account of the climate, the
                    soil, and the small allotments of land. A variety of petty trades carried on by
                    the peasantry have accordingly developed in the villages; of these cutlery is
                    the chief, no less than 6000 families being engaged in that industry at Pavlovo
                    and Vorsma. In other parts of the government the peasants make felt and woollen
                    wares, leather wares and harness, ironwire and sieves, &amp;c.; each village has
                    its own specialty, being renowned for its felt shoes, or for its gloves, its
                    fine scales, and so on. The chief occupation, however, is the manufacture of
                    wooden wares,—sledges, wheels, dishes and spoons, window frames, boxes, &amp;c.,
                    —which are exported in large quantities to the governments of the lθλveι∙ Volga,
                    and even to Bokhara and Persia. The manufactures are rapidly developing. In 1880
                    there were 465 factories (principally machine-works, steam flourmills, iron and
                    steel works, naphtha distilleries, cutlery and copper works, tanneries, and
                    rope-works), employing about 20,000 work-people, and producing goods to the
                    value of more than 15,000,000 roubles (8,840,000 in 1876); the production of the
                    distilleries amounted to 4,540,000. The building of boats and steamers is also a
                    considerable source of income. A very large proportion of the population fails
                    to find the means of self-sιipport within the province, and every year no fewer
                    than 100,000 to 117,000 persons leave their villages and go in search of labour
                    as far as St Petersburg and Astrakhan. Trade in corn, salt, timber, leather,
                    iron, and all kinds of manufactured ware is well developed in all towns of the
                    government, and there are important fairs at several places. The educational
                    institutions are few, and, on the whole, except among the Raskolniks, education
                    stands at a very low level. The government is divided into eleven districts,
                    having as their chief towns Nijni-Novgorod (50,000 inhabitants), Ardatoff
                    (3500), Arzamas (10,500), Balakhna (4000), Gorbatoff (3000), Knyaghinin (2500),
                    Lukoyanoff (10,000), Makarieff (2000), Semenoff (3000), Sergach (4000), and
                    Vasilsursk (3000). The other towns are Perevoz (1000) and Pochinki (7500); the
                    two villages Pavlovo (about 10,000) and Yorsma (4000) are important
                    manufacturing centres.</p>

                    >Nijni</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Nijniy,</hi> capital of the above
                    government, is situated at the confluence of the Oka and Volga, 276 miles by
                    rail to the east of Moscow. It occupies a most advantageous position on the
                    great artery of Russian trade, at a place where the manufactured and
                    agricultural products of the basin of the Oka meet with the metal wares from
                    that of the Kama, the corn and salt brought from the south-eastern provinces,
                    the produce of the Caspian fisheries, and the various wares imported from
                    Siberia, Central Asia, Caucasus, and Persia. It has thus become the seat of the
                    great Makarievskaya fair, and one of the chief commercial centres of Russia. Its
                    importance has still further increased during the last twenty years in
                    consequence of the growth of manufactures in the Oka basin, the rapid
                    development of steamboat traffic on the Volga and its tributaries, the extension
                    of the Russian railway system, and the opening of Central Asia for trade.
                    Nijni-Novgorod consists of three parts :— the upper city, including the Kremlin;
                    the lower town, or Nijni Bazaar; and “the Fair,” with the suburb Kunavina. The
                    upper city covers three hills, which rise as steep crags to a height of 400 feet
                    (490 feet above sea-level) on the right banks of both the Oka and the Volga. The
                    Kremlin, or old fort, occupies one of these hills facing the Volga. It was
                    erected in the beginning of the 16th century, on the site of the old palisaded
                    fort, and has a wall 2300 yards long, with eleven towers; it contains the
                    law-courts, the governor’s residence, the arsenal, barracks, the military
                    gymnasium of Count Arakchéeff, transferred from Novgorod, and two cathedrals,
                    Preobrajenski and Arkhangelsk!. These were erected in 1225 and 1222
                    respectively, and have been rebuilt more than once; the present structures, in
                    somewhat poor taste, date from</p>
                <p>1834 and 1732. The Preobrajenski cathedral, however, retains several relics of
                    the past, such as a holy picture of 1380, and a Bible of 1404; Minin, the hero
                    of Nijni, lies buried there. The Kremlin is adorned with a square, containing a
                    monument to Minin and Pojarsky erected in 1826, and pretty boulevards have been
                    laid out along its lower wall. The view from the Kremlin of the broad Volga,
                    with its low-lying and far-spreading left bank, is very charming. The Pechorsky
                    monastery, close by, is archaeologically interesting; it was built in the first
                    half of the 16th century,—instead of the old monastery founded in 1330 and
                    destroyed by a land-slip,—and has several antiquities and a library with very
                    valuable MSS. Another monastery, contemporary with the foundation of Nijni, that
                    of Blagovyeschensk, is situated on the right bank of the Oka. Its old churches
                    have been destroyed by fire, but it has a very ancient holy picture—probably the
                    oldest in Russia—dating from 933, which attracts many pilgrims. Besides the
                    Kremlin, the upper town contains the best streets and public buildings. Five
                    descents lead from it to the lower town, which covers the alluvial terrace, 30
                    to 35 feet in height, on the banks of the Oka and Volga, and is the centre of a
                    very lively <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n543/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0543-0502"/> traffic. Its embankments are covered with
                    storehouses, and during the fair great quantities of merchandise are unloaded
                    there: hills of salt surround the salt-harbour on the Oka; farther down are seen
                    the extensive storehouses and heaps of grain of the corn-harbour; then comes the
                    steamboat quay on the Volga, opposite the Kremlin, and still farther to the east
                    the timber-harbour. The fair is held on the flat sandy tongue of land between
                    the Oka and the Volga, connected with the town only by a bridge of boats, 1500
                    yards long, which is dismounted in winter. The shops of the fair, more than 3000
                    in number, built of stone in regular rows, are surrounded by a canal, and cover
                    half a square -mile. A complete town has sprung up around them, whilst the sandy
                    banks are occupied by storehouses. The Siberian harbour during the fair has a
                    special interest on account of its accumulations of tea boxes and temporary
                    shelters where the different kinds of tea are tried and valued by tasters. The
                    point of the peninsula is occupied by the storehouses of the steamboat
                    companies, while metal wares and corn are discharged on a long island of the
                    Oka, at the iron-harbour and Grebnovskaya harbour. An island in the Volga is the
                    place where various kinds of rough wares are landed. An immense cathedral has
                    been recently erected to the north of the fair, on a site which is often
                    flooded. The railway from Moscow has its terminus close to the fair buildings,
                    to the south of which is the suburb Kunavina, widely known throughout the East
                    as a place for amusements of the lowest kind during the fair.</p>
                <p>Nijni-Novgorod is well supplied with drinking-water by springs which flow from
                    beneath the Triassic marls of which its hills are constituted. The water is
                    collected in a basin on the banks of the Volga and pumped to the upper town
                    (114,000 gallons per day). The climate of Nijni is harsh and continental, the
                    yearly average temperature being 39° Fahr, (10 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 6
                    in January and 64° in July), and the extreme thermometric readings - 40° and
                    104° Fahr.</p>
                <p>The town has a settled population of 50,000 inhabitants, rising to 250,000 or
                    perhaps to 300,000 during the fair. The inhabitants are nearly all
                    Great-Russians, and many of them are Nonconformists. The mortality exceeds the
                    birth-rate. The educational institutions, which are few, include, besides the
                    military school, one college (gymnasium) for boys and one for girls, a technical
                    school, a theological seminary, two schools for sons and daughters of the
                    clergy, and a dozen primary schools. The aggregate number of scholars being
                    3000, nearly 8000 children receive no public instruction. There is a small
                    public library, and a single periodical— <hi rend="italic">The Exchange
                    News</hi>; the five printing offices are employed almost exclusively by the
                    public institutions. Of late the statistical committee has issued a most
                    valuable publication, the <hi rend="italic">Nijegorodskiy Sbornik,</hi>
                    containing all kinds of statistical, ethnographical, and archaeological
                    information about the government.</p>
                <p>The manufactures are unimportant, but on the increase. The steam flour-mills,
                    iron and machine works, manufactories of ropes and candles, distilleries, and
                    potteries have an aggregate production of nearly £250,000 per year.
                    Shipbuilding, especially for the transport of naphtha on the Caspian Sea, and
                    also steamboat building, have recently advanced considerably. Nijni is the chief
                    station of the Volga steamboat traffic. The first steamer on the Volga made its
                    appearance in 1821, but it was not till 1845 that steam navigation began to
                    assume large proportions. In 1840 the whole traffic, carried on by nearly 1000
                    boats and 200 larger boats moved by horse-power, did not exceed 1,000,000 tons;
                    it is now estimated' at 2,500,000 tons, worth £3,000,000, and the number of
                    steamers on the Volga alone is about 500. The head offices of the chief
                    companies are at Nijni. The merchants also carry on a brisk trade, valued (apart
                    from that of the fair) at more than £2,000,000 (20,000,000 roubles) of purchases
                    and £1,800,000 of sales; the chief items are corn (from £200,000 to £500,000),
                    salt, iron, tea, fish, groceries, and manufactured goods. The annual budget of
                    Nijni is under £20,000.</p>
                <p>The chief importance of Nijni is due to its fair, which is held from August 5th
                    to September 15th. From remote antiquity Russian merchants were wont to meet· in
                    summer with those from the East at different places on the Volga, between the
                    mouths of the Oka and Kama,—the fair changing its site with the increasing or
                    decreasing power of the nationalities which struggled for the possession of the
                    middle Volga. Bulgary, or Bakhrimovo, Nijni-Novgorod, Kazan, and Vasilsursk have
                    successively been its seat since the 10th century. From 1624 its seat was long
                    at the Jeltovodski monastery, 55 miles below Nijni, close to Makarieff, whence
                    its present name. The situation, however, being in many ways inconvenient, and a
                    conflagration having destroyed the shops at Makarieff, the fair was transferred
                    in 1817 to its present seat at Nijni. The first fair held here showed a large
                    increase of arrivals, which reached the value of 27,000,000 roubles, and this
                    figure has steadily increased, reaching an average of 168,628,600 roubles in
                    1871-75, and 200,446,000 roubles in 1880. The value of the merchandise unsold
                    usually varies from 15 to 25 millions (31 millions in 1880). The goods chiefly
                    dealt in are cotton, woollen, linen, and silk stuffs (35 to 38 per cent, of the
                    whole), iron and iron wares, furs and skins, pottery, salt, corn, fish, wine,
                    and all kinds of manufactured goods. The Russian goods constitute four-fifths of
                    the whole trade; those brought from Asia—tea (imported <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Kiachta, Canton, and Suez), raw cotton and silk, leather wares,
                    madder, and various manufactured wares—do not exceed 10 or 11 per cent.
                    Manufactured wares, groceries, and wines are the goods principally imported from
                    western Europe.</p>
                <p>The above figures, however, convey but a very imperfect idea of the total
                    business transacted at the fair, which has been estimated at 371,013,911 roubles
                    in 1880 (320,532,700 in 1876), and in reality stands at a much higher figure.
                    Twenty-five years ago, the Russian manufacturers depending chiefly on the
                    barter-trade in tea at Kiachta, their production was regulated principally by
                    the prices of tea established at the fair; but now cotton takes the lead, and
                    the extension to be given each year to the mills of central Russia is detennined
                    at the fair by the price of raw cotton imported from Asia, by that of madder,
                    and by the results of the year’s crop which become known during the fair. The
                    same holds good with regard to all other stuffs, the prices of wool
                    (provisionally established at the earlier fairs of south-λvestern Russia) being
                    ultimately settled at Nijni, as well as those of raw silk. The whole of the iron
                    production of the Ural depends also on the same fair. The “caravans” of boats
                    laden with iron-ware, starting from the Ural works in the spring, reach Nijni in
                    August, after a stay at the fair of Laisheff, which supplies the lower Volga;
                    and the purchases of iron made at Nijni for Asia and middle Russia determine the
                    amount of credit that will be granted for the next year’s business to the owners
                    of the iron-works, on which credit most of them entirely depend. The fair thus
                    influences directly all the leading branches of Russian manufacture. It
                    exercises a yet greater influence on the corn and salt trades throughout Russia,
                    and still more on the whole of the trade in Siberia and Turkestan, both
                    depending entirely on the conditions of credit that the Siberian and Turkestan
                    merchants obtain at the fair.</p>
                <p>The Makarievskaya fair attracts therefore no fewer than 200,000 people from all
                    parts of Russia, and partly from Asia. The 3000 shops of the Gostinoy Dvor being
                    insufficient for all the merchandise, other 3000 shops are erected on a field
                    close by, whilst the quays are covered for 10 miles with heaps of ware and
                    temporary shelters. The Oka and Volga are literally covered with thousands of
                    boats of all descriptions; thousands of bargemen sλvarm in the dirtiest holes,
                    spreading epidemics; whilst the lowest amusements are carried on in the houses
                    of Kunavina. The fair is under the control of a special committee, who raise
                    more than 400,000 roubles for shop rents.</p>
                <p>Two other fairs of some importance are held at Nijni,—one for the trade in wooden
                    wares is held on the ice of the Oka, and another, in June, for the trade in
                    horses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The confluence of the Oka and the Volga,
                    inhabited in the 10th century by numerous Mordvinian tribes, began to be coveted
                    by the Russians as soon as they had occupied the upper Volga, and as early as
                    the 11th century they had established a fort, Gorodetz, 20 miles above the mouth
                    of the Oka. In 1221 the people of Suzdal, under Yuri Vsevolodovich, erected a
                    fort on the hill now occupied by the Kremlin of Nijni, and gave it the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Noυgrad Nizoυskiya Zemli</hi> (new town of the lowland). Until
                    the beginning of the 14th century Nijni-Novgorod, which grew rapidly as the
                    Russians colonized the banks of the Oka, remained a sub-town of Suzdal; it
                    enjoyed, however, almost complete, independence, being ruled by its popular
                    assembly. In the 14th century, until 1390, it elected its own princes. Ill
                    protected by its palisaded walls, it was plundered in 1377 and 1378 by the
                    Tartars, supported by the Mordvinians. In 1390 Prince Vasili of Moscow, in
                    alliance with the khan Toktamish, took Nijni and established his own governors
                    there; in 1412 it was definitely annexed to Moscow, becoming a stronghold for
                    the further advance of that principality towards the east. It was fortified in
                    1508-11, and was able to repel the Tartars in 1513, 1520, and 1536. The second
                    half of the 16th century was for Nijni a period of peaceful and rapid
                    development. It became a dépôt for all merchandise brought from the south-east,
                    and even English merchants established warehouses there. With the fall of Kazan,
                    and the opening of the free navigation on the Volga, it became also the starting
                    place for the “caravan” of boats yearly <pb break="no"

                    military force; whilst the thick forests of the neighbourhood favoured the
                    development of shipbuilding. In 1606-11 the trading classes of Nijni took an
                    active part in the expeditions against the revolted serfs, and it was a Nijni
                    dealer in cattle, Kozma Minin Sukhoruki, who took the initiative in sending an
                    army for the delivery of Moscow from the Poles. During the 17th century the
                    country around Nijni became the seat of a vigorous religious agitation, and in
                    its forests the Raskolniks spread hundreds of their monasteries and.
                    communities, those of the Kerjenets playing an important part in the history of
                    Russian Nonconformity even to our own day.</p>
                <p>Nijni-Novgorod had at one time two academies, Greek and Slavonic, and took some
                    part in the literary movement of the end of the last century; its theatre also
                    had some importance in the history of the Russian stage, It is the birthplace of
                    Kulibin and Dobroluboff. (P. A. K.)</p>
