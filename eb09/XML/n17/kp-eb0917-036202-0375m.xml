                    special favour of the duchess of Orleans, and on his death in 1695 his son and
                    daughter were taken under her protection. The young baron was thus early
                    initiated into the usages of courts, and received a thorough training in all the
                    accomplishments best fitted to gain him influence with the great. Losses in play
                    having compelled him to leave Paris, he entered the service of Charles XII. of
                    Sweden, by whom he was sent on a secret diplomatic mission in connexion with a
                    project for the restoration of the Stuarts. In connexion with the same intrigue
                    he was also resident for a short time in London. In 1718 he came to Spain,
                    where, obtaining the favour of the duke of Ripperda, he received the commission
                    of colonel, and married Lady Sarsfield, one of the maids of honour of the queen.
                    Finding his position at the court insecure, he made his escape with his wife’s
                    jewels. After various adventures he came in 1732 to Florence as representative
                    of the emperor Charles VI. Having here made the acquaintance of several Corsican
                    patriots, he succeeded by expressing strong sympathy with their cause, and
                    promising to gain assistance for them in their resistance to the Genoese, in
                    being accepted as a candidate for the Corsican throne. After fruitless
                    endeavours to interest various European sovereigns in their behalf, he made his
                    way to the dey of Tunis. From him he obtained a shipload of supplies and
                    ammunition, with which he landed at Corsica on the 14th March 1736. He was
                    received with the utmost enthusiasm, and in the following April was crowned king
                    as Theodore I. By the help of a body-guard of 400 men, and the lavish
                    distribution of new titles, he succeeded for some time in retaining his
                    position, but failing in an effort to capture Bastia from the Genoese, he at the
                    end of eight months resigned his power into the hands of a council of regency,
                    and left the island with the view of arousing sympathy in behalf of his
                    oppressed subjects. Making his way finally to Amsterdam, he was thrown into
                    prison by some of his old creditors, but, succeeding in satisfying their
                    demands, he appeared before Corsica in September 1738 with a considerable supply
                    of provisions and war materiel, only to find it under the power of the French,
                    who had become allies of the Genoese. After the departure of the French in 1743
                    he endeavoured to reestablish his authority, but found the faction against him
                    so strong that he was soon compelled again to leave Corsica, and went to
                    England, where he suffered several years imprisonment in the King’s Bench prison
                    at the instance of his Dutch creditors. Through the efforts of Horace Walpole a
                    subscription was raised in his behalf, and, an understanding having been arrived
                    at with his creditors, he obtained his freedom in 1756. He died 11th December of
                    the same year.</p>
