                    26; Front., <hi rend="italic">De Aqueed.,</hi> 102). His father is usually
                    identified with the “Nerva filius” who is mentioned in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Digest</hi> as a prominent jurist, and who was possibly consul in 40 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Of his mother a single inscription tells us that she
                    was Sergia Plautilla, daughter of Laenas (Orelli, 777).</p>
                <p>Nerva must have been born in 32 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> for he was
                    sixty-four years old at the time of his accession in 96 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> In early manhood he had been on friendly terms with Nero, whose taste
                    for versification he shared (Martial, viii. 70; Pliny, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ep.,</hi> v. 3), and by whom, in 65, he was decorated with the “insignia
                    triumphalia” (Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> xv. 72). He had been praetor
                    (166) and twice consul, in 71 with the emperor Vespasian for colleague (Orelli,
                    1634), and again in 90 with Domitian. Towards the close of the latter’s reign he
                    is said to have excited suspicion and to have been banished to Tarentum on a
                    charge of conspiracy (Dio Cass., <hi rend="italic">Epit.,</hi> lxvii. 15;
                    Philostr., <hi rend="italic">Apoll.</hi><hi rend="italic">Tyan.,</hi> vii. 8).
                    He is described as a quiet, kindly, dignified man, honest of purpose, but
                    unfitted by age and temperament, as well as by feeble health, to bear the weight
                    of empire. Nevertheless his selection by Domitian’s murderers as that prince’s
                    successor seems to have been generally approved, and his short rule, in spite of
                    occasional exhibitions of weakness, justified the choice. His accession brought
                    a welcome relief from the terrible strain of the last few years. The reign of
                    terror was at an end and liberty restored. The new emperor recalled those who
                    had been exiled by Domitian; what remained of their confiscated property was
                    restored to them, and a stop was put to the vexatious prosecutions which
                    Domitian had encouraged. But the popular feeling demanded more than this. The
                    countless informers of all classes who had thriven under the previous régime now
                    found themselves swept away, to borrow Pliny’s metaphor (Pliny, <hi
                    rend="italic">Paneg.,</hi> 35), by a hurricane of revengeful fury, which
                    threatened to become as dangerous in its indiscriminate ravages as the system it
                    attacked. It was finally checked by Nerva, who was stung into action by the
                    sarcastic remark of the consul Fronto that, “bad as it was to have an emperor
                    who allowed no one to do anything, it was worse to have one who allowed every
                    one to do everything” (Dio Cass., <hi rend="italic">Epit.,</hi> Ixviii. 1).</p>
                <p>Nerva seems to have followed the custom established by his predecessors of
                    announcing at the outset the general lines of his future policy. Domitian had
                    been arbitrary and high-handed, and had heaped favours on the soldiery while
                    humiliating the senate;- Nerva naturally enough assumed the opposite attitude,
                    and showed himself anxious in every way to respect the traditional privileges of
                    the senate, and such maxims of constitutional government as still survived. He
                    pledged himself to put no senator to death. His chosen councillors in all
                    affairs of state were senators, and the hearing of claims against the fiscus was
                    taken from the imperial procuratores and entrusted to the more impartial
                    jurisdiction of a praetor and a court of “judices” (Dio Cass., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eρit.,</hi> Ixviii. 2; <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> i. 2, 2; Pliny, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n366/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0366-0353"/><hi rend="italic">Paneg.,</hi> 36). It was thus,
                    as Pliny magniloquently says, that Nerva united the “principate” with
                    “freedom.”</p>
                <p>No one probably expected from Nerva a vigorous administration either at home or
                    abroad. But he seems to have set himself honestly enough to carry through such
                    reforms as were either suggested by his own benevolent inclinations, or
                    imperatively demanded by the necessities of the moment. The economical condition
                    of Italy evidently excited his alarm and sympathy. The last mention of a “lex
                    agraria” in Roman history is connected with his name, though how far the measure
                    was strictly speaking a “law” is uncertain. Under the provisions of this “lex,”
                    large tracts of land were bought up and allotted to poor citizens. The cost was
                    defrayed partly from the imperial treasury, but partly also from Nerva’s private
                    resources, and the execution of the scheme was entrusted to commissioners <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dig.,</hi> xlvii. 21, 3; Dio Cass., <hi rend="italic">Epit.,</hi>
                    lxviii. 2; Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Ep.,</hi> vii. 31; <hi rend="italic">Corp.
                    Inscr. Lat.,vi,</hi> 1548). This agrarian law was probably as shortlived in its
                    effects as preceding ones had been, but a reform more lasting in its results was
                    the provision of a regular maintenance at the public cost for the children of
                    poor parents in the towns of Italy (Aur. Vict., <hi rend="italic">Ep.,</hi> 24),
                    the provision being presumably secured by imposing a yearly charge for this
                    purpose on state and municipal lands. On coins of the year 97 Nerva is
                    represented seated upon his curule chair and stretching out a helping right hand
                    to a boy and a girl. The legend on the coins is “tutela Italiae” (Eckhel, vi.
                    408; Marquardt, <hi rend="italic">Staatsverwaltung,</hi> ii. 138, note 6).
                    Private individuals were also encouraged to follow the imperial example; and
                    among those who responded was the younger Pliny, whose charitable institution in
                    his own town of Comum seems to have followed directly on that of the emperor
                    himself <hi rend="italic">(Hermes,</hi> iii. 101; Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Ep.
                    ad T.,</hi> 8). In the hands of Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines, Nerva’s
                    example bore fruit in the institution of the “alimentationes,” the most
                    genuinely charitable institution of the pagan world. These measures Nerva
                    supplemented by others which aimed at lightening the financial burdens which
                    already weighed heavily on the declining industry of Italy. The cost of
                    maintaining the imperial postal system was transferred to the “fiscus,” from the
                    same source apparently money was found for repairing the public roads and
                    aqueducts, and lastly the lucrative but unpopular succession duty “vicesima
                    hereditatum,” was so readjusted as to remove the grosser abuses connected with
                    it (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Paneg., 37). At</hi> the same time Nerva did his
                    best to reduce the overgrown expenditure of the state (Pliny, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ep.,</hi> ii. 1). A commission was appointed to consider the best modes of
                    retrenchment, and the outlay on shows and games was cut down to the lowest
                    possible point. It was these efforts which earned for him the epithet
                    “frugalissimus” (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Paneg.,</hi> 51). Nerva seems
                    nevertheless to have soon wearied of the uncongenial task of governing, and his
                    anxiety to be rid of it was quickened by the discovery that not even his
                    blameless life and mild rule protected him against intrigue and disaffection.
                    Early, apparently, in 97 he detected a conspiracy against his life headed by L.
                    Calpurnius Crassus, but he contented himself with a hint to the conspirators
                    that their designs were known, and with banishing Crassus to Tarentum. This
                    ill-judged lenity provoked a few months later an intolerable insult to his
                    dignity. The praetorian guards had keenly resented the murder of their patron
                    Domitian, and now, at the instigation of one of their two prefects, Casperius
                    Aelianus, whom Nerva had retained in office, they imperiously demanded the
                    execution of Domitian’s murderers, the chamberlain Parthenius, and Petronius
                    Secundus, Aelianus’s colleague. Nerva vainly strove to save, even at the risk of
                    his own life, the men who had raised him to power, but the soldiers,
                    disregarding his protests, brutally murdered the unfortunate men, and finally
                    forced Nerva to propose a vote of thanks for the deed (Dio Cass., <hi
                    rend="italic">Epit.,</hi> lxviii. 4; Aur. Vict., <hi rend="italic">Ep.,</hi>
                    24). This crowning humiliation convinced Nerva of the necessity of placing the
                    reins of government in stronger hands than his own. Following the precedent set
                    by Augustus, Galba, and Vespasian, he resolved to adopt as his colleague and
                    destined successor a younger and more vigorous man, and his choice fell upon Μ.
                    Ulpius Trajanus, already well known as a distinguished soldier, and at the time
                    in command of the legions on the Rhine. In October 97, in the temple of Jupiter
                    on the Capitol, Trajan was formally adopted as his son, and declared his
                    colleague in the government of the empire (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Paneg.,</hi>
                    8). For three months Nerva ruled jointly with Trajan (Aur. Vict., <hi
                    rend="italic">Ep.,</hi> 24); but on January 27, 98, he died somewhat suddenly.
                    He was buried in the sepulchre of Augustus, and divine honours were paid him by
                    his successor. The verdict of history upon his reign is best expressed in his
                    own words,—“I have done nothing which should prevent me from laying down my
                    power, and living in safety as a private man.” In the Rome of to-day the memory
                    of Nerva is still preserved by the ruined temple in the Via Alessandrina (il
                    Colonacce) which marks the site of the Forum begun by Domitian, but which Nerva
                    completed and dedicated (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Dom.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
