                    Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, was a native of
                    Germanicia, at the foot of Mount Taurus, in Syria. The year of his birth is
                    unknown. At an early age he was sent for his education to Antioch, where it is
                    probable, though not certain, that Theodore of Mopsuestia was for some time his
                    master. As monk in the neighbouring monastery of Euprepius, and afterwards as
                    presbyter, he became celebrated in the diocese for his asceticism, his
                    orthodoxy, and his eloquence; hostile critics, such as Socrates, allege that his
                    arrogance and vanity were hardly less conspicuous. On the death of Sisinnius,
                    patriarch of Constantinople (December 427), Theodosius II., indifferent to or
                    possibly perplexed by the various claims of the local clergy, appointed the
                    distinguished preacher of Antioch to the vacant see. The consecration took place
                    on April 10, 428, and then, or almost immediately afterwards, in what is said to
                    have been his first patriarchal sermon, Nestorius exhorted the emperor in the
                    famous words—“Purge me, O Caesar, the earth of heretics, and I in return will
                    give thee heaven. Stand by me in putting down the heretics and I will stand by
                    thee in putting down the Persians.” In the Spirit of this utterance, steps were
                    at once instituted by the new prelate (Socrates says five days after his
                    consecration) to suppress the assemblies of the Arians: these, by a stroke of
                    policy which seems to have been as successful as it was bold, anticipated his
                    action by themselves setting fire to their meeting-house, Nestorius being
                    forthwith nicknamed “the incendiary.” The Novatians and the Quartodecimans were
                    the next objects of his orthodox zeal,—a zeal which in the case of the former at
                    least was reinforced, according to Socrates, by his envy of their bishop; and it
                    led to serious and fatal disturbances at Sardis and Miletus. The toleration the
                    followers of Macedonius had long enjoyed was also rudely broken, the (foreign)
                    Pelagians alone finding any favour. While these repressive measures were being
                    carried on outside the pale of the catholic church, equal care was taken to
                    instruct the faithful in such points of orthodoxy as their spiritual head
                    conceived to be the most important or the most in danger. One of these was that
                    involved in the practice, now grown almost universal, of bestowing the epithet
                    Θεοτόκος, “Mother of God,” upon Mary the mother of Jesus. In the school of
                    Antioch the impropriety of the expression had long before been pointed out, by
                    Theodore of Mopsuestia, among others, in terms precisely similar to those
                    afterwards attributed to Nestorius. From Antioch Nestorius had brought along
                    with him to Constantinople a copresbyter named Anastasius, who enjoyed his
                    confidence and is called by Theophanes his “syncellus.” This Anastasius, in a
                    pulpit oration which the patriarch himself is said to have prepared for him,
                    caused great scandal to the partisans of the Marian cultus then beginning by
                    saying, “Let no one call Mary the mother of God, for Mary was a human being; and
                    that God should be born of a human being is impossible.” The opposition, which
                    was led by one Eusebius, a “scholasticus” or pleader who afterwards became
                    bishop of Dorylaeum, chose to construe this utterance as a denial of the
                    divinity of Christ, and so violent did the dispute upon it become that Nestorius
                    judged it necessary to silence the remonstrants by force; an over-zealous monk
                    who had withstood him to his face was scourged and sent into exile, while many
                    of the mob who sympathized were also punished with the lash. The exact
                    chronological order of the recorded incidents in this stage of the controversy
                    is somewhat difficult to determine, but an important part in it was taken by
                    Proclus, bishop of Cyzicus, who, preaching in the cathedral before the
                    patriarch, and at his invitation (429), on one of the festivals of the Virgin,
                    asserted so firmly the propriety of the disputed epithet that Nestorius was
                    constrained to rise and reply.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the church, while a large body of clergy and laity formally withdrew from
                    communion with Nestorius, whose friend Dorotheus was.</p>

                    well as the perhaps inevitable jealousy between the patriarchate of St Mark and
                    that of Constantinople, found’an exponent of unexampled determination and
                    unscrupulosity, did not fail to make use of the opportunity. He stirred up his
                    own clergy, he wrote to encourage the dissidents at Constantinople, and he
                    addressed himself to the sister and wife of the emperor (Theodosius himself
                    being known to be still favourable to Nestorius). Nestorius himself, on the
                    other hand, having occasion to write to Pope Celestine I. about the Pelagians
                    (whom he was not inclined to regard as heretical), gave from his own point of

                    patriarchate. This implied appeal, however, was the reverse of successful, for
                    the pope, in a synod which met in 430, decided in favour of the epithet
                    Θεοτόκος, and bade Nestorius retract his erroneous teaching, on pain of instant
                    excommunication, at the same time entrusting the execution of this decision to
                    the patriarch of Alexandria. On hearing from Rome, Cyril at once held a synod
                    and drew up a doctrinal formula for Nestorius to sign, and also twelve anathemas
                    covering the various points of the Nestorian dogmatic. Nestorius, instead of
                    yielding to the combined pressure of his two great rivals, merely replied by a
                    counter excommunication.</p>
                <p>In this situation of affairs the demand for a general council became
                    irresistible, and accordingly Theodosius and Valentinian III. issued letters
                    summoning the metropolitans of the catholic church to meet at Ephesus at
                    Whitsuntide 431, each bringing with him some able suffragans. Nestorius, with
                    sixteen bishops and a large following of armed men, was among the first to
                    arrive; soon afterwards came Cyril with fifty bishops. Juvenal of Jerusalem and
                    Flavian of Thessalonica were some days late. It was then announced that’ John of
                    Antioch had been delayed on his journey and could not appear for some days; he,
                    however, is stated to have written politely requesting that the opening of the
                    synod should not be delayed on his account. Cyril and his friends accordingly
                    assembled in the church of the Theotokos on the 2 2d of June, and summoned
                    Nestorius before them to give an account of his doctrines. The reply they
                    received was that he would appear as soon as all the bishops were assembled; and
                    at the same time the imperial commissioner, Candidian, presented himself in
                    person and formally protested against the opening of the synod. Notwithstanding
                    these circumstances, Cyril and the one hundred and fifty-nine bishops who were
                    with him proceeded to read the imperial letter of convocation, and afterwards
                    the letters which had passed between Nestorius and his adversary. Almost
                    immediately the entire assembly with one voice cried out anathema on the impious
                    Nestorius and his impious doctrines, and after various extracts from the
                    writings of church fathers had been read the decree of his exclusion from the
                    episcopate and from all priestly communion was solemnly read and signed by all
                    present, whose numbers had by this time swelled to one hundred and ninety-eight.
                    When the decision was known the populace, who had been eagerly waiting from
                    early morning till night to hear the result, accompanied the members with
                    torches and censers to their lodgings, and there was a general illumination of
                    the city. A few days afterwards (June 26 or 27) John of Antioch arrived, and
                    efforts were made by both parties to gain his ear; whether inclined or not to
                    the cause of his former co-presbyter, he was naturally excited by the
                    precipitancy with which Cyril had acted, and at a “conciliabulum” of forty-three
                    bishops held in his lodgings shortly after his arrival he was induced by
                    Candidian, the friend of Nestorius, to depose the bishops of Alexandria and
                    Ephesus on the spot. The efforts, however, to give effect to this act on the
                    following Sunday were frustrated by the zeal of the Ephesian mob. Meanwhile a
                    letter was received from the emperor declaring invalid the session at which
                    Nestorius had been deposed unheard; numerous sessions and counter-sessions were
                    afterwards held, the conflicting parties at the same time exerting themselves to
                    the utmost to secure an effective superiority at court. In the end Theodosius
                    decided to confirm the depositions which had been pronounced on both sides, and
                    Cyril and Memnon as well as Nestorius were by his orders laid under arrest.
                    Representatives from each side were now summoned before him to Chalcedon, and at
                    last, yielding to the sense of the evident majority, he gave a decision in
                    favour of the “orthodox,” and the council of Ephesus was dissolved. Maximian,
                    one of the Constantinopolitan clergy, a native of Rome, was promoted to the
                    vacant see, and Nestorius was henceforward represented in the city of his former
                    patriarchate only by one small congregation, which also a short time afterwards
                    became extinct. The commotion which had been thus raised did not so easily
                    subside in the more eastern section of the church; the Antiochenes continued to
                    maintain for a considerable time an attitude of antagonism towards Cyril and his
                    creed, and were not pacified until an understanding was reached in 433 on the
                    basis of a new formula involving some material concessions by him. The union
                    even then met with resistance from a number of bishops, who, rather than accede
                    to it, submitted to deposition and expulsion from their sees; and it was not
                    until these had all died out that, as the result of stringent imperial edicts,
                    Nestorianism may be said to have become extinct throughout the Roman empire.
                    Their school at Edessa was closed by Zeno in 489. As for Nestorius himself,
                    immediately after his deposition he withdrew into private life in his old
                    monastery of Euprepius, Antioch, until 435, when the emperor ordered his
                    banishment to Petra in Arabia. A second decree, it would seem, sent him to
                    Oasis, probably the city of the Great Oasis, in Upper Egypt, where he was still
                    living in 439, at the time when Socrates wrote his <hi rend="italic">Church
                    History.</hi> The invasions of savage tribes compelled him to seek refuge in the
                    Thebaid, where, however, the governor caused him to be dragged to Elephantis and
                    subsequently to Panopolis. The time, place, and circumstances of his death are
                    unknown; but zeal for theological truth and retributive justice has led at least
                    one historian to exercise his invention in providing a fit end for the
                    friendless heretic. The followers of Nestorius found toleration under the rulers
                    of Persia, from which empire they gradually spread into India and even into
                    Arabia and China. They also succeeded in securing a foothold among the Tartars.
                    Their patriarch had his see for a considerable time at Seleucia-Ctesiphon,
                    afterwards in Baghdad, and then in Alkôsh. In the 13th century he is said to
                    have had twenty-five metropolitans under him. The sect was almost extirpated by
                    Timur.</p>
                <p>What is technically and conventionally meant in dogmatic theology by “the
                    Nestorian heresy” has been briefly indicated elsewhere (vol. xiii. p. 671). As
                    Eutychianism is the doctrine that the Godman has only one nature, so
                    Nestorianism is the doctrine that He has two complete persons. So far as
                    Nestorius himself is concerned, however, it is certain that he never formulated
                    any such doctrine; nor does any recorded utterance of his, however casual, come
                    so near the heresy called by his name as Cyril’s deliberately framed third
                    anathema (that regarding the “physical union” of the two hypostases or natures)
                    approaches Eutychianism. It must be remembered that Nestorius was as orthodox at
                    all events as Athanasius on the subject of the incarnation, and sincerely, even
                    fanatically, held every article of the Nicene creed. Hefele himself, one of the
                    most recent as well as most learned and acute of Cyril’s partisans, is compelled
                    to admit that Nestorius accurately held the duality of the two natures and the
                    integrity of each, was equally explicitly opposed to Arianism and
                    Apollinarianism, and was perfectly correct in his assertion that the Godhead can
                    neither be born nor suffer; all that he can allege against him is that “the fear
                    of the <hi rend="italic">communicatio</hi><hi rend="italic">idiomatum</hi>
                    pursued him like a spectre. <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> But in reality the
                    question raised by Nestorius was not one as to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >communicatio</hi><hi rend="italic">idiomatum,</hi> but simply as to the
                    proprieties of language. He did not refuse to speak of Mary as being the mother
                    of Christ or as being the mother of Emmanuel, but he thought it improper to
                    speak of her as the mother of God. And there is at least this to be said for him
                    that even the most zealous desire to frustrate the Arian had never made it a
                    part of orthodoxy to speak of David as <hi rend="italic">θtoπ&lt;Lτωρ</hi> or of
                    James as <hi rend="italic">aδeλφ6θeos.</hi> The secret of the enthusiasm of the
                    masses for the analogous expression Theotokos is to be sought not so much in the
                    Nicene doctrine of the incarna-nation as in the recent growth in the popular
                    mind of notions as to the dignity of the Virgin Mary, which were entirely
                    unheard of (except in heretical circles) for nearly three centuries of the
                    Christian era (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Maiiy.</hi> vol. xv. p. 590-1). (J. 8.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0370-0357"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Modern Nestorians.</hi> —The
                    remnants of the Aramaean Nestorians are to be found in diminishing numbers
                    partly on Turkish, partly on Persian territory. Since the close of the 17th
                    century the Roman Catholic mission, with its headquarters at Aleppo, has,
                    through the powerful support of the French consuls, met with great success among
                    the Nestorians, and has formed the converts into the so-called Chaldaeans, or
                    Nestorians connected with the Roman Catholic Church. Those Nestorians who still
                    adhere to their ancient creed are settled on Turkish soil mainly in the wild and
                    inaccessible regions of eastern Kurdistan, and on Persian soil in the highly
                    fertile plain to the west of the Lake of Urmia. In the former district
                    Nestorians have lived along with the uncivilized Kurds (Iranians) from a very
                    early period, and their numbers have probably been increased by immigrants
                    driven from the lowlands of the Euphrates and Tigris by Moslem persecution. Till
                    quite recently they have maintained there a comparative independence in spite of
                    the perpetual hostility of the Kurds. In those districts where the Kurds are
                    numerically superior they have the ascendency over the scattered Nestorian
                    communities; but there were formerly districts mainly or, as in the case of
                    Tiyâri (Tyari), almost completely occupied by Nestorians, and in these the Kurds
                    were the subject race. As in those regions the conditions of life are the same
                    for both, there is little difference between Christians and Mohammedans; the
                    Nestorians wear nearly the same garb as their Kurd neighbours, the most
                    noteworthy article being the breeches. The mountain Nestorians have generally
                    striped jackets and felt caps, and frequently a staff (the stony mountain roads
                    being mere footpaths, or at best only available for mules). Stock-breeding is
                    the chief occupation; and in summer the herds are taken up to the higher
                    regions, where, however, sheep and goats are exposed to the attacks of wild
                    animals, especially bears and wolves. The alpine character of some of those
                    districts has been greatly admired by the few travellers who, in spite of risks
                    from brigands, have ventured to visit them. In certain valleys, as, for
                    instance, in that of the Zab, there is luxuriant vegetation: the chief trees are
                    the willow and the poplar; rice is cultivated, though at the risk of
                    intermittent fever. To avoid the mosquitoes the people spend the summer nights
                    in the open air on the top of a scaffolding of poles. Their ordinary houses are
                    generally very wretched, often consisting of but a single room, and sometimes
                    even being formed underground, after a fashion that becomes common in Armenia.
                    Besides making most of their own utensils, the mountaineers work certain copper
                    and sulphur mines, and earn a little money by gathering gall-nuts. Their
                    basket-work, for which the district of Tchelu is particularly famous, deserves
                    to be specially mentioned; travelling basketmakers from this region are to be
                    found in all parts of western Asia. The montaineers do a good deal of
                    hand-spinning and stocking-working, even their priests engaging in these forms
                    of industry as well as in tillage. Wooden spoons are made in the mountains. The
                    people as a rule are very poor; many of them migrate for a time (to Mesopotamia
                    for the most part), but come back with their petty gains to their homes, to
                    which they are much attached. This applies, however, only to certain districts;
                    from the central highlands of Tiyâri, for instance, emigration is rare. The
                    supply of food in the mountains is very meagre; wheat does not thrive well, and
                    the people depend on millet-bread, roasted meal, and dried mulberries. Great
                    labour has to be expended in carrying soil up to the terraces which they
                    cultivate on the mountain sides. Milk and its preparations are largely used; and
                    bee-keeping receives some attention. The hospitality of the mountaineers stands
                    high; they willingly share their last morsel with a stranger. Intellectually
                    they are not unlike the Kurds: the latter are proverbially stupid, and these Nes
                    <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> torians also are reproached not only with
                    ignorance but with lack of capacity. The clergy, ignorant to an extraordinary
                    degree, live a miserable life, and give themselves little concern about the
                    education of their flocks. They receive, however, no small respect from their
                    people, who also show a touching and reverential attachment to their creed. Even
                    the churches are objects of peculiar devotion. The accusation sometimes brought
                    against the mountain Nestorians that they resemble the Kurds in a tendency to
                    raiding and brigandage is not altogether without foundation; but this may be at
                    once explained and excused by the fact that they live in the midst of a hostile
                    and rapacious population, from whose attacks they can defend themselves only by
                    reprisals. In warlike courage they are not behind the Kurds. Among both races
                    the women, judged by Oriental standards, occupy a high position. The mountain
                    Nestorians are governed by hereditary village sheikhs called meliks (“kings”;
                    compare the “kings” of the Canaanites). Great influence is possessed by the
                    patriarch residing at Kotchannes near Julamerg, who always bears the name of Mar
                    Shimun <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> Lord Simeon); the civil jurisdiction over
                    the independent tribes is in his hands. The patriarchal dignity is hereditary in
                    one family; the woman destined to be the mother of the future patriarch must
                    refrain during her pregnancy from eating flesh, a diet which is absolutely
                    forbidden to the patriarch himself. It may sometimes happen that the patriarch
                    resorts to ecclesiastical excommunication against those who have opposed him in
                    secular affairs; but the Nestorians are quite contented under their theocratic
                    government, and have always shown a strong feeling of independence. Things went
                    hard with them in 1846, when their independence was destroyed. In concert with
                    the Turkish pasha in Mosul, to whom the freedom of the mountaineers was a
                    perpetual offence, three powerful Kurdish chieftains (of whom Nurulla of
                    Revandiz and Bedr Khan of Buhtan have attained unenviable celebrity) decided to
                    make a common attack upon the Christians. Taken completely by surprise, and
                    basely deserted by their patriarch, these could offer but a feeble resistance;
                    their property was pillaged, and more than 10,000 of their number were
                    massacred. On a small scale similar proceedings are repeated from time to time;
                    and the Turkish Government not only remains powerless to prevent them, but if
                    any advantage accrues to itself looks on with malignant approval. Frequently the
                    Kurdish beys make raids with comparative impunity even in the richer lowland
                    regions, as, for example, to Azerbijan in 1882.</p>
                <p>The Nestorians on Persian territory (in Azerbijan) live, even the few who inhabit
                    the mountains, under essentially different conditions; the greater proportion,
                    however, dwell on the rich and fruitful plain which lies round the city of Urmia
                    (Urmi). The date of their settlement in this district is not known, but Urmia is
                    mentioned as early as 1111 as the see of a Nestorian bishop. Nestorians from the
                    mountains may have gradually advanced eastwards into the plain, where they found
                    more favourable conditions of life. If not particularly healthy, it is
                    abundantly watered, and the fruit which it produces in profusion forms their
                    principal means of subsistence. Even here, indeed, they are subject to poverty,
                    for the soil belongs in great part to Mohammedan proprietors. Catholic missions
                    have had some success among them, and there is a Chaldaean bishopric at
                    Khosrava; but since 1831 the field has been more especially worked by the
                    American Board, which has sought to accomplish its purpose by utilizing through
                    the clergy the actually existing church, and by founding schools and introducing
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n371/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0371-0358"/> the press. In education a decided improvement may
                    be observed. Formerly out of two hundred Nestorians hardly one could read and
                    write; the proportion is now much higher. The development of the moral and
                    religious character of the people is, however, a difficult task; partly on
                    account of their pride in their old church and old beliefs, and partly because,
                    to some extent through Persian influence, their morale has undergone great
                    degradation. Volatile, sensuous, intemperate, and full of all kinds of
                    superstition, while they are certainly more talented and sharper-witted than
                    their brethren among the mountains, they are also much less truthful and
                    trustworthy. As their garb is similar to that of the Persians, so also are many
                    of their manners and customs. Many intelligent countenances are to be found
                    among them. It has even been asserted that these are of the Jewish type, and
                    some travellers have proposed an identification of the Nestorians with the lost
                    tribes of Israel. The ethnographic arguments in favour of this Jewish connexion
                    are, however, of no value; for many of the individual characteristics in which
                    the Nestorians agree with the ancient Jews are common to all Oriental nations;
                    and, what is of more importance, the type itself is not the Jewish one. The
                    Nestorians have round heads, and frequently light hair and hazel eyes. Among the
                    mountain Nestorians the complexion is usually a ruddy brown. That through all
                    the centuries of nominal Mohammedan domination the national type should have
                    been preserved must be ascribed exclusively to their isolated situation. They
                    still speak Aramaean (Syriac); but their dialect is not a lineal descendant of
                    the classical and literary language. In the mountains most of the Nestorians
                    understand Kurdish, and in the low country of Azerbijan Turkish; and both
                    languages have exercised a great influence on their native tongue. The
                    low-country dialect has greatly suffered from phonetic decay; that of the
                    mountaineers preserves many of the older forms, and is pronounced with greater
                    correctness. The Nestorians, it may be added, call themselves in their own
                    language Süräyi, and do not recognize the designation Nestorians bestowed upon
                    them by people of other creeds. The patriarch bears the title of patriarch of
                    the Chaldaeans.</p>
                <p>The Nestorians have a number of peculiar customs and manners. Their marriage
                    ceremonies are very interesting, as also are some of their other festivals,
                    during which, at least in the Urmia plain, there is always plenty of dancing,
                    drinking, and in the end fighting. The mountain Nestorians more particularly are
                    fond of hunting and hawking. One custom may be mentioned as peculiarly European;
                    not only do they kiss the hands of their clergy, but they lift their caps to
                    them—a mark of respect nowhere else in use in the East. Blood-revenge is in full
                    vogue both in mountains and lowlands; but there are asylums for homicides. Pork
                    is never eaten. As to creed, the Nestorians are strongly opposed to image
                    worship, have no auricular confession, know nothing of a purgatory, and allow
                    -their priests to marry. The Lord’s Supper is a kind of magical ceremony with
                    them, and several curious customs are connected with its observance. As a matter
                    of course their peculiarities are better preserved in places like Urmia on the
                    one side or the mountain district of Tiyâri on the other, where they live
                    together in considerable numbers.</p>
                <p>In regard to the total numerical strength of the Nestorians, authorities differ
                    greatly. Perkins spoke of 140,000, and assigned 50,000 to Tiyâri alone. The most
                    trustworthy data are probably those of Badger, based, in the main, on
                    information furnished by the patriarch, but with the number of families reduced
                    one-third throughout (the figures given having, in some instances, been seen to
                    be greatly exaggerated). The total number of families being 11,378, it may be
                    estimated that the individuals amount to about 70,000. In the following table
                    the enumeration of families as 4500 in Nos. 7 and 8 is purely approximate.</p>

                <p>The first-named diocese is the most southerly; it embraces the districts of Akra,
                    Zebur, Mezuriye, and Jebel Gara to the north of Mosul. It is there more
                    especially that, since the date of the collection of the figures given above,
                    there have probably been accessions to the Chaldaean Church. The second diocese,
                    comprising Berwâri, Nerwi, and Supna, lies to the north of the first, and nearer
                    the mountains; the third, farther to the west and northwest, is mainly occupied
                    by independent Kurds, and is still practically unexplored; the fourth, directly
                    subject to the patriarch, contains, besides the county of Tiyâri (upper and
                    lower), almost exclusively inhabited by Nestorians, Ashitha to the west, and
                    Kotchannes, Diz, &amp;c., to the north. North-eastward towards the Persian
                    frontier lies the sixth diocese, including, in addition to Gawar, Albak and some
                    other small isolated parishes; to the north of Tiyâri is the (ninth) diocese of
                    Lewun and Nudes (Nurduz ?), and to the east (fifth diocese) two leading
                    districts of the Tkhoma mountains and the inhospitable Tchelu, along with Bar,
                    Rekan, and Tchall. The seventh diocese, called also Be Shems-ud-din, lies to the
                    east of Tchelu, and includes also Baradost, as well as Tergawer, Marjaver,
                    &amp;c., within Persian territory.</p>
