                    small boats during the rainy season.</p>
                <p>In 1870 the deputy-commissioner roughly estimated the strength of the different
                    tribes as follows :—Assamese, 705; Aitaniyâs, 355; Câchâris, 3505; Mikirs, 8820;
                    Kukis, 2524; Nâgâs, 66,535; total, 82,444. The estimated population in 1881-82
                    was 93,000. Agriculture is conducted in a rude, nomadic fashion, the only
                    implements of tillage being the <hi rend="italic">ddo</hi> or hill knife, and a
                    <hi rend="italic">koddli</hi> or hoe. Rice and millet are the main crops. In
                    some places great skill is displayed in irrigation. The tea plant is indigenous,
                    and a large number of natives are now employed in the tea-gardens. The
                    manufactures embrace the production of the few rude articles required for
                    domestic use or as clothing, and the forging of <hi rend="italic">ddos,
                    koddlis,</hi> and spear-heads. Trade is generally conducted by means of barter,
                    and has considerably increased of late years. The local products available for
                    export comprise rice, cotton, cloth woven from nettle fibre, ivory, beeswax, and
                    various dyes obtained from the jungle. Salt and iron are imported; but the one
                    great desire of every Nâgâ is to have a gun. The revenμe is nominal.</p>
                <p>British administration was first introduced into the district in 1867; but it has
                    not yet been surveyed, and it constitutes perhaps the least orderly portion of
                    the Indian empire. It is inhabited by several wild aboriginal tribes,
                    collectively known as the Nâgâs. Those within British territory are
                    comparatively peaceful, but beyond the reach of British influence are several
                    savage and predatory tribes, who are in the habit of raiding on the plains, and
                    killing or carrying off inoffensive British subjects. Repeated expeditions have
                    been despatched to chastise them in their native hills. In 1873 a survey party
                    under Lieutenant Holcombe were treacherously massacred. In January 1875 a force
                    escorting a survey party under Captain Butler was attacked by Nâgâs, but
                    unsuccessfully; later in the same year, however, he was cut off and killed. In
                    1879-80 the Nâgâs murdered the deputy-commissioner, Mr Damant, and, after
                    receiving a sharp punishment, made a foray on the Gâchât· side, murdering a
                    tea-planter and committing other ravages. For some time the district has been in
                    a more settled condition. The construction of a road to Kohima, the principal
                    town, and the settlement of a British governor there have produced a salutary
                    effect. The eastern Nâgâs are becoming rapidly civilized.</p>
