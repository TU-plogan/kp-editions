                    according to the Roman breviary (December 6) was a native of Patara in Lycia,
                    and was given to his parents in answer to their prayers. From his earliest
                    infancy he signally displayed the piety for which his whole life was remarkable,
                    on Wednesdays and Fridays regularly refusing to receive nourishment from his
                    nurse except once only, and that after sunset. While still a youth he was
                    deprived of his parents, and the wealth that he thus early inherited he
                    forthwith distributed to the poor. To this périod belongs what may be called the
                    characteristic deed of his life,—his secret bestowal of dowries upon the three
                    daughters of a citizen fallen into poverty, who, unable to procure fit marriages
                    for them, was minded to give them up to a life of shame. Having given himself
                    wholly to God, Nicholas made a pilgrimage to Palestine, and in his voyaging
                    miraculously stilled a storm by his prayers. On his return to his native
                    province he visited Myra, the capital, where, as it fell out, the bishop had
                    just died, and the chapter had been divinely advised to select as his successor
                    a man named Nicholas who should be the first to enter the church next morning.
                    Nicholas, thus plainly indicated, was duly consecrated, and displayed throughout
                    his whole term of office every episcopal virtue. Under Maximian and Diocletian
                    he was seized for his constancy, removed far from his diocese, and thrown into
                    prison, where he lay until the days of Constantine, when he returned to Myra. He
                    afterwards attended the council of Nice, and died a natural death not long after
                    his return. His remains were subsequently removed to Bari (Barium) in Apulia. So
                    far the authoritative Roman legend, the documentary evidence for which, however,
                    does not take us farther back than to the 9th century at the earliest (Simeon
                    Metaphrastes). Nicholas is not mentioned among the Nicene fathers by any of the
                    church historians of that or the succeeding century, and the earliest extant
                    trace of his existence is in the fact that a church was dedicated to him in
                    Constantinople by Justinian about the year 560. Before the 12th century his name
                    had become very prominent both in the Eastern and in the Western Church, it is
                    difficult to tell precisely why; and to this day he is one of the most popular
                    saints in the orthodox Greek communion. Among the miracles assigned to him is
                    that of restoring to life three youths who had been murdered and salted down by
                    an innkeeper in whose house they had taken lodging; thus Nicholas figures as the
                    patron saint not only of poor maidens and of sailors but also of travellers and
                    merchants. Children, and especially schoolboys, are also regarded as being
                    especially under his guardianship, and in Russia and Greece, as well as
                    throughout the north of Europe, the liberality of Nicholas or Klaus is yearly
                    appealed to by them on the eve of his festival (December 6). His protection is
                    specially invoked against thieves and losses by robbery and violence. It may be
                    well to note that the “Old Nick” belonging to another cycle of legend has no
                    connexion, as has sometimes been supposed, with the subject of the present
                    article, that designation being etymologically connected with such words as
                    Nixie, Nickar, and perhaps even with the river-name Neckar (see Grimm’s <hi
