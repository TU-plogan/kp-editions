                    born at Besançon somewhat less than ten years before the outbreak of the
                    Revolution, but the exact date is strangely uncertain. Besançon for the place
                    and the 29th of April for the day of the month appear to be agreed upon, but the
                    year is sometimes given as 1780, sometimes as 1781, and sometimes as 1783. The
                    earliest seems the most probable. His father was a lawyer of some distinction
                    and had been a teacher of law, and after the outbreak of the Revolution he was
                    appointed mayor of Besançon and consequently chief police magistrate. He seems,
                    from some euphemistic expressions of his friends, to have rather lent himself as
                    an instrument to the tyranny of the Jacobins than to have shared their
                    principles; but his son was for a time an ardent citizen, and is said to have
                    been a club member when he could at the most have been twelve years old. His
                    education in these troublesome times was necessarily haphazard, but appears to
                    have been sufficient. His love of books began very early, and he combined with
                    it, what is not perhaps very often characteristic of the bibliophile proper, a
                    strong interest in natural science. The dates of his early life are given very
                    sparingly, and the chief authority for the details of it is his own <hi
                    rend="italic">Souvenirs,</hi> a not very trustworthy source. Having obtained and
                    then lost the post of librarian in his native town, he went to Paris and plunged
                    into literature. He had published a dissertation on the antennae in insects as
                    early as 1798 at Besançon. Entomology continued to be a favourite study with
                    him, but he varied it with philology and pure literature— <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Peintre</hi><hi rend="italic">de Salzbourg</hi> dates from this early period—and
                    even political writing. A “skit” on Napoleon in 1803 got him into trouble, which
                    was not very serious. He was obliged, or thought himself obliged, to quit Paris,
                    and for some years lived a very unsettled life at Besançon, Dole (where he
                    married), and other places. In 1811 he appears at Laibach in the singular
                    character of editor of a polyglot journal, the <hi rend="italic">Illyrian
                    Telegraph,</hi> published in French, German, Italian, and Slav. Then he returned
                    to Paris, and the restoration found him, or made him, an ardent royalist.
                    Literary and journalistic work of all kinds filled up his time, until in 1823 he
                    was appointed to the librarianship of the Bibliothèque de ΓArsenal. He was not
                    disturbed in this post by the revolution of July, but, on the contrary, was
                    elected a member of the Academy in 1833, and made a member of the Legion of
                    Honour in 1843, a year before his death, which happened on 27th January 1844.
                    These twenty years at the arsenal were by far the most important and fruitful of
                    Nodier’s life. He had much of the Bohemian in his composition, and the wandering
                    and unsettled life that he had led was more favourable to the cultivation of
                    this feature of his character than to the production of solid work. His post at
                    the arsenal was not very lucrative, and even after his appointment his way of
                    life is said by some chroniclers not to have been extraordinarily regular. But
                    he had the advantage of a settled home in which to collect rare books (for which
                    he had a real vocation), and to study them; and, what was of still more
                    importance, he was able to supply a centre and rallying place to a knot of young
                    literary men of greater individual talent than himself—the so-called Romantics
                    of 1830—and to colour their tastes and work very decidedly with his own
                    predilections. Much older than most of them, possessing a literary reputation
                    already formed, though resting on no single work of great importance, with very
                    decided idiosyncrasies and a considerable power of personally influencing his
                    associates, Nodier must be credited with no small part in the making of the men
                    of 1830.</p>
                <p>His own literary work is abundant, but much of it is obsolete, much more mere
                    miscellanies, much injured by hasty production, and some, it is said, is not due
                    to himself. His best and most characteristic work, some of which is exquisite in
                    its kind, consists partly of short tales of a more or less fantastic character,
                    partly of nondescript articles, half bibliographic, half narrative, the nearest
                    analogue to which in English is to be found in some of the papers of De Quincey.
                    The best examples of the latter are to be found in the volume entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Mélanges tirés d'une</hi><hi rend="italic">Petite</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliothèque,</hi> published in 1829 and afterwards continued. Of
                    his tales the best are <hi rend="italic">Smarra</hi> (1821), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire du Roi de Bohême et de ses sept Châteaux</hi> (1830), <hi
                    rend="italic">La Fée aux Miettes</hi> (1832), <hi rend="italic">Inès de las
                    Sierras</hi> (1837), <hi rend="italic">Légende de Soeur Béatrix</hi> (1838),
                    together with some fairy stories published in the year of his death, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Franciscus</hi><hi rend="italic">Columna,</hi> which appeared
                    after it. The <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs</hi><hi rend="italic">de Jeunesse</hi>
                    (1832), already referred to, are interesting but untrustworthy, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionnaire Universel de la Langue Française</hi> (1823), a book
                    of considerable merit, which, in the days before Littré, was one of the most
                    useful of its kind, is said to have been not wholly or mainly Nodier’s. His
                    chief tales are accessible in three or four volumes of the Bibliothèque
                    Charpentier, and the best yield to few things in French for charm of style and
                    especially for the rendering of fantastic and picturesque sentiment, but they
                    are very unequal. There is a so-called collection of <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres
                    Complètes,</hi> in 12 vols., 1832, but at that time much of the author’s best
                    work had not appeared, and it included but a part of what was actually
                    published.</p>
