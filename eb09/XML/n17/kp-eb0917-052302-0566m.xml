                    the Limousin, and dated its nobility from the 11th century. It did not obtain
                    more than local and provincial fame until the 16 th century, when its head, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Antoine</hi> de Noailles (1504-1562), became admiral of France,
                    and was ambassador in England during three important years, 1553-1556, during
                    which he maintained a gallant but unsuccessful rivalry with the Spanish
                    ambassador, Simon Renard. <hi rend="smallcaps">Henri</hi> (1554-1623), son of
                    Antoine, was a commander in the religious wars, and was made comte d’Ayen by
                    Henry IV. in 1593. The grandson of the first count played an important part in
                    the Fronde and the early years of the reign of Louis XIV., became a
                    captain-general of the newly-won province of Roussillon, and in 1663 was made
                    due d’Ayen, and peer of France. I he sons of the first duke raised the family to
                    its greatest fame, and occupied very important positions in the later years of
                    the reign of Louis XIV. The elder son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anne Jules</hi>
                    (1650-1708), was one of the chief generals of France towards the end of the
                    reign of Louis, and, after raising the regiment of Noailles in 1689, he
                    commanded in chief in Spain during the war of the Spanish succession, and was
                    made marshal of France in 1693. The younger son, Louis <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Antoine</hi> (1651-1729), took orders, and rose to the most important position
                    of the church in France when he was made archbishop of Paris in 1695. He held
                    this high dignity for more than thirty years, until his death in 1729; he was
                    made a cardinal in 1700. These two distinguished brothers had made their family
                    the most famous in France, with the exception of the Rohans, and the name occurs
                    with almost confusing reiteration throughout the 18th century. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Adrien Maurice</hi> (1678-1766), the third duke, was also a
                    soldier, and learned war under his father in Spain. He served in all the most
                    important wars of the reign of Louis XV. in Italy and Germany, and became the
                    second maréchal de Noailles in 1734. His last command in the war of the Austrian
                    succession was not a successful one, for he was beaten by the English at the
                    battle of Dettingen in 1743. Two sons of the third duke also attained the rank
                    of marshal of France. The elder, Louis (1713-1793), who bore the title of due
                    d’Ayen till his father’s death in 1766, when he became due de Noailles, served
                    in most of the wars of the 18th century without particular distinction, but was
                    nevertheless made a marshal of F rance, as the maréchal de N oailles, in 1775.
                    He refused to emigrate during the Revolution, but escaped the fate of most
                    noblemen by dying in August 1793, before the Terror reached its height. On the
                    4th Thermidor, just before the fall of Robespierre, the aged duchesse de
                    Noailles was executed with her daughter-in-law, the duchesse d’Ayen, and her
                    granddaughter, the vicomtesse de Noailles. <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean
                    Paul</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">François</hi> (1739-1824), the fifth duke, was,
                    like his family, in the army, but his heart was bent on scientific pursuits, and
                    for his eminence as a chemist he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences
                    in 1777. He became due d’Ayen in 1766 on his grandfather’s death, and due de
                    Noailles on his father’s in 1793. Having emigrated in 1792, he lived in
                    Switzerland until the restoration in 1814, when he took his seat as a peer of
                    France. He had no son, but several daughters, one of whom married La Fayette,
                    and another her cousin, the vicomte de Noailles. He was succeeded as due de
                    Noailles by his grand-nephew, <hi rend="smallcaps">Paul</hi> (b. 1802), who has
                    won some reputation as an author, and who became a member of the French Academy
                    in the place of Chateaubriand in 1849. The grandfather of Paul de Noailles, and
                    brother of the fifth duke, <hi rend="smallcaps">Emmanuel Marie Louis</hi>
                    (1743-1822), marquis de Noailles, was a distinguished diplomatist of the 18th
                    century: he was ambassador at Amsterdam from 1770-1776, at London 1776-1783, and
                    at Vienna 1783-1792; and, like his brother, he survived the Revolution, and
                    lived to see the Restoration.</p>
                <p>One other branch of the family deserves notice. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Philippe</hi> (1715- 1794), comte de Noailles, was a younger brother of the
                    fourth duke, and a more distinguished soldier than his brother. He served at
                    Minden and in other campaigns, and was made a marshal on the same day as his
                    brother, under the title of maréchal de Mouchy. He was long in great favour at
                    court, and his wife was first lady o <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> f honour to
                    Marie Antoinette, and was nicknamed by her Madame Etiquette. This court favour
                    brought down punishment in the days, of the Revolution, and the old marshal and
                    his wife were guillotined on the 27th June 1794. His two sons, the prince de
                    Poix and the vicomte de Noailles, were both members of the Constituent Assembly.
                    The prince de Poix, who was a captain of the body guards, sat on the right of
                    the assembly, and emigrated in 1792, but, surviving the <pb break="no"

                    made a lieutenant-general. Louis <hi rend="smallcaps">Marie</hi> (1756-1804),
                    vicomte de Noailles, was the second son of the maréchal de Mouchy, and the most
                    distinguished of all his family. He served brilliantly under his brother-in-law
                    La Fayette in America, and was the officer who concluded the capitulation of
                    Yorktown. He was elected to the states-general in 1789, and at once showed his
                    enthusiasm for liberty. He began the famous “orgie,” as Mirabeau called it, on
                    4th August, when all privileges were abolished, and with d’Aiguillon proposed
                    the abolition of titles and liveries in June 1790. When the Revolution became
                    more pronounced he emigrated to America, and became a partner in Bingham’s bank
                    at Philadelphia. He was very successful, and might have lived happily had he not
                    accepted a command against the English in San Domingo, under Rochambeau. He made
                    a brilliant defence of the mole St Nicholas, and escaped with the garrison to
                    Cuba; but in making for Havana his ship was attacked by an English frigate, and
                    after a long engagement he was severely wounded, and died of his wounds on 9th
                    January 1804. The whole family of Noailles had not a more brilliant
                    representative than the friend of La Fayette, Louis, vicomte de Noailles.</p>
