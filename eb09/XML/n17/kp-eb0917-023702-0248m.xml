                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (1004 A.D.), at Kubâdiyân, near Balkh in Khorâsân.
                    The first forty-two years of his life are obscure <hi rend="italic">; we</hi>
                    learn from incidental remarks of his that he was a Sunnite, probably according
                    to the Hanafite rite, well versed in all the branches of natural science, in
                    medicine, mathematics, astronomy, and astrology, in Greek philosophy, and the
                    interpretation of the Koran; that he had a comprehensive knowledge of many other
                    philosophic systems and religious creeds professed in the East; and that he was,
                    withal, much addicted to worldly pleasures, especially to excessive wine
                    drinking, the renunciation of which forms a prominent topic in his later odes.
                    He had studied Arabic, Turkish, Greek, the vernacular languages of India and
                    Sind, and perhaps even Hebrew; he had visited Multân and Lahore, and
                    been—probably in an official capacity—an eye-witness of the splendid Ghaznavide
                    court under Sultân Mahmùd, Firdousi’s patron, and his son Mas'ιid. Later on he
                    had chosen Merv for his residence, and was the owner of a house and garden
                    there. When he first steps into the full light of history, in 437 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (1045 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> we see him in
                    the position of a financial secretary and revenue collector of the Seljιik
                    sultan Toghrulbeg, or rather of his brother Jâghirbeg, the emir of Khorâsân, who
                    had conquered Merv in 1037. The introductory passages of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Safarndma,</hi> together with a number of verses in the above-mentioned kasida,
                    which belongs to the same period, clearly manifest the peculiar state of mind in
                    which Nâsir was at that time. Like Faust he had fathomed the depth of all human
                    knowledge, like him he had passed through the whirlpool of passions and sensual
                    pleasures, he had tried to drown his doubts and troubles in the wine cup, and
                    yet he had only grown more and more dissatisfied with himself; nothing could
                    quench his ever-increasing thirst for a higher intelligence, for a more profound
                    comprehension of the Godhead, and the manifestations of the divine power in the
                    universe. He had evidently reached the turning-point of his life, and, inspired
                    by a heavenly voice (which he pretends to have heard in a dream), he abjured all
                    the luxuries of life, and resolved upon a pilgrimage to the holy shrines of
                    Mecca and Medina, hoping to find there the solution of all enigmas, and to
                    return a thoroughly reformed man. The graphic description of this journey is
                    contained in the <hi rend="italic">Safarndma,</hi> a book that, quite apart from
                    the personal interest we feel in the author, ranks high among the memoirs of
                    travel as giving us the most authentic account of the state of the Mussulman
                    world and the condition of Persia, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt in the
                    middle of the 11th century. The minute sketches of Jerusalem and its environs,
                    moreover, are of the highest practical value, even at the present day, for our
                    explorations in the Holy Land. During the seven years of his journey (1045-52
                    A.D.) Nâsir visited Mecca four times, and performed all the rites and
                    observances of a zealous pilgrim; but the fascinating influence of the Holy City
                    upon his mind was greatly outweighed by that of Cairo, the capital of Egypt, and
                    the residence of the Fâtimite sultan Mostansir billâh, the great champion of the
                    Shi'a, and the spiritual as well as political head of the house of 'Ali, which
                    was just then waging a deadly war against the 'Abbâside caliph of Baghdâd, and
                    the great defender of the Sunnite creed, Toghrulbeg the Seljùk. At the very time
                    of Nâsir’s visit to Cairo, the power of the Egyptian Fatimites was in its
                    zenith; Syria, the Hijâz, Africa, and Sicily obeyed Mostansir’s sway, and the
                    utmost order, security, and prosperity reigned in Egypt. Cairo appeared as an
                    earthly paradise in Nâsir’s eyes; he became, as his poems clearly indicate,
                    thoroughly imbued there with Shi'a doctrines, and their successful introduction
                    into his native country was henceforth the sole aim and object of his life. The
                    hostilities he encountered in the propagation of these new religious ideas after
                    his return to Khorâsân in 1052 and Sunnite fanaticism compelled him at last to
                    flee, and after many wanderings he found a refuge in Yumgân, in the mountains of
                    Badakhshân, where he spent as a hermit the last decades of his life, and
                    gathered round him a considerable number of devoted adherents, who have handed
                    down his doctrines to many following generations. The Dâbistân (translated by
                    Shea and Troyer, Paris, 1843, vol. ii. p. 419 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> fixes
                    his flight from Khorâsân in 456 A.H. (1064 A.D.), but there is strong evidence
                    in some of his kasidas that this event took place some four or five years before
                    that date; and as his death occurred in 481 A.H. (1088 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> he must have lived in his exile from <pb break="no"

                    was “Hujjat.”</p>
                <p>Most of Nasir’s lyrical poems were composed in his retirement, and their chief
                    topics are—an enthusiastic praise of 'Ali, his descendants, and Mostansir in
                    particular; passionate outcries against Khorâsàn and its rulers, who had driven
                    him from house and home; the highest satisfaction with the quiet solitude of
                    Yumgan; and utter despondency again in seeing himself despised by his former
                    associates, and for ever excluded from participation in the glorious contest of
                    life. But scattered through all these alternate outbursts of hope and despair we
                    find precious lessons of purest morality, and solemn warnings against the tricks
                    and perfidy of the world, the vanity of all earthly splendour and greatness, the
                    folly and injustice of men, and the hypocrisy, frivolity, and viciousness of
                    fashionable society and princely courts in particular. It is the same strain
                    which runs, although in a somewhat lower key, through his two larger mathnawis
                    or double-rhymed poems, the <hi rend="italic">Rιιshandindma,</hi> or “book of
                    enlightenment,” and the <hi rend="italic">Sa'ddatndma,</hi> or “book of
                    felicity.” The former is divided into two sections: the first, of a metaphysical
                    character, contains a sort of practical cosmography, chiefly based on Avieenna’s
                    theories, but frequently intermixed both with the freer speculations of the
                    well-known philosophical brotherhood of Basra, the Ikhw⅛n-es-safa,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare the <hi rend="italic"

                    ethical section of the poem, abounds in moral maxims and ingenious thoughts on
                    man’s good and bad qualities, on the necessity of shunning the company of fools
                    and double-faced friends, on the deceptive allurements of the world and the
                    secret snares of ambitious craving for rank and wealth. It concludes with an
                    imaginary vision of a beautiful world of spirits who have stripped off the
                    fetters of earthly cares and sorrows and revel in the pure light of divine
                    wisdom and love. If we compare this with a similar allegory in Nasir’s diwan,
                    which culminates in the praise of Mostansir, we are fairly entitled to look upon
                    it as a covert allusion to the eminent men who revealed to the poet in Cairo the
                    secrets of the Isma'ilitic faith, and showed him what he considered the
                    “heavenly ladder” to superior knowledge and spiritual Miss. The passage, thus
                    interpreted, lends additional weight to the correctness of Dr Ethé’s
                    reconstruction of the date of the <hi rend="italic">Rushandindma,</hi> viz., 440
                    A.H. (1049 A.n.), which, notwithstanding Μ. Schefer’s objections, is warranted
                    both by the astronomical details and by the metrical requirements of the
                    respective verses. That of course does not exclude the possibility of the bulk
                    of the poem having been composed at an earlier period; it only ascribes its
                    completion or perhaps final revision to Nasir’s sojourn in Egypt.</p>
                <p>A similar series of excellent teachings on practical wisdom and the blessings of
                    a virtuous life, only of a severer and more uncompromising character, is
                    contained in the <hi rend="italic">Sa'ddatndma;</hi> and, judging from the
                    extreme bitterness of tone manifested in the “reproaches of kings and emirs,” we
                    should be inclined to consider it a protest against the vile aspersions poured
                    out upon Nasir’s moral and religious attitude during those persecutions which
                    drove him at last to Yumgan. Of all the other works of our author mentioned by
                    Oriental -writers there has as yet been found only one, the Zâd-elmusâ-firîn (in
                    the private possession of Μ. Schefer, Paris); and we can very well dismiss the
                    rest as being probably just as apocryphal as Nasir’s famous autobiography (found
                    in several Persian tadhkiras or biographies of poets), a mere forgery of the
                    most extravagant description, which is mainly responsible for the confusion in
                    names and dates in older accounts of our author.</p>
