                    and Gregory VII., succeeded Benedict III. in April 858. According to the
                    annalist “he owed his election less to the choice of the clergy than to the
                    presence and favour of the emperor Louis II. and his nobles,”—who can hardly
                    have foreseen with what ability and persistency the rights of the holy see as
                    supreme arbiter of Christendom were to be asserted even against themselves by
                    the man of their choice. Of the previous history of Nicholas nothing is
                    recorded. His pontificate of nine years and a half was marked by at least three
                    memorable contests which have left their mark in history. The first was that in
                    which he supported the claims of the unjustly degraded patriarch of.
                    Constantinople, Ignatius; the history of the conflict cannot be related here,
                    but two of its incidents, the excommunication of Photius, the rival of Ignatius,
                    by the pope in 863, and the counter-deposition of Nicholas by Photius in 867,
                    were steps of serious moment towards the permanent separation between the
                    Eastern and the Western Church. The second great struggle was that with
                    Lothaire, the king of Lorraine (second son of the emperor Lothaire I., and
                    brother of the emperor Louis II. ), about the divorce of his wife Theutberga or
                    Thietberga. The king, who desired to marry his mistress Waldrada, had brought a
                    grave charge against the life of his queen before her marriage; with the help of
                    Archbishops Gunther of Cologne and Thietgand of Treves, a confession of guilt
                    had been extorted from Thietberga, and, after the matter had been discussed at
                    more than one synod, that of Aix-la-C’hapelle finally authorized Lothaire, on
                    the strength of this confession, to marry again. Nicholas ordered a fresh synod
                    to try the cause over again at Metz in 863; but Lothaire, who was present with
                    his nobles, anew secured a judgment favourable to himself, whereupon the pope
                    not only quashed the whole proceedings, but excommunicated and deposed Gunther
                    and Thietgand, who had been audacious enough to bring to Rome in person the
                    “libellus” of the synod. The archbishops appealed to Louis II., then at
                    Benevento, to obtain the withdrawal of their sentence by force; but, although he
                    actually occupied Rome (864), he was unsuccessful in obtaining any concession,
                    and had to withdraw to Ravenna. Thietberga herself was now induced to write to
                    the pope a letter in which she declared the invalidity of her own marriage, and
                    urged the cause of Lothaire, but Nicholas, not without reason, refused to accept
                    statements which had too plainly been extorted, and wrote urging her to maintain
                    the truth steadfastly, even to the death if need were, “for, since Christ is the
                    truth, whosoever dies for the truth assuredly dies for Christ.” The imminent
                    humiliation of Lothaire was prevented only by the death of Nicholas. The third
                    great ecclesiastical cause which marks this pontificate was that in which the
                    indefeasible right of bishops to appeal to Rome against their metropolitans was
                    successfully maintained in the case of Rothad of Soissons, who had been deposed
                    by Hincmar of Rheims. It was in the course of the controversy with the great and
                    powerful Neustrian archbishop that papal recognition was first given (in 865) to
                    the pseudo-Isidorian decretals, which had probably been brought by Rothad to
                    Rome in the preceding year. (For some account of these, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Canon Law,</hi> vol. v. p. 17.) At an early period in his reign Nicholas also
                    had occasion to administer discipline to John of Ravenna, who seems to have
                    relied not only on the prestige of his famous see but also on the support of
                    Louis II. After lying under excommunication for some time he made a full
                    submission. Nicholas was the pope to whom Bogoris, the newly converted king of
                    Bulgaria, addressed himself for practical instruction in some of the difficult
                    moral and social problems which naturally arise during a transition from
                    heathenism to Christianity. The letter from the holy see in reply to the hundred
                    and six questions and petitions of the barbarian king is perhaps the most
                    interesting literary relic of Nicholas I. now extant. He died on November 13,
                    867, and was succeeded by Hadrian II.</p>
