                <p><label type="entry">NONPAREIL</label>, the name under which, from its supposed
                    matchless beauty, a little cage-bird, chiefly imported from New Orleans, has
                    long been known to English dealers (e∕. Edwards, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gleanings,</hi> i. p. 132). It is the <hi rend="italic">Emberiza</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ciris</hi> of Linnaeus, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyanosρiza</hi><hi rend="italic">ciris</hi> of most recent ornithologists,
                    belonging to a small group, which, in the present state of knowledge, cannot
                    with certainty be referred either to the Buntings or to the Finches, while some
                    authors have regarded it as a <hi rend="smallcaps">Tanager (&lt;∕.v.).</hi> The
                    cock has the head, neck, and lesser wing-coverts bright blue, the upper part of
                    the back yellow, deepening into green, and the lower parts generally, together
                    with the rump, bright scarlet, tinged on the latter with purple. This gorgeous
                    colouring is not assumed until the bird is at least two years old. The hen is
                    green above and yellow beneath; and the younger cocks present an appearance
                    intermediate between the adults of both sexes. The species, which is often also
                    called the Painted Bunting, after wintering in Central America or Mexico,
                    arrives in the southern States of the American Union in April, but does not
                    ordinarily proceed to the northward of South Carolina. In Louisiana, where it is
                    generally known to the French-speaking inhabitants as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pape—</hi> as it was to the Spaniards of Florida as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mariposa pintada</hi> (painted butterfly)—it is said to be very abundant; and
                    on its appearance in spring advantage is, or was, taken of the pugnacious
                    disposition of the males (which so often accompanies a brilliant
                    sexually-distinct plumage) to capture them alive in great numbers by means of
                    the stuffed skin of one so placed in connexion with a cage-trap that they
                    instantly fall into the latter on attacking what they conceive to be a rival. In
                    this way many thousands are said to have been taken formerly. The prisoner
                    usually reconciles himself to his fate, and in a few days will utter his
                    sprightly though not very powerful song; and, if provided with a mate and proper
                    accommodation, will breed and rear a family in confinement. Belonging to the
                    same genus as the Nonpareil is the Indigo-bird, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyanospiza</hi><hi rend="italic">cyanea,</hi> which, as a summer visitant, is
                    widely diffused from the Missouri to the Atlantic, and extends into the
                    provinces of Ontario and New Brunswick, being everywhere regarded with favour.
                    Though wanting most of the bright hues of its congener, the Indigo-bird has yet
                    much beauty, the adult cock being nearly all over of a deep blue, changing,
                    according to the light, to green. The hen is brown above and ochreous-white
                    beneath. This species is represented in the western part of the continent by the
                    Lazuli-Finch, <hi rend="italic">C. amoena,</hi> the male of which has the upper
                    parts greenish-blue, the wings barred with white, a pectoral band of light
                    chestnut extending to the flanks on each side, and the lower parts white. Of the
                    three remaining species of the genus, <hi rend="italic">C. versicolor</hi> shows
                    in the male a plumage beautifully varied with brownish-red, violet, and blue;
                    <hi rend="italic">C. leclancheri</hi> is bluish-green above and yellow beneath,
                    with an orange breast; while <hi rend="italic">C. rositae,</hi> though quite
                    distinct, comes nearest in coloration to <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ciris.</hi> These three have a more southern range than the other
                    three; but the first of them is believed occasionally to cross the Mexican
                    frontier into the United States. None of the species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyanospiza</hi> are thought to occur further south than the isthmus of Panama.
