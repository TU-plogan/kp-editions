                    the W. by Hιigli, Bardwân, Birbhùm, and Murshidàbâd districts, with an area of
                    3404 square miles. It is emphatically a district of great rivers. Standing at
                    the head of the Gangetic delta, its alluvial surface, though still liable to
                    periodical inundation, has been raised by ancient deposits of silt sufficiently
                    high to be permanent dry land. Along the entire northeastern boundary flows the
                    wide stream of the Padma or Ganges; and all the remaining rivers of the district
                    are offshoots of the great river. The Bhâgirathi on the eastern border, and the
                    Jalangi and the Matabhanga meandering through the centre of the district, are
                    the chief of these offshoots, and are called distinctively the “Nadiyâ rivers.”
                    But the whole surface of the country is interlaced with a network of minor
                    streams, communicating with one another by side channels. All the rivers are
                    navigable in the rainy season for boats of the largest burthen, but during the
                    rest of the year they dwindle down to shallow streams, with dangerous sandbanks
                    and bars.</p>
                <p>In former times the Nadiya rivers afforded the regular means of communication
                    between the upper valley of the Ganges and the seaboard; and much of the trade
                    of the district still comes down to Calcutta by this route during the height of
                    the rainy season. But the liues of the East Indian and Eastern Bengal Railways,
                    with the main stream of the Ganges and the Sundarbans route, now carry by far
                    the larger portion of the traffic.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 returned the population at 2,017,847, of whom 1,146,603 were
                    Mohammedans and 864,773 Hindus. Of the 6439 Christians, 6304 were natives.
                    Krishnagar had 24,477 inhabitants in 1881; and six others had in 1872 a
                    population exceeding 5000:—Santipur, 28,635; Kushtia, 9245; Ranaghât, 8871;
                    Nadiya, 8863; Mihrpur, 5562; and Kumârkhàli, 5251. Nadiya, the ancient capital,
                    was formerly situated on the east bank of the Bhagirathi (which has since
                    changed its course). It has always been celebrated for the sanctity ami learning
                    of its pandits. The battlefield of Plassey was situated in this district, but
                    the floods of the Bhagirathi have washed away the scene of that memorable
                    engagement. «</p>
                <p>Rice is the staple crop, and there are four harvests in the year. Indigo is the
                    chief export staple; but the district was the centre of the indigo riots in
                    1860, and the industry then received a blow from which it has never recovered. A
                    large proportion of the cultivable area of the district is held on <hi
                    rend="italic">utbandi</hi> tenure—that is, for a single season only, the rents
                    being assessed according to the out turn of the crop. Floods are common, and
                    frequently cause much damage.</p>
                <p>The number of indigo factories is still considerable. Cottonweaving is carried
                    on, but is everywhere on the decline, especially at the town of Santipur, where,
                    in the beginning of the century, the Company used to purchase muslin to the
                    annual value of £150,000. Santipur muslin is still exported to a small extent.
                    Raw date sugar is largely manufactured. The chief exports are indigo, jute,
                    linseed, wheat, pulses and gram, rice, chillies, sugar, and tobacco.</p>
                <p>The only institutions in the district worthy of note are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tols</hi> or indigenous Sanskrit schools. In these <hi rend="italic"
                    >snιriti</hi> (Hindu social and religious law) and <hi rend="italic">nydya</hi>
                    (logic) are taught by learned pandits to eager pupils. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >tols</hi> consist generally of a mere collection of mud hovels round a
                    quadrangle, where the students live in the most primitive manner, each in his
                    own hut, with his brass water-pot and mat, and seldom any other furniture. A
                    student generally remains at the <hi rend="italic">tol</hi> for eight or ten
                    years. No fees are charged, and the pandits depend for their livelihood on the
                    presents which their fame as teachers ensures them at religious ceremonies. Most
                    of the <hi rend="italic">tols</hi> are in Nadiya town, but there are also a few
                    in the surrounding villages. Their number is rapidly decreasing.</p>
                <p>The district revenue in 1880-81 amounted to Rs. 1,654,813, Rs. 1,051,776 being
                    derived from the land-tax. Education was afforded in 1877 by 897 schools,
                    attended by 28,489 pupils. The principal educational institution is the
                    Government college at Krishnagar. The average annual temperature is 77° Fahr.;
                    the average annual rainfall about 65 inches. Besides remittent and intermittent
                    fevers, which cause very great mortality, small-pox, diarrhoea, dysentery, and
                    cholera are prevalent. Cattle disease is common.</p>
