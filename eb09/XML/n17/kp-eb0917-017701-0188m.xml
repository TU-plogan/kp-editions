                <p><label type="entry">NAPIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1550-1617),
                    the inventor of logarithms, was born at Merchiston near Edinburgh in 1550, and
                    was the eighth Napier of Merchiston. The first Napier of Merchiston, “Alexander
                    Napare,” acquired the Merchiston estate before the year 1438, from James I. of
                    Scotland. He was provost of Edinburgh in 1437, and was otherwise distinguished.
                    His eldest son Alexander, who succeeded him in 1454, was provost of Edinburgh in
                    1455, 1457, and 1469; he was knighted and held various important court offices
                    under successive monarchs; at the time of his death in 1473 he was master of the
                    household to James III. His son, John Napier of Rusky, the third of Merchiston,
                    belonged to the royal household in the lifetime of his father. He also was
                    provost of Edinburgh at various times, and it is a remarkable instance of the
                    esteem in which the lairds of Merchiston were held that three of them in
                    immediate lineal succession repeatedly filled so important an office during
                    perhaps the most memorable period in the history of the city. He married a
                    great-granddaughter of Duncan, eighth earl of Levenax (or Lennox), and besides
                    this relationship by marriage the Napiers claimed a lineal male cadency from the
                    ancient family of Levenax. His eldest son, Archibald Napier of Edinbellie, the
                    fourth of Merchiston, belonged to the household of James IV. He fought at
                    Flodden and escaped with his life, but his eldest son Alexander (fifth of
                    Merchiston) was killed. Alexander’s eldest son (Alexander, sixth of Merchiston)
                    was born in 1513, and fell at the battle of Pinkie in 1547. His eldest son was
                    Archibald, seventh of Merchiston, and the father of John Napier, the subject of
                    this article.</p>
                <p>In 1549 Archibald Napier, at the early age of about fifteen, married Janet,
                    daughter of Francis Bothwell, and in the following year John Napier was born. In
                    the criminal court of Scotland, the earl of Argyll, hereditary justice-general
                    of the kingdom, sometimes presided in person, but more frequently he delegated
                    his functions; and it appears that in 1561 Archibald Napier was appointed one of
                    the justice-deputes. In the register of the court, extending over 1563 and 1564,
                    the justice-deputes named are “Archibald Naper of Merchistoune, Alexander
                    Bannatyne, burgess of Edinburgh, James Stirling of Keir, and Mr Thomas Craig.”
                    About 1565 he was knighted at the same time as James Stirling, his colleague,
                    whose daughter John Napier subsequently married. In 1582 Sir Archibald was
                    appointed master of the mint in Scotland, with the sole charge of superintending
                    the mines and minerals within the realm, and this office he held till his death
                    in 1608. His first wife died in 1563, and in 1572 he married a cousin, Elizabeth
                    Mowbray, by whom he had three sons, the eldest of whom was named Alexander.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The descent of the first
                    Napier of Merchiston has been traced to “Johan le Naper del Counte de
                    Dunbretan,” who was one of those who swore fealty to Edward I. in 1296 and
                    defended the castle of Stirling against him in 1304; but there is no authority
                    for this genealogy. The legend with regard to the origin of the name Napier was
                    given by Sir Alexander Napier, eldest son of John Napier, in 1625, in these
                    words:—“One of the ancient earls of Lennox in Scotland had issue three sons: the
                    eldest, that succeeded him to the earldom of Lennox; the second, whose name was
                    Donald; and the third, named Gilchrist. The then king of Scotland having wars,
                    did convocate his lieges to battle, amongst whom that was commanded was the earl
                    of Lennox, who, keeping his eldest son at home, sent his two sons to serve for
                    him with the forces that were under his command. This battle went hard with the
                    Scots; for the enemy pressing furiously upon them forced them to lose ground
                    until it came to flat running away, which being perceived by Donald, he pulled
                    his father’s standard from the bearer thereof, and valiantly encountering the
                    foe, being well followed by the earl of Lennox’s men, he repulsed the enemy and
                    changed the fortune of the day, whereby a great victory was got. After the
                    battle, as the manner is, every one drawing and setting forth his own acts, the
                    king said unto them, ye have all done valiantly, but there is one amongst you
                    who hath Na-Peer [i.e., no equal]; and calling Donald into his presence
                    commanded him, in regard to his worthy service, and in augmentation of his
                    honour, to change his name from Lennox to Napier, and gave him the lands of
                    Gosford, and lands in Fife, and made him his own servant, which discourse is
                    confirmed by evidences of mine, wherein we are called Lennox <hi rend="italic"
                    >alias</hi> Napier.” Sir Archibald adds that this is “the origin of our name,
                    as, by tradition from father to son, we have generally and without any doubt
                    received the same.” This written statement of the legend was occasioned by the
                    following circumstance. Robert Napier, a cousin of John Napier, had amassed
                    riches abroad as a merchant; he was created a baronet in 1612, and in order to
                    put his genealogy formally on record in the heralds’ books, he applied for an
                    authentic certificate to Sir Archibald, afterwards Lord Napier, who resided at
                    Merchiston, as the head of the family; and Sir Archibald in reply wrote out in
                    his own hand the document from which the preceding extract has been
                    made.</p></note></p>
                <p>As stated above, John Napier was born in 1550, the year in which the Reformation
                    in Scotland may be said to have commenced. In 1563, the year in which his mother
                    died, he matriculated at St Salvator’s College, St Andrews. He early became a
                    Protestant champion, and the one solitary anecdote of his youth that is known to
                    exist occurs in his address “to the Godly and Christian reader” prefixed to his
                    <hi rend="italic">Plaine Discovery.</hi> He writes :—</p>
                <p>“In my tender yeares, and barneage in Sanct-Androis at the Schooles, having, on
                    the one parte, contracted a loving familiaritie with a certaine Gentleman,
                    &amp;c. a Papist; And on the other part, being attentive to the sermons of that
                    worthie man of God, Maister Christopher Goodman, teaching upon the Apocalyps, I
                    was so mooved in admiration, against the blindnes of Papists, that could not
                    most evidently see their seven hilled citie Rome, painted out there so lively by
                    Saint John, as the mother of all spiritual whoredome, that not onely bursted I
                    out in continual reasoning against my said familiar, but also from thenceforth,
                    I determined with my seife (by the assistance of Gods spirit) to employ my
                    studie and diligence to search out the remanent mysteries of that holy Book: as
                    to this houre (praised be the Lorde) I have bin doing at al such times as
                    conveniently I might have occasion.”</p>
                <p>The names of nearly all Napier’s classfellows can be traced as becoming <hi
                    rend="italic">'determinantes</hi> in 1566 and masters of arts in 1568; but his
                    own name does not appear in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n189/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0189-0178"/> lists. The necessary inference is that his stay
                    at the university was short, and that only the groundwork of his education was
                    laid there. Although there is no direct evidence of the fact, there can be no
                    doubt that he left St Andrews to complete his education on the Continent, and
                    that he probably studied at the university of Paris, and visited Italy and
                    Germany. He did not, however, as has been supposed, spend the best years of his
                    manhood abroad, for he was certainly at home in 1571, when, being just of age,
                    the preliminaries of his marriage were arranged at Merchiston; and for many
                    years after that event he took an earnest interest in the affairs of the church,
                    the most engrossing element in the politics of the time.</p>
                <p>In 1572 John Napier married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Stirling of Keir,
                    mentioned above. This marriage took place almost immediately after his father’s
                    second marriage. About the end of the year 1579 John Napier’s wife died, leaving
                    him one son, Archibald, the first Lord Napier, and one daughter, Jane. A few
                    years afterwards he married again, the name of his second wife being Agnes
                    Chisholme, and by her he had ten children, five sons and five daughters.</p>
                <p>On the 17th of October 1593 a convention of delegates was held at Edinburgh at
                    which a committee was appointed to follow the king and lay before him in a
                    personal interview certain instructions relating to the punishment of the
                    rebellious Popish earls and the safety of the church. This committee consisted
                    of six members, two barons, two ministers, and two burgesses—the two barons
                    selected being John Napier of Merchiston and James Maxwell of Calderwood. The
                    delegates found the king at Jedburgh, and the mission, which was a dangerous
                    one, was successfully accomplished. Shortly afterwards another convention was
                    held at Edinburgh, and it was resolved that the delegates sent to Jedburgh
                    should again meet the king at Linlithgow and repeat their former instructions.
                    This was done accordingly, the number of members of the committee being,
                    however, doubled. These interviews took place in October 1593, and on the 29th
                    of the following January Napier wrote to the king the letter which forms the
                    dedication of the <hi rend="italic">Plaine Discovery.</hi></p>
                <p>The full title of this first work of Napier’s is given below.<note

                    in order that “hereby the simple of this Hand may be instructed”; and the author
                    states that he “was constrained of compassion, leaving the Latine, to haste out
                    in English this present worke.” He apologizes also for the language and his own
                    mode of expression in the following sentences:—</p>
                <p>“Whatsoever therfore through hast, is here rudely and in base language set downe,
                    I doubt not to be pardoned thereof by all good men, who, considering the
                    necessitie of this time, will esteem it more meete to make hast to prevent the
                    rising againe of Antichristian darknes within this Hand, then to prolong the
                    time in painting of language”; and “I graunt indeede, and am sure, that in the
                    style of wordes and utterance of language, we shall greatlie differ, for therein
                    I do judge my seife inferiour to all men: so that scarcely in these high matters
                    could I with long deliberation finde wordes to expresse my minde.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The work was translated into

                    published at Frankfort, which reached its third edition in 1627. The second
                    English edition appeared in 1611, and in the preface to it Napier states he
                    intended to have published an edition in Latin soon after the original
                    publication in 1593, but that, as the work had now been made public by the
                    French and German translations, and as he was “advertised that our papistical
                    adversaries wer to write larglie against the said editions that are alreadie set
                    out,” he defers the Latin edition “till having first seene the adversaries
                    objections, I may insert in the Latin edition an apologie of that which is
                    rightly done, and an amends of whatsoever is amisse.” No criticism on the work
                    was ever published, and there was no Latin edition. A third edition appeared in
                    1645.</p></note></p>
                <p>It is not to be supposed that Napier’s <hi rend="italic">Plaine Discovery</hi>
                    was in any respect due to a visionary cloud passing over his mind, or to any
                    temporary infatuation; on the contrary, it is a serious and laborious work, to
                    which he had devoted years of care and thought, and which is closely connected
                    with the history of the times. In one sense it may be said to stand to
                    theological literature in Scotland in something of the same position as that
                    occupied by the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirificus</hi>
                    with respect to the scientific literature, for it is the first published
                    original work relating to theological interpretation, and is quite without a
                    predecessor in its own field. In judging of the book, the circumstances of the
                    time and the state of the country have to be taken into account. Napier lived in
                    the very midst of fiercely contending religious factions, and his home was
                    situated in a district which was the scene of constant wars and disturbances;
                    there was but little theological teaching of any kind, and the work related to
                    what were then the leading political and religious questions of the day.</p>
                <p>After the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Plaine Discovery,</hi> Napier
                    seems to have occupied himself with the invention of secret instruments of war,
                    for in the Bacon collection at Lambeth Palace there is a document, dated June 7,
                    1596, and signed by Napier, giving a list of his inventions for the defence of
                    the country against the anticipated invasion by Philip of Spain. The document is
                    entitled “Secrett Inventionis, proffitabill and necessary in theis dayes for
                    defence of this Hand, and withstanding of strangers, enemies of God’s truth and
                    religion,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A facsimile
                    of this document is given by Mr Mark Napier in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    John Napier.</hi></p></note> and the inventions consist of (1) a mirror for
                    burning the enemies’ ships at any distance, (2) a piece of artillery destroying
                    everything round an arc of a circle, and (3) a round metal chariot, so
                    constructed that its occupants could move it rapidly and easily, while firing
                    out through small holes in it. It has been asserted (by Sir Thomas Urquhart)
                    that the piece of artillery was actually tried upon a plain in Scotland with
                    complete success, a number of sheep and cattle being destroyed.</p>
                <p>In 1614 appeared the work which in the history of British science can be placed

                <p>The nature of logarithms is explained by reference to the motion of points in a

                    into English was made by Edward Wright, and published after his death by his son
                    Samuel Wright, at London, in 1618, under the title <hi rend="italic">A

                    Edward Wright, who was a fellow of Caius College, Cambridge, occupies a
                    conspicuous place in the history of navigation. In 1599 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">Certaine</hi><hi rend="italic">errors in Navigation detected and
                    corrected,</hi> and he was the author of other works; to him also is chiefly due
                    the invention of the method known as Mercator’s sailing. He at once saw the
                    value of logarithms as an aid to navigation, and lost no time in preparing a
                    translation, which he submitted to Napier himself. The preface to Wright’s
                    edition consists of a translation of the preface to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirificus,</hi> together with the addition of the
                    following sentences written by Napier himself:—“But now some of our Countreymen
                    in this Island well affected to these studies, and the more publique good,
                    procured a most learned Mathematician to translate the same into our vulgar
                    English tongue, whe after he had finished it, sent the Coppy of it to me, to bee
                    scene and considered on by myselfe. I having most willingly and gladly done the
                    same, finde it to bee most exact and precisely conformable to my minde and the
                    originali. Therefore it may please you who are inclined to these studies, to
                    receive it from me and the Translator, with as much good will as we recommend it
                    unto you.”</p>
                <p>There is a short “preface to the reader” by Briggs, and a description of a
                    triangular diagram invented by Wright for finding the proportional parts. The
                    table is printed to one figure less than in the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mirificus.</hi> Edward Wright died in 1615, and his son in the
                    preface states that his father “gave much commendation of this work (and often
                    in my hearing) as of very great use for mariners”; and with respect to the
                    translation he says that “shortly after he had it returned out of Scotland, it
                    pleased God to call him away afore he could publish it.”</p>

                    there is prefixed to it as preface a dedicatory epistle to the high chancellor
                    of Scotland. The method which Napier terms “Rabdologia” consists in the use of
                    certain numerating rods for the performance of multiplications and divisions.
                    These rods, which were commonly called “Napier’s bones,” will be described
                    further on. The second method, which he calls the “Promptuarium
                    Multiplicationis” on account of its being the most expeditious of all for the
                    performance of multiplications, involves the use of a number of lamellae or
                    little plates of metal disposed in a box. In an appendix of forty-one pages he
                    gives his third method, “local arithmetic,” which is performed on a chess-board,
                    and depends, in principle, on the expression of numbers in the scale of radix 2.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Rabdologia</hi> he gives the chronological order of his
                    inventions. He speaks of the canon of logarithms as “a me longo tempore
                    elaboratum.” The other three methods he devised for the sake of those who would
                    prefer to work with natural numbers; and he mentions that the promptuary was his
                    latest invention. In the preface to the appendix containing the local arithmetic
                    he states that, while devoting all his leisure to the invention of these
                    abbreviations of calculation, and to examining by what methods the toil of
                    calculation might be removed, in addition to the logarithms, rabdologia, and
                    promptuary, he had hit upon a certain tabular arithmetic, whereby the more
                    troublesome operations of common arithmetic are performed on an abacus or
                    chess-board, and which may be regarded as an amusement rather than a labour,
                    for, by means of it, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and even
                    the extraction of roots are accomplished simply by the motion of counters. He
                    adds that he has appended it to the <hi rend="italic">Rabdologia,</hi> in
                    addition to the promptuary, because he did not wish to bury it in silence, nor
                    to publish so small a matter by itself. With respect to the calculating rods,
                    Napier mentions in the dedication that they had already found so much favour as
                    to be almost in common use, and even to have been carried to foreign countries;
                    and that he has been advised to publish his little work relating to their
                    mechanism and use, lest they should be put forth in some one else’s name.</p>
                <p>John Napier died on April 4, 1617, the same year as that in which the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rabdologia</hi> was published, so that his death must have taken
                    place very soon after its appearance. His will, which is extant, was signed on
                    the fourth day before his death. No particulars are known of his last illness,
                    but it seems likely that death came upon him rather suddenly at last. In both
                    the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirificus</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rabdologia,</hi> however, he makes reference to his ill-health. In
                    the dedication of the former he refers to himself as “mihi jam morbis penè
                    confecto,” and in the “Admonitio” at the end he speaks of his “infirma valetudo
                    ”; while in the latter he says he has been obliged to leave the calculation of
                    the new canon of logarithms to others “ob infirmam corporis nostri
                    valetudinem.”</p>
                <p>It is usually stated that John Napier was buried in St Giles’s church, Edinburgh,
                    and there can be no doubt that some of the family of Napier were buried there in
                    the 16th or 17 th century, but the late Professor Wallace, in a paper read
                    before the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1832, and quoted by Mr Mark
                    Napier on pp. 425-427 of his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of John Napier of
                    Merchiston,</hi> gives evidence for believing that he was buried in St
                    Cuthbert’s church. Professor Wallace’s words are—</p>
                <p>“My authority for this belief is unquestionable. It is a Treatise on
                    Trigonometry, by a Scotsman, James Hume of Godscroft, Berwickshire, a place
                    still in possession of the family of Hum» The work in question, which is rare,
                    was printed at Paris, and has the date 1636 on the title-page, but the royal
                    privilege which secured it to the author is dated in October 1635, and it may
                    have been written several years earlier. In his treatise (page 116) Hume says,
                    speaking of logarithms, ‘ L’inuenteur estoit un Seigneur de grande condition, et
                    duquel la postérité est aujourd’huy en possession de grandes dignitéz dans le
                    royaume, qùi estant sur Page, et grandement trauaillé des gouttes ne pouvait
                    faire autre chose que de s’adonner aux sciences, et principalment aux
                    mathématiques et à la logistique, à quoy il se plaisoit infiniment, et auec
                    estrange peine, a construict ses Tables des Logarymes, imprimées à Edinbourg en
                    l’an 1614. ... Il mourut l’an 1616, et fut enterré hors la Porte Occidentale
                    d’Edinbourg, dans l’Eglise de Sainct Cudbert. ’”</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that Napier’s devotion to mathematics was not due to old
                    age and the gout, and that he died in 1617 and not in 1616; still these
                    sentences were written within eighteen years of Napier’s death, and their author
                    seems to have had some special sources of information. Additional probability is
                    given to Hume’s assertion by the fact that Merchiston is situated in St
                    Cuthbert’s parish. It is nowhere else recorded that Napier suffered from the
                    gout.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirificus</hi> contains only an
                    explanation of the use of the logarithms without any account of the manner in
                    which the canon was constructed. In an “Admonitio” on the seventh page he states
                    that, although in that place the mode of construction should be explained, he
                    proceeds at once to the use of the logarithms, <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> ‘
                    ut praelibatis prius usu, et rei utilitate, caetera aut magis placeant posthac
                    edenda, aut minus saltem displiceant silentio sepulta.” He awaits therefore the
                    judgment and censure of the learned “priusquam caetera in lucem temerè prolata
                    lividorum detrectationi exponantur”; and in an “Admonitio” on the last page of
                    the book he states that he will publish the mode of construction of the canon
                    “si huius inventi usum eruditis gratum fore intellexero.”</p>
                <p>Napier, as we have seen, died in 1617, immediately after the appearance of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rabdologia,</hi> and before he had <pb break="no"

                    preface of two pages, followed by sixty-seven pages of text. In the preface
                    Robert Napier says that he has been assured from undoubted authority that the
                    new invention is much thought of by the ablest mathematicians, and that nothing
                    would delight them more than the publication of the mode of construction of the
                    canon. He therefore issues the work to satisfy their desires, although, he
                    states, it is manifest that it would have seen the light in a far more perfect
                    state if his father could have put the finishing touches to it; and he mentions
                    that, in the opinion of the best judges, his father possessed, among other most
                    excellent gifts, in the highest degree the power of explaining the most
                    difficult matters by a certain and easy method in the fewest possible words.</p>
                <p>It is important to notice that in the <hi rend="italic">Constructio</hi>
                    logarithms are called artificial numbers; and Robert Napier states that the work
                    was composed several years <hi rend="italic">(aliquot annos)</hi> before Napier
                    had invented the name logarithm. The <hi rend="italic">Constructio</hi>
                    therefore may have been written a good many years previous to the publication of

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Canon Mirificus,</hi> on its appearance in 1614, at once
                    attracted the attention of perhaps the two most eminent English mathematicians
                    then living—Edward Wright and Henry Briggs. The former, as we have seen,
                    translated the work into English, but died in 1615 before he could publish his
                    translation. The latter was concerned with Napier in the change of the
                    logarithms from those originally invented to decimal or common logarithms, and
                    it is to him that the original calculation of the logarithmic tables now in use
                    is mainly due (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Briggs).</hi> He died on January 26,
                    1631, aged about seventy-four years, so that at the time of the publication of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Canon Mirificus</hi> he was about fifty-seven years of
                    age. In a letter to Archbishop Ussher, dated Gresham House, March 10, 1615,
                    Briggs wrote, “Napper, lord of Markinston, hath set my head and hands a work
                    with his new and admirable logarithms. I hope to see him this summer, if it
                    please God, for I never saw book which pleased me better, or made me more
                    wonder.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Thomas Smith
                    thus describes the ardour with which Briggs studied the <hi rend="italic">Canon

                    concerning eclipses, for what is there which we may not hope for at his hands”;
                    and he also states “that he was wholly taken up and employed about the noble
                    invention of logarithm!, lately discovered.” In the summer of 1615 he went to
                    Merchiston and stayed with Napier a whole month; he repeated his visit in 1616,
                    and, as he states, he “would have been glad to make him a third visit, if it had
                    pleased God to spare him so long.” William Lilly, the astrologer, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Life and Times,</hi> 1721, gives the following account of the
                    meeting between Napier and Briggs on the occasion of the first visit :—</p>
                <p>“I will acquaint you with one memorable story, related unto me by Mr John Marr,
                    an excellent mathematician and geometrician, whom I conceive you remember: he
                    was servant to King James and Charles I. At first, when the Lord Napier, or
                    Marchiston, first made publick his logarithms, Mr Briggs, then reader of the
                    Astronomy lecture at Gresham College in London, was so surprised with admiration
                    of them that he could have no quietness in himself, until he had seen that noble
                    person the Lord Marchiston whose only invention they were: he acquaints John
                    Marr herewith, who went into Scotland before Mr Briggs, purposely to be there
                    when these two so learned persons should meet. Mr Briggs appoints a certain day
                    when to meet at Edinburgh: but failing thereof, the Lord Napier was doubtful he
                    would not come. It happened one day as John Marr and the Lord Napier were
                    speaking of Mr Briggs; ‘Ah, John,’ saith Marchiston, ‘Mr Briggs will not now
                    come’; at the very instant one knocks at the gate; John Marr hasted down and it
                    proved Mr Briggs to his great contentment. He brings Mr Briggs up into my Lord’s
                    chamber, where almost one quarter of an hour was spent, each beholding the other
                    almost with admiration, before one word was spoke. At last Mr Briggs began— ‘ My
                    Lord, I have undertaken this long journey purposely to see your person, and to
                    know by what engine of wit or ingenuity you came first to think of this most
                    excellent help unto Astronomy, viz., the Logarithms; but my Lord, being by you
                    found out, I wonder nobody else found it out before, when now known it is so
                    easy.’ He was nobly entertained by the Lord Napier, and every summer after that,
                    during the Lord’s being alive, this venerable man, Mr Briggs went purposely into
                    Scotland to visit him.”</p>
                <p>With respect to the change of the logarithms to decimal logarithms, the
                    concluding paragraph of the “Admonitio” which appears on the last page of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi> of 1614 is “Verùm si huius inventi usum eruditis
                    gratum fore intellexero, dabo fortasse brevi (Deo aspirante) rationem ac
                    methodum aut hunc canonem emendandi, aut emendatiorem de novo condendi, ut ita
                    plurium Logistarum diligentia, limatior tandem et accuratior, quam unius opera
                    fieri potuit, in lucem prodeat. Nihil in ortu perfectum.” In some copies,
                    however, this “Admonitio” is absent. In Wright’s translation of 1616 Napier has
                    added the sentence—“But because the addition and subtraction of these former
                    numbers may seeme somewhat painfull, I intend (if it shall please God) in a
                    second Edition, to set out such Logarithmes as shall make those numbers above
                    written to fall upon decimal numbers, such as 100,000,000, 200,000,000,
                    300,000,000, &amp;c., which are easie to be added or abated to or from any other
                    number” (p. 19); and in the dedication to the <hi rend="italic">Rabdologia</hi>
                    (1617) he wrote “Quorum quidem Logarithmorum speciem aliam multô praestan-tiorem
                    nunc etiam invenimus, &amp; creandi methodum, unà cum eorum usu (si Deus
                    longiorem vitae &amp; valetudinis usuram concesserit) evulgare statuimus; ipsam

                    charissimo.”</p>
                <p>Briggs published in 1617, after Napier’s death, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Logarithmorum Chilias Prima,</hi> containing the decimal logarithms of the
                    first thousand numbers to 14 places of decimals. This is the first table of
                    common (or Briggian) logarithms calculated or published. In 1624 he published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica Logarithmica,</hi> containing the logarithms
                    of the first 20,000 numbers and of the numbers from 90,000 to 100,000 to 14
                    places of decimals. In the short preface <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n192/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0192-0181"/> to the <hi rend="italic">Chilias</hi> (1617)
                    Briggs states that the reason why his logarithms are different from those
                    introduced by Napier “sperandum, ejus librum posthumum, abunde nobis propediem
                    satisfacturum.” The “liber posthumus” was the <hi rend="italic">Constructio</hi>
                    (1619), in the preface to which Robert Napier states that he has added an
                    appendix relating to another and more excellent species of logarithms referred
                    to by the inventor himself in the <hi rend="italic">Rabdologia,</hi> and in
                    which the logarithm of unity is 0. He also mentions that he has published some
                    remarks upon the propositions in spherical trigonometry and upon the new species
                    of logarithms by Henry Briggs, “qui novi hujus Canonis supputandi laborem
                    gravissimum, pro singulari amicitia quae illi cum Patre meo L. Μ. intercessit,

                    >Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmica</hi> (1625) Briggs bids the
                    reader not to be surprised that these logarithms are different from those

                <p>These extracts contain all the original statements made by Napier, Robert Napier,
                    and Briggs which have reference to the origin of decimal logarithms. It will be
                    seen that they are all in perfect agreement. Briggs pointed out in his lectures
                    at Gresham College that it would be more convenient that 0 should stand for the
                    logarithm of the whole sine as in the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mirificus,</hi> but that the logarithm of the tenth part of the
                    whole sine (that is to say, of the sine of <hi rend="italic">5°</hi> 44' 21'')
                    should be 10,000,000,000. He wrote also to Napier at once; and as soon as he
                    could he tvent to Edinburgh to visit him, where, as he was most hospitably
                    received by him, he remained for a whole month. When they conversed about the
                    change of system, Napier said that he had felt and desired the same thing, but
                    that he had published the tables which he had already prepared, so that they
                    might be used until he could construct others more convenient. But he considered
                    that the change ought to be so made that 0 should be the logarithm of unity and
                    10,000,000,000 that of the whole sine, which Briggs could not but admit was by
                    far the most convenient of all. Rejecting therefore those which he had prepared
                    already, Briggs began, at Napier’s advice, to consider seriously the question of
                    the calculation of new tables. In the following summer he went to Edinburgh and
                    showed Napier the principal portion of the logarithms which he published in
                    1624. These probably included the logarithms of the first chiliad which he
                    published in 1617.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately Hutton in his history of logarithms, which was prefixed to the
                    early editions of his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Tables,</hi> and was also
                    published as one of his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Tracts,</hi> has charged
                    Napier with want of candour in not telling the world of Briggs’s share in the
                    change of system, and he expresses the suspicion that “Napier was desirous that
                    the world should ascribe to him alone the merit of this very useful improvement
                    of the logarithms.” According to Hutton’s view, the words “<hi rend="italic">it
                    is to be hoped</hi> that his posthumous work” . . . . which occur in the preface
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Chilias,</hi> were a modest hint that the share Briggs
                    had had in changing the logarithms should be mentioned, and that, as no
                    attention was paid to it, he himself gave the account which appears in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi> of 1624. There seems, however, no ground whatever
                    for supposing that Briggs meant to express anything beyond his hope that the
                    reason for the alteration would be explained in the posthumous work; and in his
                    own account, written seven years after Napier’s death and five years after the
                    appearance of the work itself, he shows no injured feeling whatever, but even
                    goes out of his way to explain that he abandoned his own proposed alteration in
                    favour of Napier’s, and, rejecting the tables he had already constructed, began
                    to consider the calculation of new ones. The facts, as stated by Napier and
                    Briggs, are in complete accordance, and the friendship existing between them was
                    perfect and unbroken to the last. Briggs assisted Robert Napier in the editing
                    of the “posthumous work,” the <hi rend="italic">Constructio,</hi> and in the
                    account he gives of the alteration of the logarithms in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetica</hi> of 1624 he seems to have been more anxious that justice should
                    be done to Napier than to himself; while on the other hand Napier received
                    Briggs most hospitably and refers to him as “amico mihi longé charissimo.”</p>
                <p>Hutton’s unfair suggestions are all the more to be regretted as they occur in a
                    history which is the result of a good deal of investigation, and which has been
                    referred to as an authority by many English and foreign writers. He seems to
                    have felt a strong prejudice against Napier for some reason, and all his
                    statements with regard to the origin of logarithms and Napier’s connexion with
                    them are untrustworthy. While speaking of the change of the logarithms, it
                    should be noticed that the “Admonitio” on the last page of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirificus,</hi> containing the reference to the new
                    logarithms, does not occur in all the copies. It is printed on the back of the
                    last page of the table itself, and so cannot have been torn out from the copies
                    that are without it. As there could have been no reason for omitting it after it
                    had once appeared, we may assume that the copies which do not have it are those
                    which were first issued. It is probable therefore that Briggs’s copy contained
                    no reference to the change, and it is even possible that the “Admonitio” may
                    have been added after Briggs had communicated with Napier. As special attention
                    has not been drawn to the fact that some copies have the “Admonitio” and some
                    have not, different writers have assumed that Briggs did or did not know of the
                    promise contained in the “Admonitio” according as it was present or absent in
                    the copies they had themselves referred to, and this has given rise to some
                    confusion. It ought also to be borne in mind that had Napier lived to publish
                    the <hi rend="italic">Constructio</hi> himself, he would probably have referred
                    to Briggs in much warmer terms than those used by Robert Napier, who doubtless
                    regarded it as due to his father’s memory to simply state the facts as he knew
                    them. The character of Briggs is very amiable and perfect; he states with
                    modesty and simplicity his own share in the improvement; and with complete
                    loyalty to his friend, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0193-0182"/> with great earnestness, he devoted the rest of
                    his life to extend the utility of Napier’s splendid invention.</p>
                <p>Napier’s original canon is a table of logarithms of sines, and it was clearly
                    Briggs’s original intention to calculate logarithms of sines also; it does not
                    appear from the account he gives who it was who first suggested the tabulation
                    of the logarithms of numbers instead of sines.</p>
                <p>Kepler received the invention of logarithms with great enthusiasm. His first
                    mention of them occurs in a letter to Schikhart dated March 11, 1618, in which
                    he writes —“Extitit Scotus Baro, cujus nomen mihi excidit, qui praeclari quid
                    praestitit, necessitate omni multiplicationum et divisionum in meras additiones
                    et subtractiones commutata, nec sinibus utitur: at tamen opus est ipsi
                    tangentium canone: et varietas, crebritas, difficultasque additionum
                    subtractionumque alicubi laborem multiplicandi et dividendi superat.” This
                    erroneous estimate was formed when he had seen the <hi rend="italic"

                    to Napier dated July 28, 1619, and he there congratulates him warmly on his

                    upon his own Rudolρhine tables. He says that, although Napier’s book had been
                    published five years, he first saw it at Prague two years before; he was then
                    unable to read it, but last year he had met with a little work by Benjamin

                    the substance of the method, and he at once recognized the importance of what
                    had been effected. He then explains how he verified the canon, and so found that
                    there were no essential errors in it, although there were a few inaccuracies
                    near the beginning of the quadrant, and he proceeds, “Haec te obiter scire
                    volui, ut quibus tu methodis incesseris, quas non dubito et plurimas et
                    ingeniosissimas tibi in promptu esse, eas publici juris fieri, mihi saltem (puto

                    debitum cecidisse intelligeres.” This letter was written two years after
                    Napier’s death, of which Kepler was ignorant, and in the same year as that in
                    which the <hi rend="italic">Constructio</hi> was published. In 1624 Kepler
                    published a table of Napierian logarithms, with certain modifications and
                    additions.</p>
                <p>In a letter from Kepler to Petrus Cugerus there occurs the remarkable
                    sentence—“Nihil autem supra Neperianam rationem esse puto: etsi quidem Scotus
                    quidam literis ad Tychonem A. cioioxciv. scriptis jam spem fecit Canonis illius
                    Mirifici.” It is here distinctly stated that some Scotsman in the year 1594, in
                    a letter to Tycho Brahe, gave him some hope of the logarithms; and as Kepler
                    joined Tycho after his expulsion from the island of Huen, and had been so
                    closely associated with him in his work, he would be likely to be correct in any
                    assertion of this kind. In connexion with Kepler’s statement the following
                    story, told by Anthony Wood in the <hi rend="italic">Athenae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Oxonienses,</hi> should be noticed :—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ It must be now known, that one Dr Craig, a Scotchman . . . coming out of
                    Denmark into his own country, called upon Joh.Neper, Baron of Mercheston, near
                    Edinburgh, and told him, among other discourses, of a new invention in Denmark
                    (by Longomontanus, as ’ tis said), to save the tedious multiplication and
                    division in astronomical calculations. Neper being solicitous to know farther of
                    him concerning this matter, he could give no other account of it than that it
                    was by proportional numbers. Which hint Neper taking, he desired him at his
                    return to call upon him again. Craig, after some weeks had passed, did so, and
                    Neper then showed him a rude draught of what he called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">mirabilis</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmorum.</hi>
                    Which draught, with some alterations, he printing in 1614, it came forthwith
                    into the hands of our author Briggs, and into those of Will. Oughtred, from whom
                    the relation of this matter came.”</p>
                <p>Longomontanus was Tycho’s assistant, and this story, though obviously untrue in
                    its facts, is of importance, as it connects Dr Craig with Napier and
                    Longomontanus. In the early part of this article Thomas Craig was mentioned as
                    one of the colleagues of Sir Archibald l·sapier, John Napier’s father, in the
                    office of justice-depute. He is well known as the author of a celebrated legal
                    work <hi rend="italic">De Feudis,</hi> and between his third son John Craig and
                    John Napier a friendship sprang up which may have been due to their common taste
                    for mathematics. There are extant three letters from Dr John Craig to Tycho
                    Brahe, which show that he was on the most friendly terms with him. In the first
                    letter, of which the date is not given, Craig says that Sir William Stewart has
                    safely delivered to him, “about the beginning of last winter,” the book which he
                    sent him. Now Mr Mark Napier found in the library of the university of Edinburgh
                    a mathematical work bearing a sentence in Latin of which the translation is “To
                    Doctor John Craig of Edinburgh, in Scotland, a most illustrious man, highly
                    gifted with various and excellent learning, professor of medicine, and
                    exceedingly skilled in the mathematics, Tycho Brahe hath sent this gift, and
                    with his own hand written this at Urauiburg, 2d November 1588.” As Sir William
                    Stewart was sent to Denmark to arrange the preliminaries of King James’s
                    marriage, and returned to Edinburgh on November 15, 1588, there can be little
                    doubt that this was the volume referred to by Craig. It appears from Craig’s
                    letter, to which we may therefore assign the date 1589, that, five years before,
                    he had made an attempt to reach Uraniburg, but had been baffled by the storms
                    and rocks of Norway, and that ever since then he had been longing to visit
                    Tycho. Now John Craig was physician to the king, and in 1590 James VI. spent
                    some days at Uraniburg before returning to Scotland from his matrimonial
                    expedition. It seems not unlikely therefore that Craig may have accompanied the
                    king in his visit to Uraniburg. In any case it is certain that Craig was a
                    friend and correspondent of Tycho’s, and there can be but little doubt that he
                    was the “Scotus quidam.”</p>
                <p>It is therefore clear that as early as 1594 Napier must have communicated to
                    Craig his hope of being able to effect the simplification of the processes of
                    arithmetic. Everything tends to show that the invention of logarithms was the
                    result of many years of labour and thought, undertaken with this special object,
                    and it thus appears that Napier had seen some prospect of success nearly twenty
                    years before the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mirificus.</hi> It is very evident that no mere hint with regard
                    to the use of proportional numbers could have been of any service to Napier, but
                    it is possible that the news brought by Craig of the difficulties placed in the
                    progress of astronomy by the labour of the calculations may have stimulated him
                    to persevere in his efforts.</p>
                <p>The “new invention in Denmark” to which Anthony Wood refers as having given the
                    hint to Napier was probably the method of calculation called prosthaphaeresis
                    (often written in Greek letters πρoσ0α&lt;⅛αιp∈σιs), which had its origin in the
                    solution of spherical triangles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A careful examination of the history of the method is given

                    tabular results taken from a table of sines; and, as such products occur in the
                    solution of spherical triangles, the method affords the solution of spherical
                    triangles in certain cases by addition and subtraction only. It seems to be due
                    to Wittich of Breslau, who was assistant for a short time to Tycho Brahe; and it
                    was used by them in their calculations in 1582. Wittich in 1584 made known at
                    Cassel the calculation of one case by this prosthaphseresis; and Justus Byrgius
                    proved it in such a manner that from his proof the extension to the solution of
                    all triangles could be deduced. Clavius generalized the method in his treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De Astroidbio</hi> (1593), lib. i. lemma liii. The lemma

                    >Fundamentum Astronomicum</hi> (1588). Longomontanus, in his <hi rend="italic"

                    method, stating that it is not to be found in the writings of the Arabs or
                    Regiomontanus. As Longomontanus is mentioned in Anthony Wood’s anecdote, and as
                    Wittich as well as Longomontanus were assistants of Tycho, there seems little
                    room for doubt that Wittich’s prosthaphseresis is the method referred to by

                    edition of Kepler’s works, vol. iv. pp. 527-530. See also a paper “On

                    >Philosophical Magazine</hi> for November 1878.</p></note> which took place at
                    the end of 1608, that Her wart used his table when in manuscript for the
                    performance of multiplications in general, and that the occurrence of the word
                    prosthaphseresis on the title is due to Kepler, who pointed out that by means of
                    the table spherical triangles could be solved more easily than by Wittich’s
                    prosthaphseresis.</p>
                <p>It is evident that Wittich’s prosthaphseresis could not be a good method of
                    practically effecting multiplications unless the quantities to be multiplied
                    were sines, on account of the labour of the interpolations. It satisfies the
                    condition, however, equally with logarithms, of enabling multiplication to be
                    performed by the aid of a table of single entry; and, analytically considered,
                    it is not so different in principle from the logarithmic method. In fact, if we
                    put <hi rend="italic">xy = φ</hi> (X + Y), X being a function of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> only and Y a function of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> only, we
                    can show that we must have X = Ae <hi rend="superscript"> 91</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">y = Εe</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> il</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >'∙,</hi> and if we put <hi rend="italic">xy = φ(X + Υ')</hi>- &lt;∕&gt;(X -Y),
                    the solutions are φ(X +Y) = {-(x +j∕) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and ic =
                    sinX, y = sinY, φ(X + Y)= -∣cos(X + Y). The former solution gives a method known
                    as that of quartersquares; the latter gives the method of prosthaphaeresis.</p>
                <p>An account of the logarithmic table of Justus Byrgius is given in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Logarithms.</hi></p>
                <p>The more one considers the condition of science at the time, and the state of the
                    country in which the discovery took place, the more wonderful does the invention
                    of logarithms appear. When algebra had advanced to the point where exponents
                    were introduced, nothing would be more natural than that their utility as a
                    means of performing multiplications and divisions should be remarked; but it is
                    one of the surprises in the history of science that logarithms were invented as
                    an arithmetical improvement years before their connexion with exponents was
                    known. It is to be noticed also that the invention was not the result of any
                    happy accident. Napier deliberately set himself to abbreviate multiplications
                    and divisions,— operations of so fundamental a character that it might well have
                    been thought that they were <hi rend="italic">in rerum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >natura</hi> incapable of abbreviation; and he succeeded in devising, by the
                    help of arithmetic and geometry alone, the one great simplification of which
                    they were susceptible,—a simplification to which the following two hundred and
                    seventy years have added nothing.</p>
                <p>When Napier published the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mirificus</hi> England had taken no part in the advance of science, and there
                    is no British author of the time except Napier whose name can be placed in the
                    same rank as those of Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, or Stevinus. In
                    England, Robert Recorde had indeed published his mathematical treatises, but
                    they were of trifling importance and without influence on the history of
                    science. Scotland had produced nothing, and was perhaps the last country in
                    Europe from which a great mathematical discovery would have been expected.
                    Napier lived, too, not only in a wild country, which was in a lawless and
                    unsettled state during most of his life, but also in a credulous and
                    superstitious age. Like Kepler and all his contemporaries he believed in
                    astrology, and he certainly also had some faith in the power of magic, for there
                    is extant a deed written in his own handwriting containing a contract between
                    himself and Robert Logan of Restalrig, a turbulent baron of desperate character,
                    by which Napier undertakes “to serche and sik out, and be al craft and ingyne
                    that he dow, to tempt, trye, and find out” some buried treasure supposed to be
                    hidden in Logan’s fortress at Fastcastle, in consideration of receiving
                    one-third part of the treasure found by his aid. In the deed Logan also agrees
                    to conduct Napier from Edinburgh to Fastcastle and back again, without his being
                    despoiled of his third part or otherwise harmed, when the deed is to be
                    cancelled and destroyed as a discharge in full. “And incaiss the said Jhone sal
                    find na poiss to be thair eftir all tryall and utter diligens tane; he referris
                    the satisfactione of his trawell and painis to the discretione of the said
                    Robert.” Of this singular contract, which is signed “Robert Logane of
                    Restalrige” and “Jhone Neper, Fear of Merchiston,” and is dated July 1594, a
                    facsimile is given in Mr Mark Napier’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of the contract itself Mr
                    Mark Napier writes: “The singularity of his holding conference with one who had
                    just been proclaimed an outlaw, and whose lawless violence is alluded to and
                    provided against by Napier himself, must be accounted for by the rude state of
                    society, and the simplicity of our philosopher’s character. He took care to word
                    the contract itself, however, and there is not an expression which indicates an
                    idea beyond the most legitimate purpose; but, under the shield of his own
                    innocence, he never dreamed of contamination from his company, was fond of the
                    romance of science, and not averse (nothing derogatory in his times) to the
                    prospect of gold.”— <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> p. 223.</p></note> As the
                    deed was not destroyed, but is in existence now, it is to be presumed that the

                    illustration of the state of society and the kind of events in the midst of
                    which logarithms had their birth. Considering the time in which he lived, Napier
                    is singularly free from superstition: his <hi rend="italic">Plaine
                    Discovery</hi> relates to a method of interpretation which belongs to a later
                    age; he shows no trace of the extravagances which occur everywhere in the works
                    of Kepler; and none of his writings contain any allusion to astrology or
                    magic.</p>
                <p>After Napier’s death his manuscripts and notes came into the possession, not of
                    his eldest sou Archibald, but of his second son by his second marriage, Robert,
                    who edited the <hi rend="italic">Constructio</hi>; and Colonel Milliken Napier,
                    Robert’s lineal male representative, was still in the possession of many of
                    these private papers at the close of the last century. On one occasion when
                    Colonel Napier was called from home on foreign service, these papers, together
                    with a portrait of John Napier and a Bible with his autograph, were deposited
                    for safety in a room of the house at Milliken, in Renfrewshire. During the
                    owner’s absence the house was burned to the ground, and all the papers and
                    relics were destroyed. The manuscripts had not been arranged or examined, so
                    that the extent of the loss is unknown. Fortunately, however, Robert Napier had
                    transcribed his father’s manuscript <hi rend="italic">De Arte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Logistica,</hi> and the copy escaped the fate of the originals in
                    the manner explained in the following note, written in the volume containing
                    them by Francis, seventh Lord Napier:—“John Napier of Merchiston, inventor of
                    the logarithms, left his manuscripts to his son Robert, who appears to have
                    caused the following pages to have been written out fair from his father’s
                    notes, for Mr Briggs, professor of geometry at Oxford. They were given to
                    Francis, the fifth Lord Napier, by William Napier of Culcreugh, Esq., heir-male
                    of the above-named Robert. Finding them in a neglected state, amongst my family
                    papers, I have bound them together, in order to preserve them entire.— <hi

                <p>An account of the contents of these manuscripts was given by Mr Mark Napier in
                    the appendix to his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of John Napier,</hi> and the
                    manuscripts themselves were edited in their entirety by him in 1839 under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">De Arte</hi><hi rend="italic">Logistica</hi><hi

                    as one of the publications of the Bannatyne Club. The treatise occupies one
                    hundred and sixty-two pages, and there is an introduction by Mr Mark Napier of
                    ninety-four pages. The <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic</hi> consists of three
                    books, entitled—(1) De Computationibus Quantitatum omnibus Logisticae speciebus
                    communium; (2) De Logistica Arithmetica; (3) De Logistica Geometrica. At the end
                    of this book occurs the note—“I could find no more of this geometricali pairt
                    amongst all his fragments.” The <hi rend="italic">Algebra Joannis Naperi
                    Merchistonii Baronis</hi> consists of two books:—(1) “De nominata Algebrae
                    parte; (2) De positiva sive cossica Algebrae parte,” and concludes with the
                    words, “There is no more of his algebra orderlie sett doun.” The transcripts are
                    entirely in the handwriting of Robert Napier himself, and the two notes that
                    have been quoted prove that they were made from Napier’s own papers. The title,
                    which is written on the first leaf, and is’also in Robert Napier’sλvriting, runs
                    thus:—“The Baron of Merchiston his booke of Arithmeticke and Algebra. For Mr
                    Henrie Briggs, Professor of Geometrie at Oxforde.”</p>
                <p>These treatises were probably composed before Napier had invented the logarithms
                    or any of the apparatuses described in the <hi rend="italic">Babdologia</hi>;
                    for they contain no allusion to the principle of logarithms, even where we
                    should expect to find such a reference, and the one solitary sentence where the
                    <hi rend="italic">Babdologia</hi> is mentioned ( ‘ ‘ sive omnium facillime per
                    ossa Rhabdologiae nostrae”) was no doubt added afterwards. It is worth while to
                    notice that this reference occurs in a chapter “De Multiplicationis et
                    Partitionis compendiis miscellaneis,” which, supposing the treatise to have been
                    written in Napier’s younger days, may have been his earliest production on a
                    subject over which his subsequent labours were to exert so enormous an
                    influence.</p>
                <p>Napier uses <hi rend="italic">abundantes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >defectives</hi> for positive and negative, defining them as meaning greater or
                    less than nothing (“Abundantes sunt quantitates majores nihilo: defectivae sunt
                    quantitates minores nihilo ”). The same definitions occur also in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirificus</hi> (1614), p.
                    5:—“Logarithmes sinuum, qui semper majores nihilo sunt, abundantes vocamus, et
                    hoc signo +, aut nullo praenotamus. Logarithmos autem minores nihilo defectivos
                    vocamus, praenotantes eis hoc signum - .” Napier may thus have been the first to
                    use the expression “quantity <hi rend="italic">less than nothing.”</hi> He uses
                    “radicatum” for power; for root, power, exponent, his words are radix,
                    radicatum, index.</p>
                <p>Apart from the interest attaching to these manuscripts as the work of Napier,
                    they possess an independent value as affording evidence of the exact state of
                    his algebraical knowledge at the time when logarithms were invented. There is
                    nothing to show whether the transcripts were sent to Briggs as intended and
                    returned by him, or whether they were not sent to him. Among the Merchiston
                    papers is a thin quarto volume in Robert Napier’s writing containing a digest of
                    the principles of alchemy; it is addressed to his son, and on the first leaf
                    there are directions that it is to remain in his, charter-chest and be kept
                    secret except from a few. This treatise· and the transcripts seem to be the only
                    manuscripts which have escaped destruction.</p>
                <p>The principle of “Napier’s bones” may be easily explained by imagining ten
                    rectangular slips of cardboard, each divided into nine squares. In the top
                    squares of the slips the ten digits are written, and each slip contains in its
                    nine squares the first nine multiples of the digit which appears in the top
                    square. With the exception of the top squares, every square is divided into two
                    parts by a diagonal, the units being written on one side and the tens on the
                    other, so that when a multiple consists of two figures they are separated by the
                    diagonal. Fig. 1 shows the slips corresponding to the numbers 2, 0, 8, 5 placed
                    side by side in contact with one another, and next to them is placed another
                    slip containing, in squares without diagonals, the first nine digits. The slips
                    thus placed in contact give the multiples of the number 2085, the digits in each
                    parallelogram being added together; for example, corresponding to the number 6
                    on the right hand slip, we have 0, 8 + 3, 0 + 4, 2, 1; whence we find</p>
                <p>0, 1,5, 2, 1 as the digits, written backwards, of 6 × 2085. The use of the slips
                    for the purpose of multiplication is now evident; thus to multiply 2085 by 736
                    we take out in this manner the multiples corresponding to 6, 3, 7, and set down
                    the digits as they are obtained, from right to left, shifting them back one
                    place and adding; up the columns as in ordinary multiplication, viz., the
                    figures as written down are—</p>
                <p>12510 6255 14595</p>
                <p>1534560</p>
                <p>Napier’s rods or bones consist of ten oblong pieces of wood or other material
                    with square ends. Each of the four faces of each rod contains multiples of one
                    of the nine digits, and is similar to one of the slips just described, the first
                    rod containing the multiples of 0, 1, 9, 8, the second of 0, 2, 9, 7, the third
                    of 0, 3, 9, 6, the fourth of 0, 4, 9, 5, the fifth of 1, 2, 8, 7, the sixth of
                    1, 3, 8, 6, the seventh of 1, 4, 8, 5, the eighth of 2, 3, 7, 6, the ninth of 2,
                    4, 7, 5, and the tenth of 3, 4, 6, 5. Each rod therefore contains on two of its
                    faces multiples of digits which are complementary to those on the other two
                    faces; and the multiples of a digit and of its complement are reversed in
                    position. The arrangement of the numbers on the rods will be evident from fig.
                    2, which represents the four faces of the fifth bar. The set of ten rods is thus
                    equivalent to four sets of slips as described above, and by their means we may
                    multiply every number less than 11,111, and also any number (consisting of
                    course of not more than ten digits) which can be formed by the top digits of the
                    bars when placed side by side. Of course two sets of rods may be used, and by
                    their means we may multiply every number less than 111,111,111, and soon. It
                    will be noticed that the rods only give the multiples of the number which is to
                    be multiplied, or of the divisor, when they are used for division, and it is
                    evident that they would be of little use to any one who knew the multiplication
                    table as far as 9 × 9. In multiplications or divisions of any length it is
                    generally convenient to begin by forming a table of the first nine multiples of
                    the multiplicand or divisor, and Napier’s bones at best merely provide such a
                    table, and in an incomplete form, for the additions of the two figures in the
                    same parallelogram have to be performed each time the roils are used. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Babdologia</hi> attracted, more general attention than the
                    logarithms, and there were several editions on the Continent. An Italian
                    translation was published by Locatello at Verona in 1623, and a Dutch
                    translation by De Decker at Gouda in 1626. Ursinus published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Bhabdologia Ncperiana</hi> at Berlin in 1623, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Babdologia</hi> itself was reprinted at Lyons in 1626. Nothing
                    shows more clearly the rude state of arithmetical knowledge at the beginning of
                    the 17th century than the universal satisfaction with which Napier’s invention
                    was welcomed by all classes and regarded as a real aid to calculation.</p>

                <p>Napier also describes in the <hi rend="italic">Rabdologia</hi> two other larger
                    rods to facilitate the extraction of square and cube roots. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rabdologia</hi> the rods are called “virgulae,” but in the passage
                    quoted above from the manuscript on arithmetic they are referred to as “bones”
                    (ossa).</p>
                <p>Besides the logarithms and the calculating rods or bones, Napier’s name is
                    attached to certain rules and formulae in spherical trigonometry. “Napier’s
                    rules of circular parts,” which include the complete system of formulae for the
                    solution of right-angled triangles, may be enunciated as follows. Leaving the
                    right angle out of consideration, the sides including the right angle, the
                    complement of the hypotenuse, and the complements of the other angles are called
                    the circular parts of the triangle. Thus there are five circular parts, <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b,</hi> 90°—A, 90°— <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> 90°—B, and these
                    are supposed to be arranged in this order <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the
                    order in which they occur in the triangle) round a circle. Selecting any part
                    and calling it the middle part, the two parts next it are called the adjacent
                    parts, and the remaining two parts the opposite parts. The rules then are— sine
                    of the middle part=product of tangents of adjacent parts = product of cosines of
                    opposite parts.</p>
                <p>These rules were published in the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mirificus</hi> (1614), and Napier has there given a figure, and indicated a
                    method, by means of which they may be proved directly. The rules are curious and
                    interesting, but of very doubtful utility, as the formulae are best remembered
                    by the practical calculator in their unconnected form.</p>

                <p>They were first published after his death in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Constructio</hi> among the formulae in spherical trigonometry, which were the
                    results of his latest work. Robert Napier says that these results would have
                    been reduced to order and demonstrated consecutively but for his father’s death.
                    Only one of the four analogies is actually given by Napier, the other three
                    being added by Briggs in the remarks which are appended to Napier’s results. The
                    work left by Napier is, however, rough and unfinished, and it is uncertain
                    whether he knew of the other formulae or not. They are, however, so simply
                    deducible from the results he has given that all the four analogies may be
                    properly called by his name. An analysis of the formulae contained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Descriptio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Constructio</hi> is given by
                    Delambre in vol. i. of his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Astronomie moderne.</hi></p>
                <p>To Napier seems to be due the first use of the decimal point in arithmetic.
                    Decimal fractions were first introduced by Stevinus in his tract <hi
                    rend="italic">La Disme,</hi> published in 1585, but he used cumbrous exponents
                    (numbers enclosed in circles) to distinguish the different denominations,
                    primes, seconds, thirds, &amp;c. Thus, for example, he would have written
                    123'456 as i23(θ)4(T)5(2)6ζ3). In the <hi rend="italic">Babdologia</hi> Napier
                    gives an “Admonitio pro Decimali Arithmetica,” in which he commends the
                    fractions of Stevinus and gives an example of their use, the division of 861094
                    by 432. The quotient is written 1993,273 in the work, and 1993,2'7"3"' in the
                    text. This single instance of the use of the decimal point in the midst of an
                    arithmetical process, if it stood alone, would not suffice to establish a claim
                    for its introduction, as the real introducer of the decimal point is the person
                    who first saw that a point or line as separator was all that was required to
                    distinguish between the integers and fractions, and used it as a permanent
                    notation and not merely in the course of performing an arithmetical operation.
                    The decimal point is, however, used systematically in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Constructio</hi> (1619), there being perhaps two hundred decimal points
                    altogether in the book.</p>
                <p>The decimal point is defined on p. 6 of the <hi rend="italic">Constructio</hi> in
                    the words :—“In numeris periodo sic in se distinctis, quicquid post periodum
                    notatur fractio est, cujus denominator est unitas cum tot cyphris post se, quot
                    sunt figurae post periodum. Ut 10000000 Ό4 valet idem, quod 10000000 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ∙. Item 25'803, idem
                    quod 25 <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> V⅛⅛∙ Item
                    9999998'0005021, idem valet quod 9999998 <hi rend="subscript"> τπ</hi> ⅜⅞‰ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> y</hi>, &amp; sic de caeteris.” On p. 8, 10'502 is multiplied
                    by 3'216, and the result found to be 33'774432; and on pp. 23 and 24 occur
                    decimals not attached to integers, viz., '4999712 and Ό004950. These examples
                    show that Napier was in possession of all the conventions and attributes that
                    enable the decimal point to complete so symmetrically our system of notation,
                    viz., (1) he saw that a point or separatrix was quite enough to separate
                    integers from decimals, and that no signs to indicate primes, seconds, &amp;c.,
                    were required; (2) he used ciphers after the decimal point and preceding the
                    first significant figure; and (3) he had no objection to a decimal standing by
                    itself without any integer. Napier thus had complete command over decimal
                    fractions, and understood perfectly the nature of the decimal point.</p>
                <p>Briggs also used decimals, but in a form not quite so convenient as Napier. Thus
                    he prints 63'0957379 as 630957379, viz., he prints a bar under the decimals;
                    this notation first appears without any explanation in his “Lucubrationes”
                    appended to the <hi rend="italic">Constructio.</hi> Briggs used the notation all
                    his life, but in writing it, as appears from manuscripts of his, he added also a
                    small vertical line just high enough to fix distinctly which two figures it was
                    intended to separate: thus he might have written 6310957379. The vertical line
                    was printed by Oughtred and some of Briggs’s successors. It was a long time
                    before decimal arithmetic came into general use, and all through the 17th
                    century exponential marks were in common use. There seems but little doubt that
                    Napier was the first to make use of a decimal separator, and it is curious that
                    the separator which he used, the point, should be that which has been ultimately
                    adopted, and after a long period of partial disuse.</p>
                <p>The hereditary office of king’s poulterer (Pultrie Regis) was for many
                    generations in the family of Merchiston, and descended to John Napier. The
                    office, Mr Mark Napier states, is repeatedly mentioned in the family charters as
                    appertaining to the ‘ <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> pultre landis” near the
                    village of Dene in the shire of Linlithgow. The duties were to be performed by
                    the possessor or his deputy; and the king was entitled to demand the yearly
                    homage of a present of poultry from the feudal holder. The pultrelands and the
                    office were sold by John Napier in 1610 for 1700 marks. It has been erroneously
                    asserted that Napier dissipated his means; there is no truth in this statement.
                    With the sole exception of the pultrelands all the estates he inherited
                    descended undiminished to his posterity.</p>
                <p>With regard to the spelling of the name, Mr Mark Napier states that among the
                    family papers there exist a great many documents signed by John Napier. His
                    usual signature was “Jhone Neper,” but in a letter written in 1608, and in all
                    deeds signed after that date, he wrote “Jhone Nepair.” His letter to the king
                    prefixed to tjιθ <hi rend="italic">Plaine Discovery</hi> is signed “John
                    Napeir.” His own children, who sign deeds along with him, use every mode except
                    Napier, the form now adopted by the family, and which is comparatively modern.
                    In Latin he always wrote his name “Neperus.” The form “Neper” is the oldest, as
                    John, third Napier of Merchiston, so spelt it in the 15th century.</p>
                <p>Napier frequently signed his name “Jhone Neper, Fear of Merchiston.” He was “Fear
                    of Merchiston” because, <hi rend="italic">more</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >majorum,</hi> he had been invested with the fee of his paternal barony during
                    the lifetime of his father, who retained the liferent. He has been sometimes
                    erroneously called “Peer of Merchiston,” and in the 1645 edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Plaine Discovery</hi> he is so styled, probably by a misprint (see
                    Mr Mark Napier’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> pp. 9 and 173, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Libri qui supersunt,</hi> p. xciv).</p>
                <p>Napier’s home at Merchiston is thus described by Sir Walter Scott in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Provincial Antiquities of Scotland·.—</hi> “This fortalice is
                    situated upon the ascent, and nearly upon the summit of the eminence called the
                    Borough-moor-head, within a mile and a half of the city walls. In form it is a
                    square tower of the 14th or 15th century, with a projection on one side. The top
                    is battlemented, and within the battlements, by a fashion more common in
                    Scotland than in England, arises a small building with a steep roof, like a
                    stone cottage erected on the top of the tower. . . The celebrated John Napier of
                    Merchiston was born in this weather-beaten tower; and a small room in the summit
                    is pointed out as the study in which he secluded himself while engaged in the
                    mathematical researches which led to his great discovery. The battlements of
                    Merchiston tower command an extensive view of great interest and beauty.” There
                    is a view of Merchiston tower in Mr Mark Napier’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    John Napier,</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>One well-known character of the time, Dr Richard Napier, was cousin to John
                    Napier. The eldest son of Alexander, sixth Napier of Merchiston, was Archibald,
                    the father of John Napier; his second son, named Alexander, settled at Exeter,
                    and married an English lady by whom he had two sons, the eldest of whom, Robert,
                    was the merchant, mentioned in the note near the beginning of this article as
                    having been created a baronet. The second son was a fellow of Exeter College,
                    Oxford, and became rector of Lynford, Buckinghamshire. He was a friend and pupil
                    of Dr Simon Forman, a well-known Rosicrucian adept of the time, and at his death
                    became the possessor of his secret manuscripts. Dr Richard Napier, who was more
                    of a physician than a divine, was a great pretender to astrology, necromancy,
                    and magical cures. There is a portrait of him in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford
                    (engraved in Mr Mark Napier’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs'),</hi> which is
                    interesting on account of the similarity of some of the features to those of
                    John Napier. It does not appear that there was ever any friendship or
                    correspondence between John Napier and Richard Napier.</p>
                <p>In 1787 <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Life, Writings, and Inventions of
                    John Napier of Merchiston</hi> was published at Perth by David Stewart, earl of
                    Buchan, and Walter Minto, LL.D. It is a quarto work of one hundred and
                    thirty-four pages, only twelve of which relate to the life of Napier, the rest
                    being devoted to a careful explanation of the contents of his works. The
                    particulars given of Napier’s life are very scanty, but, such as they are, they
                    form the source frem which nearly all the notices of Napier which have appeared
                    since have been drawn. The work <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n197/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0197-0186"/> has also given rise to the impression that there
                    was but little chance of further information being obtained with respect to
                    Napier's life. In 1834 Mr Mark Napier published his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    John Napier of Merchiston, his Life, Lineage, and Times, with a History of the
                    Invention of Logarithms,</hi> a large quarto volume of five hundred and
                    thirty-four pages. Mr Mark Napier, who had already devoted great attention to
                    the history of Scotland with special reference to the families of Lennox and
                    Napier, had full access to all the charters and papers in the possession of the
                    family, and he spared no pains in examining every document and investigating
                    every point which seemed likely to throw light upon the life of Napier and the
                    circumstances amidst which his life was passed. The work contains a vast mass of
                    general information relating to Napier and his relatives, and the people with
                    whom he was brought into contact, besides much collateral matter which serves to
                    illustrate the state of the country at the time. The facts relating to Napier’s
                    own life are so interwoven with the other contents of the volume, and the work
                    is so large, that in the absence of an index it is very difficult to extract the
                    comparatively small portion that relates to Napier himself. From this work,
                    which is the sole authority upon the private events of Napier’s life, all the
                    facts given in this article with respect to his descent and personal history
                    have been derived. In 1839 Mr Mark Napier completed his labours by editing
                    Napier’s unpublished manuscripts, of which he had only been able to give a
                    résumé in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> and to this he prefixed an
                    introduction, the greater part of which, however, is included in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs.</hi> Three different portraits of Napier are known tobe
                    in existence; one was engraved as the frontispiece to the earl of Buchan’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Account,</hi> and another forms the frontispiece to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs.</hi> There is also an engraving of Napier in Lilly’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life and Times</hi> (1822). Foran account of the contents of
                    Napier’s mathematical works and their place in the history of science, the
                    reader is referred to Delambre’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Astronomie moderne.</hi></p>
                <p>It maybe useful to give, in conclusion, a list of Napier’s works with a brief
                    statement of the contents of each. The works published in his lifetime are—(1)
                    <hi rend="italic">The Plaine Discovery</hi> (1593), containing an interpretation
                    of the Book of Revelation; (2) the <hi rend="italic">Canonis Mirifici</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Logarithmorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Descriptio,</hi> containing
                    the first announcement of the invention of logarithmsand a table of log sines,
                    also the rules of circular parts; (3) the <hi rend="italic">Rabdologia</hi>
                    (1617), containing the description of Napier's bones, the promptuary, and the
                    method of local arithmetic,—all three designed for the simplification of
                    multiplications and divisions. The posthumous works are—(1) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Canonis Mirifici</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmorum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Constructio</hi> (1619), edited by his son Robert, containing an
                    account of the mode of construction of the canon, and Napier’s analogies; this
                    book is the first in which the decimal point was systematically employed; (2)
                    the treatise <hi rend="italic">De Arte</hi><hi rend="italic">Logistica,</hi>
                    edited by Mr Mark Napier in 1839, containing treatises on arithmetic and
                    algebra, transcribed from Napier’s notes by his son Robert. (J. W. L. G.)</p>
