                <p><label type="entry">NORMANS</label> is the softened form of the word “Northman,”
                    applied first to the people of Scandinavia in general, and afterwards specially
                    to the people of Norway. In the form of “Norman” <hi rend="italic">(Northmannus,
                    Normannus, Normand)</hi> it is the name of those colonists from Scandinavia who
                    settled themselves in Gaul, who founded the Norman duchy, who adopted the French
                    tongue and French manners, and who from their new home set forth on new errands
                    of conquest, chiefly in the British Islands and in southern Italy and Sicily.
                    From one point of view the expeditions of the Normans may be looked on as
                    continuations of the expeditions of the Northmen. As the name is etymologically
                    the same, so the people are by descent the same, and they are still led by the
                    old spirit of war and adventure. But in the view of general history Normans and
                    Northmen must be carefully distinguished. The change in the name is the sign of
                    a thorough change, if not in the people themselves, yet in their historical
                    position. Their national character remains largely the same; but they have
                    adopted a new religion, a new language, a new system of law and society, new
                    thoughts and feelings on all matters. Like as the Norman still is to the
                    Northman, the effects of a settlement of Normans are utterly different from the
                    effects of a settlement of Northmen. There can be no doubt that the
                    establishment of the Norman power in England was, like the establishment of the
                    Danish power, greatly helped by the essential kindred of Normans, Danes, and
                    English. But it was helped only silently. To all outward appearance the Norman
                    conquest of England was an event of an altogether different character from the
                    Danish conquest. The one was a conquest by a people whose tongue and
                    institutions were still palpably akin to those of the English. The other was a
                    conquest by a people whose tongue and institutions were palpably different from
                    those of the English. The Norman settlers in England felt no community with the
                    earlier Danish settlers in England. In fact the Normans met with the steadiest
                    resistance in a part of England which was largely Danish. But the effect of
                    real, though unacknowledged, kindred had none the less an important practical
                    effect. There can be no doubt that this hidden working of kindred between
                    conquerors and conquered in England, as compared with the utter lack of all
                    fellowship between conquerors and conquered in Sicily, was one cause out of
                    several which made so wide a difference between the Norman conquest of England
                    and the Norman conquest of Sicily.</p>
                <p>These two conquests, wrought in the great island of the Ocean and in the great
                    island of the Mediterranean, were the main works of the Normans after they had
                    fully put on the character of a Christian and French-speaking people, in other
                    words, after they had changed from Northmen into Normans. The English and the
                    Sicilian settlements form the main Norman history of the 11th century. The 10th
                    century is the time of the settlement of the Northmen in Gaul, and of the change
                    in religion and language of which the softening of the name is the outward sign.
                    By the end of it, any traces of heathen faith, and even of Scandinavian speech,
                    must have been mere survivals. The new creed, the new speech, the new social
                    system, had taken such de3p root that the descendants of the Scandinavian
                    settlers were better fitted to be the armed missionaries of all these things
                    than the neighbours from whom they had borrowed their new possessions. With the
                    zeal of new converts they set forth on their new errand very much in the spirit
                    of their heathen forefathers. If Britain and Sicily were the greatest fields of
                    their enterprise, they were very far from being the only fields. The same spirit
                    of enterprise which brought the Northmen into Gaul seems to carry the Normans
                    out of Gaul into every corner of the world. Their character is well painted by a
                    contemporary historian of their exploits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    sets the Normans before us as a race specially marked by cunning, despising
                    their own inheritance in the hope of winning a greater, eager after both gain
                    and dominion, given to imitation of all kinds, holding a certain mean between
                    lavishness and greediness—that is, perhaps uniting, as they certainly did, these
                    two seemingly opposite qualities. Their chief men, he adds, were specially
                    lavish through their desire of good report. They were moreover a race skilful in
                    flattery, given to the study of eloquence, so that the very boys were orators, a
                    race altogether unbridled unless held firmly down by the yoke of justice. They
                    were enduring of toil, hunger, and cold whenever fortune laid it on them, given
                    to hunting and hawking, delighting in the pleasure of horses, and of all the
                    weapons and garb of war. Several of these features stand out very clearly in
                    Norman history. The cunning of the Normans is plain enough; so is their
                    impatience of restraint, unless held down by a strong master. Love of imitation
                    is also marked. Little of original invention can be traced to any strictly
                    Norman source; but no people were ever more eager to adopt from other nations,
                    to take into their service and friendship from any quarter men of learning and
                    skill and eminence of every kind. To this quality is perhaps to be attributed
                    the fact that a people who did so much, who settled and conquered in so large a
                    part of Europe, has practically vanished from the face of the earth. If Normans,
                    as Normans, now exist anywhere, it is certainly only in that insular fragment of
                    the ancient duchy which still cleaves to the successor of its ancient dukes.
                    Elsewhere, as the settlers in Gaul became French, the emigrants from Gaul became
                    English, Irish, Scottish, and whatever we are to call the present inhabitants of
                    Sicily and southern Italy. Everywhere they gradually lost themselves among the
                    people whom they conquered; they adopted the language and the national feelings
                    of the lands in which they settled; but at the same time they often modified,
                    often strengthened, the national usages and national life of the various nations
                    in which they were finally merged.</p>
                <p>But Geoffrey hardly did justice to the Normans if he meant to imply that they
                    were simple imitators of others. Their position was very like that of the
                    Saracens. Hasty writers who forget the existence of the eastern Rome are apt to
                    claim for the Saracens of Baghdad, or more commonly for those of Cordova, a
                    monopoly of science and art at some time not very clearly defined by dates. In
                    so doing they slur over the real position and the real merit of the Saracens
                    with regard to science and art. In neither department did any Saracen, strictly
                    speaking, invent anything; but they learned much both from Constantinople <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n593/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0593-0548"/> and from Persia, and what they learned they
                    largely developed and improved. The Normans did just the same. They adopted the
                    French tongue, and were presently among the first to practise and spread abroad
                    its literature. ’ They adopted the growing feudal doctrines of France, and
                    worked them, both in Normandy and in England, into a harmonious system. From
                    northern Italy, as it would seem, they adopted a style of architecture which
                    grew in their hands, both in Normandy and in England, into a marked and living
                    form of art. Settled in Gaul, the Scandinavian from a seafaring man became a
                    landsman. Even in land-warfare he cast aside the weapons of his forefathers; but
                    he soon learned to handle the weapons of his new land with greater prowess than
                    they had ever been handled before. He welcomed the lore of every stranger.
                    Lanfranc brought law and discipline; Anselm brought theology and philosophy. The
                    gifts of each were adopted and bore fruit on both sides of the Channel. And no
                    people ever better knew how to be all things to all men. The Norman power in
                    England was founded on full and speedy union with the one nation among whom they
                    found themselves. The Norman power in Sicily was founded on a strong distinction
                    between the ruling people and the many nations which they kept in peace and
                    prosperity by not throwing in their lot with any one among them.</p>
                <p>The quality which Geoffrey Malaterra expresses by the word “effrenatissima” is
                    also clearly marked in Norman history. It is, in fact, the groundwork of the
                    historic Norman character. It takes in one case the form of ceaseless
                    enterprise, in another the form of that lawlessness which ever broke out, both
                    in Normandy and in every other country settled by Normans, when the hand of a
                    strong ruler was wanting. But it was balanced by another quality which Geoffrey
                    does not speak of, one which is not really inconsistent with the other, one
                    which is very prominent in the Norman character, and which is, no less than the
                    other, a direct heritage from their Scandinavian forefathers. This is the
                    excessive litigiousness, the fondness for law, legal forms, legal processes,
                    which has ever been characteristic of the people. If the Norman was a born
                    soldier, he was also a born lawyer. Randolf Flambard, working together the
                    detached feudal usages of earlier times into a compact and logical system of
                    feudal law, was as characteristic a type of the people as any warrior in the
                    Conqueror’s following. He was the organizer of an endless official army, of an
                    elaborate technical system of administration, which had nothing like it in
                    England before, but which grew up to perfection under Norman rulers. But nothing
                    so well illustrates this formal side of the Norman character as the whole
                    position of the Conqueror himself. His claim to the crown of England is
                    something without earlier precedent, something as far as possible removed from
                    the open violence of aggressors who have no pretexts with which to disguise
                    their aggression. It rested on a mass of legal assumptions and subtleties,
                    fallacious indeed, but ingenious, and, as the result proved, effective. His
                    whole system of government, his confiscations, his grants, all that he did, was
                    a logical deduction from one or two legal principles, arbitrary certainly in
                    their conception, but strictly carried out to their results. Even Norman
                    lawlessness in some sort took a legal shape. In the worst days of anarchy, in
                    the minority of William or under the no-reign of Robert, the robber-baron could
                    commonly give elaborate reasons for every act of wrong that he did.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps less wonderful that this characteristic should have been left out
                    in a picture of the Normans in Apulia and Sicily than if it had been left out in
                    a picture of the Normans in Normandy and England. The circumstances of their
                    Apulian and Sicilian conquests certainly did not tend to bring out this feature
                    of their character so strongly as it was brought out by the circumstances of
                    their English conquest. Possibly the same cause may have kept the chronicler
                    from enlarging on their religious character <hi rend="italic">; yet</hi> in
                    Sicily at least they might pass for crusaders. Crusaders in fact they were
                    before crusades were preached. Norman warriors had long before helped the
                    Christians of Spain in their warfare with the Saracens of the Peninsula, and in
                    Sicily it was from the same enemy that they won the great Mediterranean island.
                    Others had done a kindred work in a more distant field as helpers of the Eastern
                    emperors against the Turks of Asia. All these might pass for religious wars, and
                    they might really be so; it needed greater ingenuity to set forth the invasion
                    of England as a missionary enterprise designed for the spiritual good of the
                    benighted islanders. The Norman, a strict observer of forms in all matters,
                    attended to the forms of religion with special care. No people were more
                    bountiful to ecclesiastical bodies on both sides of the Channel; the foundation
                    of a Benedictine monastery in the 11th century, of a Cistercian monastery in the
                    12th, seemed almost a matter of course on the part of a Norman baron. The
                    Conqueror beyond doubt sincerely aimed at being a religious reformer both in his
                    duchy and in his kingdom, while it is needless to say that his immediate
                    successor was exceptionally ungodly, whether among Normans or among other men.
                    But among their countrymen generally strict attendance to religious observances,
                    a wide bounty to religious foundations, may be set down as national
                    characteristics. On the other hand, none were less inclined to submit to
                    encroachments on the part of the ecclesiastical power, the Conqueror himself
                    least of all.</p>
                <p>We thus see in the Scandinavian settlers in Gaul, after they had put on the
                    outward garb of their adopted country, a people restless and enterprising above
                    all others, adopting and spreading abroad all that they could make their own in
                    their new land and everywhere else,—a people in many ways highly gifted, greatly
                    affecting and modifying at the time every land in which they settled, but,
                    wherever they settled, gradually losing themselves among the people of the land.
                    The Norman, as a visible element in the country, has vanished from England, and
                    he has vanished from Sicily. The circumstances of his settlement in his two
                    great fields of conquest were widely different; his position when he was fully
                    established in his two insular realms was widely different; but the end has been
                    the same in both cases. Neither island has for ages been in any sense a Norman
                    land, and the tongue which the Norman brought with him into both has not for
                    ages been spoken in either. Norman influence has been far stronger in England
                    than in Sicily, and signs of Norman presence are far more easily recognized. But
                    the Norman, as a distinct people, is as little to be seen in the one island as
                    in the other. His disappearance in both cases is an illustration of one of the
                    features which we have spoken of in the Norman character, the tendency which in
                    fact made Normans out of Northmen, the tendency to adopt the language and
                    manners of the people among whom they found themselves. But, as far as outward
                    circumstances are concerned, we may say that the same effect has been brought
                    about by different and almost opposite causes. The whole circumstances of the
                    conquest of England constrained the conquerors to become Englishmen in order to
                    establish themselves in the conquered land. In William’s theory, the forcible
                    conquest of England by strangers was an untoward accident. The lawful heir of
                    the English crown was driven against his will to win his rights by force from
                    outside. But he none the less held his crown as an English king succeeding
                    according to English law. Moreover every Norman to whom he granted lands and
                    offices held them by English law in a much truer sense <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n594/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0594-0549"/> than the king held his; he was deemed to step
                    into the exact position of his English predecessor, whatever that might be. This
                    legal theory worked together with other causes to wipe out all practical
                    distinction between the conquerors and the conquered in a wonderfully short
                    time. By the end of the 12th century the Normans in England might fairly pass as
                    Englishmen, and they had largely adopted the use .of the English language. The
                    fashionable use of French for nearly two centuries longer was far more a French
                    fashion than a Norman tradition. When the tradition of speaking French had all
                    but died out, the practice was revived by fashion. Still the tradition had its
                    effect. The fashion could hardly have taken root except in a land where the
                    tradition had gone before it.</p>
                <p>The Normans in England therefore became Englishmen, because there was an English
                    nation into which they could be absorbed. The Normans in Sicily could hardly be
                    said to become Sicilians, for there assuredly was no Sicilian nation for them to
                    be absorbed into. While the Normans in England were lost among the people of the
                    land, the Normans in Sicily were lost among their fellow-settlers in the land.
                    The Normans who came into Sicily must have been much less purely Norman than the
                    Normans who came into England. The army of Duke William was undoubtedly very far
                    from being wholly made up of Normans, but it was a Norman army; the element
                    which was not Norman, though considerable, was exceptional. But we may doubt
                    whether the Norman invaders of Sicily were Norman in much more than being
                    commanded by Norman leaders. They were almost as little entitled to be called
                    pure Scandinavians as the Saracens whom they found in the island were entitled
                    to be called pure Arabs. The conquest of England was made directly from
                    Normandy, by the reigning duke, in a comparatively short time, while the
                    conquest of Sicily grew out of the earlier and far more gradual conquest of
                    Apulia and Calabria by private men. The Norman settlements at Aversa and Capua
                    were the work of adventurers, making their own fortunes, and gathering round
                    them followers from all quarters. They fought simply for their own hands, and
                    took what they could by the right of the stronger. They started with no such
                    claim as Duke William put forth to justify his invasion of England; their only
                    show of legal right was the papal grant of conquests that were already made. The
                    conquest of Apulia, won bit by bit in many years of what we can only call
                    freebooting, was not a national Norman enterprise like the conquest of England,
                    and the settlement to which it led could not be a national Norman settlement in
                    the same sense. The Sicilian enterprise had in some respects another character.
                    By the time it began the freebooters had grown into princes. Sicily was won by a
                    duke of Apulia and a count of Sicily. Still there was a wide difference between
                    the duke of the Normans and the duke of Apulia, between an hereditary prince of
                    a hundred and fifty years’ standing and an adventurer who had carved out his
                    duchy for himself. And, besides this, warfare in Sicily brought in higher
                    motives and objects. Though crusades had not yet been preached, the strife with
                    the Mussulman at once brought in the crusading element; to the Christian people
                    of the island they were in many cases real deliverers; still, the actual process
                    by which Sicily was won was not so very different from that by which Apulia had
                    been won. Duke William was undisputed master of England at the end of five
                    years; it took Count Roger thirty years to make himself undisputed master of
                    Sicily. The one claimed an existing kingdom, and obtained full possession of it
                    in a comparatively short time; the other formed for himself a dominion bit by
                    bit, which rose to the rank of a kingdom in the next generation. When Count
                    Roger at last found himself lord of the whole island, he found himself lord of
                    men of various creeds and tongues, of whom his own Norman followers were but one
                    class out of several. And the circumstances of his conquest were such that the
                    true Normans among his following could not possibly lose themselves among the
                    existing inhabitants of the island, while everything tended to make them lose
                    themselves among their fellow-adventurers of other races, among whom, by the
                    time the conquest was ended, they could hardly have been even a dominant
                    element.</p>
                <p>As far then as concerned the lands in which the settlements were made, the
                    difference lay in this, that, as has been already said, while there was an
                    English nation, there was no Sicilian nation. The characteristic point of Norman
                    rule in Sicily is that it is the rule of princes who were foreign to all the
                    inhabitants of the island, but who were not more foreign to the inhabitants of
                    the island than different classes of them were to one another. The Norman
                    conqueror found in Sicily a Christian and Greek-speaking people and a Mussulman
                    and Arabic-speaking people. The relations between the two differed widely in
                    different parts of the island, according to the way in which the Saracens had
                    become possessed of different towns and districts. In one place the Christians
                    were in utter bondage, in another they were simply tributary; still, everywhere
                    the Mussulman Saracen formed the ruling class, the Christian Greek formed the
                    subject class. We speak of the Saracen very much as we speak of the Norman; for
                    of the Mussulman masters of Sicily very many must have been only artificial
                    Arabs, Africans who had adopted the creed, language, and manners of Arabia. In
                    each case the Arab or the Norman was the kernel, the centre round which all
                    other elements gathered and which gave its character to the whole. Besides these
                    two main races, Greek and Saracen, others came in through the Norman invasion
                    itself. There were the conquerors themselves; there were the Italians, in Sicily
                    known as Lombards, who followed in their wake; there were also the Jews, whom
                    they may have found in the island, or who may have followed the Norman into
                    Sicily, as they certainly followed him into England. The special character of
                    Norman ride in Sicily was that all these various races flourished, each in its
                    own fashion, each keeping its own creed, tongue, and manners, under the
                    protection of a common sovereign, who belonged to none of them, but who did
                    impartial justice to all. Such a state of things might seem degradation to the
                    Mussulman, but it was deliverance to the native Christian, while to settlers of
                    every kind from outside it was an opening such as they could hardly find
                    elsewhere. But the growth of a united Sicilian nation was impossible; the usual
                    style to express the inhabitants of the island is “omnes” or “universi Siciliae
                    populi.” In the end something like a Sicilian nation did arise; but it arose
                    rather by the dying out of several of the elements in the country, the Norman
                    element among them, than by any such fusion as took place in England. That is,
                    as has been already said, the Norman as such has vanished in two different ways.
                    In England the Norman duke came in as a foreign intruder, without a native
                    supporter to establish his rule over a single nation in its own land. He could
                    not profess to be, as the count of Sicily could honestly profess to be, a
                    deliverer to a large part of the people of the land. But, coming in by a title
                    which professed to be founded on English law, establishing his followers by
                    grants which professed no less to be founded on English law, he planted a
                    dynasty, and established a dominant order, which could not fail to become
                    English. The Normans in England did not die out; they were merged in the
                    existing nation. The Normans in Sicily, so far as they did not die out, were
                    merged, not in a Sicilian nation, for that did not exist, but in the common mass
                    of settlers of Latin speech and rite, as distinguished<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0595-0550"/> from the older inhabitants, Greek and Saracen.
                    The Norman conquest of England was at the moment a curse; the Norman conquest of
                    Sicily was at the moment a blessing. But the gradual and indirect results of the
                    Norman conquest of England are easily to be seen to this day, and they have been
                    largely, though indirectly, results for good. Its chief result has been, not so
                    much to create anything new as at once to modify and to strengthen what was old,
                    to call up older institutions to a new life under other forms. But whatever it
                    has done it has done silently; there has not been at any time any violent change
                    of one set of institutions for another. In Sicily and southern Italy there is
                    hardly any visible Norman influence, except the great historic fact which we may
                    call the creation of Sicily and southern Italy in their modern sense. The coming
                    of the Norman ruled that these lands should be neither Saracen nor Greek, nor
                    yet Italian in the same sense as northern Italy, but that they should
                    politically belong to the same group of states as the kingdoms and
                    principalities of feudal Europe. William assuredly did not create the kingdom of
                    England <hi rend="italic">; Roger</hi> assuredly did create the kingdom of
                    Sicily. And yet, notwithstanding all this, and partly because of all this, real
                    and distinct Norman influence has been far more extensive and far more abiding
                    in England than it has been in Sicily.</p>
                <p>In Sicily then the circumstances of the conquest led the Norman settlers to
                    remain far more distinct from the older races of the land than they did in
                    England, and in the end to lose themselves, not in those older races of the
                    land, but in the settlers of other races who accompanied and followed them. So
                    far as there ever was a Sicilian nation at all, it might be said to be called
                    into being by the emperor-king Frederick II. In his day a Latin element finally
                    triumphed; but it was not a Norman or French-speaking element of any kind. The
                    speech of the Lombards at last got the better of Greek, Arabic, and French; how
                    far its ascendency can have been built on any survival of an earlier Latin
                    speech which had lived on alongside of Greek and Arabic this is not the place to
                    inquire.</p>
                <p>The use of language and nomenclature during the time of Norman rule in the two
                    countries forms a remarkable contrast, and illustrates the circumstances of the
                    two as they have just been sketched. The chroniclers of the conquest of Apulia
                    and Sicily use the Norman name in every page as the name of the followers of the
                    conquerors from Hauteville. It was the natural name for a body of men who must,
                    by the time the conquest of Sicily was over, have been very mixed, but whose
                    kernel was Norman, whose strength and feelings and traditions all came from a
                    Norman source. But if we turn to Hugo Falcandus, the historian of Sicily in the
                    12th century, the Norman name is hardly found, unless when it is used
                    historically to point out (as in Muratori, vii. 260) that the royal house of
                    Sicily was of Norman descent. Of the various “Siciliae populi,” we hear of
                    Greeks, Saracens, Lombards, sometimes of Franci, for by that time there were
                    many French-speaking settlers in Sicily who were not of Norman descent. There is
                    a distinction between Christians and Saracens; among Christians there seems to
                    be again a distinction between Greeks and Latins, though perhaps without any
                    distinct use of the Latin name; there is again a further distinction between
                    “Lombardi” and “Franci”; but Normans, as a separate class, do not appear. In
                    England there is no room for such subtleties. The narratives of the conquest of
                    England use both the Norman and the French names to express the followers of
                    William. In the English chronicles “French” is the only name used. It appears
                    also in the Bayeux Tapestry, and it is the only word used when any legal
                    distinction had to be drawn between classes of men in the English kingdom.
                    “Franci” and “Angli” are often opposed in Domesday and other documents, and the
                    formula went on in charters long after all real distinction had passed away.
                    That is to say, there were several purposes for which it was convenient to
                    distinguish “English” and “French’’—the last name taking in all the followers of
                    the Conqueror; there were no purposes for which there was any need to
                    distinguish Normans as such, either from the general mass of the people or from
                    others who spoke the French tongue. We can see also that, though several
                    languages were in use in England during the time of Norman rule, yet England was
                    not a land of many languages in the same sense in which Sicily was. In the 12th
                    century three languages were certainly spoken in London; yet London could not
                    call itself the “city of threefold speech,” as Palermo did. English, French,
                    Latin, were all in use in England; but the distinction was rather that they were
                    used for three different purposes than that they were used by three distinct
                    races or even classes. No doubt there was a class that knew only English; there
                    may have been a much smaller class that knew only French <hi rend="italic">;
                    any</hi> man who pretended to high cultivation would speak all as a matter of
                    course; Bishop Gilbert Foliot, for instance, was eloquent in all three. But in
                    Sicily we see the quite different phenomenon of three, four, five classes of men
                    living side by side, each keeping its own nationality and speaking its own
                    tongue. If a man of one people knew the speech of any of the others, he knew it
                    strictly as a foreign language. Before the Norman Conquest England had two
                    official tongues; documents were drawn up sometimes in English, sometimes in
                    Latin, now and then in both. And the same usage went on after the Conquest; the
                    use of English becomes gradually rarer, and dies out under the first Angevins,
                    but it is in favour of Latin that it dies out. French, the language which the
                    Normans brought with them, did not become an official language in England till
                    after strictly Norman rule had passed away. French documents are unknown till
                    the days of French fashion had come in, that is, till deep in the 13th century.
                    So it was in Sicily also; of all the tongues of Sicily French was the most
                    needful in the king’s court (“Francorum lingua quae maxime necessaria esset in
                    curia,” says Hugo Falcandus, 321); but it was not an official tongue. The three
                    tongues of Palermo are Greek, Arabic, and Latin. King Roger’s clock is
                    commemorated in all three. Documents were drawn up in such and so many of these
                    tongues as was convenient for the parties concerned; not a few private documents
                    add a fourth tongue, and are drawn up in Greek, Arabic, Latin, and Hebrew. In
                    neither case is the actual speech of the conquerors one of the tongues in formal
                    use. French, as a separate tongue from Latin, already existed as a literary
                    speech, and no people had done more than the Normans to spread it as a literary
                    speech, in both prose and verse. But neither in England nor in Sicily did
                    official formalism acknowledge even French, much less Italian, as a fit tongue
                    for solemn documents. In England, English, French, Latin, were the three tongues
                    of a single nation; they were its vulgar, its courtly, and its learned speeches,
                    of which three the courtly was fast giving way to the vulgar. In Sicily, Greek,
                    Arabic, Latin and its children, were the tongues of distinct nations; French
                    might be the politest speech, but neither Greek nor Arabic could be set down as
                    a vulgar tongue, Arabic even less than Greek.</p>
                <p>The different positions then which the conquering Norman took in his two great
                    conquests of England and of Sicily amply illustrate the way in which he could
                    adapt himself to any circumstances in which he found himself, the way in which
                    he could adopt whatever suited his purpose in the institutions of any other
                    people, the way in which he commonly lost his national being in that of some
                    other people. From England moreover he spread into Scotland, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n596/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0596-0551"/> Wales, and Ireland, and in each land his
                    settlement put on a somewhat different character, according to the circumstances
                    of the land. In Scotland he was not a conqueror, but a mere visitor, and oddly
                    enough he came as a visitor along with those whom he had himself overcome in
                    England. Both Normans and English came to Scotland in crowds in the days of
                    Margaret, Edgar, and David, and Scottish national feeling sometimes rose up
                    against them. In Scotland again the Norman settlers were lost in the mixed
                    nationality of the country, but not till they had modified many things in the
                    same way in which they modified things in England. They gave Scotland nobles and
                    even kings; Bruce and Balliol were both of the truest Norman descent; the true
                    Norman descent of Cornyn might be doubted, but he was of the stock of the
                    Francigenae of the Conquest. In Wales the Norman came as a conqueror, more
                    strictly a conqueror than in England; he could not claim Welsh crowns or Welsh
                    estates under any fiction of Welsh law. The Norman settler in Wales therefore
                    did not to any perceptible extent become a Welshman; the existing relations of
                    England and Wales were such that he in the end became an Englishman, but he
                    seems not unnaturally to have been somewhat slower in so doing in Wales than he
                    was in England. At least Giraldus Cambrensis, the Norman Welshman or Welsh
                    Norman, was certainly more alive to the distinction between Normans and English
                    than any other of his contemporaries. In Ireland the Norman was more purely a
                    conqueror than anywhere else; but in Ireland his power of adaptation caused him
                    to sink in a way in which he sank nowhere else. While some of the Norman
                    settlers in Ireland went to swell the mass of the English of the Pale, others
                    threw in their lot with the native Irish, and became, in the well-known saying,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hibernis ipsis Hiberniores.</hi></p>
                <p>There is yet one point in which we may profitably go back to our comparison
                    between England and Sicily. Both countries are rich in works of architecture
                    raised during the time of Norman rule. And the buildings of both lands throw an
                    instructive light on the Norman national character, as we have described it. Few
                    buildings, at least few buildings raised in any reasonable style of architecture
                    which makes use of the arched construction, can be less like one another than
                    the buildings of the Norman kings in England and the buildings of the Norman
                    kings in Sicily. In Sicily the Normans found the two most outwardly civilized of
                    the nations of Europe, the two which had as yet carried the arts to the highest
                    pitch. The Greek had created the column; the Roman had developed it; the Roman
                    Greek or Greek Roman had taught the column to bear the cupola; the Saracen had
                    taught it to bear arches of his own favourite pointed shape. Out of these
                    elements the Saracens of Sicily had formed a noble and beautiful style, grand
                    and simple in its construction, rich and graceful in its characteristic detail.
                    With the Saracen and the Greek to his subjects, the Norman had really no need to
                    innovate; he had simply to bid the men of the land to go on working for him
                    instead of for any other. The palaces and churches of the Norman kings at
                    Palermo and Monreale and Cefalu and Messina are in style simply Saracenic; they
                    were most likely the work of Saracen builders; they were beyond doubt built
                    after Saracenic models. In these buildings, as in those of Aquitaine, the
                    pointed arch is the surest sign of Saracenic influence; it must never be looked
                    on as marking the approach of the Gothic of the North. With that form of art the
                    pointed style of Sicily has nothing in common. A Sicilian church has nothing in
                    common with a French or an English church; it is sometimes purely Oriental,
                    sometimes a basilica with pointed arches. But, if the Saracen gave the lines of
                    the building, the Greek gave the mosaic decorations of its walls. In such a case
                    the ruling people, rather the ruling dynasty, had really nothing to add to what
                    they found ready for them. They had simply to make Saracen and Greek work in
                    partnership. In England, on the other hand, the Normans did really bring in a
                    new style of their own, their own form of Romanesque, differing widely indeed
                    from the Saracenic style of Sicily. This Norman form of Romanesque most likely
                    had its origin in the Lombard buildings of northern Italy. But it took firm root
                    on Norman soil; it made its way to England at an early stage of its growth, and
                    from that time it went on developing and improving on both sides of the Channel
                    till the artistic revolution came by which, throughout northern Europe, the
                    Romanesque styles gave way to the Gothic. Thus the history of architecture in
                    England during the 11th and 12th centuries is a very different story from the
                    history of the art in Sicily during the same time. There were no Greeks or
                    Saracens in England; there was no Greek or Saracen skill. England indeed had,
                    possibly in a somewhat ruder form, the earlier style of Romanesque once common
                    to England with Italy, Gaul, and Germany. To this style it is no wonder that the
                    Normans preferred their own, and that style therefore supplanted the older one.
                    A comparison of Norman buildings in England and in Normandy will show that the
                    Norman style in England really was affected by the earlier style of England; but
                    the modification was very slight, and it in no way affected the general
                    character of the style. Thus, while the institutions of England in the 12th
                    century were English with very considerable Norman modifications, the
                    architecture of England in that century was Norman with a very slight English
                    modification. The difference then is plain. Where, as in Sicily, the Normans
                    felt that they could not improve, they simply adopted the style of the country.
                    Where, as in England, they felt that they could improve, they substituted for
                    the style of the country their own style,—that is, a style which they had not
                    created but which they had adopted, which they had made thoroughly their own,
                    and which they went on improving in England no less than in Normandy. That is,
                    the discerning Norman, as ever, adapted himself, but adapted himself in an
                    intelligent way, to the circumstances of each land in which he found himself.
                    And this comes out the more clearly if we compare Norman work in England and in
                    Sicily with Norman work in at least some parts of Apulia. At Bari, Trani, and
                    Bitonto we see a style in which Italian and strictly Norman elements are really
                    mingled. The great churches of those cities are wholly unlike those of Sicily;
                    but, -while some features show us that we are in Italy, while some features even
                    savour of the Saracen, others distinctly carry us away to Caen and Peterborough.
                    It is plain that the Norman settlers in Apulia were not so deeply impressed with
                    the local style as they were in Sicily, while they thought much more of it than
                    they thought of the local style of England. In each of the three cases there is
                    adaptation, but the amount of adaptation differs in each case according to local
                    circumstances. In Normandy itself, after the separation from England,
                    architecture becomes French, but it is French of a remarkably good type. The
                    buildings of the latest French style keep a certain purity and sobriety in
                    Normandy which they do not keep elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Of all the points here insisted on that which it is most necessary to bear in
                    mind is the Norman power of adaptation to circumstances, the gift which in the
                    end destroyed the race as a separate race. English history is utterly
                    misconceived if it is thought that an acknowledged distinction between Normans
                    and English went on, perhaps into the 14th century, perhaps into the 17th. Long
                    before the earlier of those dates the Norman in England had done his work; he
                    had unwittingly done much to preserve and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n597/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0597-0552"/> strengthen the national life of a really kindred
                    people, and, that work done, he had lost himself in the greater mass of that
                    kindred people. In Sicily his work, far more brilliant, far more beneficent at
                    the time, could not be so lasting. The Norman princes made Sicily a kingdom;
                    they ruled it for a season better than any other kingdom was ruled; but they
                    could not make it a Norman kingdom, nor could they themselves become national
                    Sicilian kings. The kingdom that they founded has now vanished from among the
                    kingdoms of the earth, because it was only a kingdom and not a nation. In every
                    other way the Norman has vanished from Sicily as though he had never been. His
                    very works of building are hardly witnesses to his presence, because, without
                    external evidence, we should never have taken them to be his. In Sicily, in
                    short, he gave a few generations of unusual peace and prosperity to several
                    nations living side by side, and then he, so to speak, went his way from a land
                    in which he had a work to do, but in which he never was really at home. In
                    England he made himself, though by rougher means, more truly at home among
                    unacknowledged kinsmen. When in outward show he seemed to work the unmaking of a
                    nation he was in truth giving no small help towards its second making. <hi
