                    rend="italic">cité.</hi> The latter is one of the oldest and most interesting of
                    French towns. The cathedral (St Just) is the third on the site, and dates from
                    the close of the 13th century, when the choir (130 feet high) was built. Two
                    towers were added in the 15th century. An unusual effect is produced by a double
                    row of crenella-tion taking the place of balustrades on the roof of the choir
                    chapels and connecting the pillars of the flying buttresses. Among the
                    sepulchral monuments in the chancel may be noticed the alabaster tomb of
                    Cardinal de Briçonnet, minister of state under Charles VIII. The chapter-house,
                    of the 15th century, has a vaulted roof supported on four free pillars. From the
                    top of the towers, 19-4 feet high, a magnificent view is obtained over the
                    Narbonne plain, the valley of the Aude, the Montagne Noire, the Cevennes, the
                    hills of La Clape, which lie between the city and the sea, the Canigou, and the
                    Corbières. The apse of the cathedral was formerly joined to the fortifications
                    of the archiépiscopal palace, and the two buildings are still connected by a
                    mutilated cloister of the 14th and 15th centuries. On the front of the palace
                    are. three square towers of unequal height. Between the Tour des Télégraphes
                    (1318), crenellated and turreted at the corners, and that of St Martial (1380),
                    machicolated and pierced by Gothic openings, a new façade was erected in the
                    style of the 15th century after the plans of Viollet-le-Duc. This portion of the
                    building now serves as hôtel de ville, and its upper stories are occupied by the
                    Narbonne museum, one of the best outside of Paris, containing pictures, pottery,
                    nearly three thousand medals, and (in the old guard-room) a rich variety of
                    Greek, Carthaginian, and Roman antiquities. The palace garden also contains many
                    fragments of Roman work once built into the now dismantled fortifications; and
                    the Musée Lapidaire in the Lamourguier buildings (formerly a Benedictine
                    convent) has six hundred and twenty bas-reliefs and three hundred and
                    twenty-three ancient inscriptions. The church of St Paul, though partly
                    Romanesque, is in the main a striking and for the south of France a rare example
                    of a building of the first half of the 13 th century in the Gothic style of the
                    north. It possesses some ancient Christian sarcophaguses and fine Renaissance
                    wood carving. Narbonne has a good trade, especially in wine and spirituous
                    liquors,— the surrounding country growing (at the rate of 120 gallons per acre)
                    strong alcoholic wines, largely in demand for “fortifying” weaker vintages. As a
                    matter of course this gives employment to large numbers of coopers; and besides
                    there are in the town several verdigris factories, a sulphur refinery, and
                    tanneries. The honey of Narbonne is famed throughout Europe. The population in
                    1881 was 28,134.</p>
                <p>Long before the Roman invasion of Gaul Narbonne was a flourishing city. It was
                    there that the Romans in 118 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> founded their first
                    colony in Gaul; and they constructed great works to protect the city from
                    inundation and to improve its port. The seat of a proconsul and a station for
                    the Roman fleet, Narbo Martius became the rival of Massilia. But in 150 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> it suffered greatly from a conflagration, and the
                    division of Gallia Narbonensis into two provinces lessened its importance as a
                    capital. Alans, Suevi, Vandals, each held the city for a brief space, and at
                    last, in 413, it was more permanently occupied by the Visigoths. In 719, after a
                    siege of two years, it was captured by the Saracens, and by them its
                    fortifications were restored and extended. Charles Martel, after the battle of
                    Poitiers, and Pippin the Short, in 752, were both repulsed from its walls; but
                    on a new attempt, after an investment of seven years, and by aid of a traitor,
                    the Franks managed again to force their way into Narbonne. Charlemagne made the
                    city the capital of the duchy of Gothia, and divided it into three lordships—one
                    for the bishop, another for a Frankish lord, and the third for the Jews, who,
                    occupying their own quarter, possessed schools, synagogues, and a university
                    famous in the Middle Ages. The viscounts who succeeded the Frankish lord
                    sometimes acknowledged the authority of the counts of Toulouse, sometimes that
                    of the counts of Barcelona. In the 13th century the crusade against the
                    Albigenses spared the city, but the archbishopric was seized by the pope’s
                    legate Amaury, who took the title of duke of Narbonne. Simon de Montfort,
                    however, deprived him of this dignity, receiving from Philip Augustus the duchy
                    of Narbonne along with the county of Toulouse. By his expulsion of the Jews
                    Philip the Fair hastened the decay of the city; and about the same period the
                    Aude, which had formerly been diverted by the Romans, ceased to flow towards
                    Narbonne and the harbour was silted up, to the further disadvantage of the
                    place. United to the French crown in 1507, Narbonne was enclosed by a new line
                    of walls under Francis I., but having ceased to be a garrison town it had the
                    last portions of its ramparts demolished in 1870.</p>
