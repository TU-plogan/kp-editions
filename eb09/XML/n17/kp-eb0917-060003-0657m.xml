                    open modern-looking town. Part of the old citadel is used as a prison. Of the
                    churches it is enough to mention the cathedral, originally dating from 400, but
                    (with the exception of the octagonal dome-roofed baptistery, separated from the
                    west end by an atrium) rebuilt in the Romanesque style between 1860 and 1870
                    after designs by Antonelli; the church of S. Gaudenzio (so called after Bishop
                    Gaudentius (oδ. 417), who is buried under the high altar), rebuilt by Pellegrino
                    Pellegrini Tibaldi, with its strange tower, more than 269 feet high; and San
                    Pietro del Rosario, in which the papal anathema was pronounced against the
                    followers of Fra Dolcino. The city also contains handsome market-buildings
                    erected in 1817-42, a large hospital originally dating from the 9th century, a
                    court-house constructed in 1346, a municipal library of 30,000 volumes (located
                    in the marketbuildings), a theatre, a statue of Cavour by Dini (1863), and
                    another of Charles Albert. Besides being the largest grain market in the
                    north-west of Italy, Novara trades in silk, linen, &amp;c., and manufactures
                    cotton, waxcloth, pottery, and starch. The communal population was 29,516 in
                    1871, and 33,077 in 1881; that of the city was 15,232 (or, with its suburbs, S.
                    Martino, S. Andrea, S. Agabio, Bicocca, and Torrion, 26,206) in 1881.</p>
                <p>Novara, the ancient Novaria, according to Pliny of Gaulish, according to Cato of
                    Ligurian origin, was a municipal city of some importance during the Roman
                    empire. Dismantled in 386 by Maximus for siding with his rival Valentinian, it
                    was restored by Theodosius; but it was afterwards ravaged by Radagaisus (405)
                    and Attila (452). A dukedom of Novara was constituted by the Lombards, a
                    countship by Charlemagne. In 1110 the city was taken and burned by the emperor
                    Henry V. Before the close of the 12th century it accepted the protection of
                    Milan, and thus passed into the hands first of the Visconti and secondly of the
                    Sforzas. In 1706 the city, which had long before been ceded by Maria Visconti to
                    Amadeus VIII. of Savoy, was occupied by the Savoy troops. At the peace of
                    Utrecht it passed to the house of Austria along with the duchy of Milan; but,
                    having been occupied by Charles Emmanuel in 1734, it was granted to him in the
                    following year. Under the French it was the chief town of the department of
                    Agogna. Restored to Savoy in 1814, it was in 1821 the scene of the defeat of the
                    Piedmontese by the Austrians, and in 1849 of the more disastrous battle which
                    led to the abdication of Charles Albert and an Austrian occupancy of the city.
                    Natives of Novara are C. Albucius Silus (ancient rhetorician) and Gaudenzio
                    Ferrari (many of whose works are preserved in the city); and Peter Lombard was
                    born at Lumello in the neighbourhood. The chapel-mastership has been held by
                    some of the greatest Italian musicians, Paganini, Mercadante, La Coccia,
                    &amp;c.</p>
