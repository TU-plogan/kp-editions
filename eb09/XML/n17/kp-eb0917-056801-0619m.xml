                    of the 6th to the middle of the 8th century under Ethelfrith and the descendants
                    of Edwin of Deira, the predominance of Mercia during the latter half of the 8th
                    century under Offa, and the gradual union of England under the descendants of
                    Egbert of Wessex between the close of the 8th century and the Norman Conquest.
                    The present article is chiefly concerned with the first of these periods
                    chronologically, and geographically with the portion of Britain which under the
                    Northumbrian kings at the time of their greatest power extended from the Humber
                    to the Forth, and was bounded on the east by the German Ocean and on the west by
                    an irregular and gradually receding line, at times overstepped, of the country
                    more or less mountainous retained by the Celts of Strathclyde and Cumbria
                    between the Clyde and the Mersey (see Plate II., vol. viii.). The first
                    settlements of the Angles in these regions and the foundation of the kingdoms of
                    Bernicia and Deira have been spoken of in vol. viii. p. 270. Bernicia and Deira
                    were Celtic names, Bryneich and Deifr, somewhat modified; the former kingdom
                    corresponded generally with the modern counties of Durham and <pb break="no"

                    Yorkshire, and when the two became united in one kingdom it received the name of
                    Northumberland.</p>
                <p>The history of Bernicia between the establishment of Ida as its king and the
                    reign of his grandson Ethelfrith (592-617), and of Deira prior to the reign of
                    Edwin (616- 633), the son of Aella, is obscure. The skilful piecing together of
                    the notices of Nennius, Bede, and the early English chroniclers by Palgrave,
                    Lappenberg, Skene, and others cannot be regarded as a completely successful
                    reconstruction of the chronology of the Northumbrian kings. The chief
                    difficulty, though only one of many, is that six of twelve sons of Ida are said
                    to have reigned in Bernicia from his death (559) to the accession of Ethelfrith,
                    his grandson (592 or 594), a period of only thirty-three or thirty-five years,
                    which, though not quite incredible, appears short in comparison with the
                    parallel reigns of Aella of Deira (559-588) and his son Edwin (616-633), while
                    their names and order of succession do not agree in the earliest authorities.
                    Another is that Bebba, the British princess from whom Bamburgh, the chief
                    fortress of Bernicia, was named, was according to the <hi rend="italic">Saxon
                    Chronicle</hi> wife of Ida, but according to Nennius of Ethelfrith. Whatever may
                    be the truth as to the earlier history, more light dawns with Ethelfrith, in
                    whose reign the attempt to unite Bernicia and Deira commenced. “The most
                    powerful and covetous of glory of kings,” as he is called by Bede, Ethelfrith
                    “wasted the race of the Britons more than all the chiefs of the Angles, and made
                    more land than any of them subject to or inhabited by Angles, exterminating or
                    subduing the indigenous tribes” (Bede, i. 34). By one of these victories, that
                    of Catraeth? (596), commemorated in the verse of Aneurin, he overcame the
                    Britons, who were driven back into Cumbria, and by another at Daegsastan
                    (?Dawston in Liddisdale) over Aidan, king of the Scots of Dalriada, in 603, he
                    put a stop to incursions of the Scots down to Bede’s own day. A third victory at
                    Caerleon (Chester on the Dee) 613?, followed by the slaughter of the monks of
                    Bangor, marks the fact that the Northumbrian Angles were still heathens fighting
                    against Christian Celts. It was these successes that led to the extension of
                    Northumberland to the borders of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and the first
                    permanent inclusion of part at least of the district between the Tweed and the
                    Forth in the kingdom of the northern Angles. Ethelfrith married a sister of
                    Edwin and daughter of Aella of Deira, and after Aella’s death, during the
                    minority of Edwin, seized Deira, over which he reigned for twelve years. The
                    young Edwin took refuge first amongst the Britons and afterwards with Redwald,
                    king of East Anglia, who restored him to his kingdom by the defeat and death of
                    Ethelfrith at a battle on the Idle, a tributary of the Trent, in 617. This turn
                    of fortune drove Eanfrid, Oswald, and Oswy, the sons of Ethelfrith, into exile
                    amongst the northern Celts, and Edwin, like Ethelfrith, ruled over the whole
                    Angles north of the Humber to the Forth; for, whether Edinburgh was his
                    foundation or a fortress of the Celts (Dunedin), the tradition which linked its
                    modern name with his can scarcely be without meaning. Through his example the
                    Angles were converted to Christianity by Paulinus, a monk sent from Canterbury
                    with letters from Boniface V. to the king and his wife Ethelberga, the daughter
                    of Ethelbert of Kent. The story of the origin of the Northumbrian Church, with
                    its incidents of the destruction of the idols by the heathen archpriest Coifi,
                    the speeches at the council of the witan which decided in favour of the new
                    faith, the host of catechumens eager for baptism in the nearest rivers, the Glen
                    in Bernicia, the Swale in Deira, and the Trent in the country of the Lindissi,
                    the erection of a stone church dedicated to St Peter at York surrounding the
                    wooden oratory in which Edwin had himself been baptized, afterwards itself
                    enclosed in the minster, forms one of the most vivid passages of Bede. As the
                    scene of these incidents vas his native country, and their time about half a
                    century before his birth, there is no reason to doubt the substantial truth of a
                    narrative derived at first, or at furthest at second hand.</p>
                <p>“Deda, a priest of Bardney, a man of singular veracity,” he mentions in one
                    place, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ‘ told me that one of the oldest persons
                    (in the province of the Lindissi, modern Lincoln) had informed him that he
                    himself had been baptized by Paulinus at noon in the presence of Edwin, with a
                    great multitude of the people, in the river Trent . . . he was also wont to
                    describe the personal appearance of Paulinus, tall of stature, a little
                    stooping, his hair black, his visage meagre, his nose very slender and aquiline,
                    his aspect both venerable and majestic.”</p>
                <p>The same historian testifies to the dignity of Edwin’s reign, shown by the
                    “tufa,” or standard of feathers on a spear-head, borne before him in war and
                    peace. A woman with a new-born child might walk through his dominion without
                    harm, and cups were provided at the springs on the wayside for travellers. Such
                    a time was fitted for the reception of the new religion of peace, but Edwin’s
                    days ended in war, and he perished at Heathfield (Hatfield in Yorkshire) in a
                    battle against the heathen host led by Penda, king of Mercia, and the British
                    King Ceadwalla (633). His death permitted the return of the sons of Ethelfrith.
                    The eldest, Eanfrid, who is supposed to have been in exile amongst the Picts,
                    obtained Bernicia, while Deira fell to Osric, the son of his uncle Alfric.
                    Eanfrid, who relapsed to paganism, held his kingdom only a year; and in 634
                    Ceadwalla defeated Osric at York, and killed by treachery Eanfrid, who had made
                    overtures of peace. Eanfrid’s brother Oswald recovered both Bernicia and Deira
                    by the great victory of Heavenfield near Hexham in 635. “The most Christian king
                    of the Northumbrians,” as Bede emphatically calls him, Oswald restored
                    Christianity throughout his whole territory, but under the monastic form he had
                    learnt during his exile in Iona, and with the usages as to Easter and the
                    tonsure which distinguished the Celtic from the Roman Church. At his request
                    Aidan, a monk of Iona, came to instruct the Angles in the Christian faith, and
                    was in 634 or 635 consecrated as bishop of Lindisfarne, the Holy Island, which
                    became the Iona of the eastern coast.</p>
                <p>The powerful and wise rule of Oswald not only reunited Bernicia and Deira, but
                    subjected races of all the four languages (for we may be sure Bede’s expression
                    <hi rend="italic">“all</hi> the nations of the four languages” is an hyperbole),
                    the Britons, the Picts, the Scots, and the Angles, to his dominion.</p>
                <p>In 642 he fell in a battle against Penda of Mercia at Maserfield, which, whether
                    it be the place of that name now called Winwick in Lancashire or Oswestry
                    (Oswald’s tree) in Shropshire, shows that he was still further enlarging his
                    realm. His successor Oswy revenged his death by the defeat and death of Penda at
                    the river Winwaed, now Winmore, near Leeds (655), which resulted in the
                    conversion of Mercia. In his reign Wilfrid, an energetic and ambitious monk,
                    persuaded the Northumbrians at the council of Whitby to conform to the Roman
                    usage as to Easter and the tonsure, and Colman, the third Celtic bishop oi
                    Lindisfarne, returned to Iona with the Scottish monks and the relics of Aidan.
                    The successful advocate of the Roman rites became bishop of York, with a diocese
                    including all Northumberland and the Pictish subjects of Oswy, thus completing
                    the scheme of Gregory I. and Augustine for the ecclesiastical organization of
                    England.</p>
                <p>On the death of Oswy in 670 the Picts revolted, but his son Egfrid succeeded in
                    quelling the revolt and in extending his father’s kingdom both against the
                    Mercians <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n621/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0621-0570"/> on his southern and the Pictish kings on his
                    northern border. In 684, tempted by his good fortune, he sent his general Beret
                    to ravage Ireland, then, says Bede, a peaceful and friendly country, which
                    implies that his dominions had now touched some parts of the western shores, and
                    next year he himself invaded the territory of the northern Picts, where he was
                    defeated and slain by their king Bredei or Brude at Nechtan’s Mere (Dunnichen Î
                    in Forfarshire) in 685. The result was that not only the Picts recovered their
                    own land and ceased to pay tribute, but some of the Britons also became
                    independent. The Northumbrian Church under the able leadership of Wilfrid shared
                    in the extension of the kingdom, and it also shared in its repulse. A bishopric
                    established under Trumwine at Abercorn in Linlithgowshire, in the country of the
                    Angles, but close to the arm of the sea dividing the Angles and the Picts (Bede,
                    iv. 26), had to be abandoned. The Forth was destined to be the limit of
                    Northumbrian sovereignty to the north.</p>
                <p>Shortly before the close of this reign a dispute between the king and Wilfrid led
                    to the division of the diocese of York into two bishoprics—York, of which Bosa
                    was made bishop, and that of Lindisfarne or Hexham, whose first bishop was Eata.
                    A new bishopric was erected for the district of the Lindissi (Lincoln), who had
                    been conquered by Egfrid. To this or the next reign belong the earliest
                    fragmentary memorials of the Northumbrian or Northern English dialect which have
                    come down to our time—the Runic inscription of the crosses at Ruthwell and
                    perhaps those at Thornhill in Dumfriesshire and at Bewcastle in Cumberland. It
                    was during the same period that <hi rend="smallcaps">Caedmon</hi> (7.v.), a monk
                    of Whitby, the earliest English poet, died (68θ), and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bede</hi> (7.v.), the monk of Wearmouth and Yarrow, the earliest English
                    historian, except the anonymous authors of the <hi rend="italic">A.S.
                    Chronicle,</hi> Aldhelm, and Eddi, the writer of Wilfrid’s life, was born (672
                    or 674). To their influence, and to the learned—which succeeded the warlike
                    —epoch of Northumberland during the next century down to the death of Alcuin of
                    York in 804, may be ascribed the fact that, while Saxon Wessex became the
                    dominant state, the language and the land south of the Forth received from the
                    Angles the name of English-and England.</p>
                <p>Egfrid was succeeded by his brother Aldfrid, an illegitimate son of Oswy
                    (685-705), who “retrieved,” in the words of Bede, “the ruined state of the
                    kingdom, though within narrower bounds.” It was in his reign that Cuthbert, a
                    monk of Melrose, which had been founded by Bishop Eata, became bishop of
                    Lindisfarne. His preaching commenced the Christianization of the country between
                    the Forth and the Tweed, and his fame quickly gathering a legendary halo of
                    miracles led to his being adopted as the patron saint of Durham and the north of
                    England, as well as of southern Scotland. While no serious attempt was made to
                    regain the lost territory in the country of the Northern Picts, Egfrid, his son
                    Osred (705-716), and Osred’s successors, Coenred (716-718), Osric (718-729), and
                    Ceolwulf (729-737), some of whom were descendants of a different branch of the
                    family of Ida, gradually extended the limits of their kingdom to the west, and,
                    following the coast, established themselves in Galloway and as far as Cunningham
                    (Bede, v. 12), the northern district of modern Ayrshire. Shortly before 731,
                    when Bede concluded his history, an Anglian see had been created at Whithorn <hi
                    rend="italic">(Candida Casa)</hi> in Galloway, of which Bechtheim was the first
                    bishop, and which lasted till 803.</p>
                <p>The last of the important kings of Northumberland, Eadbert (737-758), pushed his
                    arms as far as the Clyde, defeating the Britons in Kyle, and, in alliance with
                    Angus Macfergus, king of the Picts, took Allclyd (Dumbarton), the chief town or
                    fortress of the Strathclyde Britons, in 756. These were uncertain conquests.</p>
                <p>The epoch of Northumbrian greatness closes with Oswy. It is significant that two
                    of the last-named kings, Ceolwulf and Eadbert, resigned the crown for the
                    tonsure. External circumstances combined with the enervation of the royal race
                    to produce the decline of Northumberland. Its southern neighbour, Mercia, was
                    ruled by two powerful kings,—Ethelbald, who ravaged Northumberland in 737, and
                    after his death the great Offa (757-796), the contemporary of Charlemagne; while
                    a series of Northumbrian kings, of whom we know little save the names and the
                    dates of their mostly violent deaths—Oswulf (758), Ethelwald (765), Alchred
                    (774), Ethelred (779), Alfwold (788), Osred (792), another Ethelred (796), whose
                    wife, Ethelfreda, was a daughter of Offa—wasted in intestine struggles the
                    kingdom of their predecessors.</p>
                <p>On its northern boundary a vigorous line of Pictish kings, beginning with Angus
                    Macfergus (731-761), the ally of Eadbert against the Britons of Strathclyde,
                    whose chief seat was Scone, threatened, and there is no doubt often passed, the
                    boundary of the Forth, but the Angles retained Lothian during the 8th and the
                    first half of the 9th century, and it was not till a century after the union of
                    the Scots and Picts under Kenneth Macalpine (844), in the reign of Indulph
                    (954-962), that Edinburgh became Scottish instead of Northumbrian ground. In 793
                    the heathen Northmen signalized the commencement of the attacks which were for
                    several centuries to vex the coast of Britain by the sack of Lindisfarne, and in
                    the following year of Yarrow. Though this descent was repelled, the Danish
                    vikings with increased numbers renewed their raids in the following century.
                    Before its close the southern half of Northumberland had received a large
                    infusion of Danish population. Their distant kinship in race and not so distant
                    likeness of language favoured their settlement in the territory of the Angles.
                    With the close of the 8th century the history of the kingdom of Northumberland
                    practically ends, though a few names of kings of pure Anglian race are recorded
                    in the 9th century.</p>
                <p>It may be convenient to trace the subsequent fate of this kingdom and its parts.
                    In 827 Eadred, king of Northumberland, submitted to Egbert, the founder of the
                    greatness of Wessex, and agreed to pay tribute in order to stay the progress of
                    that kingdom at the Humber.</p>
                <p>In 875 the Danish host, now too large for and weary of mere raids, divided itself
                    between Guthorm, who led his division against southern England, where its final
                    repulse by Alfred made him the hero of his race, while Healfdene, with no Alfred
                    amongst the Angles to oppose him, conquered Northumberland and settled his
                    followers on the east coast, throughout the whole of ancient Deira, the southern
                    part of ancient Bernicia, and as far west as the central districts of Anglian
                    Cumberland. Wherever the “by” replaced the older name or gave a new name to the
                    settlement, wherever the “t” still lingers instead of “the” as the article,
                    linguistic scholars see certain marks of Danish occupation. This occupation
                    retarded the northern advance of the Wessex kings, the descendants of Alfred,
                    and a century elapsed before Edward the Elder in 924 received again at Bakewell
                    in Derbyshire the homage αf the Northumbrians, as Egbert in 827 is said to have
                    done almost at the same point, whose position on the extreme southern border of
                    Northumberland is significant. This homage is recorded in the contested passage
                    of the <hi rend="italic">A.S. Chronicle·.</hi> “And then chose him for father
                    and lord the king of the Scots and the whole nation of the Scots and Regnwald
                    and the sons of Eadulf and all those who dwell in Northumbria, as well Angles as
                    Danes, Northmen, and others.” But the dispute as to the precise nature and
                    extent of the submission does not concern the present subject so much as the
                    evidence it affords of the mixed population of Northumberland, and of the
                    absence of any prominent sovereign of the whole country whose name could be
                    mentioned by the Chronicle. In the reign of Athelstan, the son of Edward the
                    Elder, the great victory of Brunanburgh (937), by which he defeated the united
                    forces of Olaf Cuaran, the son of Sitric, the Danish king or earl, his
                    father-in-law Constantine, king of the Scots, another Olaf, the son of Godfry,
                    king of the Irish Danes, and the British prince of Cumbria, made the conquest of
                    Northumberland south of the Solway and the Tweed more of a reality. Norse
                    mercenaries under Egil, the hero of the Icelandic saga, fought in the army of
                    Athelstan, and a few years <pb break="no"

                    the Fairhaired, had to be purchased by giving him the rule over Northumberland,
                    which he was intended, but was unable, to hold as a barrier against the Scots
                    and Danes. The conquest of the Northumbrian Danes was only completed in 954,
                    when Eadred, the third son of Edward the Elder, who was king of Wessex, was able
                    to substitute Oswulf, an earl of his own choice, for their last king, Eric, who
                    is called by the English chroniclers simply “the son of Harold,” and is supposed
                    by Adam of Bremen to have been the son of Harold (Blue-tooth) king of Denmark,
                    but by the best modern writers to be Eric Blood-Axe, who had returned to
                    Northumberland and was slain at Stanemoor (954).<note anchored="true"

                    Northumberland into two earldoms, which answered roughly to the ancient Deira
                    and Bernicia, but probably more nearly to the modern county of York, of which
                    Oslac was earl, and modern Northumberland and Durham, which Oswulf retained. The
                    dismemberment of the ancient kingdom had commenced in the earlier reign of
                    Edmund, who in 945 ceded Cumbria to Malcolm I. of Scotland on condition that he
                    should be “his fellow-worker both by land and sea,” a remarkable expression in
                    the A.S. Chronicle, indicating alliance rather than homage.</p>
                <p>Lothian was either ceded between 970 and 975 by Eadgar to Kenneth, the son of
                    Malcolm I., upon condition that it should retain its Anglian speech and customs,
                    which is the account given by John of Wallingford, or conquered by the defeat of
                    Eadulf Cudel, its ruler in the time of Canute, by Malcolm II. at the battle of
                    Carham in 1018, as is stated by Simeon of Durham. It seems not impossible that
                    both statements may be true, and that an earlier almost compulsory union was
                    followed by a more complete annexation. For England was already threatened by
                    the last and most formidable invasion of the Danes, which was to end in its
                    conquest by Canute (1017). This conquest for a brief space included not only
                    Northumberland but Scotland (1031-35). In the confused period between the Danish
                    and the Norman conquests of England, the succession of the Northumbrian earls
                    appears to have been this. The two earldoms of Oslac and Oswulf had been united
                    under Waltheof (975), who was deposed by Aethelred in favour of Waltheofs son
                    Uhtred (1000). Uhtred defeated the Scots near Durham, and received the hand of
                    Aelgifa, Aethelred’s daughter. He submitted to Canute, but was slain soon after
                    his submission by a private enemy, and Eric, the husband of Canute’s sister
                    Gytha, became earl, though the northern portion of his earldom was left to the
                    charge of Eadulf Cudel, a brother of Uhtred, whose signal defeat at Carham, we
                    have seen, finally united Lothian to Scotland. Two obscure sons of Eadulf,
                    Ealred and a second Eadulf, afterwards appear as earls in Bernicia in the time
                    of Hardicanute. Both were assassinated, the latter by Siward the Strong, a
                    Danish follower of Canute, who married a daughter of Ealred, and in 1041 reigned
                    over all Northumberland. He was the famous earl in the narrative of whose
                    exploits it is difficult to separate legend from history, but to the latter
                    apparently belongs his alliance with Malcolm Canmore, and the aid he gave in
                    recovering his father’s kingdom from Macbeth, the representative of the Celtic
                    party in Scotland. On his death in 1055, Edward the Confessor appointed Tostig,
                    one of the sons of Godwin, earl of Northumberland, including the detached shires
                    of Northampton and Huntingdon. Deposed by the Northumbrians, he took refuge with
                    his brother-in-law, the Flemish Baldwin, at Bruges. After taking part in the
                    early designs of William the Conqueror against England, he joined in the
                    expedition of Harold Hardrada against his brother Harold, and was slain at
                    Stamfordbridge (25th September 1066). After the Conquest Yorkshire was
                    incorporated in England. Morkere the son of Aelfgar earl of Mercia, and Copsige,
                    a thane who had acted as deputy of Tostig, still retained the northern
                    districts, and, though they submitted to William, the subjugation was almost
                    nominal. Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham were not
                    sufficiently subdued to be included in the Domesday survey, though some parts of
                    southern Westmoreland and Cumberland are contained in the description of the
                    West Riding of Yorkshire, and parts of Lancashire in that of Cheshire. Frequent
                    risings and constant changes of its earls prove the difficulty which the Norman
                    kings experienced in governing the unruly northern province: Robert of Comines
                    was slain at Durham in 1069; Cospatric was deprived for rebellion in 1070;
                    Waltheof, who also rebelled, was executed in 1076; Walcher, who held it along
                    with the bishopric of Durham, was murdered in 1080; Alberic resigned the dignity
                    in 1085, and was succeeded by Robert de Moubray, after whose forfeiture in 1095
                    Northumberland was united by Rufus to the crown. In the reign of Henry II. the
                    earldom was conferred on Henry, earl of Huntingdon, the son of David I. of
                    Scotland; after his death it was surrendered in 1154 by Malcolm IV., but its
                    possession was always coveted and sometimes almost obtained by the Scottish
                    kings, until the final result of the wars of the Plantagenets was to leave
                    Scotland independent, but to fix its boundaries north of the</p>
                <p>Tweed, the Cheviots, and the Solway. Richard II. in 1377 regranted the earldom to
                    Henry Percy, and the memory of its former independence probably prompted the
                    ambition of the earls of this powerful house, which played so great a part in
                    English history in the 15th and 16th centuries (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Percy).</hi></p>
                <p>To sum up the results of a somewhat complex and here necessarily compressed
                    history. The ancient kingdom of Northumberland, formed by the union of all the
                    northeastern part of Britain between the Humber and the Forth under the Anglian
                    kings, and the more or less complete conquest of the British or Cymric western
                    part between the Mersey and the Clyde, was ruled by the Anglian kings from the
                    middle of the 6th to the 9th century. A great portion of it was resettled by the
                    Danes towards the close of that century. It was conquered-by the West-Saxon
                    kings in the 10th century, but they had to allow its Danish earls to remain its
                    real governors until shortly before the Norman Conquest, and before its close,
                    or in the beginning of the 11th century, to cede the northern part of Cumbria
                    and the northern part of Bernicia beyond the Tweed to the Scottish kings. Of
                    their dominions the former, Galloway (the shires of Wigtown, Kirkcudbright, and
                    part of Dumfries), became for a time an outlying district, but after David I. an
                    integral part, though it retained for some time longer its Celtic speech and
                    customs, while the latter, Lothian, preserving its Anglian speech and customs,
                    became the seat of the court and the source of the civilization of Scotland. The
                    portion of the Northumbrian kingdom which remained English was divided into the
                    shire of York, the earldom or county of Northumberland in the modern sense, and
                    the later counties of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and part of Lancashire. The
                    preponderating influence in government as in language passed during the Middle
                    Ages, and still continues to belong, to southern England, which possesses the
                    capital London, its greatest river the Thames, and its most fertile lands. The
                    discovery of the coal and ironstone, the sinews of manufactures, in the North,
                    and the later development of the Mersey, the Clyde, the Humber, the Tyne, and
                    the Forth, as the channels of commerce in modern times, have revived the
                    importance of the districts comprised within the ancient kingdom of
                    Northumberland. Whatever maybe its future, its earliest history forms a
                    memorable chapter in that of Great Britain.</p>
