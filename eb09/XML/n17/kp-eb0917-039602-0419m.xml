                <p><label type="entry">NEW JERSEY</label>. The State of New Jersey, one of the
                    original colonies which formed the United States of America, lies between 38°
                    55' 39" ’ 65 and 41° 2Γ 19" N. lat., and 73° 53' 51" and 75° 33' 3" W. long.,
                    and is bounded on the E. by the Hudson river, Staten Island Sound, Raritan Bay,
                    and the Atlantic Ocean, on the S. by Delaware Bay, on the W. by the Delaware
                    river, and on the N. by the State of, New York, their common boundary being a
                    straight line from the west bank of the Hudson river in latitude 40° N. to a
                    point on the north bank of the Neversink river at its junction with the
                    Delaware. The extreme length is 167j miles, and the width ranges from 59 to 32
                    miles; and the State has an area of 7576 square miles, and is divided into 21
                    counties and 223 townships.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> New Jersey lies entirely on the
                    Atlantic slope of the United States. In the north and north-west it is traversed
                    by the Appalachian chain; the Red Sandstone belt, intersected by trap dykes, and
                    extending from Massachusetts to South Carolina, occupies the central portion;
                    and the lower half of the State is a part of the level sandy tract, covered with
                    pine woods, which borders the Atlantic from New York to Florida.</p>
                <p>The ridges of the Appalachian chain in New Jersey may be grouped in two main
                    ranges—the Blue or Kittatinny Mountains and the Highland range. The first of
                    these is an almost unbroken ridge from the New York State line to the Delaware
                    Water Gap, and is the highest ground in the State, being at the Water Gap 1479
                    feet above the sea, and at High Point, near the New York line, 1800 feet high.
                    Its level crest is clothed with forests, but the slopes are to a great extent
                    cultivated. The Highland range, on the other hand, consists of a number of
                    detached ridges, the highest of which is 1488 feet above the sea. These vary
                    greatly in their surfaces; many admit of cultivation to the summit, while others
                    are so covered with loose stones or bare rock that cultivation is impossible.
                    The mineral wealth of the range is considerable.</p>
                <p>The Red Sandstone central region is traversed by a number of irregularly
                    distributed trap dykes, which are rough and wooded, and rise in the midst of a
                    rich and productive district. These vary much in elevation, the highest being
                    868 feet. In southern New Jersey there are no rocky eminences or elevations
                    worthy of the name of mountains. Its rounded hills are all earthy, and the
                    results of denudation or erosion; the most elevated—the Navesink highlands— are
                    about 400 feet high.</p>
                <p>The southern half of the State is a great plain, sloping gently from its centre
                    towards the Atlantic and the</p>
                <p>Delaware, and has been eroded in the Drift period.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The glacial action of the Drift period is
                    well marked in the State by striae and by boulders as distant as 100 miles from
                    their original position. In Middlesex county there is a boulder of 250 tons
                    nearly 30 miles from its parent rock, another in West Orange. The western
                    boundary of the great terminal or ffbntal moraine of the glacial Drift period
                    extends across the State in a general north-north-west course from the mouth of
                    the Raritan at Perth Amboy to Morristown, thence northerly to Denville, where
                    the direction changes to the west as far as the Musconetcong valley, where it
                    again turns and bears westsouth-west to the Delaware at Belvidere.</p></note> It
                    contains tracts of gravelly loam largely used for market gardens and vineyards.
                    Extensive tidal marshes border the Atlantic and Delaware Bay, to the extent of
                    nearly 300,000 acres. The Delaware river and bay receive all streams flowing
                    from the western half of the State; the Passaic and Raritan are the most
                    considerable rivers entirely within New Jersey.. In the north-western part are
                    many beautiful lakes abounding with fish; the largest is Lake Hopatcong, 5⅜
                    miles long by 4∣ to 1∣ miles wide.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> Nearly all the geological periods,
                    except the Coal-measures, are represented in the State. It may be stated in a
                    general way that all the stratified formations cross the State from north-east
                    to south-west; that the Highland range, to which they run parallel, is made up
                    of the oldest rocks in the State; that almost all of the Palaeozoic rocks, which
                    are next in order, lie on the north-west side of these mountains; that the
                    Triassic rocks lie next to the mountains on the south-east; and that the
                    Tertiary and recent formations are then found in succession towards the
                    south-east. The Azoic rocks occur mainly in the Highland range, and here consist
                    chiefly of syenitic gneiss and white crystalline limestone, the former greatly
                    predominating. This limestone is found chiefly on the north-west border of the
                    gneiss, interstratified with and conformable to it. Magnetic iron ore abounds
                    here, and occurs in beds or veins interposed between the strata of the gneiss.
                    New mines are constantly being discovered, and the supply seems
                    inexhaustible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>,762 tons
                    were obtained in 1882.</p></note> Graphite is also found and worked. Valuable
                    deposits of zinc ore occur in the crystalline limestone, and large quantities of
                    excellent lime are made from this rock.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>,138 tons were mined in 1882.</p></note> The Potsdam
                    limestone is found in comparatively small quantities, always near the borders of
                    the gneiss and limestone. Magnesian limestone, found between the Highland range
                    and Kittatinny Mountains, is extensively used for making lime, and contains
                    haematite iron ore. Hudson River slate (used for roofing and flagging) exists
                    most largely on the south-east slope of the Kittatinny Mountains. Water lime and
                    Lower Helderberg limestone, which produce the Rosendale cements, are found in
                    quantity along the north-west foot of the Kittatinny. Red sandstones and shales
                    underlie the region immediately south-east of the Highland range, extending from
                    the Hudson to the Delaware. They are in regular layers, dipping gently to the
                    northwest, and form an excellent building material. Copper occurs in this
                    formation, and was worked at an early period. To the south-east of the Sandstone
                    formation follow plastic and fire clays, due to the decomposition of a ridge of
                    granite which once formed the eastern edge of the Red Sandstone valley; these
                    furnish clays of the purest and most refractory kind, suitable for fire-brick;
                    very pure quartz sand is also found here, to mix with the clay, and kaolin,
                    although not yet of the best quality.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In 1882 more than 350,000 tons of these clays were worked,
                    from which 150,000,000 red bricks were made, a large number of porous bricks, 80
                    per cent, of the architectural terra cotta made in the United States, and a very
                    large amount of pottery and stoneware.</p></note> The greensand, marl, and sand
                    beds occupy a belt some 90 miles long extending from Sandy Hook to the Delaware
                    near <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n422/mode/1up"

                    beds of greensand, each from 12 to 25 feet thick, separated by beds of sand. The
                    marl is clearly of marine origin, containing sea shells, bits of coral, sharks’
                    teeth, saurian bones, &lt;fcc., and makes a good manure. Glassmakers’ sand is
                    worked in the southern part of the State.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the year ending June 1880 27,495 tons were mined, and in
                    that year there were in operation in the State 55 furnaces, containing 364 pots,
                    with 3501 work-people, and a product of §2,810,000; window glass, green glass,
                    and glassware are made. One-third of the product of green glass in the United
                    States is made by the Jersey works.</p></note> Along the shore is an elevation
                    of only 5 to 10 feet above the sealevel, having good alluvial soil, which must
                    within a comparatively recent period have been beneath the sea. Since the first
                    settlement of the country, however, the shore has washed away, and there is good
                    reason to believe that a very gradual subsidence is now taking place.<note

                    Survey and the New Jersey Geological Survey are engaged on observations to
                    settle this question.</p></note> The entire sea-coast is rapidly becoming a
                    continuous line of summer resorts, among which may be enumerated Long Branch,
                    Sea Bright, Spring Lake, and Asbury Park in the northern portion, Atlantic City
                    in the centre, and Cape May in the south. Some of these places, as Atlantic
                    City, are frequented even during the winter months.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce and Industry.—</hi> Although only the thirty-fifth
                    among the thirty-eight States in area, it is the nineteenth in population, the
                    eighth in the value of property, and twenty-fifth in value of agricultural
                    products, the sixth in manufacturing and mechanical industries, while in some
                    industries, as silk, pottery, and glass, it far exceeds any other State. The
                    output of the non-precious minerals places it seventh in the list of States, it
                    being the fourth among the iron-producing States, and first as to zinc ore. It
                    has 1869 miles of railways, or 1 mile to every 4’25 square miles of area,
                    exceeded in this by only one State. The average value of farming lands is
                    considerably above that of any other State. In 1880 the total number of farms
                    was 34,307, averaging 85 acres, or a total of 2,929,773 acres of farm lands, of
                    which 24 ’ 4 per cent, were unimproved. The value of farm lands was
                    §190,895,833; farming implements and machinery, §6,921,085; live stock,
                    §14,861,412; all farm products, §29,650,756. Among the principal products
                    were—Indian corn, 11,150,705 bushels; oats, 3,710,573; rye, 949,064; wheat,
                    1,901,739; hay, 518,990 tons; Irish potatoes, 3,563,793 bushels; sweet potatoes,

                    females, 1,092,017 white, 38,853 coloured, 172 Chinese, and 74 Indians. The
                    inhabitants of foreign birth numbered 221,700. To every square mile of area
                    there were 151’73 inhabitants, the State being the third in the Union in respect
                    of density of population.</p>
                <p>The largest cities, with population in 1880, are—Newark, 136,508; Jersey City,
                    120,722; Paterson, 51,031; Camden, 41,659; Hoboken, 30,999; Trenton (the State
                    capital), 29,910; Elizabeth, 28,229; New Brunswick, 17,166; Orange, 13,207.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> The executive power is vested in a governor
                    elected by the people for a term of three years; no one can serve in this
                    capacity two successive terms. The legislative power is in the legislature,
                    composed of a senate and general assembly meeting on the second Tuesday of
                    January each year at Trenton, the capital of the State. A senator is elected for
                    three years by each of the twenty-one counties, one-third of the whole number
                    being elected each year. The assembly consists of not more than sixty members,
                    elected for one year, and apportioned among the counties as nearly as may be
                    according to the number of their inhabitants, with the condition, however, that
                    each county shall at all times be entitled to one member. The principal officers
                    of the State are a secretary of state, attorney-general, adjutant-general, and
                    quartermaster-general, all appointed by the governor and confirmed by the
                    senate, and a treasurer and comptroller appointed by the legislature in joint
                    meeting. All judges and prosecutors of the pleas are appointed by the governor
                    and confirmed by the senate; the election system for the judiciary has not yet
                    reached New Jersey.</p>
                <p>The judicial power is vested in (1) a court of errors and appeals in the last
                    resort, consisting of the chancellor, the justices of the supreme court, and six
                    judges of the court of errors; (2) a court for the trial of impeachments,
                    consisting of the senate; (3) a court of chancery, consisting of the chancellor
                    and two vice-chancellors; (4) a supreme court, consisting of the chief justice
                    and eight associate justices; (5) circuit courts, held in every county by the
                    justices of the supreme court; (6) an inferior court of the common pleas
                    organized in each county, and consisting of three judges. In some of the
                    sparsely settled counties the inferior courts are presided over by justices of
                    the supreme court; in the other counties one of the three judges is a law judge
                    and presides. The court of pardon consists of the governor, the chancellor, and
                    the six lay judges of the court of errors; a majority of this court, of whom the
                    governor must be one, can remit fines and forfeitures, and grant pardons, after
                    conviction in all cases except impeachments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">State Institutions.—</hi> There are two lunatic asylums,—one
                    near Trenton containing more than 600 patients, the other near Morristown
                    capable of accommodating 800; the latter is probably unsurpassed by any similar
                    institution; there are also seven county asylums containing 746 patients. An
                    institution for the deaf and dumb, to contain 125 pupils, has been recently
                    established at Trenton; the blind and feeble-minded are placed in suitable
                    establishments in neighbouring States. The home for disabled soldiers, at
                    Newark, accommodates nearly 400 men. The State prison at Trenton contains some
                    800 convicts, a large part of whom are employed in contract labour to an extent
                    which pays about 54 per cent, of the cost of the institution. A reformatory
                    school for boys, near Jamesburg, contains about 325 juvenile delinquents. An
                    industrial school for girls, near Trenton, has 30 inmates. The board of health
                    is steadily gaining in importance, and has accomplished much good in spreading
                    useful information, collecting important vital and health statistics, and
                    investigating matters affecting the public health. The labour bureau has done
                    good service in collecting statistics affecting the questions of labour and
                    capital, in bringing about a better understanding between the two, and in
                    indicating new and profitable avenues for industry. The geological survey, of
                    which the geodetic and topographical surveys have necessarily formed part, now
                    approaching its close, is one of the most useful of the State institutions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The Agricultural College, attached to Rutgers
                    College at New Brunswick, is supported by the proceeds of certain public lands
                    given by the United States to the State for that purpose. In connexion with this
                    are the college farm and the agricultural experiment stations, which are doing
                    admirable work in systematic and carefully conducted experiments (under the
                    chief of the geological survey) with various fertilizers, and in testing various
                    soils, crops, and methods of agriculture. The public schools are mainly
                    supported by a State tax of §4 for each child between five and eighteen years of
                    age, amounting in 1882 to§l,322,740, supplemented by an annual appropriation of
                    §100,000 from the school fund, which latter now amounts to more than §3,375,000,
                    and is rapidly increasing. Small additional special taxes are also levied in
                    some of the school districts. A normal school has been in successful operation
                    at Trenton for several years, and has nearly 250 pupils. The college of New
                    Jersey at Princeton, and its sister theological seminary, although not State
                    institutions, occupy places in the very front rank of American schools of
                    learning.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Finance.—</hi> The only State debt is that known as the war
                    debt, amounting at present to less than $1,700,000, and paid off at the rate of
                    $100,000 per annum. The sinking fund for the redemption of this debt is valued
                    at something more than $1,100,000. Independently of the general State school tax
                    the receipts and expenditures for 1882 were $1,104,303’75, distributed as
                    follows:—interest on debt, $90,000; charitable and reformatory, $269,793’19;
                    courts, crimes, &amp;c., $274,025’82; State government, $158,171’04; scientific,
                    sanitary, &amp;c., $47,880’49; military, $70,692’22; educational, $33,983’61;
                    publication, $105,225’47; miscellaneous, $54,531’91. It will thus be seen that
                    the State expended for educational purposes $1,356,723’61, as against
                    $1,070,320’14 for other purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The first settlement within the present State
                    was made in 1617 by the Dutch at Bergen opposite New York. Subsequently
                    Cornelius May, who discovered the Delaware in 1623, built a fort on its banks
                    opposite Philadelphia. During the early colonial period the region was the scene
                    of many petty struggles arising out of the rival efforts of the Dutch, Swedes,
                    and English to establish trading posts and settlements on the river. The Indians
                    among whom these early settlers were thrown were generally divided into small
                    tribes; but in the valley of the upper Delaware were the principal and most
                    populous seats of the Leni Lenape—known by the English as the Delawares, a name
                    still retained by the remnants of this most interesting and once powerful tribe
                    in their new homes west of the Mississippi. On the whole the early intercourse
                    between the whites and Indians was peaceful, but there were occasional
                    collisions, some of a serious nature, too often brought about by the rapacity
                    and bad faith of the whites. As a rule the title to the Indian lands was
                    purchased, and after the province fell into the hands of the English the general
                    policy pursued was one of humanity and good faith. At the time of the English
                    accession it is estimated that the Indians in New Jersey numbered about
                    2000.</p>
                <p>When Charles II. wrested their North American possessions from the Dutch—in fact
                    before this was accomplished—he granted them in bulk to his brother the duke of
                    York, who in turn granted what is now New Jersey to Lord John Berkeley and Sir
                    George Carteret, the conveyance (June 23, 1664) providing that “the said tract
                    of land is to be called Nova Caesarea, or New Jersey.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In compliment to Sir George Carteret, who had
                    defended the Isle of Jersey against the Long Parliament.</p></note> The royal
                    grant was of the proprietary character, that is, it not only conveyed the
                    absolute estate and title to the land, but also the power to govern and rule,
                    and therefore to establish such laws as “might be thought necessary, provided
                    they were not contrary to but, as near as conveniently might be, agreeable to
                    the laws, statutes, and government of the realm of England.” As all these rights
                    and powers were assignable, the duke transferred to Berkeley and Carteret, not
                    only the lands, but also the power to govern; and they in turn possessed, and
                    finally exercised, the power to assign to others both land and power to govern.
                    A form of government was accordingly established in a “concession and agreement”
                    issued by them. The governor was appointed by the proprietors, and he appointed
                    a council of from six to twelve members; the governor and council united formed
                    the executive. The freeholders of the province elected not less than twelve
                    representatives, who, with the governor and council, composed the general
                    assembly, in whom rested the legislative power, limited only by the terms of the
                    “concession,” especially the article securing entire liberty of conscience. The
                    general assembly established the courts of justice, and took all measures
                    necessary to preserve order and provide for the general defence; they regulated
                    commerce, and determined the time and duration of their own sessions; they
                    possessed the entire power of taxation, and it was required that the executive
                    should neither impose nor suffer to be imposed any tax other than those imposed
                    by the general assembly. The right of petition to the lords proprietors was
                    secured to the freeholders. The first governor was Philip Carteret, a brother of
                    Sir George, who arrived with a number of “adventurers” in August 1665, and
                    established himself at Elizabethtown. Upon the capture of New Amsterdam by the
                    English, their commander, Colonel Nichols, assumed the administration of the
                    entire territory in the name of the duke of York. Ignorant of the grant to
                    Berkeley and Carteret, Nichols at once offered inducements to settlers from New
                    England and Long Island to move into New Jersey, advising them to purchase the
                    Indian titles, and promising immunity from ground rents. In consequence of this
                    promise, which occurred before Carteret’s arrival, serious difficulties
                    afterwards arose.</p>
                <p>The first general assembly met at Elizabeth, May 26, 1668; another session was
                    held during the same year, but none other for seven years thereafter. In 1672
                    New Amsterdam and New Jersey were reconquered by the Dutch, but early in 1673
                    they reverted to England. Doubts arising as to the effect of the reconquest upon
                    the validity of the original grant, the duke of York obtained a new grant from
                    the king, and renewed his own to Berkeley and Carteret. Prior to this renewal
                    the two proprietors had agreed to a division of their interests, and in the new
                    grant the portion assigned to Carteret was the region east of a line drawn
                    from</p>
                <p>Barnegat Creek to the Rancoeus; to Berkeley was assigned the territory west of
                    that line. In 1676, however, the line of separation was changed by the owners,
                    so that it extended from Little Egg Harbour to a point on the Delaware in 40° N.
                    lat.; this remained thereafter the boundary between East and West Jersey.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the reconquest Philip Carteret returned to East Jersey as its
                    governor, and on his arrival in 1674 presented a new charter, less liberal in
                    many respects than the original. Berkeley meanwhile sold West Jersey to a firm
                    of Quakers, who at once proceeded to colonize it, establishing their first
                    settlement at Salem in 1675, and another shortly after at Burlington. For some
                    years great annoyance was experienced both in East and West Jersey from the
                    unjust interference of the governor of New York, and of the duke himself, with
                    their internal affairs; these attempts were always met by a firm and spirited
                    resistance, which eventually triumphed. In 1682, soon after Sir* George
                    Carteret’s death, a society of Quakers under the lead of William Penn,
                    encouraged by their success in West Jersey, purchased from his heirs their righ⅛
                    to East Jersey. It will give some idea of the progress already made to state
                    that at this early period (1682) a smelting furnace and forge were in operation
                    in New Jersey, making good iron, and that contemporary documents show that at
                    the same date there were exported “great plenty of horses, beef, pork,
                    pipe-staves, boards, bread, flour, wheat, barley, rye, Indian corn, butter, and
                    cheese to Barbados, Jamaica, and other adjacent islands, as also to Portugal,
                    Spain, the Canaries, &amp;c.; whale oil, whale fins, beaver, mink, raccoon, and
                    martin furs to England.”</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the 17th century the number of proprietors in the two
                    provinces increased so much as to render good government impracticable in
                    consequence of the discord arising from divergent interests and views. The evil
                    became unendurable, and in 1702, by the general consent of the proprietors and
                    people, the former, white retaining all their property rights, surrendered their
                    right of government to the crown, by whom the two provinces were reunited, and
                    placed under a governor appointed by the sovereign. With him were associated in
                    the government twelve councillors selected by the crown, and twenty-four
                    assemblymen selected by the freeholders. The sessions of the assembly were at
                    the pleasure of the governor, and its acts subject to the double veto of
                    governor and crown. The governor and council organized the courts of law,
                    determined all salaries, and appointed all civil and military officers.</p>
                <p>The population of the two provinces at this period was probably a little more
                    than 15,000. The great majority of the people were Quakers, Presbyterians, and
                    Anabaptists; there were only two Church of England ministers in the province,
                    and their followers were too few and poor to provide churches; nevertheless the
                    Church of England was now made the established church, and its support provided
                    for. Liberty of conscience was permitted to all except Roman Catholics. Quakers
                    were eligible to office. The governor enjoyed the right of presentation to
                    ecclesiastical benefices.</p>
                <p>Lord Cornbury was the first governor appointed under the new arrangement, and the
                    commission and instructions which he received, the chief points of which have
                    just been given, formed the constitution and government of New Jersey until the
                    declaration of independence, except that New York and New Jersey had the same
                    governor until 1738, after which year each had its own governor, and in New
                    Jersey the council became a separate branch of the legislature, the governor no
                    longer participating in the debates. From the beginning of Cornbury’s
                    administration to the Revolution the political history of the province consisted
                    largely of violent contests between the assembly and the governor and his
                    council,—the latter constantly striving to extend the prerogative and curb the
                    power of the people, and the assembly maintaining a bold and able contest in
                    defence of the principles of liberty. Notwithstanding the large proportion of
                    Quakers among its early inhabitants, New Jersey never failed to furnish its just
                    quota of men and money for the various American wars waged in the 18th century,
                    and its contingent bore a most honourable part in the chief military events of
                    that period. For the campaigns of 1711, 1739, 1746, 1747, and 1748 the province
                    supplied a battalion of 500 men. It was during these last campaigns that the
                    name “Jersey Blues,” in vogue since that time, was first applied to the Jersey
                    troops from the colour of their uniform—blue faced with red, grey stockings, and
                    buckskin breeches. They were described at the time as “the likeliest well-set
                    men who ever entered upon a campaign." When the French war of 1754 broke out
                    Jersey again furnished a battalion of 500 men; of these one half were captured
                    by Montcalm at Oswego, after a gallant resistance, and the remainder at the
                    surrender of Fort William Henry. But the province at once made good the losses,
                    and maintained as many as 1000 men in 1758, 1759, and 1760, in which last year
                    its contingent took part in the capture of Montreal. In 1761 and 1762 the
                    contingent was 600 men, and again in 1764 for service against the Indians.</p>

                    meetings of the continental congress preceding and leading to the war of the
                    Bevolutioπ, and from the breaking out of hostilities bore more than its full
                    share of the burdens necessary to bring the war to a successful conclusion. The
                    last provincial assembly was prorogued in December 1775. The provincial
                    congress, elected in accordance with the ordinance of the preceding congress,
                    convened in June 1776, and on the 18th of July assumed the title of the
                    “convention of the <hi rend="italic">State</hi> of New Jersey.” An Act of
                    Assembly of September 1777 substituted the word “State” for the word “Colony” in
                    all cases of writs, commissions, indictments, &amp;c., &amp;c. In the war New
                    Jersey furnished to the “continental line” 10,726 men, besides large numbers of
                    militia, and expended for war purposes, on account of the continental
                    government, §5,342,770. Some very important and interesting operations of the
                    war were conducted within the limits of the State; and from its peculiar
                    position New Jersey suffered more from the evils of the war than any of the
                    thirteen colonies, except perhaps South Carolina. In the whisky insurrection of
                    1794 the State furnished more than 2000 militia, who under Governor Howell
                    formed part of the army in Pennsylvania. In the war of 1812 it furnished nearly
                    7000 militia, and in the Mexican war three companies of regular infantry and a
                    battalion of volunteers. At the breaking out of the civil war of 1861 the number
                    of men in the State available for military duty was 98,806; and during that war
                    New Jersey organized and maintained 37 regiments of infantry, 3 regiments of
                    cavalry, and 5 batteries. The national guard of the State now consists of 48
                    companies of infantry and 2 Gatling gun companies, numbering 3220 officers and
                    men, thoroughly organized, drilled, and equipped for service.</p>
