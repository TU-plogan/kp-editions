                <p><label type="entry">NORTH SEA</label>. The North Sea or German Ocean lies between
                    Great Britain and the continent of Europe. It communicates with the North
                    Atlantic by the Straits of Dover in the south, and by the Pentland Firth and the
                    various openings between the Orkney and Shetland Islands in the north. Between
                    the Shetlands and Norway it passes by a wide opening into the sub-polar basin,
                    now generally known as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Norwegian Sea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.υ.),</hi> of which indeed it may be regarded as a southern
                    extension. It has communication with the Baltic by the Skagerrack and the
                    Cattegat. The shores of the North Sea have from the earliest times been
                    inhabited by brave and hardy races of men famous for their maritime exploits;
                    and at the present day it is surrounded by many of the most prosperous and
                    enterprising commercial nations, and is, in consequence, one of the most
                    important highways of the world. Its fisheries give employment to thousands of
                    persons, and are the most valuable that exist. Lighthouses are situated on
                    nearly every available point where they are required, and there are numerous
                    light-ships along the coasts.</p>
                <p>The North Sea lies between the parallels of 51° and 61° N. lat. and 2° 30' W. and
                    8° E. long., its greatest length being about 600 miles, its breadth (from St
                    Abb’s Head to the shores of Denmark) 360 miles, and its area about 140,000
                    square miles. It may be said to be without islands if we except the Orkneys, the
                    Shetlands, and those islands which are situated along the coasts. Its coasts
                    present considerable variety in appearance and geological formation.
                    Scandinavia, composed of ancient rocks, is elevated, deeply indented by fjords,
                    and skirted with numerous islands. The coasts of Britain are bold and rocky in
                    the north, while towards the south they present a succession of low rocky or
                    chalky cliffs and sandy beaches. Denmark, Germany, Holland, and Belgium have low
                    shores, composed of recent formations, and deeply indented. Many parts of
                    Holland and Belgium are indeed below the level of the sea, and are protected
                    from inundation by artificial dykes and extensive natural sand dunes. The sea
                    has repeatedly broken through these artificial and natural barriers and
                    submerged large tracts of country. The Dollart Zee and the Zuyder Zee were
                    formed in this way in 1277 and 1282. Some of the most important rivers of Europe
                    enter the North Sea, as the Elbe, Weser, Ems, Rhine, Scheldt, Thames, Humber,
                    Tyne, Tweed, Forth, and Tay. If we include the Baltic, which enters into it, we
                    may regard the North Sea as receiving the drainage of about one-fourth of the
                    European continent.</p>
                <p>Its greatest depth is in a deep gully following closely the trend of the southern
                    portion of the Scandinavian peninsula, where soundings of 160, 200, 300, and 400
                    fathoms are common. It has been suggested that this deep gully, which extends
                    into the Skagerrack, may have been the bed of a river at a time when the
                    continent of Europe stood at a higher level, and that the Elbe and some of the
                    other rivers now entering the Baltic and North Sea may have united and flowed
                    into the Norwegian basin of the Atlantic through this depression. With the
                    exception of this gully the depth of the North Sea is less than 100 fathoms. It
                    is to be noticed, however, that the bottom of the whole basin is very irregular.
                    The southern half is the shallower, and, generally speaking, the depths in this
                    portion are greater on the eastern and western sides than in the centre, where
                    the Dogger Bank is situated. On this bank the depth is from 8 to 16 fathoms,
                    whereas in the “Silver Pit” immediately to the south there is a depth of 45
                    fathoms. Similar irregularities are met with in various other parts of this
                    seabed, and are called by the fishermen “pits” and “banks,” with various
                    distinguishing names. In the northern half the depth gradually increases towards
                    the north, until a depth of 2000 fathoms is reached in the Norwegian Sea. It is
                    probable that these irregularities met with in the bottom of the North Sea are
                    chiefly due to the moraines and detrital matter left by the great glacier which
                    filled it during the Glacial period. There are besides a great number of shoals
                    and sandbanks lying along the coasts of Holland, Belgium, France, and Britain,
                    which assume the form of ridges running in a direction nearly parallel to the
                    shores, and consist of sand and detrital matter brought down by rivers and
                    arranged apparently by tide streams. The deposits vary considerably in their
                    composition. In the shallow parts a sand predominates, composed of fragments of
                    quartz, felspars, micas, hornblende, augite, magnetite, and calcareous fragments
                    consisting of triturated pieces of mollusc shells, Echinoderms, Polyzoa,
                    Alcyonarian spicules, calcareous Algae, and many Foraminifera. In the deeper
                    water we generally find a mud or clay composed of the above-mentioned mineral
                    and organic fragments, with the addition of fine argillaceous matter, very
                    minute mineral particles, and Diatom frustules. In some places we have stones
                    and gravel, and indeed stones may be met with in all the varieties of
                    deposit.</p>
                <p>Fogs, mists, and rain occur at all seasons. The winds are variable, the
                    moisture-laden winds from the south-west being the most prevalent, and storms
                    are frequent. The currents depend chiefly upon the direction of the winds, and
                    the navigation is most difficult. The great tidal wave from the Atlantic on
                    reaching the British Islands breaks into two portions, one passing through the
                    Straits of Dover and the other round the north of Scotland into the North Sea.
                    These two portions meeting produce nodal lines, where they partially neutralize
                    each other, for instance in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n613/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0613-0564"/> the Straits of Dover, and less distinctly in
                    lines stretching from the Wash and Moray Firth to the north of Denmark. The
                    North·Sea lies between the January isotherms of 31° and 40°, and the July
                    isotherms of 55° and 65° Fahr., so that the difference between the mean winter
                    and summer temperature is about 24°. The temperature of the surface water ranges
                    in January between 39° and 45° Fahr., and in July between 53° and 63°. Hence the
                    contrast between the temperature of the water and that of the air is greater in
                    winter than in summer, and indeed except during the warmest months the air is
                    colder than the water. In the southern part of the North Sea, south of the
                    Dogger Bank, where the sea is comparatively shallow, there is in summer only a
                    difference of a degree or so between the surface and the bottom water, the
                    bottom water being a little the colder. The difference is greatest in the
                    hollows like the “Silver Pit,” where the depth reaches 45 fathoms. The
                    temperature along the British coast appears to be in summer about 3° colder both
                    at the surface and at the bottom than along the coast of Denmark. We have no
                    very reliable information as to the temperature of the water at different depths
                    during the winter months, but we know it takes a very long time before the
                    cooling of the surface water affects the temperature at the depth of a few
                    fathoms, therefore it is most probable that the water at the bottom in the
                    southern part of the sea is much warmer than the surface or intermediate water,
                    and this is likely to be the case especially in the “pits” where the depth is
                    greatest. This is very probably the chief reason why such large catches of soles
                    and other fish are made in these “pits” during very cold winters.</p>
                <p>North of the Dogger Bank there is a very considerable difference of temperature
                    between the surface and the bottom water in summer. Off Aberdeen there is a
                    difference of • 11°, the surface temperature in summer being 56° Fahr.</p>
                <p>and the bottom 45°, while in the Norwegian gully there is a difference of 17°.
                    Farther north in the Norwegian Sea, at a depth of 300 or 400 fathoms, the water
                    is below » 32° Fahr, all the year round. The specific gravity ranges between l ’
                    0249 and 1Ό270, the saltest water being found at the bottom in the Norwegian
                    gully. The lightest water is found in the Skagerrack where the Baltic water
                    enters the North Sea, and in the southern half of the sea where the Continental
                    rivers discharge their waters.</p>
                <p>The North Sea has an abundant flora. Algae in great abundance and variety grow on
                    all the shores and in all the shallower waters, while a few species are found at
                    depths of even 50 and 100 fathoms. The surface and subsurface waters swarm with
                    Diatoms, Peridinias, Coccospheres, and other minute Algae. It is a matter of
                    observation that where there is a low specific gravity, indicating a mixture of
                    fresh with salt water, there is usually a great abundance of Diatomaceae in the
                    surface waters. This is the case in bays and estuaries, and in the arctic and
                    antarctic regions, where melting ice lowers the specific gravity. The North Sea
                    has all the characteristic features of a great bay, and has a great abundance of
                    plant life. Its surface or intermediate waters are at times quite discoloured by
                    the enormous abundance of Diatoms or Peridinias which are met -with in vast
                    floating banks. The cause of the rapid and great development of these minute
                    organisms at particular times and places appears to depend on physical
                    conditions which are not at present understood. With such a vast food supply it
                    is not surprising that a prolific fauna swarms in the North Sea. Everywhere on
                    the bottom we find Foraminifera, Sponges, Coelenterates, Echinoderms, Worms,
                    Polyzoa, Tunicata, Molluscs, Crustacea, and Fishes. At all depths in the
                    intermediate water we find Protozoa, Medusae, Copepods, Amphipods, Schizopods,
                    Sagitta, and various other pelagic animals, together with a great abundance of
                    the larvae of animals living on the bottom. The invertebrates living on the
                    bottom and in the water at various depths, in their adult as well as in their
                    larval stages, supply food for those fishes which are so much desired for the
                    table. Most valuable food fish, as the cod, haddock, herring, sprat, holibut,
                    sole, coal-fish, and many others, frequent the North Sea, and are captured in
                    great numbers by the fishermen of all the nations occupying the seaboard. There
                    are also important fisheries for crustaceans such as lobsters, crabs, prawns,
                    and shrimps, and for molluscs such as oysters, mussels, whelks, and periwinkles.
                    Whales and porpoises are numerous, and sea-birds are found in vast numbers on
                    the islands along the shores. The annual value of the North Sea fisheries of
                    various kinds is enormous. In a recent lecture the duke of Edinburgh estimated
                    that the labours of British fishermen supplied annually “fish food amounting to
                    about 615,000 tons weight, which at £12 per ton represents a money value of
                    £7,380,000.” By far the larger part of this comes from the North Sea. If we
                    consider that these waters are also fished by Norwegians, Danes, Germans,
                    Dutchmen, Belgians, and Frenchmen, we may form some idea of its fertility. It is
                    very probable that the annual value of all the fisheries exceeds
                    £25,000,000.</p>
                <p>No systematic investigation of the North Sea has yet been undertaken, and in
                    consequence our knowledge is in many respects very meagre. This is all the more
                    astonishing when we remember the value of the fisheries and the enterprise of
                    the nations engaging in them. The Admiralty employed a ship for several seasons
                    to examine the currents and tides; the results are published in the North Sea
                    pilot and admiralty tide tables. The German ship “Pom-merania” was engaged
                    during the year 1872 in examining the North Sea. See <hi rend="italic">Die
