                <p><label type="entry">NEOPLATONISM</label>.— <hi rend="italic">Historical Position
                    and Significance.—</hi> The political history of the ancient world closes with
                    the formation, under Diocletian and Constantine, of a universal state bearing
                    the cast of Oriental as well as Graeco-Roman civilization. The history of
                    ancient philosophy ends in like manner with a universal philosophy which
                    appropriated elements of almost all the earlier systems, and worked up the
                    results of Eastern and Western culture. And, just as the Byzantine Roman empire
                    was at once the supreme effort of the old world and the outcome of its
                    exhaustion, so Neoplatonism is in one aspect the consummation, in another the
                    collapse, of ancient philosophy. Never before in Greek or Roman speculation had
                    the consciousness of man’s dignity and superiority to nature found such adequate
                    expression; and never before had real science and pure knowledge been so
                    undervalued and despised by the leaders of culture as they were by the
                    Neoplatonists. Judged from the standpoint of pure science, or the empirical
                    investigation of the universe, philosophy passed its meridian in Plato and
                    Aristotle, declined in the post-Aristotelian systems, and set in the darkness of
                    Neoplatonism. But, from the religious and moral point of view, it must be
                    affirmed that the ethical “mood” which Neoplatonism endeavoured to create and
                    maintain is the highest and purest ever reached by antiquity. That this
                    attainment should have been made at the expense of science was inevitable. On
                    the level of the polytheistic nature-religions physical science must either
                    subjugate and destroy religion, or be subjugated and destroyed by it. Religion
                    and morality, however, are found to be the stronger forces; and philosophy,
                    standing midway between these and physical science, may waver for a little, but
                    ultimately it yields to the greater power. The conflict with empirical knowledge
                    is rendered inevitable by the fact that within the sphere of nature-religion the
                    ethical is itself, without any misgiving, conceived as a higher order of the
                    natural. The higher “physics”—for as such we must here regard religious
                    ethics—must dislodge the lower, in order to maintain its own ground. Philosophy
                    must cease to exist as science, in order that man’s assertion of the
                    supernatural value of his person and his life may receive full recognition.</p>
                <p>It is a proof of the strength of the moral instincts of mankind that the only
                    phase of culture which we can survey in all its stages from beginning to end
                    culminated, not in materialism, but in the boldest idealism. This idealism,
                    however, is also in its way a mark of intellectual bankruptcy. Contempt for
                    reason and science leads in the end to barbarism,—its necessary consequence
                    being the rudest superstition, and sheer helplessness in the presence of all
                    sorts of delusion. As a matter of fact, barbarism did break out after the flower
                    had fallen from Neoplatonism. The philosophers themselves, no doubt, still lived
                    on the knowledge they repudiated; but the masses were trained to a superstition
                    with which the Christian church, as the executor of Neoplatonism, had to reckon
                    and contend. By a fortunate coincidence, at the very moment when this bankruptcy
                    of the old culture—its reversion to barbarism —must have become apparent, the
                    stage of history was occupied by barbaric peoples, with whom the work of the
                    past thousand years went for nothing. This has obscured the fact, which is
                    nevertheless obvious enough to a keener scrutiny, that the inner history of
                    antiquity, ending as it did in despair of this world, must in any event have
                    seen a recurrence of barbarism. The present world was a thing that men would
                    neither enjoy nor master nor study. A new world was discovered, for the sake of
                    which everything else was abandoned; to make sure of that world insight and
                    intelligence were freely sacrificed; and, in the light that streamed from
                    beyond, the absurdities of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0345-0332"/> present became wisdom, and its wisdom became
                    foolishness.</p>
                <p>Such is Neoplatonism. The pre-Socratic philosophy took its stand on natural
                    science, to the exclusion of ethics and religion. The systems of Plato and
                    Aristotle sought to adjust the rival claims of physics and ethics (although the
                    supremacy of the latter was already acknowledged); but the popular religions
                    were thrown overboard. The post-Aristotelian philosophy in all its branches
                    makes withdrawal from the objective "world its starting point. It might seem,
                    indeed, that Stoicism indicates a falling off from Plato and Aristotle towards
                    materialism, but the ethical dualism, which was the ruling tendency of the Stoa,
                    could not long endure its materialistic physics, and took refuge in the
                    metaphysical dualism of the Platonists. But this originated no permanent
                    philosophical creation. From one-sided Platonism issued the various forms of
                    scepticism, the attempt to undermine the trustworthiness of empirical knowledge.
                    Neoplatonism, coming last, has borrowed something from all the schools. First,
                    it stands in the line of post-Aristotelian systems; it is, in fact, as a
                    subjective philosophy, their logical completion. Secondly, it is founded on
                    scepticism; for it has neither interest in, nor reliance upon, empirical
                    knowledge. Thirdly, it can justly claim the honour of Plato’s name, since it
                    expressly goes back to him for its metaphysics, directly combating those of the
                    Stoa. Yet even on this point it has learned something from the Stoics; the
                    Neoplatonic conception of the action of the Deity on the world and of the
                    essence and origin of matter can only be explained by reference to the dynamic
                    pantheism of the Stoa. Fourthly, the study of Aristotle also exercised an
                    influence on Neoplatonism. This appears, not only in its philosophical method,
                    but also—though less prominently—in its metaphysic. And, fifthly, Neoplatonism
                    adopted the ethics of Stoicism; although it was found necessary to supplement
                    them by a still higher conception of the functions of the spirit.</p>
                <p>Thus, with the exception of Epicureanism—which was always treated as the mortal
                    enemy of Neoplatonism— there is no outstanding earlier system which did not
                    contribute something to the new philosophy. And yet Neoplatonism cannot be
                    described as an eclectic system, in the ordinary sense of the word. For, in the
                    first place, it is dominated by one all-pervading interest—the religious; and in
                    the second place, it has introduced a new first principle into philosophy, viz.,
                    the supra-rational, that which lies beyond reason and beyond reality. This
                    principle is not to be identified with the “idea” of Plato or the “form” of
                    Aristotle. For, as Zeller rightly says, “in Plato and Aristotle the distinction
                    of the sensible from the intelligible is the strongest affirmation of the
                    validity of the thinking process. It is only sense perception, and the existence
                    perceived by the senses, whose relative unreality is presupposed; of a higher
                    region of spiritual life, lying beyond the notion and beyond thought, there is
                    no hint. In Neoplatonism, on the contrary, it is precisely this ‘ supra-rational
                    ’ which is held to be the final goal of all effort and the ultimate ground of
                    all being. Rational cognition is only an intermediate stage between sense
                    perception and supra-rational intuition; the forms of the intellect are not the
                    highest and ultimate reality, but only the channels through which the activity
                    of the formless primeval being flows into the world. This theory, therefore,
                    proceeds, not merely on the denial of the reality of sensible existence and
                    sensible presentations, but upon absolute doubt—a straining after something
                    behind the sum total of reality. The highest intelligible is not that which
                    constitutes the actual contents of reason, but simply what man postulates and
                    reaches after as the unknowable ground of his thought.” Neoplatonism perceived
                    that neither sense perception nor rational cognition is a sufficient basis or
                    justification for religious ethics; consequently it broke away from
                    rationalistic ethics as decidedly as from utilitarian morality. But, just
                    because it renounced perception and reason, it had to find out a new world and a
                    new spiritual function, in order first to establish the existence of what it
                    desiderated, and then to realize and describe what it had proved to exist. Man,
                    however, cannot add to his psychological endowment. He is hemmed in by walls of
                    iron; and, if he will not allow his thought to be determined by experience, he
                    falls a victim to his imagination. In other words, thought, which will not stop,
                    takes to mythology; and in the place of reason we have superstition. A dumb
                    astonishment in the presence of the incomprehensible passes for the highest aim
                    of mental activity; artificially excited ecstasies are prized above all the
                    conscious acts of the spirit. Still, as we cannot allow every fancy of the
                    subjective reason to assert itself, we require some new and potent principle to
                    keep the imagination within bounds. This is found in the authority of a sound
                    tradition. Such authority must be superhuman, otherwise it can have no claim on
                    our respect; it must, therefore, be divine. The highest sphere of knowledge—the
                    supra-rational—as well as the very possibility of knowledge, must depend on
                    divine communications,—that is, on revelations. In one word, philosophy as
                    represented by Neoplatonism, its sole interest being a religious interest, and
                    its highest object the supra-rational, must be a philosophy of revelation. This
                    is not a prominent feature in Plotinus or his immediate disciples, who still
                    exhibit full confidence in the subjective presuppositions of their philosophy.
                    But the later adherents of the school did not possess this confidence;<note

                    this was before he became a pupil of Plotinus; as a philosopher he was
                    independent of the <hi rend="italic">λόγια.</hi></p></note> they based their
                    philosophy on revelations of the Deity, and they found these in the religious
                    traditions and rites of all nations. The Stoics had taught them to overstep the
                    political boundaries of states and nationalities, and rise from the Hellenic to
                    a universal human consciousness. Through all history the spirit of God has
                    breathed; everywhere we discover the traces of His revelation. The older any
                    religious tradition or mode of worship is the more venerable is it, the richer
                    in divine ideas. Hence the ancient religions of the East had a peculiar interest
                    for the Neoplatonist. In the interpretation of myths Neoplatonism followed the
                    allegorical method, as practised especially by the Stoa; but the importance it
                    attached to the spiritualized myths was unknown to the Stoic philosophers. The
                    lattei’ interpreted the myths and were done with them; the later Neoplatonists
                    treated them as the proper material and the secure foundation of philosophy.
                    Neoplatonism claimed to be not merely the absolute philosophy, the keystone of
                    all previous systems, but also the absolute religion, reinvigorating and
                    transforming all previous religions. It contemplated a restoration of all the
                    religions of antiquity, by allowing each to retain its traditional forms, and at
                    the same time making each a vehicle for the religious attitude and the religious
                    truth embraced in Neoplatonism; while every form of ritual was to become a
                    stepping-stone to a high morality worthy of mankind. In short, Neoplatonism
                    seizes on the aspiration of the human soul after a higher life, and treats this
                    psychological fact as the key to the interpretation of the universe. Hence the
                    existing religions, after being refined and spiritualized, were made the basis
                    of philosophy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n346/mode/1up"

                <p>Neoplatonism thus represents a stage in the history of religion; indeed this is
                    precisely where its historical importance lies. In the progress of science and
                    enlightenment it has no positive significance, except as a necessary transition
                    which the race had to make in order to get rid of nature-religion, and that
                    undervaluing of the spiritual life which formed an insuperable obstacle to the
                    advance of human knowledge. Neoplatonism, however, failed as signally in its
                    religious enterprise as it did in its philosophical. While seeking to perfect
                    ancient philosophy, it really extinguished it; and in like manner its attempted
                    reconstruction of ancient religions only resulted in their destruction. For in
                    requiring these religions to impart certain prescribed religious truths, and to
                    inculcate the highest moral tone, it burdened them with problems to which they
                    were unequal, and under whose weight they were crushed. And further, by inviting
                    them to loosen, though not exactly to dissolve, their political allegiance— the
                    very thing that gave them stability—it removed the foundation on which they
                    rested. But might it not then have placed them on a broader and firmer
                    foundation? Was not the universal empire of Rome ready at hand, and might not
                    the new religion have stood to it in the same relation of dependence which the
                    earlier religions had held to the smaller nations and states <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi> So one might imagine, but in truth it was no longer possible. It is true
                    that the political and spiritual histories of the peoples on the Mediterranean
                    run in parallel lines, the one leading up to the universal monarchy of Rome, the
                    other leading up to monotheism and universal human morality. But the spiritual
                    development had shot far ahead of the political; even the Stoa occupied a height
                    far beyond the reach of anything in the political sphere. It is also true that
                    Neoplatonism sought to come to an understanding with the Byzantine Roman empire;
                    the noble Julian perished in the pursuit of this project. But even before his
                    day the shrewder Neoplatonists had seen that their lofty religious philosophy
                    could not stoop to an alliance with the despotic world-empire, because it could
                    not come in contact with the world at all. To Neoplatonism political affairs are
                    at bottom as indifferent as all other earthly things. The idealism of the new
                    philosophy was too heavenly to be naturalized in a degenerate, tyrannical, and
                    effete institution like the Byzantine empire, which stood more in need of
                    despotic and unscrupulous police officials than of high-minded philosophers.
                    Important and instructive, therefore, as are the attempts made from time to time
                    by the state and by individual philosophers to unite Neoplatonism and the
                    universal monarchy, their failure was a foregone conclusion.</p>
                <p>There is one other question which we are called upon to raise here. Why did not
                    Neoplatonism set up an independent religious community? It had entirely
                    remodelled the ancient religions, with a view to their restoration; it had tried
                    to fill the old unsophisticated worships with profound philosophical ideas, and
                    to make them the exponents of pure morality; why did it not address itself, in
                    the last resort, to the creation of a religious society of its own? Why did it
                    not provide for its mixed multitude of divinities by founding a church, destined
                    to embrace all mankind, in which all the gods of all nations might be worshipped
                    along with the one ineffable Deity? Why not! The answer to this question
                    involves the answer to another—Why was Neoplatonism defeated by Christianity?
                    Three essentials of a permanent religious foundation were wanting in
                    Neoplatonism; they are admirably indicated in Augustine’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessions</hi> (vii. 18-21). First, and chiefly, it wanted a religious
                    founder; second, it could not tell how the state of inward peace and blessedness
                    could become permanent; third, it had no means to win those who were not endowed
                    with the speculative faculty. The philosophical discipline which it recommended
                    for the attainment of the highest good was beyond the reach of the masses; and
                    the way by which the masses could attain the highest good was a secret unknown
                    to Neoplatonism. Thus it remained a school for the “wise and prudent”; and when
                    Julian tried to enlist the sympathies of the common rude man for the doctrines
                    and worship of this school, he was met with scorn and ridicule.</p>
                <p>It is not as a philosophy, then, nor as a new religion, that Neoplatonism became
                    a decisive factor in history, but, if one may use the expression, as a “mood.”
                    The instinctive certainty that there is a supreme good, lying beyond empirical
                    experience, and yet not an intellectual good,—this feeling, and the accompanying
                    conviction of the utter vanity of all earthly things, were produced and
                    sustained by Neoplatonism. Only, it could not describe the nature of this
                    highest good; and therefore it had to abandon itself to imagination and
                    aesthetic impressions. It was driven to explore “mysterious inward paths,” which
                    after all led nowhere. It changed thought into an emotional dream; it plunged
                    into the ocean of sentiment; it treated the old world of fable as the reflexion
                    of a higher reality, and transformed reality into poetry; and after all these
                    expedients, to borrow a phrase of Augustine’s, it only saw afar off the land of
                    its desire. It dashed this world in pieces, and then had nothing left but an
                    indescribable “something,”—a faint glimmer from some world beyond.</p>
                <p>And yet the influence of Neoplatonism on the history of our ethical culture has
                    been, and still is, immeasurable, —not merely because it has refined and
                    strengthened our emotions and susceptibilities, nor merely because it wove the
                    fine veil with which all of us, whether religious or irreligious, cover the
                    Gorgon face of brute reality, but above all because it begot the consciousness
                    that the only blessedness which can satisfy the heart must be sought higher even
                    than the sphere of reason. That man shall not live by bread alone, the world had
                    learned before Neoplatonism; but Neoplatonism has enforced the deeper truth—a
                    truth which the older philosophy had missed— that man shall not live by
                    knowledge alone. And, besides the propaedeutic importance which thus belongs to
                    it, another fact has to be taken into account in estimating the influence of
                    Neoplatonism. It is to this day the nursery of that whole type of devotion which
                    affects renunciation of the world, which strives after an ideal, without the
                    strength to rise above aesthetic impressions, and is never able to form a clear
                    conception of the object of its own aspiration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Origin.—</hi> As forerunners of Neoplatonism we may regard, on
                    the one hand, those Stoics who accepted the Platonic distinction between the
                    sensible world and the intelligible, and, on the other hand, the so-called
                    Neopythagoreans and religious philosophers like Plutarch of Chaeronea and
                    especially Numenius of Apamea. But these cannot be considered the actual
                    progenitors of Neoplatonism; their philosophic method is quite elementary as
                    compared with the Neoplatonic, their fundamental principles are uncertain, and
                    unbounded deference is still paid to the authority of Plato. The Jewish and
                    Christian thinkers of the first two centuries approach considerably nearer than
                    Numenius to the later Neoplatonism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    revelation that the divine Supreme Being is “supra-rational,” that He can be
                    reached only through “ecstasy,” and that the oracles of God supply the material
                    of moral and religious knowledge. The religious ethics of Philo—a compound of
                    Stoic, Platonic, and Neopythagorean elements—already bear the peculiar stamp
                    which we recognize in Neoplatonism. While his system assigns the supremacy to
                    Greek philosophy over the national religion of Israel, it exacts from the
                    former, as a sort of tribute to the latter, the recognition of the elevation of
                    God above the province of reason. The claim of positive religion to be something
                    more than the intellectual apprehension of the reason in the universe is thus
                    acknowledged. Religious syncretism is also a feature of Philo’s system, but it
                    differs essentially from what we find in later Neoplatonism. For Philo pays no
                    respect to any cultus except the Jewish; and he believed that all the fragments
                    of truth to be found amongst Greeks and Romans had been borrowed from the books
                    of Moses. The earliest Christian philosophers, particularly Justin and
                    Athenagoras, likewise prepared the way for the speculations of the
                    Neoplatonists,—partly by their attempts to connect Christianity with Stoicism
                    and Platonism, partly by their ambition to exhibit. Christianity as
                    “hyper-platonic.” In the introduction to his <hi rend="italic">Dialogue with
                    Trypho,</hi> Justin follows a method which bears a striking resemblance to the
                    later method of Neoplatonism: he seeks to base the Christian knowledge of
                    God—that is, the knowledge of the truth—on Platonism, Scepticism, and
                    “Revelation.” A still more remarkable parallel to the later Neoplatonism is
                    afforded by the Christian Gnostics of Alexandria, especially Valentinus and the
                    followers of Basilides.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Basilidians believed, not in an emanation from the Godhead, but in a dynamic
                    manifestation of its activity. The same is true of Valentinus, who also placed
                    an unnameable being at the apex of his system, and regarded matter, not as a
                    second principle, but as a product of the one divine principle. It must be added
                    that the dependence of Basilides and Valentinus on Zeno and Plato is beyond
                    dispute. But the method observed by these Gnostics in thinking out the plan and
                    the history of the universe is by no means thoroughgoing. Ancient myths are
                    admitted without undergoing analysis; the most naive realism alternates with
                    daring efforts at spiritualizing. Philosophically considered, therefore, the
                    Gnostic systems are very unlike the rigorous self-consistency of Neoplatonism;
                    although they certainly contain almost all the elements which enter into the
                    Neoplatonic theory of the universe.</p>
                <p>But were the oldest Neoplatonists really acquainted with the speculations of
                    Philo, or Justin, or Valentinus, or Basilides? Did they know the Oriental
                    religions, Judaism and Christianity in particular? And, if so, did they really
                    derive anything from these sources?</p>
                <p>To these questions we cannot, unfortunately, give decided, still less definite
                    and precise, answers. Since Neoplatonism originated in Alexandria, where
                    Oriental modes of worship were accessible to every one, and since the Jewish
                    philosophy had also taken its place in the literary circles of Alexandria, we
                    may safely assume that even the earliest of the Neoplatonists possessed an
                    acquaintance with Judaism and Christianity. But if we search Plotinus for
                    evidence of any actual influence of</p>
                <p>Jewish and Christian philosophy, we search in vain; and the existence of any such
                    influence is all the more unlikely because it is only the later Neoplatonism
                    that offers striking and deep-rooted parallels to Philo and the Gnostics. The
                    Philonic and Gnostic philosophies thus appear to be merely an historical
                    anticipation of the Neoplatonic, without any real connexion. Nor is there
                    anything mysterious in such an anticipation. It simply means that a certain
                    religious and philosophical tendency, which grew up slowly on Greek soil, was
                    already implanted in those who occupied the vantage-ground of a revealed
                    religion of redemption. We have to come down to Iamblichus and his school before
                    we find complete correspondence with the Christian Gnosticism of the 2d century;
                    that is to say, it is only in the 4th century that Greek philosophy in its
                    proper development reaches the stage at which certain Greek philosophers who had
                    embraced Christianity had arrived in the 2d century. The influence of
                    Christianity— whether Gnostic or Catholic—on Neoplatonism was at no time very
                    considerable, although individual Neoplatonists, after Amelius, used Christian
                    texts as oracles, and put on record their admiration for Christ.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Doctrines.—</hi> The founder of the Neoplatonic
                    school in Alexandria is supposed to have been Ammonius Saccas (oδ. <hi

                    been a Christian by birth, and to have relapsed to heathenism. As he has left no
                    written works behind him, it is impossible to criticize his teaching. He
                    communicated to his pupils an admiration for Plato, and set them to work at the
                    reconciliation of Plato and Aristotle. The most distinguished of his disciples
                    were Origen the Christian, another Origen—a heathen, Longinus, Herennius, and,
                    the greatest of all, Plotinus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Born at Lycopolis, in Egypt, in 205, Plotinus laboured from
                    244 onwards in Rome, where he gained many followers and admirers, amongst others
                    the emperor Gallienus and his consort, and died in Lower Italy in 270. The
                    writings of Plotinus were arranged by his pupil Porphyry, and published in six
                    <hi rend="italic">Enneads.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Enneads</hi> of Plotinus are the primary and classical
                    document of Neoplatonism. The doctrine of Plotinus is mysticism, and like all
                    mysticism it consists of two main divisions. The first or theoretical part deals
                    with the high origin of the human soul, and shows how it has departed from its
                    first estate. In the second or practical part the way is pointed out by which
                    the soul may again return to the Eternal and Supreme. Since the soul in its
                    longings reaches forth beyond all sensible things, beyond the world of ideas
                    even, it follows that the highest being must be something supra-rational. The
                    system thus embraces three heads—(1) the primeval Being, (2) the ideal world and
                    the soul, (3) the phenomenal world. We may also, however, in accordance with the
                    views of Plotinus, divide thus:—(A) the invisible world—(1) the primeval Being,
                    (2) the ideal world, (3) the soul; (B) the phenomenal world.</p>
                <p>The primeval Being is, as opposed to the many, the One; as opposed to the finite,
                    the Infinite, the unlimited. It is the source of all life, and therefore
                    absolute causality and the only real existence. It is, moreover, the Good, in so
                    far as all finite things have their purpose in it, and ought to flow back to it.
                    But one cannot attach moral attributes to the original Being itself, because
                    these would imply limitation. It has no attributes of any kind; it is being
                    without magnitude, without life, without thought; in strict propriety, indeed,
                    we ought not to speak of it as existing; it is “above existence,” “above
                    goodness.” It is also active force without a substratum; as active force the
                    primeval Being is perpetually producing something else, without alteration, or
                    motion, or diminution of itself. This production is not a physical process, but
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n349/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0349-0336"/> an emission of force; and, since the product has
                    real existence only in virtue of the original existence working in it,
                    Neoplatonism may be described as a species of dynamic pantheism. Directly or
                    indirectly, everything is brought forth by the “One.” In it all things, so far
                    as they have being, are divine, and God is all in all. Derived existence,
                    however, is not like the original Being itself, but is subject to a law of
                    diminishing completeness. It is indeed an image and reflexion of the first
                    Being; but the further the line of successive projections is prolonged the
                    smaller is its share in the true existence. The totality of being may thus be
                    conceived as a series of concentric circles, fading away towards the verge of
                    non-existence, the force of the original Being in the outermost circle being a
                    vanishing quantity. Each lower stage of being is united with the “One” by all
                    the higher stages, and receives its share of reality only by transmission
                    through them. All derived existence, however, has a drift towards, a longing
                    for, the higher, and bends towards it so far as its nature will permit.</p>
                <p>The original Being first of all throws out the nous, which is a perfect image of
                    the One, and the archetype of all existing things. It is at once being and
                    thought, ideal world and idea,. As image, the nous corresponds perfectly to the
                    One, but as derived it is entirely different. What Plotinus understands by the
                    nous is the highest sphere accessible to the human mind <hi rend="italic"
                    >(κόσμος νοητός),</hi> and, along with that, pure thought itself.</p>
                <p>The image and product of the motionless nous is the soul, which, according to
                    Plotinus is, like the nous, immaterial. Its relation to the nous is the same as
                    that of the nous to the One. It stands between the nous and the phenomenal
                    world, is permeated and illuminated by the former, but is also in contact with
                    the latter. The nous is indivisible; the soul <hi rend="italic">may</hi>
                    preserve its unity and remain in the nous, but at the same time it has the power
                    of uniting with the corporeal world, and thus being disintegrated. It therefore
                    occupies an intermediate position. As a single soul (world-soul) it belongs in
                    essence and destination to the intelligible world; but it also embraces
                    innumerable individual souls; and these can either submit to be ruled by the
                    nous, or turn aside to the sensual, and lose themselves in the finite.</p>
                <p>Then the soul, a moving essence, generates the corporeal or phenomenal world.
                    This world ought to be so pervaded by the soul that its various parts should
                    remain in perfect harmony. Plotinus is no dualist, like the Christian Gnostics;
                    he admires the beauty and splendour of the world. So long as idea governs
                    matter, or the soul governs the body, the world is fair and good. It is an
                    image—though a shadowy image—of the upper world, and the degrees of better and
                    worse in it are essential to the harmony of the whole. But in the actual
                    phenomenal world unity and harmony are replaced by strife and discord; the
                    result is a conflict, a becoming and vanishing, an illusive existence. And the
                    reason for this state of things is that bodies rest on a substratum of matter.
                    Matter is the basework of each (το <hi rend="italic">βάθος ίκάστον ή</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vλη);</hi> it is the dark principle, the indeterminate, that which
                    has no qualities, the <hi rend="italic">μη ov.</hi> Destitute of form and idea,
                    it is evil; as capable of form it is neutral.</p>
                <p>The human souls which have descended into corporeality are those which have
                    allowed themselves to be ensnared by sensuality and overpowered by lust. They
                    now seek to cut themselves loose from their true being; and, striving after
                    independence, they assume a false existence. They must turn back from this; and,
                    since they have not lost their freedom, a conversion is still possible.</p>
                <p>Here, then, we enter upon the practical philosophy. Along the same road by which
                    it descended the soul must retrace its steps back to the supreme Good. It must
                    first of all return to itself. This is accomplished by the practice of virtue,
                    which aims at likeness to God, and leads up to God. In the ethics of Plotinus
                    all the older schemes of virtue are taken over, and arranged in a graduated
                    series. The lowest stage is that of the civil virtues, then follow the
                    purifying, and last of all the divine virtues. The civil virtues merely adorn
                    the life, without elevating the soul. That is the office of the purifying
                    virtues, by which the soul is freed from sensuality, and led back to itself, and
                    thence to the nous. By meansof ascetic observances the man becomes once more a
                    spiritual and enduring being, free from all sin. But there is still a higher
                    attainment; it is not enough to be sinless, one must become “God.” This is
                    reached through contemplation of the primeval Being, the One; or, in other
                    words, through an ecstatic approach to it. Thought cannot attain to this, for
                    thought reaches only to the nous, and is itself a kind of motion. Thought is a
                    mere preliminary to communion with God. It is only in a state of perfect
                    passivity and repose that the soul can recognize and touch the primeval Being.
                    Hence in order to this highest attainment the soul must pass through a spiritual
                    curriculum. Beginning with the contemplation of corporeal things in their
                    multiplicity and harmony, it then retires upon itself and withdraws into the
                    depths of its own being, rising thence to the nous, the world of ideas. But even
                    there it does not find the Highest, the One; it still hears a voice saying, “not
                    we have made ourselves.” The last stage is reached when, in the highest tension
                    and concentration, beholding in silence and utter forgetfulness of all things,
                    it is able as it were to lose itself. Then it may see God, the fountain of life,
                    the source of being, the origin of all good, the root of the soul. In that
                    moment it enjoys the highest indescribable bliss; it is as it were swallowed up
                    of divinity, bathed in the light of eternity.<note anchored="true"

                    during the six years of their intercourse Plotinus attained to this ecstatic
                    union with God.</p></note></p>
                <p>Such is the religious philosophy of Plotinus, and for himself personally it
                    sufficed, without the aid of the popular religion or worship. Nevertheless he
                    sought for points of support in these. God is certainly in the truest sense
                    nothing but the primeval Being; but He reveals Himself in a variety of
                    emanations and manifestations. The nous is a sort of second god, the λόγοι which
                    are wrapped up in it are gods, the stars are gods, and so on. A rigid monotheism
                    appeared to Plotinus a miserable conception. He gave a meaning to the myths of
                    the popular religions, and he had something to say even for magic, soothsaying,
                    and prayer. In support of imageworship he advanced arguments which -were
                    afterwards adopted by the Christian image-worshippers. Still, as compared with
                    the later Neoplatonists, he is comparatively free from crass superstition and
                    wild fanaticism. He is not to be classed amongst the “deceived deceivers,” and
                    the restoration of the worship of the old gods was by no means his chief
                    object.</p>

                    the teaching of Plotinus on certain points; and he also put some value on the

                    thinker, but he was a solid and diligent student, distinguished by great
                    learning, by a turn for keen historical and philological criticism, and by an
                    earnest purpose to disseminate the true philosophy of life, to uproot false
                    teaching—especially Christianity, to ennoble men and train them to goodness.
                    That a spirit so free and noble yielded itself up wholly to the philosophy of
                    Plotinus and polytheistic mysticism shows how irresistible was the tendency of
                    the age, and means also that the age had no better thing to offer than religious
                    mysticism. The system of Porphyry is distinguished from that of Plotinus by
                    being still more emphatically practical and religious. The object of philosophy,
                    according to Porphyry, is the salvation of the soul. The origin and the blame of
                    evil are not in the body, but in the desires of the soul. Hence the strictest
                    asceticism (abstinence from flesh, and wine, and sexual intercourse) is
                    demanded, as well as the knowledge of God. As he advanced in life, Porphyry
                    protested more and more earnestly against the rude faith of the common people
                    and their immoral worships. “The ordinary conceptions of God are such that it is
                    more impious to share them than it is to slight the images of the gods.” But,
                    outspoken as he was in his criticism of the popular religions, he had no wish to
                    give them up. He stood up for a pure worship of the many gods, and maintained
                    the cause of every old national religion and the ceremonial duties of its
                    adherents. His work <hi rend="italic">Against the Christians</hi> was directed,
                    not against Christ, nor even against what he believed to be Christ’s teaching,
                    but against the Christians of his own day and their sacred books, which,
                    according to Porphyry, were the work of deceivers and ignorant people. In his
                    trenchant criticism of the origin of what passed for Christianity in his time,
                    he spoke bitter and severe truths, which have gained for him the reputation of
                    the most rabid and wicked of all the enemies of Christianity. His work was

                    which we find in Lactantius, Augustine, Jerome, Macarius Magnus, and others are
                    sufficient to show how profoundly Porphyry had studied the Christian writings,
                    and how great was his talent for real historical research.</p>
                <p>Porphyry marks the transition to a new phase of Neoplatonism, in which it becomes
                    completely subservient to polytheism, and seeks before everything else to
                    protect the Greek and Oriental religions from the formidable assault of
                    Christianity. In the hands of <hi rend="smallcaps">Iamblichus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.υ.),</hi> the pupil of Porphyry <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi>
                    330), Neoplatonism is changed “from a philosophical theory to a theological
                    doctrine.” The distinctive tenets of Iamblichus cannot be accounted for from
                    scientific but only from practical considerations. In order to justify
                    superstition and the ancient forms of worship, philosophy becomes in his hands a
                    theurgy, a knowledge of mysteries, a sort of spiritualism. To this period also
                    belongs a set of “philosophers,” with regard to whom it is impossible to say
                    whether they are dupes or impostors—the “decepti deceptores” of whom Augustine
                    speaks. In this philosophy the mystical properties of numbers are a leading
                    feature; absurd and mechanical notions are glossed over with the sheen of
                    sacramental mystery; myths are explained by pious fancies and fine-sounding
                    pietistic reflexions; miracles, even the most ridiculous, are believed in, and
                    miracles are wrought. The “philosopher” has become a priest of magic, and
                    philosophy a method of incantation. Moreover, in the unbridled exercise of
                    speculation, the number of divine beings was increased indefinitely; and these
                    fantastic accessions to Olympus in the system of Iamblichus show that Greek
                    philosophy is returning to mythology, and that naturereligion is still a power
                    in the world. And yet it is undeniable that the very noblest and choicest minds
                    of the 4th century are to be found in the ranks of the Neoplatonists. So great
                    was the general decline that this Neoplatonic philosophy offered a welcome
                    shelter to many earnest and influential men, in spite of the charlatans and
                    hypocrites who were gathered under the same roof. On certain points of doctrine,
                    too, the dogmatic of Iamblichus indicates a real advance. Thus his emphatic
                    assertion of the truth that the seat of evil is in the will is noteworthy; and
                    so also is his repudiation of Plotinus’s theory of the divinity of the soul.</p>
                <p>The numerous followers of Iamblichus (Aedesius, Chrysanthius, Eusebius, Priscus,
                    Sopater, Sallust, and, most famous of all, Maximus) rendered little service to
                    speculation. Some of them (Themistius in particular) are known as commentators
                    on the older philosophers, and others as the missionaries of mysticism. The work
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Mysteriis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aegyptiorum</hi> is the best sample of the views and aims of these
                    philosophers. Their hopes rose high when their protégé, the enthusiastic,
                    noble-minded, but mentally ill-balanced Julian, ascended the imperial throne
                    (361-363). But the emperor himself lived long enough to see that his romantic
                    policy of restoration was to leave no results; and after his early death all
                    hope of extinguishing Christianity was abandoned.</p>
                <p>But undoubtedly the victory of the church in the age of Valentinian and
                    Theodosius had a purifying influence on Neoplatonism. During the struggle for
                    supremacy, the philosophers had been driven to make common cause with everything
                    that was hostile to Christianity. But now Neoplatonism was thrust from the great
                    stage of history. The church and church theology, to whose guidance the masses
                    now surrendered themselves, took in along with them their superstition, their
                    polytheism, their magic, their myths, and all the machinery of religious
                    witchcraft. The more all this settled and established itself—certainly not
                    without opposition—in the church the purer did Neoplatonism become. While
                    maintaining intact its religious attitude and its theory of knowledge, it
                    returned with new zest to scientific studies, especially the study of the old
                    philosophers. If Plato still remains the divine philosopher, yet we can perceive
                    that after the year 400 the writings of Aristotle are increasingly read and
                    valued. In the chief cities of the empire Neoplatonic schools flourished till
                    the beginning of the 5th century; during this period, indeed, they were the
                    training-schools of Christian theologians. At Alexandria the noble Hypatia
                    taught, to whose memory her impassioned disciple Synesius, afterwards a bishop,
                    has reared a splendid monument. But after the beginning of the 5th century the
                    fanaticism of the church could no longer endure the presence of “heathenism.”
                    The murder of Hypatia was the death of philosophy in Alexandria, although the
                    school there maintained a lingering existence till the middle of the 6th
                    century. But there was one city of the East which, lying apart from the crowded
                    highways of the world, had sunk to a mere provincial town, and yet possessed
                    associations which the church of the 5th century felt herself powerless to
                    eradicate. In Athens a Neoplatonic school still flourished. There, under the
                    monuments of its glorious past, Hellenism found its last retreat. The school of
                    Athens returned to a stricter philosophical method and the cultivation of
                    scholarship. Still holding by a religious philosophy, it undertook to reduce the
                    whole Greek tradition, as seen in the light of Plotinus, to a comprehensive and
                    closely knit system. Hence the philosophy which <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0351-0338"/> arose at Athens was what may fairly be termed
                    scholasticism. For every philosophy is scholastic whose subjectmatter is
                    imaginative and mystical, and which handles this subject-matter according to
                    established rules in logical categories and distinctions. Now to these
                    Neoplatonists, the books of Plato, along with certain divine oracles, the Orphic
                    poems, and much more which they assigned to a remote antiquity, were documents
                    of canonical authority; they were inspired divine writings. Out of these they
                    drew the material of their philosophy, which they then proceeded to elaborate
                    with the appliances of dialectic.</p>
                <p>The most distinguished teachers at Athens were Plutarch <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ob.</hi> 433), his disciple Syrianus (who did important work as a commentator
                    on Plato and Aristotle, and further deserves mention for his vigorous defence of
                    the freedom of the will), but above all Proclus (411-485). Proclus is the great
                    schoolman of Neoplatonism. It was he who, combining religious ardour with formal
                    acuteness, connected the whole mass of traditional lore into a huge system,
                    making good defects, and smoothing away contradictions by means of distinctions
                    and speculations. “It was reserved for Proclus,” says Zeller, “to bring the
                    Neoplatonic philosophy to its formal conclusion by the rigorous consistency of
                    his dialectic, and, keeping in view all the modifications which it had undergone
                    in the course of two centuries, to give it that form in which it was transferred
                    to Christianity and Mohammedanism in the Middle Ages.” Forty-four years after
                    the death of Proclus the school of Athens was closed by Justinian (529 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.);</hi> but it had fulfilled its mission in the work of
                    Proclus, and might with advantage retire from the scene. It had nothing new to
                    say; it was ripe for the grave, and an honourable burial awaited it. The works
                    of Proclus, as the last testament of Hellenism to the church and the Middle
                    Ages, exerted an incalculable influence on the next thousand years. They not
                    only formed one of the bridges by which the mediaeval thinkers got back to Plato
                    and Aristotle; they determined the scientific method of thirty generations, and
                    they partly created and partly nourished the Christian mysticism of the Middle
                    Ages, both in the East and in the West.</p>
                <p>The disciples of Proclus are not eminent (Marinus, Asclepiodotus, Ammonius,
                    Zenodotus, Isidorus, Hegias, Damascius). The last president of the Athenian
                    school was Damascius. When Justinian issued the edict for the suppression of the
                    school, Damascius along with Simplicius (the painstaking commentator of
                    Aristotle) and five other Neoplatonists set out for Persia. They were under the
                    delusion that Persia was the land of the East, the home of wisdom,
                    righteousness, and devotion. In a few years they came back to the Byzantine
                    empire, sadder and wiser men.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the 6th century Neoplatonism had ceased to exist in the East
                    as an independent philosophy. Almost at the same time, however—and the
                    coincidence is not accidental—it made new conquests in the church theology
                    through the writings of the pseudo-Dionysius. It began to bear fruit in
                    Christian mysticism, and to diffuse a new magical leaven through the worship of
                    the church.</p>
                <p>In the West, where philosophical efforts of any kind had been very rare since the
                    2d century, and where mystical contemplation did not meet with the necessary
                    conditions, Neoplatonism found a congenial soil only in isolated individuals. We
                    know that the rhetorician Marius Victorinus (c. 350) translated certain works of
                    Plotinus, and that his translation had a decisive influence on the spiritual
                    history of Augustine. It may be said that Neoplatonism influenced the West only
                    through the medium of the church theology, or, in some instances, under that
                    disguise. Even Boetius (it may now be considered certain) was a catholic
                    Christian, although his whole mode of thought was certainly Neoplatonic. His
                    violent death in the year 525 marks the end of independent philosophy in the
                    West. But indeed this last of the Roman philosophers stood quite alone in his
                    century, and the philosophy for which he lived was neither original, nor
                    well-grounded, nor methodically developed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Neoplatonism, and the Theology of the Church.—</hi> The
                    question as to the influence of Neoplatonism on the development of Christianity
                    is not easily answered, because it is scarcely possible to get a complete view
                    of their mutual relations. The answer will depend, in the first instance, upon
                    how much is included under the term “Neoplatonism.” If Neoplatonism is
                    understood in the widest sense, as the highest and fittest expression of the
                    religious movements at work in the Graeco-Roman empire from the 2d to the 5th
                    century, then it may be regarded as the twin-sister of the church dogmatic which
                    grew up during the same period; the younger sister was brought up by the elder,
                    then rebelled against her, arid at last tyrannized over her. The Neoplatonists
                    themselves characterized the theologians of the church as intruders, who had
                    appropriated the Greek philosophy, and spoiled it by the admixture of strange
                    fables. Thus Porphyry says of Origen (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> vi.
                    19), “The outer life of Origen was that of a Christian, and contrary to law;
                    but, as far as his views of things and of God are concerned, he thought like the
                    Greeks, whose conceptions he overlaid with foreign myths.” This verdict of
                    Porphyry’s is at all events more just and apt than that of the theologians on
                    the Greek philosophers, when they accused them of having borrowed all their
                    really valuable doctrines from the ancient Christian books. But the important
                    point is that the relationship was acknowledged on both sides. Now, in so far as
                    both Neoplatonism and the church dogmatic set out from the felt need of
                    redemption, in so far as both sought to deliver the soul from sensuality, and
                    recognized man’s inability without divine aid—without a revelation—to attain
                    salvation and a sure knowledge of the truth, they are at once most intimately
                    related, and at the same time mutually independent. It must be confessed that
                    when Christianity began to project a theology it was already deeply impregnated
                    by Hellenic influences. But the influence is to be traced, not so much to
                    philosophy, as to the general culture of the time, and the whole set of
                    conditions under which spiritual life was manifested. When Neoplatonism
                    appeared, the Christian church had already laid down the main positions of her
                    theology; or if not, she worked them out alongside of Neoplatonism— <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> is not a mere accident—but still independently. It was
                    only by identifying itself with the whole history of Greek philosophy, or by
                    figuring as pure Platonism restored, that Neoplatonism could stigmatize the
                    church theology of Alexandria as a plagiarism from itself. These assumptions,
                    however, were fanciful. Although our sources are unfortunately very imperfect,
                    the theology of the church does not appear to have learned much from
                    Neoplatonism in the 3d century,—partly because the latter had not yet reached
                    the form in which its doctrines could be accepted by the church dogmatic, and
                    partly because theology was otherwise occupied. Her first business was to plant
                    herself firmly on her own territory, to make good her position, and clear away
                    old and objectionable opinions. Origen was quite as independent a thinker as
                    Plotinus; only, they both drew on the same tradition. From the 4th century
                    downwards, however, the influence of Neoplatonism on the Oriental theologians
                    was of the utmost importance. The church gradually expressed her most peculiar
                    convictions in dogmas, which were formulated bv nhilosonhical <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n352/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0352-0339"/> methods, but were irreconcilable with
                    Neoplatonism (the Christological dogmas); and the farther this process went the
                    more unrestrainedly did theologians resign themselves to the influence of
                    Neoplatonism on all other questions. The doctrines of the incarnation, the
                    resurrection of the flesh, and the creation of the world in time marked the
                    boundary line between the church’s dogmatic and Neoplatonism; in every other
                    respect, theologians and Neoplatonists drew so closely together that many of
                    them are completely at one. In fact, there were special cases, like that of
                    Synesius, in which a speculative reconstruction of distinctively Christian
                    doctrines by Christian men was winked at. If a book does not happen to touch on
                    any of the above-mentioned doctrines, it may often be doubtful whether the
                    writer is a Christian or a Neoplatonist. In ethical precepts, in directions for
                    right living (that is, asceticism), the two systems approximate more and more
                    closely. But it was here that Neoplatonism finally celebrated its greatest
                    triumph. It indoctrinated the church with all its mysticism, its mystic
                    exercises, and even its magical cultus as taught by Iamblichus. The works of the
                    pseudo-Dionysius contain a gnosis in which, by means of the teaching of
                    Iamblichus and Proclus, the church’s theology is turned into a scholastic
                    mysticism, with directions on matters of practice and ritual. And as these
                    writings were attributed to Dionysius, the disciple of the apostles, the
                    scholastic mysticism which they unfold was regarded as an apostolic, not to say
                    a divine, science. The influence exercised by these writings, first on the East,
                    and then—after the 9th (or 12th) century—on the West, cannot be overestimated.
                    It is impossible to enlarge upon it here; suffice it to say that the mystical
                    and pietistic devotion of our own day, even in the Protestant churches, is
                    nourished on works whose ancestry can be traced, through a series of
                    intermediate links, to the writings of the pseudo-Areopagite.</p>
                <p>In the ancient world there was only one Western theologian who came directly
                    under the influence of Neoplatonism; but that one is Augustine, the most
                    important of them all. It was through Neoplatonism that Augustine got rid of
                    scepticism and the last dregs of Manichaeism. In the seventh book of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessions</hi> he has recorded how much he owed to the perusal
                    of Neoplatonic works. On all the cardinal doctrines—God, matter, the relation of
                    God to the world, freedom, and evil—Augustine retained the impress of
                    Neoplatonism; at the same time he is the theologian of antiquity who most
                    clearly perceived and most fully stated wherein Neoplatonism and Christianity
                    differ. The best ever written by any church father on this subject is to be
                    found in chaps, ix,-xxi. of the seventh book of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessions.</hi></p>
                <p>Why Neoplatonism succumbed in the conflict with Christianity is a question which
                    the historians have never satisfactorily answered. As a rule, the problem is not
                    even stated correctly. We have nothing to do here with our own private ideal of
                    Christianity, but solely with catholic Christianity and catholic theology. These
                    are the forces that conquered Neoplatonism, after assimilating nearly everything
                    that it contained. Further, we must consider the arena in which the victory was
                    won. The battlefield was the empire of Constantine and Theodosius. It is only
                    when these and all other circumstances of the case are duly realized that we
                    have a right to inquire how much the essential doctrines of Christianity
                    contributed to the victory, and what share must be assigned to the organization
                    of the church.</p>
                <p>In mediaeval theology and philosophy mysticism appears as the powerful opponent
                    of rationalistic dogmatism. The empirical science of the Renaissance and the two
                    following centuries was itself a new development of Platonism and Neoplatonism,
                    as opposed to rationalistic dogmatism, with its contempt for experience. Magic,
                    astrology, and alchemy—all the outgrowth of Neoplatonism—gave the first
                    effectual stimulus to the observation of nature, and consequently to natural
                    science, and in this way finally extinguished barren rationalism. Thus in the
                    history of science Neoplatonism has played a part, and rendered services of
                    which Plotinus or Iamblichus or Proclus never dreamt. So true is it that sober
                    history is often stranger and more capricious than all the marvels of legend and
                    romance.</p>
