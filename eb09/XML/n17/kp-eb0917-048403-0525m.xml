                    a physician, and was born at Sarzana, near Spezzia, in 1389. He received a good
                    education at Bologna, became tutor in the Albizzi and Strozzi families at
                    Florence, and ultimately entered into the service of Albergata, bishop of
                    Bologna. He accompanied his patron on several embassies, and gained so high a
                    reputation, for diplomatic ability and for learning that shortly after
                    Albergata’s death he himself obtained the see of Bologna, was sent by Eugenius
                    IV. on an embassy into Germany, and in December 1446 was made a cardinal. In
                    less than three months he was pope in succession to Eugenius,—a. small majority
                    of the electors, indisposed to the strongest candidate, Cardinal Prospero
                    Colonna, having united upon Parentucelli as a man who had made no enemies. His
                    policy as pope seemed clearly marked out for him. The church was reaching the
                    end of a period of strife and schism. The. firmness of Eugenius IV. had at
                    length almost beaten down the emperor, the antipope, and the council of Basel;
                    the wisdom and moderation of Nicholas V. completed the work. Within two years
                    the emperor made peace, the antipope abdicated, and the council dissolved
                    itself. Nicholas hoped for a period of tranquillity, and determined, to exhibit
                    the papacy to the world as the protector of art and learning. “To the demand of
                    Germany for reformation,” says Mr Creighton, “he answered by offering culture.”
                    He aimed especially at making Rome architecturally a worthy capital of the
                    Christian world: he repaired its fortifications, began the rebuilding of its
                    cathedral, enlarged and adorned its thoroughfares, and. traced much of the plan
                    of restoration executed by his successors. But his great glory was his active
                    co-operation in the revival of learning. He collected manuscripts from all
                    quarters, caused them to be multiplied by transcription, commissioned the most
                    competent scholars to translate Greek books into Latin, and gathered around him
                    the most distinguished humanists of his day, Poggio Bracciolini, Valla, Filelfo.
                    Under him the papacy regained much of its former lustre, and till late in his
                    reign his administration was disturbed by no unfortunate events. In January
                    1453∙ the conspiracy of Stefano Porcaro was detected on the eve of breaking out.
                    The pope and cardinals were to have been seized, their effects pillaged, and
                    Rome declared a. republic. Nicholas was terrified, and showed himself angry and
                    cruel. On May 29 of the same year Constantinople was taken by the Turks. The
                    fault was not the pope’s, who had ineffectually sent his galleys to the rescue;
                    yet he could not but feel that a stain had fallen upon his pontificate. He
                    proclaimed a crusade, but this was an undertaking for which he was
                    constitutionally unfit; he failed to kindle the zeal of others, and many doubted
                    his own. Exhausted by repeated attacks of gout, he died on March 24, 1455.
                    Before his death he summoned the cardinals, and enumerated the good works he had
                    been enabled to perform, “by God’s blessing of peace and tranquillity in my
                    days.” These last words sufficiently express the general scope of his policy. He
                    was rather a scholar than an ecclesiastic or a statesman, yet enough of both to
                    perform his part on the world’s stage with sufficient credit; it is, however,
                    his principal distinction to have been a learned and art-loving pope, and to
                    have formed that alliance between the papacy and intellectual culture which
                    subsisted for the next hundred years. He was succeeded by Calixtus HI.</p>
