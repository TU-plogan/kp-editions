                        Baroness</hi></label> (1766— 1845), the authoress of many fine Scotch songs,
                    was born in the “auld hoose” of Cask, Perthshire, 16th August 1766. She was
                    descended from an old family which had settled in Perthshire in the 13 th
                    century, and which could boast of kinship with the royal race of Scotland. Her
                    father, Laurence Oliphant, was one of the foremost supporters of the Jacobite
                    cause, and she was named Caroline in memory of Prince Charlie. In early
                    childhood her health was extremely delicate, but a certain refined sensibility
                    was the only trace of this which she retained in after years. In the schoolroom
                    she was known as “pretty Miss Car,” and afterwards her striking beauty and
                    pleasing manners earned for her the name of the “Flower of Strathearn.” Miss
                    Oliphant was one of the earliest admirers of Robert Burns, and induced her
                    brother Laurence to enter his name as subscriber to the first edition of his
                    poems. It was the attempts of Burns in the <hi rend="italic">Scots Musical
                        Museum</hi> to adapt words of a more refined character to the old Scotch
                    airs that suggested to her to undertake a similar enterprise. Her first effort
                    was a new version of the “Pleughman,” which her brother introduced at an
                    entertainment to the Gask tenantry, and which soon met with great popularity
                    throughout central Scotland. In June 1800 she married William Murray Nairne,
                    whose rank as fifth Lord Nairne was in abeyance on account of attainder. He was
                    then assistant inspector-general of barracks in Scotland. At the instigation of
                    the Misses Hume, daughters of Baron Hume, she some time after her marriage
                    undertook to bring out a collection of national airs set to appropriate words.
                    To the collection she contributed a large number of original songs, adopting the
                    signature’“B.B.”—“Mrs Bogan of Bogan.” The music was edited by R. A. Smith, and
                    the collection was published at Edinburgh under the name of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Scottish Minstrel</hi> (6 vols., 1821-24). Her husband was
                    restored to his rank in 1824, but died 9th July 1830. After his death she took
                    up her residence at Enniskerry, county Wicklθλv, but on account of the delicate
                    health of her only son she went to the Continent, where she spent several years.
                    The son died at Brussels in 1838. Lady Nairne returned to Gask in 1843, and died
                    there 26th October 1845.</p>
                <p>The songs of Lady Nairne may be classed under three heads :— (1) those
                    illustrative of the characters and manners of the old Scotch gentry, such as
                    “The Laird of Cockpen,” “The Fife Laird,” and “John Tod”; (2) Jacobite songs,
                    composed for the most part to gratify her kinsman the aged chief of Strowan,
                    among the best-known of which are perhaps “Wha’ll be King but Charlie,” “Charlie
                    is my Darling,” “The Hundred Pipers,” “He’s owτe the Hills,” and “Bonnie
                    Charlie’s noo awa”; and (3) songs not included under the above heads, ranging
                    over a variety of subjects from “Caller Herrin’” to the “Land o’ the Leal.” For
                    vivacity, genuine pathos, and bright wit her songs are surpassed only by those
                    of Burns, and, although their note is less full and strong than his, it is
                    perhaps in some respects more mellow and tender.</p>
