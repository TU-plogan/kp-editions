                    of that portion of Armenia, which was allotted to Persia by the partition of
                    384), he· may have been prepared and educated by his parents for service in an
                    Oriental court. If the statement that he. died at the age of ninety-five be
                    correct, he was born about the year 478. He was probably brought young to
                    Constantinople, and attained a footing in the <hi rend="italic">offidum</hi> of
                    the·, grand chamberlain. From a subordinate place he rose in course of time to
                    be one of the three (spectabiles} “chartularii,” a position implying some
                    literary attainment, and involving the custody of the archives of the household.
                    Hence, probably in middle life, he became. “praepositus sacri cubiculi,” an
                    “illustris,” and entitled along with the praetorian prefects and the generals to
                    the; highest rank at the imperial court. In this capacity, in· 530, he received
                    into the emperor’s obedience another Narses, a fellow-countryman as well as
                    namesake, together with his two brothers Aratius and Isaac. These Pers-armenian
                    generals, having formerly fought under the standard of Persia, now in
                    consequence of the successes of Belisarius transferred their allegiance to the
                    emperor, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n244/mode/1up"

                    from the great minister.</p>
                <p>In the year 532 the celebrated insurrection known as the Nika broke out in
                    Constantinople, when for some hours the throne of Justinian seemed doomed to
                    overthrow. It was saved partly by the courage of his wife, Theodora, and partly
                    by the timely prodigality of Narses, who stole out into the capital, and with
                    large sums of money bribed the leaders of the “blue” faction (which was
                    aforetime loyal to the emperor) to shout as of old “Justiniane Auguste Tu
                    Vincas.”</p>
                <p>The African and Italian wars followed (533-534, 535- 554; see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Justinian,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 797). In the fourth year of the
                    latter war the splendid successes of Belisarius, who with a handful of troops
                    had conquered the better part of Italy, reoccupied Rome, and held it against
                    150,000 Goths, vainly besieging it for 374 days, had awakened both joy and fear
                    in the heart of his master. Reinforcements amounting to 10,000 men were sent
                    into Italy, and Narses the eunuch was placed at their head. Belisarius
                    understood that Narses came to serve under him like any other officer of
                    distinguished but subordinate rank, and he received a letter from Justinian
                    which seemed to support this conclusion. But the friends of Narses continually
                    plied him with suggestions that he, a great officer of the household, in the
                    secrets of the emperor, had been sent to Italy, not to serve as a subaltern, but
                    to hold independent command and win military glory for himself. The truth
                    probably lay between the two. Justinian could not deprive his great general of
                    the supreme command, yet he wished to have a very powerful emissary of the court
                    constantly at his side. He would have him watched but not hampered.</p>
                <p>The two generals met (538 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> at Fermo on the
                    Adriatic coast. The first interference of Narses with the plans of Belisarius
                    was beneficial. John, one of the officers highest in rank under Belisarius, had
                    pressed on to Rimini, contrary to the instructions of his chief, leaving in his
                    rear the difficult fortress of Osimo untaken. His daring march had alarmed the
                    Goths for Ravenna, and induced them to raise the siege of Rome; but he himself
                    was now shut up in Rimini, and on the point of being forced by famine to
                    surrender. Belisarius and his followers were prepared to let him pay the penalty
                    of his rashness and disobedience. But his friend Narses so insisted on the blow
                    to the reputation of the imperial arms which would be produced by the surrender
                    of Rimini that he carried the council of war with him, and Belisarius had to
                    plan a brilliant march across the mountains, in conjunction with a movement by
                    the fleet, whereby Rimini was relieved while Osimo was still untaken. When
                    Belisarius and John met, the latter ostentatiously thanked Narses and Narses
                    alone for his preservation.</p>
                <p>His next use of his authority was less fortunate. Milan, which was holding out
                    for the Romans, was also hard pressed by famine. The two generals who were sent
                    to relieve it loitered disgracefully over their march, and when Belisarius
                    wished to despatch further reinforcements the commanders of these new troops
                    refused to stir till Narses gave them orders. Belisarius wrote to the eunuch
                    pointing out the necessity of unity of purpose in the imperial army. At length,
                    grudgingly, Narses gave his consent, and issued the required orders; but it was
                    too late. Milan had been compelled by extremity of famine to surrender, and with
                    it the whole province of Liguria fell into the hands of the enemy. This event
                    forced Justinian to recognize the dangers of even a partially divided command,
                    and he recalled Narses to Constantinople.</p>
                <p>Twelve years elapsed before Narses returned to Italy. Meanwhile there had been
                    great vicissitudes of fortune both for the Romans and the Goths. Italy, which
                    appeared to have been won by the sword of Belisarius, had been lost again by the
                    exactions and misgovernment of Alexander. The young and gallant Totila had
                    raised up a new army, had more than kept Belisarius at bay in five difficult
                    campaigns (544—548), and now held nearly all the country. Belisarius, however,
                    in this his second series of campaigns, had never been properly seconded by his
                    master. In the spring of 552 Narses set sail from Salona on the Dalmatian coast
                    with a large and well-appointed army. It was a Roman army only in name.
                    Lombards, Heruli, Huns, Gepidae, and even Persians followed the standard of
                    Narses, men equal in physical strength and valour to the Goths, and inspired by
                    the liberal pay which they received and by the hope of plunder.</p>
                <p>The eunuch seems to have led his army round the head of the Adriatic Gulf. By
                    skilfully co-operating with his fleet he was able to cross the rivers of Venetia
                    without fighting the Gothic general Teias, who intended to dispute their
                    passage. Having mustered all his forces at Ravenna, he marched southward. He
                    refused to be detained before Rimini, being determined to meet the Gothic king
                    as soon as possible with his army undiminished. The occupation of the pass of
                    Furlo (Petra Pertusa) by the Goths prevented his marching by the Via Flaminia,
                    but, taking a short circuit, he rejoined the great road near Cagli. A little
                    further on, upon the crest of the Apennines, he was met by Totila, who had
                    advanced as far as Tadini (which Procopius calls Taginas). Parleys, messages,
                    and harangues by each general followed. At length the line of battle was formed,
                    and the Gothic army (probably greatly inferior in number to the Byzantine) was
                    hopelessly routed, the king receiving a mortal wound as he was hurrying from the
                    battlefield.</p>
                <p>With Totila fell the last hopes of the Gothic kingdom of Italy. The brave young
                    Teias, who was proclaimed his successor, protracted for a few months a desperate
                    resistance in the rocky peninsula of Castellamare, overlooking the Bay of
                    Naples. At length want of provisions forced him into the plain, and there by the
                    river Sarno, almost in sight of Pompeii, was fought (553) a battle which is
                    generally named from the overlooking range of Mons Laetorius (Monte Lettere).
                    The actual site of the battle, however, is about half a mile from the little
                    town of Angri, and its memory is still vaguely preserved by the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Pozzo dei Goti</hi> (Well of the Goths). In this battle Teias was
                    killed. He was the last king of the Ostrogoths.</p>
                <p>The task of Narses, however, was not yet ended. By the invitation of the Goths an
                    army of 75,000 warlike Alemanni and Franks, the subjects of King Theudibert,
                    crossed the Alps under the command of two Alemannic nobles, the brothers Leuthar
                    and Butilin (553). The great strategic talents of Narses were shown even mo're
                    conspicuously in this than in his previous and more brilliant campaigns. Against
                    the small but gallant bands of Totila and Teias he had adopted the policy of
                    rapid marches and imperative challenges to battle. His strategy in dealing with
                    the great host from Gaul was of the Fabian kind. He kept them as long as he
                    could north of the Apennines, while he completed the reduction of the fortresses
                    of Tuscany. At the approach of winter he gathered his troops into the chief
                    cities and declined operations in the field, while the Alemannic brothers
                    marched through Italy killing and plundering. When the spring of 554 appeared,
                    Leuthar with his half of the army insisted on marching back to Gaul, there to
                    deposit in safety the plunder which they had reaped. In an unimportant
                    engagement near Pesaro he was worsted by the Roman generals, and this hastened
                    his northward march. At Ceneda in Venetia he died of a raging fever. Pestilence
                    broke out in his army, which if not absolutely annihilated thereby was so wasted
                    as to be incapable of further opera-tiona<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0245-0234"/> in Italy. Meanwhile his brother Butilin, whose
                    army was also suffering grievously from disease, partly induced by too free
                    indulgence in the grapes of Campania, encamped at Casilinum, the site of modern
                    Capua. Here, after a time, Narses accepted the offered battle. The barbarians,
                    whose army was in the form of a wedge, pierced the Roman centre. But by a most
                    skilful manoeuvre Narses contrived to draw his lines into a curve, so that his
                    mounted archers on each flank could aim their arrows at the backs of the troops
                    who formed the other side of the Alemannic wedge. They thus fell in whole ranks
                    by the hands of unseen antagonists. Soon the Roman centre, which had been
                    belated in its march, arrived upon the field and completed the work of
                    destruction. Butilin and his whole army were destroyed, though we need not
                    accept the statement of the Greek historian (Agathias, ii. 9) that only five men
                    out of the barbaric host of 30,000 escaped, and only eighty out of the Roman
                    18,000 perished (554).</p>
                <p>The only other important military operation of Narses which is recorded—and that
                    indistinctly—is his defeat of the Herulian king Sindual, who had served under
                    him at Capua, but who subsequently revolted, was defeated, taken captive, and
                    hanged by the eunuch’s order (565). In the main the thirteen years after the
                    battle of Capua (554- 567) were years of peace, and during them Narses ruled
                    Italy from Ravenna with the title of prefect.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gibbon’s statement that Narses was “the first
                    and most powerful of the exarchs of Ravenna” is more correct in substance than
                    in form. The title of exarch does not appear to be given to Narses by any
                    contemporary writer. He is always “Praefectus Italiae,” “Patricius,” or <hi

                    he bears the style of his former offices in the imperial household,

                    cities destroyed in the Gothic -war; and two inscriptions on the Salarian bridge

                    the year 564.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Gruter, p. 161.</p></note></p>
                <p>His administration, however, was not popular. The effect of the imperial
                    organization was to wring the last <hi rend="italic">solidus</hi> out of the
                    emaciated and fever-stricken population of Italy, and the belief of his subjects
                    was that no small portion of their contributions remained in the eunuch’s
                    private coffers. At the close of 565 Justinian died, and a deputation of Romans
                    waited upon his successor Justin II., representing that they found “the Greeks”
                    harder taskmasters than the Goths, that Narses the eunuch was determined to
                    reduce them all to slavery, and that unless he were removed they would transfer
                    their allegiance to the barbarians. This deputation led to the recall of Narses,
                    which took place in 567, and was accompanied, according to a somewhat late
                    tradition, by an insulting message from the empress Sophia, who sent him a
                    golden distaff, and bade him, as he was not a man, go and spin wool in the
                    apartments of the women. “I will spin her such a hank,” Narses is represented as
                    saying, “that she shall not find the end of it in her lifetime”; and forthwith
                    he sent messengers to the Lombards in Pannonia, bearing some of the fruits of
                    Italy, and inviting them to enter the land which bore such goodly produce. Hence
                    came the invasion of Alboin (568), which wrested the greater part of Italy from
                    the empire, and changed the destinies of the peninsula.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This celebrated story seems to be unknown to
                    strictly contemporary authors. We find no hint of it in Agathias (who wrote
                    between 566 and 582), Marius (532-596), or Gregory of Tours (540-594). The

                    7th century, and Paulus Diaconus, towards the close of the 8th, supply the
                    saga-like details, which become more minute the further the narrators are from
                    the action. On the whole, the transaction, though it is too well vouched for to
                    allow us to dismiss it as entirely fabulous, cannot take its place among the
                    undoubted facts of history.</p></note></p>
                <p>Narses, who had retired to Naples, was persuaded by the pope (John III.) to
                    return to Rome. He died there about 573, and his body, enclosed in a leaden
                    coffin, was carried to Constantinople and buried there. Several years after his
                    death the secret of the hiding-place of his vast stores of wealth is said to
                    have been revealed by an old man to the emperor Tiberius II., for whose
                    charities to the poor and the captives they furnished an opportune supply.</p>
                <p>Narses was short in stature and lean in figure. His freehandedness and affability
                    made him very popular with his soldiers. Evagrius tells us that he was very
                    religious, and paid especial reverence to the Virgin, never engaging in battle
                    till he conceived that she had given him the signal. Our best authorities for
                    his life are his contemporaries Procopius and Agathias. For the period after 555
                    we have to depend chiefly on fragmentary notices in the authors whose names have
                    been mentioned above. " (T. H. )</p>
