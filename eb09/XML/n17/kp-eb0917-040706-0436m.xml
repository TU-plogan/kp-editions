                <p><label type="entry">NEW SOUTH WALES</label>. This was the name given by Captain
                    Cook, in his exploratory voyage in 1770, to the southern portion of the eastern
                    coast of Australia, from some imagined resemblance of its coast-line to that of
                    South Wales. The name was afterwards extended to the eastern half of Australia,
                    but by subsequent subtractions has gradually received a more limited meaning. It
                    is still, however, three times the size of Great Britain and Ireland, and larger
                    than any state in Europe except Russia. The present British colony of New South
                    Males is bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the E., by Queensland on the N., by
                    South Australia on the W., and by Victoria on the S. It lies between 28° and 38°
                    S. lat., and 141° and 154° E. long., extending over about nine degrees of
                    latitude and about twelve and a half degrees of longitude. The coast-line, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n437/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0437-0408"/> which is about 700 miles in length, extends from
                    Cape Howe (37° 30') at the south-eastern corner of Australia to Point Danger in
                    28° 7' S. The colony is approximately rectangular in form, with an average depth
                    from the coast of 650 miles and an average width from north to south of 500
                    miles. The superficial area is estimated at 310,000 square miles, or about
                    one-tenth of the whole of Australia.</p>
                <p>Along the seaboard are twenty-two well-defined headlands or capes and about a
                    score of bays or inlets, to mark which for navigators there are twenty-three
                    lighthouses. There are four very fine natural harbours, viz., Jervis Bay, Port
                    Jackson, Broken Bay, and Port Stephens, and several others of minor importance.
                    Of these, only Port Jackson, on which is situated the city of Sydney, has
                    attained as yet to commercial importance. The port second in commercial
                    importance is Newcastle, at the mouth of the Hunter river, which is the great
                    coal-shipping port of the colony. Secondary harbours, available for coasting
                    steamers, south of Sydney are to be found at Port Hacking, Wollongong, Kiama,
                    Shoalhaven, Bateman’s Bay, Ulladulla, Merimbula, and Twofold Bay. To the north
                    of Sydney the secondary ports are at the mouths of the Hawkesbury, the Manning,
                    the Hastings, the Macleay, the Nambucca, the Bellinger, the Clarence, the
                    Richmond, and the Tweed rivers. These are mostly bar harbours, but the Clarence
                    is a noble river, and when the entrance is improved will become a great
                    port.</p>
                <p>The characteristic natural feature of New South Wales is the great Cordillera
                    range running north and south. The average elevation of this range is about 2500
                    feet. The highest point, Mount Kosciusko, reaches, however, a height of 7300
                    feet, about 700 feet below the theoretical line of perpetual snow, yet snow has
                    never more than once wholly disappeared. None of the interior parts of the
                    colony attain to a similar elevation. This range runs generally parallel to the
                    coast, varying from 30 to 140 miles distant, being nearest at the south and
                    receding the farthest at the sources of the Goulburn river, the main tributary
                    of the Hunter. The crest of this range is in some places narrow; in others it
                    spreads out into a wide table-land. The eastern slopes are somewhat rugged and
                    precipitous, the sandstone especially being deeply fissured by the watercourses;
                    but along the greater part of the coast there is a belt of flat land generally
                    of high fertility. At the outlet of many of the streams descending from the
                    range are large lagoons, sometimes closed against the sea by sandbars, and at
                    other times opened by the force of the outrushing waters. The principal of these
                    are Lake Illawarra and Lake Macquarie, Tuggarah Lake, Lake Myall, Wallis Lake,
                    Watson Taylor Lake, and Queen’s Lake. Lake Macquarie, however, is rather a
                    magnificent estuary than a lake, and if the bar at the entrance could be removed
                    would become a commercial port, as the hills at the back are rich in coal. The
                    inland lakes are few and unimportant. They are mostly shallow and occasionally
                    dry. On the western side of the main range the general slope of the country is
                    towards the west, the drainage being into the Murray, the Murrumbidgee, the
                    Lachlan, and the Darling; but the drainage of all of them unites in the Murray,
                    at the town of Wentworth, near the southwestern corner of the colony.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The rainfall differs very much in different
                    parts of the colony. It is heaviest on the eastern coast, where the easterly
                    gales break against the main range. Here the average is 40 inches on the south
                    to 65 inches on the north. Sydney, with forty-three years’ observation, has a
                    mean of 50 inches. In winter the temperature sometimes falls to the freezing
                    point, and it rises in summer to 85° or 90° on very hot days. The mean
                    temperature of Sydney is 62 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 5. On the
                    table-lands the rainfall is from 20 to 35 inches. In winter the temperature in
                    extreme cases falls 10° or 15° below the freezing point, and in the height of
                    summer it rises to 100° or 105°. The mean temperature may be found from 50° to
                    60°. On the great western plains the rainfall is much less, falling rapidly as
                    the high land is left to 18 inches, and in the far west to 8 inches. Here the
                    temperature seldom falls more than 6° or 8“ below freezing, but in summer it
                    often rises to 110°, and in extreme cases to 120°; and the mean temperatures
                    range from 60° on the south to 68° on the north. Along the coast-line the air is
                    moist and soft; the temperature is mild, the thermometer ranging from 78° in
                    January to 59“ in July, and the mean for the year being about 62∣°. The
                    prevailing wind in summer is from the north-east, though occasionally hot, dry
                    winds come from the north-western interior, which are generally followed by a
                    sudden and violent reaction from the south, known as “southerly bursters.” On
                    such occasions the thermometer will sometimes suddenly fall in a few hours 20 or
                    30 degrees. The violent rainstorms generally come from the east, shifting from
                    north-east to south-east; but, as they are mostly accompanied with a high
                    temperature, their origin is to be looked for towards the north. During the
                    winter months the wind blows mostly from the west. It is a dry wind, and the
                    weather is generally clear, bright, and invigorating. On the table-land the air
                    is much drier than on the coast, the winters are longer and colder, and the
                    summer heat, except in the middle of hot days, much below the coast temperature;
                    and this elevated region is much resorted to by the citizens of Sydney as a
                    summer resort. As the country slopes down towards the west the dryness of the
                    climate increases. Though the heat is sometimes oppressive, the climate is not
                    unhealthy; while sheep and cattle are more free from disease here than in
                    moister parts of the colony.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The main mountain chain, running north and
                    south, with the eastern portion of the continent generally, must have been
                    submerged during the early Miocene period to the extent of about 4000 feet below
                    its present level, leaving the highest portions of the range standing out as
                    islands, which have probably never wholly been submerged since the commencement
                    of the Mesozoic era, and to this is attributable the survival of the cycads,
                    araucarias, and other ancient vegetable forms which now abound in Australia; the
                    living <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus forsteri</hi> of Queensland, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Marsupialia,</hi> also point to the same conclusion. To the
                    westward it throws out many lateral spurs, diminishing gradually in elevation,
                    and determining the basins of the tributaries of the rivers flowing westward.
                    The most important of these lateral ranges runs northwestward towards the
                    Darling and beyond to the Barrier Ranges in the north-western part of the
                    colony. The summit of this lateral range has been partly denuded, and it dips
                    towards the plain of the Darling where that river cuts through it. This being
                    the only water channel from all the north-western portion of the colony, all the
                    tributaries of the Darling converge into this depression. This range divides the
                    western portion of the colony into two main basins, the northern of which
                    contains all the affluents of the Darling, and the southern is the Murrumbidgee
                    basin, with its affluents the Murray and the Lachlan. These basins consist of a
                    large Cretaceous area, which extends away far beyond the western boundary of the
                    colony. The basis of the mountain system of the colony is granite, and the
                    oldest sedimentary deposit resting on it is the Upper Silurian. In the
                    neighbouring colony of Victoria, Lower Silurian fossils are found over a large
                    area west of Melbourne, but in New South Wales nothing has been definitely
                    determined older than the Upper Silurian. Granite has lifted the superincumbent
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n438/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0438-0409"/> deposits, penetrated them, and metamorphosed them
                    in various degrees up to a close resemblance to igneous rocks. The great western
                    plains of the interior are characterized by isolated rocks, or short ranges,
                    mostly granite, but occasionally trap, long sand ridges, and clay basins. The
                    sand and clay both result from the disintegration of granite and trap, the sand
                    ridges having been wind-blown, and the clay washed into the lower levels. Many
                    of the wells sunk into the yellow clay;furnish an almost undrinkable brackish
                    water, from the salts of soda and iron, and occasionally lime, potash, and
                    magnesia, yielded by the felspars.</p>
                <p>The Upper Silurian rocks occur frequently, but chiefly on the western watershed
                    of the great dividing range. They consist of conglomerates, sandstones, slates,
                    mudstones, and limestones, and have a general meridional strike. Devonian rocks
                    are displayed on the western flanks of the Blue Mountains. They include
                    sandstones, conglomerates, limestones, and shales, related by their fossils to
                    the Silurian beds below and to the Carboniferous beds above. The Carboniferous
                    series is very widely developed. The strata are probably not less than 10,000
                    feet thick, the lower beds containing both plants and marine fauna. The Upper
                    Carboniferous series includes the lower Coal-measures of New South Wales. These
                    are traceable along .the coast from 31 ∣ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> to 35 J
                    <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> S. The coal-seams are visible above the sea-level
                    from Coal Cliff, 20 miles south of Sydney, the seams rising to the southward,
                    and from Lake Macquarie, north of Sydney, the seams rising to the northward. The
                    great coal basin extends westward along what seems to have been a depression
                    between the northern and southern elevated portions of the old main range, and,
                    lying under what is now the Blue Mountains, passes up northwards along the
                    western flank of the main range towards the boundary of Queensland. The western
                    edge of the coal basin is not determined. Overlying the coal basin, to the
                    westward of Sydney, is a Mesozoic sandstone formation, 1000 feet thick, while
                    above this, and also intermixed with it, lies a shale deposit. All these series
                    have been disturbed by dykes of basalt, diabase, and dolerite. Some of the
                    coal-seams have been tilted by this intrusion; in other cases the dip has not
                    been changed; and in some cases the adjacent coal has been charred into coke.
                    Volcanic disturbance seems to have been very active during the Tertiary epoch,
                    and the igneous formations occupy about 40,000 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Commercial mining is at present limited to
                    gold, silver, copper, tin, coal, and oil shales. The greater portion of the gold
                    hitherto raised has been from alluvial deposits. These are of Permian,
                    Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary ages, and are derived from the degradation
                    of the older sedimentary rocks of Upper Silurian, Devonian, and Lower
                    Carboniferous ages. The formations in association with which gold has been found
                    are widely scattered over the colony, and are estimated to occupy nearly
                    one-fourth of its area. In the reefs, gold seldom occurs without one or more of
                    the following sulphides :—iron pyrites, galena, mispickel, blende, and copper
                    pyrites. The gold is always more or less alloyed with silver, and there are
                    occasionally traces of copper, iron, osmiridium, and other metals. The greatest
                    depth at which auriferous reefs have been worked is 940 feet at Adelong. The
                    value of the gold raised in the colony up to the end of 1882 was £34,839,847.
                    Silver has been found in several places, but has only been profitably worked at
                    Boorook. The lodes vary in width rom 1 to 3 feet, and are situated in belts of
                    felspar porphyry, alternated with beds of fossiliferous shales of the Devonian
                    formation. The value of silver raised to the end of 1882 was £187,429. Copper
                    ore is traceable on the surface in very many places, and the cupriferous
                    formations are already estimated to cover an area equal to 4,300,000 acres. The
                    value of copper exported to the end of 1882 was £3,538,285. Tin has been
                    profitably worked since 1872, and the value exported to the end of 1882 was
                    £5,173,038. It is nearly all taken from alluvial deposits—in the first instance
                    from the beds of existing creeks, but more recently from the beds of old rivers,
                    sometimes covered by basalt. It is all obtained from the Tertiary and Quaternary
                    drifts, composed of the detritus from the stanniferous granite. The area of
                    stanniferous deposits is estimated at 5,440,000 acres, the principal tin-bearing
                    localities being in the high lauds of the great dividing chain in the northern
                    and southern districts. The known Coal-measures embrace an area of about 24,000
                    square miles, the seams varying from 3 feet to 25 feet in thickness. The seams
                    are mostly horizontal. The dip is usually under 5°. The principal collieries are
                    near Newcastle, and on the Illawarra coast, and at the western foot of the Blue
                    Mountains. The seams worked to the south of Sydney are more anthracitic than
                    those worked to the north. The value of the coal raised during 1882 was£944,405.
                    Whatis called, though erroneously, “kerosene shale” is worked in the west at
                    Hartley andin the south at Joadja Creek. It is really a species of cannel coal.
                    A good illuminating oil is distilled from it, and it is largely shipped for use
                    in gas-works, a moderate percentage of it greatly improving the quality of the
                    gas. The value of this cannel coal raised up to the end of 1882 was £665,160.
                    Iron exists in abundance, and has been worked at Mittagong and Lithgow Valley,
                    but the colonial cost of labour has made it difficult to compete with English
                    imports. Red and brown ore exists in abundance in the sandstone formation. It
                    contains 55 per cent, of metallic iron. Beds of clayband iron ore are found in
                    the Coal-measures, both on the west of the Blue Mountains and on the Illawarra
                    coast. Antimony has been found in several places, and has been slightly worked
                    in the Macleay and Armidale districts, where the lodes traverse sedimentary
                    rocks of the Devonian age. Argentiferous lead is found in many places in the
                    Silurian, Devonian, and granite formations, but hitherto the attempts to work it
                    at a profit have been a failure. Bismuth has been found in the tin-bearing
                    rocks, and asbestos in veins in serpentines; chromic iron and manganese ore have
                    also been found in considerable quantities. The tin-bearing drifts in the river
                    gravels contain precious stones,—the diamond, sapphire, emerald, ruby, opal,
                    amethyst, garnet, chrysolite, topaz, cairngorm, and onyx having all been found.
                    The colony is well supplied with building stone, granite, sandstone, flagging,
                    marble, limestone, slate, and fire-clay; and brick and pottery clays occur in
                    abundance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The fertile soils consist chiefly of the
                    alluvial deposits on the banks of the rivers and the detritus of the igneous
                    rocks. On the rich flats on the banks of the river Hunter, mostly devoted to the
                    growing of lucerne for hay, six cuttings are generally taken off in the year. To
                    the southward of Sydney the coast land is very largely devoted to dairy-farming,
                    the herbage being rich and sweet, especially in localities where there has been
                    any basaltic overflow. The principal supply of butter and cheese for the Sydney
                    market comes from this district. Along the coast to the northward of Port
                    Stephens maize is very largely cultivated for horsefood. The yield in an average
                    season is about 50 bushels per acre. Sugar has not been commercially successful
                    south of Clarence. But on that river, and on the Richmond, and all the way to
                    the border of Queensland, it has proved profitable, and is rapidly extending.
                    Oranges are not cultivated to advantage south of Sydney, but anywhere to the
                    northward along the eastern slopes they grow freely. Nearly every description of
                    European fruit is cultivated without difficulty. Tobacco is increasingly grown
                    both on the coast and on the alluvial flats of the western waters. In earlier
                    days wheat was very largely grown upon the coast, but in consequence of the rust
                    this crop has been driven inland on to basaltic areas. The production of wine is
                    limited only by the demand. Hitherto the principal seats of this industry have
                    been in the Hunter river district, where many varieties of light wine are
                    produced, and in the district round Albury, where, in a dry, warm climate, and
                    from a rich volcanic soil, a strong, full-bodied wine is obtained.</p>
                <p>Grazing was the beginning of the industrial life of Australia, and it is still
                    the great source of its wealth. The mildness of the winter allows stock to be
                    pastured out of doors all the year round, and supersedes the necessity of
                    artificial food. The consequence is that the country has been easily and rapidly
                    overspread with sheep and cattle farms, the only natural check being the want of
                    water in the remote parts and the occasional discouragement of poor markets. The
                    speciality of the Australian wool is its fineness, and the small merino sheep
                    are found to be the best-suited to the pasture and the climate. The stock which
                    is now most appreciated is that of Australian breeders who have kept their
                    flocks free from intermixture for a long period. The Australian merino has
                    established for itself a separate type. Sheep as a rule are remarkably healthy
                    in the Australian climate. In wet seasons and on stiff land they are liable to
                    fluke and to foot-rot. . Scab has occasionally appeared; but the precautions
                    taken against it now are very strict, and it has not prevailed in the colony
                    since it was stamped out in 1866. Cattle are liable to pleuro-pneumonia, which
                    is sometimes very destructive.</p>

                <p>Amongst the <hi rend="italic">Myrtaccae</hi> (containing some 140 species) there
                    are plants ranging from the minute <hi rend="italic">Baeckia</hi> to the
                    gigantic <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus.</hi> These, for the most part, have
                    valuable resins and oils, and possess astringent and antiscorbutic properties;
                    the foliage is evergreen, and the flowers vary from white and yellow to purple
                    and crimson. The forests are principally myτtaceous, some species yielding
                    esculent fruits, while the wood and bark of many are becoming known throughout
                    the world. While in point of utility the <hi rend="italic">Myrtaocae,</hi> stand
                    unrivalled, the <hi rend="italic">Proteaceae,</hi> by their various flowers,
                    curiously shaped fruits, and harsh foliage, arrest the attention of the
                    observer. The far-famed “wooden pear” (AyZo- <hi rend="italic">melum

                    >Grevillea</hi> represent this order in the vicinity of Port Jackson. In New
                    South Wales there is only one heath correctly so termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gaultheria</hi><hi rend="italic">hispida),</hi> and that only on the summite
                    of snowy mountains near the Bellinger, or on the Australian Alps; but the lovely
                    epacrids, which are abundant near Sydney, take the place of heaths, and two of
                    them <hi rend="italic">(E. purpurascens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">E.
                    microphylla),</hi> as if to increase the beauty of their inflorescence, are
                    sometimes found double even in a wild state. In each region, whether alpine,
                    littoral, or beyond the dividing range, epacrids occur in a greater or less
                    degree. The <hi rend="italic">Leguminosae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Composites,</hi> though nearly cosmopolitan, attain a comparative maximum in
                    New South Wales, the species of the former being over 300 and of the latter 250.
                    Of leguminous plants, the species of <hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi> are the most
                    numerous (about 100), scattered in some places amongst the trees of the forest,
                    and in others forming dense scrubs. Those remarkable for their scented and
                    useful wood (such as <hi rend="italic">A. pendilla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A.
                    homalophylla</hi> —the “myalls” of the natives) are highly valued. Sturt’s
                    desert pea <hi rend="italic">(Clianthus Dampier ι),</hi> the Moreton Bay
                    chestnut <hi rend="italic">(Castanospermum</hi><hi rend="italic">australe),</hi>
                    and the genus <hi rend="italic">Swainsona</hi> have acquired a reputation
                    amongst horticulturists. Many of the composites, the largest of which is the
                    musk-tree <hi rend="italic">(Aster argophyllus),</hi> are found not only near
                    the coast but on the arid plains of the interior. Although from the frequent
                    occurrence of certain orders, the flora of New South Wales is somewhat
                    monotonous, yet the vegetation of the southern mountains, of the north-east
                    portion of the colony, and of moist gullies is wonderfully diversified. The
                    alpine plants of the south, occurring at an elevation of from 4000 to 6000 feet
                    above the level of the sea, show an affinity for the flora of Tasmania, many
                    plants being common to both colonies, whilst ten species at least are identical
                    with those of Europe. In the northern parts of the colony the character of the
                    vegetation is semi-tropical, similar in some respects to that of India. And
                    then, again, in moist and shady gullies, or on the ranges of the mountains,
                    treeferns rising to 50 feet, large climbers of the <hi rend="italic">Vitis</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Lyonsia</hi> genus, orchids of singular forms and various
                    habits, and mosses, lichens, and fungi may be found in great profusion. In good
                    seasons the interior is well supplied with splendid grasses, but when droughts
                    prevail and the usual pasture fails, sheep aud cattle find sustenance in
                    salsolaceous bushes, the hardy composites, and plants of the geranium or
                    umbelliferous kind. The <hi rend="italic">Casuarinas,</hi> which prevail more or
                    less from the coast to the far interior, are almost exclusively Australasian,
                    some rising to be lofty trees, and others forming brushes on the mountains. Here
                    there is a genus differing from others in the strangely-jointed stems of the
                    species, their minute whorled leaves, and the peculiar growth of their wood; and
                    there, again, is the perplexing tree <hi rend="italic">Alchomea ilid∙
                    folia,</hi> celebrated as having reproduced itself for many generations from
                    female plants alone. In the northern specimens male flowers have been found, but
                    not so in those near Sydney. <hi rend="italic">Bxocarpus cupressiformis, or</hi>
                    the “native cherry,” is another anomalous shrub, having, as it is said, its
                    fruit outside, or more properly raised on an obconical pedicel, which becomes
                    thick, red, and esculent. In most countries the labiates are herbs or
                    undershrubs, but in New South Wales there is. a large genus of the order <hi
                    rend="italic">(Prostanthera)</hi> which has species of considerable size,
                    abounding in scented and volatile oils, and adorned with a profusion of elegant
                    flowers. The <hi rend="italic">Stylideae</hi> are not largely represented in
                    Eastern Australia, but the species are very singular. The column in which the
                    stamens and style are blended is remarkable for its irritability, and is
                    scarcely like anything in the vegetable kingdom, excepting perhaps some of the
                    orchids. So also in the <hi rend="italic">Goodeniacese,</hi> which number nearly
                    50 species, there is a peculiar covering on the stigma, the object of which is
                    yet a mystery. The monocotyledonous plants are between 600 and 700, and of these
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cyperaceae, Graminaceae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orchidaceae</hi> are the most abundant. Some of the orchids are highly prized
                    for the singularity of their structure and the elegance of their flowers, whilst
                    the gigantic lily <hi rend="italic">(Doryanthes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >excelsa)</hi> has been an object of interest from the earliest days of the
                    colony. Of the palms, five species extend to New South Wales. The walking-stick
                    palm <hi rend="italic">(Kentia monostachya)</hi> occurs in the north, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptychosperma Cunninghami</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Livistona
                    australis</hi> extend to Illawarra.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> As New South Wales has no natural boundary except
                    the Pacific, there are no organic types which characterize this colony in the
                    same degree as the marsupials, proteads, eucalypte, and acacias distinguish the
                    Australian region as a whole. In this respect neither do its northern districts
                    differ from South Queensland nor its southern from north-east Victoria, while
                    its west is uniform with the rest of the great continental plain. With this
                    proviso, New South Wales may be justly regarded as the typical region of East
                    Australia. It is made up of three strips, each a subregion in itself—the coast,
                    the dividing range and its plateaus, and the lower western plains. The coast
                    ranges, bathed by a heated oceanic current, shelter a warm and moist sea margin,
                    in which as far as 34° 40' S. lat. we find jungles of palms, figs, nettletrees,
                    and a host of other sub-tropical plants, haunted by talegallas, fruit pigeons,
                    flying foxes, &amp;c.; the table-lands enjoy an essentially temperate climate;
                    and in the plains of the interior the scanty rainfall imposes further
                    restrictions on animal and vegetable life.</p>
                <p>The indigenous mammals are all marsupial, with the exception of a few bate and
                    rodents, and even among these <hi rend="italic">Hydromys</hi> is peculiar. This
                    indicates permanent isolation since Mesozoic time. The dingo was doubtless
                    introduced by man, while whales and seals belong to no coast in particular. The
                    dugong <hi rend="italic">(Halicore)</hi> is not found south of Moreton Bay. Many
                    extinct marsupials, belonging to Australian types, but of gigantic size, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Diprotodon, Nototherium, Thylacoleo,</hi> with huge kangaroos, are
                    found in Pleistocene deposits. With them are associated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thyladnus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sarcophilus,</hi> now restricted to

                    kangaroos, found in Australia. All other genera of marsupials are represented in
                    New South Wales. The flying ’possum <hi rend="italic">(Petaurista),</hi> tiger

                    and invertebrates, the region is naturally intermediate between the Indo-Pacific
                    and South Australian districts, partly limited indeed on the south by the cold
                    waters of Bass’s Straits, but quite open to the north; hence the fauna is rich
                    and various.—The number and variety of the insects of New South Wales is well
                    known. The most distinct types are probably in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coleoptera,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">Carenum, Anoplognathus,
                    Stigmodera,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amycterus</hi> form very important groups

                    are comparatively few, restricted to the coast, and of Indian types. In like
                    manner the land and freshwater molluscs, numerous to the north and east, become
                    rarer towards the south and west.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.—</hi> Up to the present time but little enterprise
                    has been displayed in developing the extensive sea-fisheries of the colony. The
                    fish as a rule are shore-fish, and are not commonly met at a greater distance
                    from the coast than 3 or 4 leagues, or in a greater depth of water than
                    40'fathoms. The line-fish, such as Schnappers, teraglin, king-fish, rock cod,
                    morwong, and other forms, are generally found in the neighbourhood of reefs, or
                    rocky patches off headlands and in offings; while the net-fish, such as mullet
                    (of various kinds), black and silver bream (or tarwhine), whiting, black-fish,
                    gar-fish, flounders, flathead, tailors, and travally, are obtained on inshore
                    beaches or flats of the many inlets and rivers which break the coast-line. No
                    gadoids or codfish have as yet been found, nor any larger flat fish than
                    flounders and soles. The chief freshwater fish are the Murray cod and the golden
                    and common river perch. Freshwater herrings abound in the eastern rivers, also
                    eels, but they are not much sought <pb break="no"

                    appear to be three varieties, the mud oyster, the drift, and the rock or
                    foreshore oyster. The drift and rock oyster are in season all the year round in
                    some fisheries, and in quality almost, if not quite, equal the ‘ ‘ natives” of
                    Whitstable. Lobsters also abound on the coast, especially where there is good
                    cover afforded by kelpy rocks. Shrimps are not found, but prawns of large size
                    and excellent quality are abundant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.</hi> —Sydney, the capital, seated on the magnificent
                    harbour of Port Jackson, is well posted to gather the commerce of the Southern
                    Pacific, its position corresponding with that of San Francisco on the opposite
                    coast of the Northern Pacific. The fiscal policy of the colony has been
                    generally, though not rigidly, one of free trade, and this has greatly helped to
                    make Sydney the chief emporium of Australasia. The total value of the trade in
                    1882 was very nearly £38,000,000, the imports exceeding the exports by
                    £4,500,000. The intercolonial trade accounts for about one-third of the imports,
                    and that with the United Kingdom for nearly one-half, the import from foreign
                    states being about one-tenth. The export trade with foreign states is below
                    one-thirteenth of the whole. The great items of export consist of wool, skins,
                    leather, hides, and tallow. To the neighbouring colony of Victoria there is a
                    very large export of sheep and cattle. Next to the produce of the pastoral
                    industry comes the produce of the mining industry, consisting of gold, coin,
                    tin, copper, and coal. Other articles are of minor importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> These, with one small and detached exception,
                    are entirely in the hands of the Government, and nearly all the capital has been
                    raised in England. They are under the management of a commissioner, subject to
                    the general superintendence of the minister for public works. The whole system
                    is divided into three groups, the southern, the western, and the northern, with
                    their respective branches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">telegraph and, Postal Service.—</hi> The telegraph and postal
                    systems are entirely in the hands of the Government. Every important Slace in
                    the colony is within the range of both services, and New outh Wales unites with
                    New Zealand in subsidizing the mail route between Sydney and San Francisco.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Banks.—</hi> There are thirteen joint-stock banks, five of them
                    being Anglo-Australian, four intercolonial, with their headquarters in Sydney,
                    three branches of intercolonial banks, having their headquarters elsewhere, and
                    two belonging exclusively to the colony. In 1882 the average note circulation
                    was about £1,500,000, and the coin and bullion held about £3,000,000. There is a
                    savings bank with its branches, under Government management, besides a savings
                    bank department attached to the post-office, and the total deposits in 1882
                    amounted to £2,600,000, the depositors numbering over 70,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shipping. —</hi> The coasting and intercolonial trade sustains
                    a dozen steamship companies, and the trade of nearly all the great ocean lines
                    of steamers converges at Sydney, where the convenience for coaling is greatest.
                    Mort’s Dock is capable of accommodating most of the large steamers that visit
                    the port. The Government possesses another dock of equal size at Biloela, and is
                    constructing another capable of taking in the largest ironclad. There are
                    several private slips, and repairs of any kind can be executed. The headquarters
                    of the imperial navy are in Port Jackson, where the admiralty has a dépôt.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The political constitution of New South
                    Wales is that of a self-governing British colony, and rests on the provisions of
                    the Constitution Act. The governor is appointed by the crown, the term of office
                    being generally for five years, and the salary £7000. The governor is the
                    official medium of communication between the colonial Government and the
                    secretary for the colonies, but at the same time the colony maintains its own
                    agent-general in London, who not only sees to all its commercial business, but
                    communicates with the colonial office. In the legislative assembly there are
                    more than one hundred members. The number is not fixed, because the Electoral
                    Act provides that electorates in which the votes have increased beyond a
                    stipulated number shall be permanently entitled to additional representation.
                    The principle adopted in distributing the representation is that of equal
                    electoral districts, modified, however, by a preference given to the distant and
                    rural constituencies at the cost of the metropolitan electorates. The. suffrage
                    qualification is a residence of six months, or the possession of a small landed
                    property. The upper house or legislative council consists exclusively of persons
                    nominated for life by the governor, with the advice of the executive council.
                    The number is not fixed, but it is understood that, except in cases of
                    emergency, the number shall not exceed one-half of that of the legislative
                    assembly, and that no appointments shall be made during the sitting of
                    parliament. The parliaments are triennial.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Revenue.—</hi> The revenue is officially classed under three
                    principal heads, as derived from taxation, from public services, and from land,
                    of which the first yields the least. This is nearly all derived from the
                    custom-house, and principally from the duties on alcoholic liquors, tobacco in
                    its various forms, and groceries. Stamps and licences are the only form of
                    direct taxation. The municipal system, being of voluntary adoption, has been
                    only partially applied, a very large proportion of works of improvement being
                    executed by the general Government. The receipts from land are large; the policy
                    which should regulate the alienation of land is a standing subject of political
                    controversy. At the end of 1882 nearly 36,000,000 acres had been alienated, the
                    unsold portion being leased by the Government to graziers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The educational system was originally that of
                    subsidizing the four principal churches, to which were made grants of land for
                    school purposes, as well as annual endowments. Subsequently a national system in
                    imitation of the Irish system was established, and the two were separately
                    worked by a national board and a denominational board respectively. These two
                    boards were abolished in 1866, and a public school board appointed to
                    superintend all schools, both national and denominational. Finally this board,
                    was abolished, and in 1880 all primary schools were placed under the immediate
                    control of a minister for education, and it was arranged that grants to
                    denominational schools should cease at the end of the year 1882. There is one
                    grammar school for boys only in Sydney, sustained by the state, but by a recent
                    Act high schools for both sexes are to be established all over the colony. The
                    university, which was built by the state, and which receives an endowment of
                    £10,000 a year, gives lectures and confers degrees in arts, laws, medicine, and
                    science. Adjoining the university is the Prince Alfred Hospital, the medical
                    teaching in which is partly under the control of the university senate. Attached
                    to the university are three affiliated colleges, one belonging to the Church of
                    England, one to the Church of Rome, and one to the Presbyterian Church. In
                    addition to the examinations for degrees, the senate holds a senior and a junior
                    examination each year for the use of schools for both sexes. Private munificence
                    has supplied many bursaries and scholarships. Mechanics’ institutes and schools
                    of art receive an annual subsidy in proportion to their subscriptions, and an
                    extensive scheme for technical classes is being organized.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The official estimate of the population at
                    the close of 1882 was 817,000. The previous census was taken on April 3, 1881,
                    and the population was then 751,468 (411,149 males and 340,319 females),—an
                    increase since 1871 of 247,487, or 48 per cent. The persons born in the colony
                    numbered 465,559, while 208,512 had come from Great Britain, Ireland, and other
                    British possessions. The Catholics were about two-seVenths of the population,
                    being 207,606 as against 516,512 Protestants. Nearly every religious sect is
                    represented, and the estimated attendance at public worship on Sunday was
                    221,031. There is no state church.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The early history of New South Wales was for
                    many years that of Australasia, and it has little more interest than what
                    pertains to the philosophy of penal settlements. It was a distant prison
                    maintained at the imperial cost. The commercial epoch began when Captain
                    Macarthur found that the climate was suited to the growth of fine wool. The
                    first sheep came from the Cape, mixed with a few from India. He got together a
                    flock of 1000, and noticed that even in his mongrel flock careful culling and
                    breeding led to a, great improvement in the wool, and this set him on
                    considering the importance of having good rams. The fortunate arrival in the
                    colony from the Cape of some fine-woolled sheep of the Escurial breed gave him
                    the opportunity of adding three rams and five ewes to his flock, which he
                    subsequently further improved on a visit to England, by purchasing some of King
                    George III.’s stock at Kew. The stud flock he thus formed, and which was kept at
                    Camden for fifty years, laid the basis of an expansive industry. From that time
                    the colony had an export. The growth of livestock quickly overtook the demands
                    of the local population for meat, and then another colonist, Mr O’Brien, made
                    the discovery that if sheep were worth nothing for meat they were worth
                    something for tallow, and boiling down became the destiny of all the surplus
                    stock. This waste of meat was suddenly stopped when the next great epoch in the
                    history of the colony was opened up by the discovery of gold. Victoria soon
                    outstripped the mother-colony by its superior attractions in this respect, but
                    New South Wales gained the enormous advantage of having its pastoral industry
                    stimulated and made more profitable. The unoccupied country became worth taking
                    up, till every portion of the territory that was at all occupiable was leased.
                    The political government was at first necessarily a strictly military one, but
                    as the number of the freed men and their children increased, and the number of
                    free settlers increased also, the demand for some form of representative
                    government arose, and became irresistible. A legislative council was
                    established, partly nominative and partly elective. Coincidently with this grew
                    up a demand that transportation should cease, and the agitation on this question
                    has been the only serious conflict between the colony and the mother-country. It
                    was ended by the mother-country yielding, and transportation was somewhat
                    reluctantly abolished in 1853. At about the same time the mixed legislative
                    council was superseded by the existing parliamentary system of two houses and
                    responsible government, under which the colony has prospered contentedly ever
                    since. (A. GA.) <pb break="no"
