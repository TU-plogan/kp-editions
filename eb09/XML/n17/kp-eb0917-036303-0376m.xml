                    pain,</hi> is a term which is frequently employed both technically and popularly
                    in a somewhat loose manner, to describe pains the origin of which is not clearly
                    traceable. In its strict sense it denotes the existence of pain in some portion
                    or throughout the whole of the distribution of a nerve without any distinctly
                    recognizable structural change in the nerve or nerve centres. This strict
                    definition, if adhered to, however, would not be applicable to a large number of
                    cases of neuralgia; for it is well known that in not a few instances the pain is
                    connected with some source of irritation, by pressure or otherwise, in the
                    course of the affected nerve; and hence the word is generally used to indicate
                    pain affecting a particular nerve or its branches from any cause. There are few
                    ailments which give rise to greater human suffering than neuralgia, and some of
                    the chief causes concerned in its production, or the conditions most frequently
                    found associated with it, may be briefly alluded to.</p>
                <p>It may be stated generally that neuralgia rarely occurs in the midst of good
                    health. On the contrary its existence usually betokens a depressed or enfeebled
                    state. Constitutional conditions inherited or acquired are among the most
                    powerful of the predisposing influences in the production of neuralgia. Thus it
                    is often found to affect the hereditarily rheumatic or gouty. In weakened
                    conditions of the system from improper or insufficient food, or as a result of
                    any drain upon the body, or in anaemia from any cause, and in certain disease
                    poisons, such as syphilis or malaria, neuralgia is a frequent concomitant
                    Further, any strain upon the nervous system, such as mental overwork or anxiety,
                    is a predisposing cause of recognized potency. Among the exciting causes of an
                    attack of neuralgia by far the most common is exposure to cold and damp, which
                    seems to excite irritation in a nerve already predisposed to suffer. But
                    irritation may be produced by numerous other causes besides this,—such as a
                    decayed tooth, diseased bone, local inflammations in which nerves are
                    implicated, by some source of pressure upon a nerve trunk, or by swelling of its
                    sheath in its passage through a bony canal or at its exit upon the surface.
                    Further, there would appear to be causes of a reflex character which are capable
                    of setting up neuralgia at a distance, such as intestinal or uterine
                    derangements. The practical importance of ascertaining the probable nature of
                    the cause is obvious.</p>
                <p>The pain of neuralgia is generally localized, but may come to extend beyond the
                    immediate area of its first occurrence. It is usually of paroxysmal character,
                    and not unfrequently periodic, occurring at a certain time of the day or night.
                    It varies in intensity, being often of the most agonizing character, or less
                    severe and more of a tingling kind. Various forms of perverted nerve function
                    may be found co-existing with or following neuralgia. Thus there may be
                    hyperaesthesia, anaesthesia, paralysis, or alterations of nutrition, such as
                    wasting of muscles, whitening of the hair, &amp;c. Attacks of neuralgia are
                    liable to recur, particularly when the general health is low, and some persons
                    unhappily continue to suffer from occasional attacks during the greater part of
                    their lifetime.</p>
                <p>The nature of the disease and its manifestations will be best understood by a
                    reference to the forms in which neuralgia most commonly shows itself. These are
                    facial neuralgia or tic douloureux, migraine (hemicrania or brow ague),
                    intercostal neuralgia, and sciatica. Other forms, such as those affecting the
                    neck, arm, &amp;c., are described, but they are of less frequent occurrence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Facial neuralgia,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tic doloureux,</hi>
                    is one of the most common forms of neuralgia, and one of the most severe. It
                    affects the great nerve of sensation of the face (fifth nerve), and may occur in
                    one or more of the three divisions in which the nerve is distributed. It is
                    usually confined to one side. Females suffer, on the whole, more frequently than
                    males, and adults or young persons more than children or the aged. Among the
                    more prominent conditions asso-dated<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0377-0364"/> with it may be mentioned a low state of health as
                    a result of previous disease, any drain upon the system (such as excessive
                    menstruation, over-lactation, &amp;c. ), and, very specially, over-exertion of
                    body or mind and mental anxiety. It is occasionally associated with epilepsy
                    (Trousseau). The attack is often precipitated by the irritation of a decayed
                    tooth or by exposure to cold air. When the first or upper division of the nerve
                    is involved, the pain is mostly felt in the forehead and side of the head. It is
                    usually of an intensely sharp, cutting, or burning character, either constant or
                    with exacerbations, and often periodic, returning at a certain hour each day
                    while the attack continues. Occasionally the paroxysms are of extreme violence,
                    and are brought on by the slightest provocation, such as a draught of cool air.
                    The skin over the affected part is often red and swollen, and, even after the
                    attack has abated, feels stiff and tender to the touch. In this, as in all forms
                    of neuralgia, there are certain localities where the pain is more intense, these
                    “painful points,” as they are called, being for the most part in those places
                    where the branches of the nerves emerge from bony canals or pierce the fascia to
                    ramify in the skin. Hence, in this form, the greater severity of the pain above
                    the eyebrow and along the side of the nose. There is also pain in the eyelid,
                    redness of the eye, and flow of tears. When the second division of the nerve is
                    affected the pain is chiefly in the cheek and upper jaw, the painful points
                    being immediately below the lower eyelid, over the cheek bone, and about the
                    upper lip. When the third division of the nerve suffers the pain affects the
                    lower jaw, and the chief painful points are in front of the ear and about the
                    chin. As a result of this malady important nutritive disturbances may appear in
                    the affected area, such as thickening of the tissues, falling out or blanching
                    of hair, &amp;c., as well as various alterations of sensibility. Attacks of tic
                    douloureux, extremely distressing as they are, may recur occasionally for years;
                    and, although, by depriving the sufferer of sleep and interfering with the
                    taking of food, they may in some measure impair the health, they rarely appear
                    to lead to any serious results.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hemicrania,</hi><hi rend="italic">migraine, brow-ague,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">sick headache</hi> are various terms employed to describe what
                    appears to be another form of neuralgia, notwithstanding the opinion of some
                    that it is a different kind of disease. The causes giving rise to it appear to
                    be similar to those which bring about any of the forms of neuralgia. In some
                    instances it would seem to be hereditary. It most frequently affects females,
                    and generally occurs in early life, tending to disappear as age advances. An
                    attack may come on suddenly, but, in general, begins by a dull aching pain in
                    the brow or temple, which steadily increases in severity and extent, but remains
                    usually limited to one side of the head. It attains at times an extreme degree
                    of violence, and is apt to be aggravated by movement, loud noises, or bright
                    light Accompanying the pain there is more or less of nausea, and when the attack
                    reaches its height vomiting may occur, after which relief comes, especially if
                    sleep supervene. An attack of this kind may last for a few hours or for a whole
                    day, and after it is over the patient feels comparatively well. It may recur
                    periodically, or, as is more common, at irregular intervals. During the
                    paroxysms, or even preceding them, certain sensory disturbances may be
                    experienced, more especially affections of vision, such as ocular spectra,
                    hemiopia, diplopia, &amp;c.; and there is also apt to be considerable mental
                    depression.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Intercostal neuralgia</hi> is pain affecting the nerves which
                    emerge from the spinal cord and run along the spaces between the ribs to the
                    front of the body. This form of neuralgia affects the left side more than the
                    right, is much more common in women than in men, and occurs generally in
                    enfeebled states of health. It might be mistaken for pleurisy or some
                    inflammatory affection of the lungs; but the absence of any chest symptoms, its
                    occurrence independently of the acts of respiration, and other considerations
                    well establish the distinction. The specially painful points are chiefly at the
                    commencement of the nerve as it issues from the spinal canal, and at the
                    extremities towards the front of the body, where it breaks up into filaments
                    which ramify in the skin. This form of neuralgia is occasionally the precursor
                    of an attack of shingles <hi rend="italic">{Herpes zoster)</hi> as well as a
                    result of it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sciatica</hi> is another of the more common forms of neuralgia.
                    It affects the great sciatic nerve which emerges from the pelvis and runs down
                    the leg to the foot. It is in most instances traceable to exposure to cold or
                    damp, to overuse of the limbs in walking, &amp;c.; but there are many other
                    possible causes. Any source of pressure upon the nerve within the pelvis, such
                    as may be produced by a tumour or even by constipation of the bowels, may excite
                    an attack of sciatica. It is often connected with a rheumatic or gouty
                    constitution. In general the nerve of one side only is affected. The pain which
                    is felt at first a little behind the hip-joint steadily increases in severity
                    and extends along the course of the nerve and its branches in many instances as
                    far as the toes. The specially painful points are about the knee and ankle
                    joints; besides which a feeling of numbness is experienced throughout the whole
                    limb, la severe cases all movement of the limb aggravates the pain, and the
                    patient is obliged to remain in bed. In prolonged attacks the limb may waste and
                    be drawn up and fixed in one position. Attacks of sciatica are often attended
                    with great suffering, and are apt to be very intractable to treatment.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of all forms of neuralgia it is of first importance to ascertain
                    if possible whether any constitutional morbid condition is associated with the
                    malady, for otherwise the most powerful and approved remedies will often fail.
                    Thus, if evidence of rheumatism, gout, anaemia, &amp;c., be present, treatment
                    appropriate to these conditions must be employed.</p>
                <p>Of means available for the relief of the pain the number is so great that any
                    detailed statement would be impossible in a general notice like the present.
                    Only the more approved and potent remedial measures can be alluded to. The
                    internal administration of narcotics and sedatives often succeeds in quelling
                    the attack and procuring sleep. Among these the various preparations of opium,
                    belladonna, henbane, chloral, croton-chloral, bromide of potassium, the bromide
                    and chloride of ammonium, aconite, gelsemium, &amp;c., are most commonly
                    employed; but to many of them, such as opium and chloral, there exists the
                    serious objection of the risk of the acquisition of the habit of indulgence in
                    them.</p>
                <p>When the attack is periodic the administration of a large dose of quinine two or
                    three hours previous to the usual time of the seizure will often mitigate, and
                    may even prevent, the paroxysm. In migraine, caffein and its preparations are
                    recommended. Many topical applications are of great efficacy. The various
                    liniments or ointments containing the preparations of opium, belladonna, or
                    aconite rubbed into the affected part will often soothe the most severe local
                    pain. An excellent sedative application is a lotion composed of equal parts of
                    camphor and chloral painted or gently rubbed over the painful area. In many
                    cases relief may be obtained by the hypodermic injection of morphia or atropia,
                    by acupuncture, by blisters, or by counter-irritation with the button
                    cautery.</p>
                <p>The plan at one time resorted to of dividing or excising a portion of the
                    affected nerve is now seldom employed, but the operation of nerve-stretching has
                    been recently introduced, and in some forms of neuralgia, notably sciatica, is
                    sometimes successful. It consists in cutting down upon and exposing the nerve,
                    and in seizing hold and drawing upon it so as to stretch it. Such an operation
                    is obviously justifiable only in cases where other less severe measures have
                    failed to give relief. The employment of electricity, either in the form of
                    faradization or galvanism, has much to recommend it, and in long continued and
                    intractable forms of neuralgia proves in many instances eminently serviceable.
