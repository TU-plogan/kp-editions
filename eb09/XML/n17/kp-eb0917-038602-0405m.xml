                <p><label type="entry">NEW GUINEA</label>, the largest island in the world
                    (excluding Australia), lies immediately north of Australia, between 0° 25' and
                    10° 40' S. lat. and between 130° 50' and 150° 35' E. long. It is 1490 miles
                    long, with a maximum breadth of 430 miles, its area being about 306,000 square
                    miles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>That of Borneo is
                    about 286,000.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> It was
                    probably in Miocene times, if not later, united to Australia; the average depth
                    of Torres Straits, which are 80 miles wide, is only 8 or 9 fathoms, and the
                    maximum 20,—three-fourths of the distance being occupied by coral reefs, a
                    prolongation of the great eastern barrier reef of Australia. At either end of
                    New Guinea a few large islands, with a number of smaller islets, are only
                    separated from the mainland by narrow channels. From difficulties connected with
                    the navigation, the climate, and the people, the coasts are still imperfectly
                    surveyed, while of the interior, relatively to its vast extent, very little is
                    known. At the north-west end the deep M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Cluer
                    Inlet almost cuts off a great peninsula of some 200 by 115 miles, while this
                    inlet and another farther south almost if not entirely insulate the great tract
                    known as Onin. The south coast, from Cape Bourou westwards, is mostly
                    precipitous, limestone cliffs rising several hundred feet, with dense forest and
                    a mountainous country behind. There are occasional tracts of flat swampy ground,
                    and the steep coast-line is besides broken by some large rivers, whose banks for
                    some distance inland are usually swampy. Off M <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi>
                    Cluer Gulf are numbers of curious mushroom-shaped islands with sea-worn
                    bases.</p>
                <p>The north coasts are sometimes level, as at parts of Geelvink Bay and the
                    extensive delta of the great Amberno river, at Walckenaar and Humboldt Bays, and
                    farther east towards Cape della Torre, near which, and near Huon Gulf, there are
                    large rivers; otherwise the shores are steep-to, and apparently rising, with
                    promontories jutting 20 to 40 miles out, and some good harbours. There is no
                    barrier reef off this coast. High distant mountains are observed at every
                    opening, those towards the east rising in successive and highly fertile terraces
                    to some 13,000 feet. No active volcanoes have as yet been observed on the
                    mainland, but Mr W. Powell reports masses of pumice on the slopes of the
                    Finisterre mountains. Severe earthquakes, too, occur on the north side, and
                    there is a line of volcanic activity parallel to this coast some 20 to 50 miles
                    distant. Near its east end are the D’Entrecasteaux Islands (7000 feet), richly
                    wooded, with rocks of raised coral and boiling alkaline springs. Cape Bourou
                    appears to be the extremity of the lofty Charles Louis range, over 16,000 feet,
                    the tops of which seem from the distance to be snow-covered. East from Cape
                    Bourou the mountains recede out of sight, the sea is shallow, and the flat
                    mangrove-covered coast is intersected by creeks and rivers laden with mud, as
                    far as the Gulf of Papua, where Signor D’Albertis reports that he steamed 500
                    miles up the Fly river, probably one of several channels draining a vast swamp
                    country between the mountains and the sea. He found the tropical forest scenery
                    varied by treeless plains, with isolated hills rising from them, like the
                    islands in the neighbouring Torres Straits from the sea. These tracts are
                    Australian in character. The hills probably escaped the submersion which,
                    besides forming Torres Straits, covered the surrounding country, and thus
                    remained as nuclei of an Australian flora,—the plains, on <pb break="no"

                    by the tropical vegetation from the westward. Beyond Redscar Head in the Gulf of
                    Papua the country again rises, having an Australian appearance,—open grassy
                    hills with scattered timber sloping to the coast, which is here skirted by a
                    barrier reef with occasional openings, affording good shelter to vessels.
                    Inland, densely wooded hills and valleys with rivers and rich cultivable soil
                    are backed by the great Owen Stanley range (13,000 feet), which terminates at
                    the east forks in bluffs 2000 feet high.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> Of the geology of New Guinea little is known. In
                    the north-west the Arfak mountains are mainly granite and gneiss. Near Geelvink
                    Bay dark limestones occur, apparently ancient, and stratified clay slates.
                    Bismuth is found here at Moom. Miosnom island, opposite, is volcanic. Raised
                    coral is frequent on this (north) coast, and the streams bring down pebbles of
                    plutonic rocks and sandstones. Clay ironstone is found at Humboldt Bay, on the
                    river Jakata near M ’ Cluer Gulf, and at Lakahia Island, and a Tertiary coal
                    (lignite) at Lakahia and in Galewo Strait. On the east side of the Gulf of Papua
                    the coast range is of recent limestone. At Hall Sound calcareous clays from the
                    Lower Miocene contain fossil shells identical with those found in Victoria and
                    South Australia. Small fragments and pebbles, sent from Redscar and Astrolabe
                    Bays (probably coming from the great central range), consisting of mica slate,
                    quartz, sandstones, greenstones, and jasperoid rocks, are undistinguishable from
                    those of the Devonian and Silurian series of the gold-fields of New South Wales.
                    A black magnetic-iron sand (with traces of gold) and plumbago are reported from
                    this (south-east) coast. Some of the Torres Straits islands are of raised coral,
                    others of stratified sandstones with huge overlying blocks of the same and
                    conglomerates, others volcanic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of the coast is unhealthy,
                    especially during the transition between the monsoons, which is long and
                    irregular owing to the action of the high mountain ranges on these winds. The
                    heat is tempered by the heavy rainfall, discharged by the north-west monsoon
                    chiefly in the west and north; the south-east monsoon also is often wet,
                    especially in the east and south districts. Torres Straits are healthier, though
                    the heat is great and the amount of salt in the air is trying to many. From July
                    to September the force of the south-east monsoon there is such that even
                    steamers cannot always face it and the tide together.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora. —</hi> The flora is mainly that of the Indian
                    Archipelago, which predominates even in the islands of Torres Straits; but on
                    the shores of the Gulf of Papua, and inland, Australian vegetation is
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus,</hi> acacias, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pandanus</hi>; and Australian types are found as far north as Humboldt Bay.
                    Over great part of New Guinea dense forests prevail, clothing the mountains to a
                    height of several thousand feet, the timber of enormous height, though the
                    species are fewer than in the great islands of the archipelago. Among them
                    various kinds of <hi rend="italic">Ficus, Casuarina, Araucaria, Dammara,

                    vegetation poor. Of the smaller growths are great reeds and grasses covering the

                    everywhere; the sago-palm grows wild in abundance in the swamps, and in the
                    north-west each hill tribe, apparently to avoid collisions, draws its supplies
                    from a different district of the coast. They have also in the hills a tree
                    called “sali,” with top and pith resembling sago. Tobacco of good quality is
                    brought down from the interior, and an illustrious antiquity is claimed for the
                    plant by a tradition which describes it as the miraculous fruit of a woman named
                    Heva. In some places the kava of the Pacific <hi rend="italic">{Piper

                    of pig, some mice, and various <hi rend="italic">Pteropidse,</hi> four families
                    of marsupials, all Australian, viz., <hi rend="italic">Dasyuridae, Peramélidae,
                    Macropodidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phalangistidas,</hi> with nine species
                    Among them are a <hi rend="italic">Dendrolagus</hi> or tree-kangaroo and several
                    cuscus. There are also two echidnas. The large animals reported by travellers
                    may possibly be gigantic marsupials akin to those found fossil in the Queensland
                    Pleistocene. The wealth and beauty of the avifauna are great. Count Salvador!
                    gives 1028 species, belonging to 321 genera, for the Papuan subregion <hi
                    rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> from the Solomon Islands westwards to, but excluding,
                    Celebes). Of these about 470 are peculiar to New Guinea and the adjacent
                    islands, including Aru. The more numerous and important genera are pre-eminently
                    Australian in character, with many species peculiarly developed. There is also,
                    as might be expected, a considerable number of Malayan forms, some common to the
                    whole region, some only found here and at other far distant spots in it. The
                    most remarkable orders, besides the birds of paradise, which are only found in
                    New Guinea and the neighbouring islands, are the honeysuckers, flycatchers,
                    parrots, kingfishers, and pigeons, all rich in special forms. Birds of prey are
                    rare; vultures, pheasants, woodpeckers, and finches absent. Mr Wallace
                    attributes the unusually large number of “beautiful” birds, 50 per cent, of the
                    whole, to the numbers of parrots, lories, cockatoos, pigeons, and kingfishers,
                    and to the absence of thrushes, shrikes, warblers, and other dull-coloured
                    groups. Of snakes, which may migrate freely on floating timber, we find out of
                    24 genera (belonging to 11 families) 6 Oriental, 4 Australian, and only 4
                    specially Papuan; of lizards 3 families with 24 genera, of which only 3 are
                    peculiarly Oriental, 3 Australian, 6 Papuan. The <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi>
                    (6 families with 8 genera), for which the salt water is a barrier, have no
                    western affinities, and those not of wide distribution are almost exclusively
                    Australian,—a fact of obvious geological significance. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera</hi> are numerous and singularly beautiful, as are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> which Mr Wallace says often display the metallic
                    lustre characteristic of the plumage of the New Guinea birds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population consists of à great number of
                    isolated tribes, differing much in appearance and language. The level of
                    civilization varies, but seldom reaches even the average Pacific standard.</p>
                <p>They have no single name for New Guinea, nor any idea of its extent, only using
                    terms signifying “great land,” to distinguish it from the adjacent islands or
                    from Australia.</p>
                <p>The name Papùa is a Malayan term signifying frizzled, in reference to the hair;
                    and, as distinguishing the peoples so characterized from the Australians, the
                    term “Papuan” is by some writers thought more suitable than “Melanesian,” <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n409/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0409-0388"/> while equally distinguishing the race from the
                    brown Polynesians. The type of man known as Papuan or Melanesian (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Melanesia)</hi> is found here in its greatest purity, and
                    app⅛rs to occupy the whole island excepting its east extremity. But among tribes
                    occupying so wide an area, having little intercommunication, and with other
                    races at no great distance, many deviations from the normal type must be
                    expected, and in fact it is not very easy to define this type. Its leading
                    characteristics are— a medium height; fleshy rather than muscular frame; colour
                    a sooty brown, varying, but decidedly darker than the Malay; high but narrow and
                    rather retreating forehead, with thick brows; nose sometimes flat and wide at
                    the nostrils, but offener hooked and “Jewish,” with depressed point, a feature
                    represented in their karwars or ancestral images; prognathism general, but not
                    universal; lips thick and projecting, so as to make the chin seem retreating;
                    high cheek bones; hair black, frizzly, trained into a mop. The appearance ⅛ thus
                    negroid, and is said to resemble the population of the African coast opposite
                    Aden. But in the Arfak mountains in the north-west, and at points on the west
                    and north coasts and adjacent islands, very degraded and stunted tribes are
                    found, with hardly the elements of social organization (possibly the aboriginal
                    race unmixed with foreign elements), and resembling the Aetas or Negritos of the
                    Philippines, and other kindred tribes in the Malay Archipelago. On the banks of
                    the Fly river D’Albertis observed at least two widely differing types, those on
                    its upper course bearing some resemblance to the tribes of the eastern coast.
                    Here, wedged in among the ruder Papuans, who reappear at. the extremity of the
                    peninsula, we find a very different-looking people, whom competent observers,
                    arguing from appearance, language, and customs, assert to be a branch of the
                    fair Polynesian race. But there are obvious signs among them of much admixture
                    of blood; and they or their congeners again may easily have modified their
                    neighbours immediately west of them, just as Malay and other influences have
                    done on the other end of the island. Indeed the greater degree of intelligence
                    and good looks observed at points along the north coast may be due simply to
                    this cause. On the west coasts there is a semi-civilization, due to intercourse
                    with Malays and Bughis, who have settled at various points, and carry on the
                    trade with the neighbouring islands, in some of which, while the coast
                    population is Malay or mixed, that of the interior is identical with the people
                    of the mainland. On the west coasts Mohammedan teaching has also some civilizing
                    effect. Many of the tribes at this west end of New Guinea are, at all events in
                    war time, head-hunters, and in the mountains cannibals. Cannibalism in fact is
                    practised here and there throughout New Guinea. Tho frequent hostility and
                    mistrust of strangers arc partly due to slave-hunting raids and ill-treatment by
                    traders, but the different tribes vary much in character. Thus in the mountains
                    of the north-west the Karons, a short, hardy, well-built people, cultivate very
                    little, living chiefly on wild plants which their women cook in hollow bamboos,
                    and obtaining what they require from without, as knives, ornaments, &amp;c.,
                    either by plunder, or by disposal of slaves or bird skins; while their
                    neighbours the Kebars grow vegetables and very fine tobacco, which they sell to
                    the Amberbaki, a peaceful industrious coast tribe. The mountain tribes are
                    usually despised by their coast neighbours as ruder and more destitute of
                    resources, but when more numerous and fiercer, as in the south of west New
                    Guinea, the tables are turned, and the coast people live in perpetual terror of
                    their neighbours, who plunder and enslave them.</p>
                <p>At Humboldt Bay the people, though uncertain, rude, and warlike, are ready to
                    trade, and tribes of a kindred race are found farther east, at Astrolabe Bay;
                    here the Russian Miklucho Maclay lived among them for some time, and was
                    favourably impressed by them. Still farther east, the plateaus of the Finisterre
                    ranges are highly cultivated and artificially irrigated by a comparatively fair
                    people. Many tribes in the south-west seem to be migratory. At Princess Marianne
                    Straits tribes much wilder than those farther west, naked and painted, swarm
                    like monkeys in their trees, the stems of which are submerged at high tide. But
                    the Torres Straits islanders are employed by Europeans in the pearl shell
                    fishery, and are liked as labourers; andin some of the Ké and Aru Islands the
                    Papuan inhabitants form orderly Christian communities. The people of the
                    south-east peninsula seem generally, like the typical Polynesian, of a mild,
                    accessible type. Englishmen, wandering inland and losing their way, have been
                    found and brought back by them. Their manners are more courteous, their women
                    better treated, than is usual with Papuans, but they show perhaps less ingenuity
                    and artistic taste. Their children, in the mission schools, show much
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>While tribes allied to the Papuan have been traced through Timor, Flores, and the
                    highlands of the Malay Peninsula to the Deccan of India, these “Oriental
                    negroes” have many curious resemblances with some East-African tribes. Besides
                    the appearance of the hair, the raised cicatrices, the belief in omens and
                    sorcery, the extraction of diseases in the form of bits of wood or stone, and
                    the practices for testing the courage of youths, they are equally devoid of
                    forethought or ambition, rude, merry, and boisterous, but amenable to
                    discipline, and with decided artistic tastes and faculty.</p>
                <p>Several of the above practices are also common to tho Australians, who, though
                    generally inferior, have many points of resemblance (osteological and other)
                    with the Papuans. The extinct Tasmanians were more closely allied to the
                    Papuans.</p>
                <p>The constitution of society is everywhere simple. Among the more advanced tribes
                    rank is hereditary, otherwise the chiefs generally have but little power, most
                    matters being settled by the assembly, a contrast to the Polynesian respect for
                    birth and hereditary rank. The Papuan’s religious institutions are likewise
                    simpler; there is no general object of worship, consequently no regular
                    priesthood; the institution of <hi rend="italic">tabu</hi> is less oppressive,
                    and its sanction less awful, but the transgressor may still have to reckon, not
                    only with the society or individual who imposed it, but also with offended
                    spirits. Almost every crime is condoned by payment. A characteristic example of
                    the feeling of the fair race towards the dark was seen in the contempt shown by
                    the tribes of the south-east towards certain Melanesian teachers introduced by
                    the English missionaries, while others brought from the Polynesian islands were
                    treated with respect.</p>
                <p>The Papuan women are, as a rule, more modest than the Polynesian.</p>
                <p>In western New Guinea, according to the Dutch missionaries, there is a vague
                    notion of a universal spirit, practically represented by several malevolent
                    powers, as <hi rend="italic">Manoin,</hi> the most powerful, who resides in the
                    woods; <hi rend="italic">Narwoje</hi> in the clouds, above the trees, a sort of
                    Erl-König who carries off children; <hi rend="italic">Faknik</hi> in the rocks
                    by the sea, who raises storms. As a protection against these the people
                    construct —having first with much ceremony chosen a tree for the purpose—
                    certain rude images called karwars, each representing a recently dead
                    progenitor, whose spirit is then invoked to occupy the image and protect them
                    against their enemies and give success to their undertakings. The karwar is
                    about a foot high, with head disproportionately large; the male figures are
                    sometimes represented with a spear and shield, the female holding a snake. Omens
                    are observed before starting on any expedition; if they are unfavourable the
                    person threatened retires, and another day is chosen and the process repeated.
                    They have magicians and rain-makers, and sometimes resort to ordeal to discover
                    a crime. Temples (so-called) are found in the north and west, built like the
                    houses, but larger, the piles being carved into figures, and the roof-beams and
                    other prominent points decorated with representations of crocodiles or lizards,
                    coarse human figures, and other grotesque ornamentation; but their use is not
                    clear. Neither temples nor images (except small figures worn as amulets) occur
                    among the people of the south-east, whose religious ideas seem vague and
                    rudimentary; but they have a great dread of departed spirits, especially those
                    of the hostile inland tribes, and of a being called Vata, who causes disease and
                    death.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n410/mode/1up"

                <p>The dead are disposed of in various ways. The spirit is supposed not to leave the
                    body immediately, which is either buried for a time and.then taken up and the
                    bones cleaned and deposited in or near the dwelling, or it is exposed with the
                    same object on a platform of -branches,'or dried over a fire, and the mummy kept
                    for a few years. Sometimes the head, oftener the jaw bone, is kept as a relic.
                    Food is placed on a grave,—with an infant a calabash of its mother’s inilk,-and
                    a path is made to the sea that the spirit may bathe; but the spirits are
                    everywhere dreaded as likely to injure the living. No one likes to go about, or
                    into the water, after dark. Little imitation houses are placed in the woods to
                    allure the spirits away. These dwell chiefly in the moon, and are particularly
                    active at full moon. ’ The houses which they haunt, and beneath or near which
                    their bodies lie buried, are deserted from time to time, especially by a
                    newly-married couple, or by women before childbirth. Probably the effluvium from
                    the buried corpse produces the feelings of sickness which are supposed to be
                    caused by the spirit’s presence, and which subside when they leave the spot.</p>
                <p>i Feasting and dances take place on the setting up of a karwar, on the return of
                    warlike and other expeditions, at a marriage, birth, change of name, child’s
                    first hair-cutting, and also some time after a death.</p>
                <p>The chief diseases are skin diseases, with which in some places one-third of the
                    population is affected,—among these a sort of leprosy to which, as well as to a
                    dropsy <hi rend="italic">(beri-bcrι),</hi> Europeans are subject,—catarrhs,
                    boils, syphilis, and intermittent fevers, especially where there is much coral
                    on the coast.</p>
                <p>"The Papuan varies his vegetable diet with the flesh of the wild pig, wallabi,
                    and other small animals, which are hunted with dogs, pirds are snared or limed.
                    Fish abound at many parts of the coast, and are taken by lines, or speared by
                    torchlight, or netted (the netting pattern is the same as ours); or a river is
                    dammed and the (ish stupefied with the root of a milletia. Turtle and dugong are
                    caught. The kima, a great mussel weighing (without shell) 20 to feθ ft, and
                    other shell-ħsh are eaten, as are also dogs, flying foxes, Wizards, beetles, and
                    all kinds of insects, and an edible earth.</p>
                <p>/Food is cooked in various ways, being stewed or roasted, or baked with hot
                    stones as in Polynesia. A third part of sea water, which is carried to the
                    interior in hollow bamboos, is added in place of salt, which is also obtained
                    from the ashes of wood saturated by the sea. The sexes generally eat apart.</p>
                <p>*Their ery scanty clothing is made of the bark of <hi rend="italic">Hibiscus,
                    βroussonetia,</hi> and other plants, or of leaves, and in more civilized parts
                    of cotton. Tight belts and armlets of split rattan and fibre are often worn. The
                    people have usually a great dislike to rain, ⅜nd carry a mat of pandanus leaves
                    as a protection against it.</p>
                <p>'The chief home-made ornaments are necklaces, armlets, and earrings of shells,
                    teeth, or fibre, and cassowary, cockatoo, or bird of paradise feathers,—the last
                    two, or a flower, are worn through the septum of the nose. The hair is frizzed
                    out and decorated variously ∣vith flowers, leaves, feathers, and bamboo combs.
                    Γhe fairer tribes at the east end tattoo, no definite meaning apparently being
                    attached to the pattern, for they welcome suggestions from Manchester. For the
                    women it is simply a decoration. Men are not tattooed till they have killed some
                    one. Raised cicatrices usually take the place of tattooing with the darker
                    races. Rosenberg says the scars on the breast and arms register the number of
                    sea-voyages made.</p>
                <p>The use of the bow and arrow is little known among the eastern tribes. 'The
                    Papuan bow is rather short, the arrows barbed and tipped with cassowary or human
                    bone. Other weapons are a short dart, a heavy spear and shield, stone clubs and
                    axes. They are mostly ignorant of iron, but work skilfully with their axes of
                    stone or tridacna shell, and bone chisels, cutting down trees 20 inches in
                    diameter. Two man working on a tree trunk, one making a cut with the adze
                    lengthwise and the other chopping off the piece across, will soon hollow out a
                    large canoe. Every man has a stone axe, each village generally owning a large
                    one. Their knives are of bamboo hardened by fire. In digging they use the
                    pointed stick.</p>
                <p>The eastern tribes salute by squeezing simultaneously the nose and stomach, and
                    both there and on the north coast friendship is ratified by sacrificing a dog.
                    In other places they wave green branches, and on the south (Papuan) coast pour
                    water over their Reads, a custom noticed by Cook at Mallicolo (New Hebrides).
                    .Among other pets they keep little pigs, which the women suckle.</p>
                <p>The Papuan numerals extend usually to 5 only. In Astrolabe Hay the limit is 6;
                    with the more degraded tribes it is 3, or, as in Torres Straits, they have names
                    only for 1 and 2; 3 is 2 + 1.</p>
                <p>The houses are mostly (so far as is known) built in Malay fashion on piles, and
                    this not only on the coast but on the hill-sides, though the houses there are
                    smaller. Small houses are also found perched high up in trees as a safeguard
                    against enemies and evil spirits, and possibly malaria; and one or two of these
                    in a village act as its fortress or watch-tower.</p>
                <p>The piles support a platform made from old canoes or branches, the whole covered
                    with a rounded or inverted boat-shaped roof thatched with υalm branches,
                    sometimes 500 feet long, and looking inside, when undivided, like a dark
                    tunnel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These large
                    houses, like the custom of head-hunting, are traceable west through Borneo up to
                    the north-east frontier of India, where the custom above-mentioned of exposing
                    the dead also prevails.</p></note> Otherwise the coast houses are 60 to 70 feet
                    long, often more, with a passage down the centre, and the side spaces
                    partitioned off as needed. Each house has a sort of paterfamilias, the rest of
                    the numerous inhabitants being his relations or slaves. A bridge, when the house
                    is over the water, connects it with the land, and near this is sometimes a small
                    jointure house for widows of former occupants, and a separate one for bachelors
                    or for pregnant women. A veranda towards the sea is usually occupied during the
                    day by the men, and one on the land side by the women. The gable ends are often
                    prolonged upwards and carved, and the houses adorned with drawings of animals,
                    and hung round with weapons, and crocodiles’, dogs’, and boars’ teeth. On the
                    north coast, about Astrolabe Bay, the houses are not built on piles; the walls,
                    of bamboo or palm branches, are very low, and the projecting roof nearly reaches
                    the ground; a barrier at the entrance keeps out pigs and dogs. A sort of table
                    or bench stands outside, used by the men only, for meals and for the subsequent
                    siesta.</p>
                <p>In east New Guinea sometimes the houses are two-storied, the lower part being
                    used for stores. The furniture consists of earthen bowls, drinking cups, wooden
                    neck-rests, spoons, &amp;c., artistically carved, mats, cordage, small plaited
                    baskets and boxes, and various weapons and implements. The pottery is moulded
                    and fire-baked.</p>
                <p>West New Guinea exports a certain amount of sago, nutmegs, massoi and pulasaria
                    barks (all wild), birdskins, tripang, tortoise-and pearl-shell, the trade with
                    the Dutch being worth about £20,000 a year. Misol is rich in all these products,
                    and Salawatti in sago. They are sent to Ceram, Ternate, and Macassar in exchange
                    for iron and copper ware, cotton cloths, indigo, knives, mirrors, beads, arrack,
                    &amp;c. The Ké islanders are great boatbuilders. An active trade is carried on
                    between the hill and coast tribes, the former bringing down vegetable produce in
                    exchange for fish and shell ornaments. In the north-west some of the coast
                    villagers spend six months in the forest collecting massoi bark, and live the
                    rest of the year by fishing. Often a village has its special industry, as
                    canoe-building, pottery, or manufacture of shell ornaments, or of the little
                    sticks worn in the septum of the nose. Large trading canoes pass up and down the
                    coast, probably combining a little piracy and kidnapping with other business.
                    The Papuan pirates were formerly dreaded in these seas. For trading purposes
                    several large canoes are lashed together, with a platform above and a house at
                    each end united by a palisade. Coasting voyages of several weeks are made in
                    these craft. The canoes vary from the common “dug-out” to the great war-canoe
                    elaborately carved and ornamented.</p>
                <p>Both races show considerable agricultural skill—probably an old Asiatic
                    tradition, for the plants cultivated seem mostly Asiatic. In some places the
                    hill-sides are carefully terraced, plantations well kept and fenced, and flowers
                    grown for ornament. Any one may clear and cultivate a piece of land belonging to
                    his tribe, but often after one or two deaths a kampong is deserted, and new
                    forest-land taken up; on the west coast, where the mainland is too steep for
                    cultivation, the people cross over and cultivate the neighbouring uninhabited
                    islands. They have a strong sense of proprietorship, even of the fruit trees in
                    the forest and of the fish in their own streams or on their own coast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The claims to superiority over New Guinea on the
                    part of the rulers of some of the small neighbouring islands are curious when we
                    compare the extent of their dominions with New Guinea. These claims date at all
                    events from the spread of Islam to the Moluccas at the beginning of the 15th
                    century, and were maintained by the Malay rulers both of Batjan and of Gébé.
                    Latterly they have been exercised by the sultan of Tidore. When the Dutch first
                    came to these seas it was their policy to ally themselves with certain chiefs,
                    and support their claims over various islands, so as to extend their own
                    commercial monopoly; and they now support the claims (admitted by Great Britain
                    in 1814) of their former rival and ally the sultan of Tidore over both the Raja
                    Ampat (t.e., the four Papuan kingships, Waigiu, Salawatti, Misol, and
                    Waigamma<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On Misol
                    island.</p></note>) and certain islands or points on the north-west coast of New
                    Guinea, and the rulers of these places are nominated, on his recommendation, by
                    the Dutch governor of Ternate, under the titles of rajah, major, singaji, or
                    koτano.</p>
                <p>Salawatti and till lately Misol have dominated the coasts respectively adjacent
                    to them, but certain dues (consisting of sago, massoi bark, occasional slaves,
                    and other produce) are levied in the sultan’s name, at irregular intervals, all
                    along the coast for hundreds of miles. These extortions make Islam unpopular,
                    and have retarded progress, for we read in former days of Papuan pirate fleets,
                    and of “the Papuas” in league with the Moluccas against the Portuguese. The
                    Dutch, however, in their dealings with the people still find it convenient to
                    use the sultan’s name and authority. As his suzerain they claim possession of
                    the west half of New Guinea as far as 140° 47' E., but his claims never extended
                    so far, and their sovereignty is little more than nominal. There is a small

                    hoisted by many of the coast chiefs, ignorant even of its meaning; all attempts
                    at settlement have been abandoned owing, to the bad climate, the difficult
                    navigation, and the constant fighting and laziness of the people,—all this
                    limiting the amount of produce available for trade. The Dutch missionaries,<note

                    for many years, have a certain influence, and their schools are well attended,

                    increase of material prosperity.</p>
                <p>Though probably sighted by A. Dabreu, 1511, New Guinea was apparently first
                    visited either by the Portuguese Don Jorge de Meneses, driven on his way from
                    Goa to Ternate in 1526 to take shelter at “Isla Versija” (which has been
                    identified with a place Warsia on the N.W. coast, but may possibly be the island
                    of Waigiu), or by the Spaniard Alvaro de Saavedra two years later.</p>
                <p>By Ortiz de Retez, or Roda, who in 1546 first laid down several points along the
                    north coast, the name of “New Guinea” was probably given. In that and the two
                    following centuries, though the coasts were visited by many illustrious
                    navigators, as Schonten and Lemaire, Tasman, Dampier, Torres, Bougainville, and
                    Cook, little additional knowledge was gained. This was due first to the
                    difficulties of the navigation, next to the exclusiveness of the Dutch, who,
                    holding the Spice Islands, prevented all access to places east of them, and
                    lastly to the stream of enterprise being latterly diverted to the more temperate
                    regions farther south. The Dutch barrier was broken down by the arrival of
                    Dampier and other ‘ ‘ interlopers” from the east, and of emissaries from the
                    (English) East India Company in search of spice-bearing lands. The voyage of
                    Forrest (1774) in the “Tartar galley” of 10 tons, and his account of New Guinea,
                    are still full of interest. New Guinea was actually annexed in 1793 by two
                    commanders in the East India Company’s service, and the island, of Manasvari in
                    Geelvink Bay held for some months by their troops. After the peace of 1815 Dutch
                    surveying expeditions to the west coasts became more numerous. Surveys of the
                    east coasts have been made since the visits of D’Entrecasteaux (1793) and
                    D’Urville (1827-40) by Captains Owen Stanley, Yule, Blackwood, and other English
                    officers, the latest being that of Captain Moresby; and English missionaries and
                    traders are doing around the Gulf of Papua what the Dutch have done at Geelvink
                    Bay. The islands of Torres Straits, which are the headquarters of a valuable
                    pearl-shell and tripang fishery, have all been annexed to Queensland, and
                    practically command the few available channels by which ships can pass.</p>
                <p>Latterly the colonial authorities in Australia, alarmed at the prospect of the
                    annexation by some foreign power of territory so near their shores, and also
                    desirous to prevent the abuses that must soon arise from the influx of convicts
                    or of European adventurers under no control, have urged the home Government to
                    annex the east half of New Guinea.</p>
