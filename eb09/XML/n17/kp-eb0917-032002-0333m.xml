                    Viscount</hi></label> (1758-1805), was a younger son of the Rev. Edmund Nelson,
                    and was born at Barnham, Thorpe, Norfolk, September 29, 1758. A love of
                    adventure and a daring spirit, which developed itself from his earliest years,
                    inclined the future admiral to the life of the sea, and, through the interest of
                    a maternal uncle, the lad entered the navy in 1770. It is unnecessary to dwell
                    on the career of Nelson as he passed through the first grades of his calling ·
                    as a midshipman or a lieutenant he saw service in almost every division of the
                    globe, and on several occasions he gave signal proof of extraordinary energy and
                    fertility of resource, and, above all, of a courage in danger which, if somewhat
                    rash, was truly heroic. Already, too, he had shown an expertness in seamanship
                    and in the art of the pilot often noticed by his superior officers, and he had
                    displayed a singular aptitude for command in a variety of enterprises entrusted
                    to him. He was made a post-captain at the age of twenty-one, a promotion due to
                    merit alone, and remarkable in that aristocratic age; and during the next few
                    years he was actively engaged in the vicissitudes of the American War. It was a
                    period of chequered fortunes as regards the English navy; its supremacy on the
                    ocean was not yet assured; and, though Rodney’s great victory in 1782 attested
                    the excellence of British seamen, the flag of France was for a time dominant in
                    the West Indies and Indian seas; the fleets of the French and Spanish monarchies
                    insulted the English coasts for several weeks, and assailed Gibraltar in
                    formidable strength; and the armed neutrality of the Northern powers threatened
                    England with no ordinary peril. Nelson, however, though his correspondence
                    proves that he followed them with the eye of genius, took no part in these great
                    operations; he was in command only of small vessels, and was chiefly employed in
                    protecting convoys and in chasing cruisers of the same class as his own; and his
                    most notable exploit was a bold descent on the shores of the South American
                    isthmus, in which he gave fresh proofs of his habitual bravery. Yet his
                    reputation as a promising officer was steadily growing during these years; he
                    attracted the attention of every admiral on the different stations on which he
                    served; and King William IV., at this time a midshipman, probably only echoed a
                    general opinion in describing Nelson as a “boy captain with an enthusiasm that
                    showed he was no common being.” After the peace of Versailles in 1783, Nelson
                    was in the West Indies for several years; and he gained credit for almost
                    Quixotic zeal, and drew down on himself no little odium, by the efforts he made
                    to prevent smuggling between the new United States and British colonies, and to
                    expose the frauds of the greedy contractors who, especially on the Jamaica
                    station, had been long permitted to plunder the navy. The time was now at hand
                    when the commanding powers of this great seaman were to become manifest. War
                    between England and revolutionary France was declared in the first months of
                    1793; and Nelson, on the recommendation of Lord Hood—a veteran who held him in
                    high esteem— was made captain of the “Agamemnon,” the first ship of the line
                    commanded by him. He was despatched under Hood to the Mediterranean; and, though
                    his vessel was one of the worst in the fleet, he performed feats of daring and
                    perfect seamanship which at once marked him out for applause and distinction.
                    With a detachment of sailors who, when led by him, “minded shot,” he declared,
                    “as little as peas,” he took a prominent part in the siege of Bastia; and the
                    capitulation of the place was due, for the most part, to their determined
                    valour. At the siege of Cadiz also, where he lost an eye, he contributed largely
                    to the result, his “seamen,” as he reported, having “fought the guns” with the
                    assistance only of “a single artilleryman.” Nelson, however, was greatest on his
                    own element; and soon after this he for the first time displayed conspicuously,
                    and in a decisive manner, the transcendent gifts which made him pre-eminent. In
                    March 1795 the British fleet, under Admiral Hotham—Lord Hood had by this time
                    been replaced—was partially engaged off the coasts of Italy with a French fleet
                    of superior force; and a French eighty-four, having been dismasted, sheered off,
                    towed by a powerful frigate, and supported by two large ships of the line. The
                    “Agamemnon,” though only a sixty-four, stood out boldly after the retiring
                    enemy; and Nelson’s manoeuvres were so skilful that he all but destroyed the
                    crippled Frenchman, and kept the whole hostile squadron at bay, without
                    incurring any serious loss. The injured ship, with one of her consorts, was
                    easily captured a few hours afterwards; and, had the admiral followed Nelson’s
                    advice, the whole French fleet would have been brought to action, and have
                    probably met a complete defeat.</p>

                <p>In the winter of 1795-96 Nelson was employed in cutting off the supplies of the
                    French army on the Italian seaboard; and, had he been well seconded by the
                    Austrian generals, Napoleon would not have possessed the means of beginning his
                    career of Italian conquest. Soon after this he became a commodore; and before
                    long he had again performed one of those great feats of daring and skill which
                    ordinary commanders would have deemed impossible. Spain, drawn into her old
                    alliance with France, had declared war in 1796; and on 13th February 1797 a
                    Spanish fleet met one of the English, a few miles off Cape St Vincent. Though
                    the enemy had twenty-seven ships of the line, and the British force was only
                    fifteen, its admiral, Jervis, did not hesitate; and, skilfully employing a
                    well-known manoeuvre, he broke the hostile line, cutting off nine ships. The
                    Spanish admiral, however, endeavoured to rejoin this detachment by wheeling
                    round his van; and the evolution might have been successful had not Nelson,
                    placed at the British rear, immediately abandoned his own line, and,
                    disregarding his superior’s orders, assailed with his single ship the advancing
                    squadron. This audacious movement threw him in the way of three first and three
                    second rates; and, though the “Captain” was ably seconded by the three nearest
                    ships of the British line, Nelson was engaged for more than half an hour with a
                    force immeasurably superior to his own. Yet British discipline and valour
                    triumphed; the Spanish commander drew off beaten, and the “Captain” boarded and
                    took two ships, each larger and more powerful than herself, Nelson leading his
                    exulting crew in person to the cry of “Westminster Abbey or Victory.” For this
                    extraordinary passage of arms Nelson received the order of the Bath and was made
                    an admiral,— his splendid success and skilful promptitude having effaced, even
                    in professional minds, his disregard of the rules of the service. During the
                    following months he was engaged in operations against Spain and her colonies;
                    and he lost an arm in an attack on Santa Cruz, a place famous for one of Blake’s
                    victories. The time had now arrived when his genius and skill were to appear in
                    full force in an independent command. In May 1798 he was despatched by
                    Jervis—now Lord St Vincent—to intercept a great French armament, which, under
                    the guidance of Bonaparte, was intended to reach Egypt and to threaten India.
                    His squadron, however, having been crippled in a gale, the hostile fleet escaped
                    from Toulon and reached Alexandria on 1st July, the British admiral, who had
                    made Aboukir on the 28th June, having just missed it. This misadventure deceived
                    Nelson, who believed that the enemy was still at sea; and it was not until he
                    had made a circuit by Crete to the coasts of Sicily, and back again to the
                    shores of Greece, that he heard how the French had made good their landing. He
                    set off from the Gulf of Coron, though his intelligence was a rumour only; and
                    on the 1st August the enemy was descried. His plan of attack was quickly formed,
                    and it was marked by his wonted insight and skill. The French fleet lay in front
                    of the roads of Aboukir, the rear supported by coast batteries, the centre and
                    van more out at sea, but composed of new and formidable ships; and, as shoals
                    stretched between it and the neighbouring shore, its admiral, Brueys, believed
                    that no foe would thread the way between and attack from that side. Nelson,
                    however, a dexterous pilot from boyhood, saw that with fine steering the feat
                    was possible; and he directed part of his fleet to assail the enemy to the
                    landward through this intricate passage, while the remaining part assailed from
                    the seaward. As evening fell his preparations were complete; the shoal stopped
                    only one of the British ships, and before an hour had passed his divided line
                    had encompassed more than half the French fleet. The issue of the battle was
                    never doubtful; the French, indeed, fought with heroic courage, but their rear
                    and centre, placed between two fires, were gradually overpowered and destroyed;
                    and their van, at anchor, like all their line, was either unable or perhaps
                    unwilling to make sail and assist their consorts. The flagship of Brueys, the
                    huge “Orient,” blew up towards midnight in a volcano of flame, and by daybreak
                    on the 2d the victory was complete. Of thirteen French ships two only escaped,
                    and it should be added that the British fleet, though equal in numbers to that
                    of the enemy, was wholly inferior in real force. The British seventy-fours were
                    no match for the new and magnificent French eighties; and Nelson’s flagship, the
                    “Vanguard,” had scarcely more than half the strength of the “Orient.”</p>
                <p>This great victory—perhaps Nelson’s masterpiece— marks a new epoch in British
                    naval history. The superiority, indeed, of the English fleets had been proved
                    from the beginning of the war, especially on June 1, 1794, and the Revolution
                    had injured the marine of France. But it was not until the Battle of the
                    Nile—the name given to Nelson’s triumph—that the navy of England attained its
                    complete ascendency, and that it became the terror of even its bravest enemies.
                    This change was due in the main to Nelson, and unquestionably the dread his name
                    inspired was the principal cause that, years afterwards, Napoleon’s plan of
                    invading England failed. From this period, too, the whole naval service, so to
                    speak, was animated by a new spirit, and deeds of daring were done by men of the
                    rising school which the Hawkes and Ansons would have never dreamt of. It is
                    painful to turn from this blaze of glory to notice a dark passage in Nelson’s
                    career. The Battle of the Nile having again combined the Continent against
                    revolutionary France,—for Bonaparte and his army seemed lost,—the court of
                    Naples was drawn into the war; and, in the struggle that ensued, the king and
                    queen were compelled to take refuge in Palermo. They soon, however, had returned
                    to the capital, Suwaroff having driven the French from Italy; and they entered
                    Naples on the faith of a treaty, which amnestied their revolted subjects.
                    Nelson, who still held his Mediterranean command, and had taken the royal family
                    under his protection, nevertheless declared the capitulation null, allowed the
                    vindictive creatures of the court to work their will on disarmed enemies, and,
                    hurrying on himself the trial and sentence, gave his sanction to what can be
                    only called the judicial murder of Caraccioli, the admiral of the Neapolitan
                    fleet, who had served in the “rebel” cause only under compulsion. History must
                    severely condemn these acts, but there is reason to believe that they were not
                    caused, as is commonly supposed, by female prompting; and we must not forget
                    that, in that age, political passion ran furiously high, and often broke down
                    all moral barriers,—that it was the age of the assassinations at Rastadt, of the
                    crime of Vincennes, of the execution of Ney. Nelson remained on his station
                    after this tragedy; he shared in some of the short-lived triumphs of the allies
                    in 1799-1800, had the satisfaction of hearing of the capture of the two ships
                    which had escaped from Aboukir, and gave effectual aid in the siege of Malta,
                    taken by Bonaparte on his way to Egypt. By the winter of 1800 he was again in
                    England, having received a* peerage for the Battle of the Nile, and the
                    well-merited rank of vice-admiral, and greeted by his country with general
                    acclaim. He was called before long to perform another service, in which his
                    great qualities became again manifest. The victory of Marengo, won by Bonaparte
                    after his extraordinary return from Egypt, having broken up the coalition
                    against France, and inclined the czar to a French alliance, the Northern courts,
                    with Denmark at their head, renewed the armed neutrality of 1780; and, in the
                    first months of 1801, a British fleet was fitted out for the Baltic to put an
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n335/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0335-0322"/> end to this menacing league. Sir Peter Parker, a
                    cautious veteran, was made chief of this expedition, Nelson being only the
                    second in command, for negotiation was to be tried at first, and for this Nelson
                    had no aptitude; but, though this arrangement promised well, it did not prove,
                    on the whole, fortunate. The fleet, an extremely powerful armament, had passed
                    the Sound by the 31st March,— Nelson chafing at the delays of his colleague, and
                    at diplomatic efforts which, he rightly thought, would give to the Danes what
                    they wanted, time; and by the 7th April it cast anchor in the waters around the
                    Danish capital. The enemy, however, had already prepared the means of making a
                    stern resistance: Copenhagen was covered by strong batteries; and an imposing
                    array of heavily armed craft, protected by a shoal, as was the case at Aboukir,
                    presented a most formidable line of defence. Nelson, however, declared for an
                    immediate attack; and on the 2d May the attempt was made, Parker having
                    judiciously left him to act for himself. Nelson’s tactics resembled those of the
                    Nile; he closed on his foe by getting within the shoal; but, from the nature of
                    the case, he had not the means of placing the Danes between two fires; he had to
                    deal with forts, not with vessels only; and his operations were in part
                    unfortunate, for three of his ships at the outset grounded. The result was that,
                    although his squadron destroyed the first line of the Danish defences, and
                    threatened the capital with ruinous injury, the hostile batteries were not
                    silenced, and Nelson’s ships had suffered so much that he readily welcomed the
                    terms of a truce which extricated him from no little danger. Parker, indeed, had
                    been so alarmed at the prospect that he had actually signalled the fleet to
                    retreat; but Nelson characteristically refused to obey until something like
                    victory had been attained,—on the whole, certainly, a wise resolve.</p>
                <p>Nelson was made a viscount for Copenhagen, and the league of the North was soon
                    dissolved, for, though his success had not been perfect, it had taught the enemy
                    a severe lesson. During the summer of 1801 he was engaged in watching the first
                    preparations for a descent on the English coast, already contemplated by
                    Napoleon; and he directed a boat attack on what was ere long to grow into the
                    formidable and threatening flotilla of Boulogne. The peace of Amiens brought the
                    war to a close; and Nelson stood on a pinnacle of fame, the acknowledged chief
                    of the navy of England. His life, however, had become unhappy, for his private
                    as well as his public character was not, it must be confessed, spotless. He was
                    singularly susceptible to female influences; and he had formed for some years an
                    erring attachment for Emma, the wife of Sir William Hamilton, ambassador at
                    Naples in 1798. She was an adventuress of great beauty and parts; and, though
                    his conduct at Naples does not seem to have been due to her evil counsels, he
                    became almost her slave in his wild passion; and this had not only led to a
                    separation from his wife, but had given him many wretched moments, and had
                    caused much pain to his aged sovereign. Discredit, however, of this kind could
                    not detract from his splendid services; and on the renewal of the war in 1803
                    Nelson was appointed to the Mediterranean command. He took up his station off
                    Toulon; and for nearly two years he kept the French in port, in spite of
                    repeated efforts of escape, and of the vicissitudes of all kinds of weather—an
                    example of endurance never equalled. Meanwhile Napoleon had been maturing his
                    deep-laid plan for invading England; the army which afterwards subdued the
                    Continent had been marshalled along the cliffs of Boulogne; a vast and armed
                    flotilla had been assembled; and the descent was to be covered by an immense
                    fleet, collected from many points of the compass, and concentrated in suitable
                    force in the Channel. A variety of circumstances, however, the principal being
                    the timidity of the French admirals, alarmed at the recollections of the Nile,
                    and fearing attempts to break the blockade, delayed the execution of the enemy’s
                    design, though certainly it was formidable in the extreme, and was unsuspected
                    until the last moment. At last, at the end of March 1805, the French admiral,
                    Villeneuve, escaped from Toulon,—his mission being to rally a Spanish squadron,
                    to cross the Atlantic and reach the West Indies, and then, returning to the seas
                    of Europe, to liberate the French and Spanish squadrons blockaded at Ferrol,
                    Rochefort, and Brest, and to attain the Channel with a great armada of from
                    fifty to sixty ships of the line. Villeneuve’s operations were at first
                    successful: he was at Martinique by the middle of May, having been joined by a
                    fleet from Cadiz; and, though haunted, as it were, by the thought of Nelson, he
                    was in full sail for Europe by the 1st June, having as yet completely eluded the
                    enemy. Meantime Nelson had sought for Villeneuve on the Mediterranean for
                    several days; he had been long delayed by contrary winds; and, though he had
                    crossed the Atlantic with extreme rapidity when apprised of the destination of
                    his foe, he had been lured away by a false report to the shores of the South
                    American continent, and he only reached the latitude of Martinique to find that
                    Villeneuve and his fleet were gone. He sailed from Antigua on the 13th June,
                    pursuing with eleven sail a fleet of nineteen or twenty; and, as he feared that
                    he might not come up with Villeneuve, he despatched several light craft to warn
                    the Admiralty—though not suspecting Napoleon’s design—that a hostile fleet was
                    on the ' way to Europe. This precaution proved of the highest moment. Nelson
                    missed Villeneuve in the Atlantic wastes, but one of these vessels conveyed his
                    message. Sir Robert Calder, sent off for the purpose, intercepted Villeneuve off
                    the coasts of Spain, and though the action was not decisive the Frenchman was
                    compelled, to put into Ferrol, and was thus prevented from making northwards.
                    Before long Nelson, still chasing Villeneuve, but ignorant where his enemy was,
                    had approached Europe and made for England; and at this intelligence the French
                    admiral sailed from Ferrol southward, and put into Cadiz, completely frustrating
                    his master’s projects. The position of affairs had now become clearer,—though
                    Collingwood alone of British seamen had even an inkling of Napoleon’s purpose;
                    and the Admiralty made preparations at once to attack the fleet that had fled
                    into Cadiz. Nelson was placed in supreme command, and he was off Cadiz in the
                    last days of September. His fleet numbered thirty-three or thirty-four sail of
                    the line; that of Villeneuve was of the same force, the Ferrol squadron having
                    joined his own; but, as Nelson knew that the French chief would not venture to
                    fight on equal terms, he actually sent away seven or eight ships, in order to
                    bring about an engagement which, he had resolved, should prove decisive.</p>
                <p>By 20th October Villeneuve had put to sea with the combined fleets of France and
                    Spain. He obeyed a peremptory command of Napoleon, who had stigmatized him as a
                    feeble coward; he left Cadiz trusting to a false report that Nelson had only
                    twenty ships; and yet, with thirty-three, he dreaded a battle. Nelson, eager to
                    decoy the Frenchman out, had kept a considerable distance from land, but the
                    enemy’s movements were watched by his frigates, and he was informed of them
                    throughout the night. His plan of attack had been made some time: the ships of
                    the allies being very numerous, he had resolved to break their line at two
                    points; and in this way the results, he believed, of the manoeuvre would be more
                    quick and effective. By daybreak on the 21st the fleet of Villeneuve was
                    descried off the Cape of Trafalgar; and the English fleet was formed into two
                    columns, the northern led <pb break="no"

                    Collingwood in the “Royal Sovereign.” The wind was light, and there was an ocean
                    swell; Nelson’s ships slowly advanced on the waters; and, as they approached it,
                    the hostile fleet, the sun shining on the masses of sails, presented a grand and
                    imposing appearance. Villeneuve, a skilful seaman though a timid leader, had
                    arranged his squadrons ably to meet the attack: he had formed them into two
                    parallel lines, the vessels of the second commanding the spaces between the
                    vessels of the first line; and they were thus marshalled in a compact array,
                    each division giving support to the other, and offering a continuous front of
                    fire to the enemy. Deafening cheers broke from the British armament as the
                    celebrated signal flew from the flagship, “England expects every man to do his
                    duty”; and it is said that Villeneuve, as he heard the shouting, exclaimed to
                    his officers that “all was lost.” The southern column came into action towards
                    noon; and Collingwood first broke the hostile line, pouring a destructive
                    broadside into the “Santa Anna,” and then ranging alongside the “Fougeux.” The
                    “Royal Sovereign,” however, had out-sailed her consorts, and he was surrounded
                    by enemies for many minutes before a friendly ship could come to her aid; and
                    this circumstance not only proves how absolute had become the confidence of the
                    British chiefs, but how the manoeuvre of piercing the line requires a better
                    fleet to have a chance of success. By this time the northern column was engaged;
                    the “Victory,” assailed by a tremendous fire, broke through the enemy soon after
                    twelve, making immense havoc in Villeneuve’s flagship, and exchanging broadsides
                    with the “Redoubtable” and with the huge “Santissima Trinidad,” by far the
                    largest man-of-war afloat; and here again some moments elapsed before the
                    “Temeraire” gave her partial relief. The action had now become general; and the
                    British ships in the rear came up, reducing the great inferiority in the first
                    attack. Six or seven ships of the enemy’s first line made a stern and noble
                    resistance; but the second line gradually fell to leeward; the van, as at the
                    Nile, scarcely fired a shot: and, divided, scattered, and overpowered at every
                    point where the defence was maintained, the allied fleet ere long was a mass of
                    fragments, disabled, helpless, and pursued by their conquerors. Nevertheless the
                    victory, splendid as it was, was dearly bought by the loss of the life of the
                    illustrious warrior who had prepared it. A musket ball from the “Redoubtable’s”
                    tops inflicted a mortal wound on Nelson about an hour after the battle began,
                    and he died towards evening to the unspeakable grief of all who witnessed the
                    sorrowful scene in the “Victory.” He retained, however, his great faculties to
                    the last; he lived to hear that almost two-thirds of the enemy’s fleet had been
                    destroyed or captured; and, though he passed away in.the prime of manhood, it
                    can hardly be said that his death was premature, for the foes of England had
                    been swept from the ocean. We have indicated Nelson’s undoubted errors; and he
                    was inferior to several of England’s naval chiefs in political sagacity and calm
                    forethought. But he was the greatest of her commanders at sea; he was
                    unrivalled, in an eventful age of war, for resource, daring, professional skill,
                    and the art of winning the hearts of men; and, on the whole, he was beyond
                    comparison the first of the naval worthies of his country. His remains were
                    conveyed to England and interred in St Paul’s Cathedral on January 9, 1806.</p>
