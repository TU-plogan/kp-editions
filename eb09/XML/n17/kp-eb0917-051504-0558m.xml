                <p><label type="entry">NITROGEN</label> is a chemical element which, on account of
                    its abundance in nature and its relations to life, is of great importance. About
                    three-fourths of the mass of the atmosphere consists of elementary nitrogen;
                    and, as an essential component of all albumenoids, the element pervades the
                    whole of the animal and vegetable kingdom. Nitrogen minerals are scarce (almost
                    the only ones are Chili saltpetre and native nitre), but traces of the two
                    nitrogen compounds, ammonia and nitric acid, are diffused throughout all soils,
                    besides existing in the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Elementary nitrogen exists only in the one form of nitrogen gas (N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 1 molecule), which is easily extracted from the
                    atmosphere. Though resembling air in its general properties, it is easily
                    distinguished from it by its not supporting combustion. According to Régnault,
                    its specific gravity is 0’970.3 times that of pure, dry air; and one litre,

                <p>Nitrogen is a permanent gas in this sense that no amount of pressure will liquefy
                    it at any temperature lying above the “critical point” of - 123 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 8 C. At or a little below this temperature 42
                    atmospheres reduce it to a liquid (Sarrau).</p>
                <p>Chemically, nitrogen gas is characterized by perfect inertness towards all
                    ordinary reagents under ordinary conditions. But at certain higher temperatures
                    boron, magnesium, vanadium, and titanium combine with it directly into nitrides.
                    Nitrogen is capable even of uniting with ordinary oxygen. A mixture of the two
                    gases, it is true, remains unchanged when exposed <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">masse</hi> to any temperature, but when it is subjected to a
                    succession of electric sparks a small proportion of the two gases, no doubt
                    through local dissociation into isolated atoms N and O, does unite into nitric
                    oxide, NO, which then combines with more oxygen into red fumes of peroxide, N
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.</p>
                <p>The part which the nitrogen gas in the atmosphere plays in the economy of nature
                    is as yet a mystery. It certainly is not susceptible of being taken up directly
                    by the plants and utilized in their synthesis of nitrogenous compounds. It plays
                    no active part in the processes of combustion and of animal respiration; in
                    either it appears to act only as an inert diluent of the oxygen.</p>
                <p>In the case of respiration, however, this particular diluent seems to be
                    essential; no animal could live healthily for any considerable period of time in
                    pure oxygen, and we know of no other diluent which could be substituted for the
                    nitrogen without producing poisonous effects. Besides, there can be no doubt
                    that atmospheric nitrogen, in an indirect way, contributes towards the building
                    up of nitrogenous organic matter. Every process of ordinary combustion probably,
                    and every electric discharge in the atmosphere certainly, induces the formation
                    of some nitric acid, which by combining with the atmospheric ammonia becomes
                    nitrate of ammonia, and from certain experiments of Schönbein’s it would appear
                    that nitrogen gas and water are capable of uniting directly into nitrite of
                    ammonia (N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = NO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>), which,
                    supposing<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n559/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0559-0516"/> it to be produced in the atmosphere, would
                    promptly be oxidized into nitrate. The nitrate produced by either process is
                    carried down by the rain and conveyed to the roots of the plants, which
                    assimilate it as part of their nitrogenous organic ma tter. However small the
                    scale may appear on which these processes of atmospheric nitrification go on
                    when measured by the mass of nitrogen which remains unchanged, as this mass is
                    immense, their absolute effect must be very considerable, and may form an
                    important item in the economy of nature.</p>
                <p>The compounds of nitrogen may be arranged under the heads of ammonia, nitrates,
                    nitro-compounds, organic nitrogen compounds, and cyanides. As all the several
                    classes and their most important members are treated of under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chemistry</hi> (vol. v. p. 509-514), we confine ourselves here,
                    in the main, to supplementing that article by such details as are of practical
                    or general scientific interest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ammonia.</hi></p>
                <p>This, the only known compound of hydrogen with nitrogen, is a gas of the
                    molecular formula NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. The most convenient process
                    for the preparation of the pure gas is to mix powdered sal-ammoniac with
                    powdered quicklime in a flask and to heat the mixture in a sand-bath. Torrents
                    of ammonia come off, which must be dried by passing it through a closely packed
                    column of solid caustic potash or soda (chloride of calcium absorbs the gas
                    chemically) and collected over mercury, as the gas dissolves most abundantly in
                    water. In addition to what has been said under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chemistry</hi> of the properties of ammonia, it may here be mentioned that,
                    though uninflammable in air, it burns brilliantly in oxygen, and that it is
                    liable to the following peculiar kind of oxidation. Pour some strong liquor
                    ammoniae into a large flask, so as to produce a moist mixture of the gas and of
                    air, and suspend in this atmosphere a recently ignited spiral of thin platinum
                    wire. The wire continues glowing and the flask soon fills with dense white fumes
                    of nitrite and nitrate of ammonia, formed according to equation: 2NH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + (40 or 30) = H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + N0
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H . NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> or NO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H.NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. The platinum suffers
                    no permanent change; its mode of action probably consists in this that it
                    alternately absorbs (i.e., combines with) oxygen and hands it over to the
                    ammonia. In any case the reaction is interesting as throwing some light upon the
                    process of nitrification <hi rend="italic">{vide infra}.</hi></p>
                <p>Aqueous ammonia (liquor ammoniae), being in constant requisition as a reagent,
                    and also used in medicine and in the arts, is being manufactured industrially.
                    Fresenius recommends the following process. A cast-iron pot, fitted up as a
                    retort, is charged with alternate layers of slaked lime (10 kilos of quicklime
                    plus 4 kilos of water) and a powdered and sifted mixture of 6’5 kilos of
                    chloride and 3'5 kilos of sulphate of ammonium. Eight litres of water are then
                    added and well incorporated with the solids. The retort is now closed, and the
                    outlet-tube joined on to the lower end of an inverted condenser, the upper end
                    of which communicates with a set of Woulfe’s bottles charged with water. The
                    ammonia is driven off by judicious application of heat, the inverted condenser
                    serving to make the gas relatively dry before being absorbed. In this operation
                    the tubes conveying the gas to the water must go to the bottom of the bottles,
                    as the solution produced is lighter than pure water; and, of course, the bottles
                    must be kept cool by immersion in a cold water-bath. The strength of aqueous
                    ammonia, for commercial purposes, is readily ascertained by means of an
                    hydrometer ranging from 0’85 to 1’0 specific gravity. The relation between
                    specific gravity S at 14° C. (water of 14 <hi rend="superscript"> d</hi> = l)
                    and percentage of ammonia NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (p), according to

                <p>Aqueous ammonia is generally sent out as “liquor fortissimus” of 30 to 35 per
                    cent. For ordinary laboratory purposes it is usually diluted down to 9 to 10 per
                    cent. This explains the discontinuities in the table.</p>
                <p>Two natural sources of ammonia are at present in industrial use. (1) The gaseous
                    exhalations of volcanoes always include ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and
                    sulphurous acid, of which the first two are formed no doubt by the action of
                    steam on deposits of nitrides and chlorides in the interior of the earth. This
                    explains the existence in the fumaroles (smoke-holes), and in the clefts of the

                    sal-ammoniac. This volcanic ammonia salt is highly valued as a material for the
                    preparation of pure liquor ammoniae; but its supply hardly comes up to the
                    demands of even this small industry. (2) More important are the masses of
                    ammonia formed in the processes of putrefaction which are going on constantly in
                    nature, and of which a mere fraction would satisfy all the demands of industry,
                    if the recovery of such ammonia were not, as a rule, beset with insuperable
                    difficulties. Thus, for instance, all the immense mass of the ammonia of the
                    sewage of our large cities must be allowed to go to waste because we have no
                    economical method for its extraction. Urine, when undiluted, is an easily
                    handled raw material, and in former times actually formed the principal source
                    of ammonia. Human urine contains from 2 to 3 per cent, of urea, or carbamide as
                    it is called in systematic chemistry, because it is the anhydride of carbonate
                    of ammonia. When urine putrefies, this carbamide takes up the elements of water
                    and becomes carbonate of ammonia, CO . (N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = CO <hi

                    2</hi>, A prompter mode of conversion is to evaporate the urine with a small
                    proportion of vitriol, and heat the residue to near the boiling-point of the
                    acid, when the nitrogen of the urea passes at once into the form of sulphate of
                    ammonia. This latter process would apply also to the urine of horses and cattle,
                    which, instead of urea, contains hippuric acid, a compound which, when taken
                    conjointly with water, contains the elements of ammonia and benzoic and acetic
                    acids. At the present time urine plays hardly any part in the ammonia industry;
                    but it may be mentioned that the produce of the urinals of Glasgow is, or lately
                    was, wrought for carbonate of ammonia.</p>

                    All such matter when subjected to dry distillation gives up part of its nitrogen
                    as ammonia, of which the greater part condenses with the vapour of water
                    produced, and is thus obtained as part of the aqueous portion of the “tar.”
                    Large quantities of such tarwater are being produced incidentally in the
                    manufacture of coal-gas, and it is this material which at present forms the

                <p>Crude tar-water contains about 1 per cent, of ammonia (more or less according to

                    the ammonia is extracted directly in the form of liquor ammoniae. The liquor is

                    vapours if condensed as they come off, would yield a very dilute liquor
                    contaminated largely with volatile carbon compounds. To obtain a relatively pure
                    gas, the vapour is subjected to a succession of partial condensations by making
                    it pass through the several compartments of an iron apparatus, similar in its
                    action to the “Coffey’s still” which is used for the strengthening and refining
                    of alcoholic liquors (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Distillation,</hi> vol. vii. p.
                    265). The almost pure gas which leaves the last condenser is passed into a mass
                    of water contained in a refrigerated close lead vessel, and thus converted into
                    liquor ammoniae of the requisite strength. In the majority of large
                    establishments, however, the ammonia is converted into sulphate, for which
                    purpose it need not be so elaborately purified. The ammoniacal vapour obtained
                    from the crude liquor by simple distillation, or by distillation with lime from
                    out of a steam-boiler, is passed into a quantity of chamber-acid contained in a
                    leaden tank, until the acid is almost but not quite neutralized. An excess of
                    alkali would induce the formation of sulphide of iron from the sulphide of
                    ammonium in the vapour and the traces of iron-salt adventitiously present, and
                    lead to a discoloration of the salt. Matters are generally arranged so that the
                    bulk of the sulphate formed crystallizes out, on cooling, in the form of a
                    granular magma, which is allowed to drain and to dry, and either sold as it is,
                    or first purified by recrystallization. The pure salt, (NH <hi rend="subscript">

                    anhydrous, colourless, transparent crystals, isomorphous with those of the
                    corresponding potash salt, and, like it, belonging to the rhombic system; even
                    when produced on a large scale they are generally of small dimensions; when
                    allowed to grow, they assume forms which strikingly remind one of sugar-candy,
                    although the latter is clino-rhombic. The salt is insoluble in alcohol, like
                    most sulphates,—100 parts of water at 0°, 20°, 100° C. dissolve 71’0, 76’3, 97’5
                    parts of salt. The solution is neutral to litmus. The salt readily unites with

                    741-2), is made sometimes by sublimation of a mixture of the sulphate with
                    common salt, but it is more conveniently produced direct from gas-liquor ammonia
                    by passing it into muriatic acid until the latter is almost neutralized. The
                    liquor, when sufficiently concentrated by evaporation, deposits, on cooling,
                    part of its salt in feathery crystals, which are customarily purified by
                    sublimation. The subliming apparatus consists of two parts, —(1) a hemispherical
                    stoneware basin placed within a close fitting iron one, or an enamelled iron
                    basin, and (2) a hemispherical lead or stoneware lid, or dome, placed on the top
                    of the basin and cemented on to prevent leakage. The dome has a small aperture
                    in the top which remains open to preclude accumulation of pressure. The
                    carefully dried crystallized salt is pressed into the basin, and, after the lid
                    has been fitted on, is exposed to a long-lasting moderate heat. The salt
                    volatilizes (mostly in the form of a mixed vapour of the two components, which
                    reunite on cooling), and condenses in the dome in the form of a
                    characteristically fibrous and tough crust. The salt readily dissolves in water,
                    with considerable absorption of heat; 30 parts of salt with 100 parts of water
                    at 13 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 3 give a mixture of the temperature of

                    saturated solution it crystallizes on cooling in feathery groups of colourless

                    well-developed crystals which belong to the regular system, but look irregular
                    on account of the predominance of the (hemihedric) faces of the

                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">carbonates</hi> of ammonia there are a large number, and

                    by passing carbonic acid into a saturated solution of the commercial salt, when
                    it comes down as a crystalline precipitate. The commercial salt (important as a
                    medicinal agent and as a chemical reagent) is obtained by subliming a mixture of
                    sal-ammoniac and chalk from an iron retort provided with a lead dome and
                    receiver. It forms hard fibrous crusts or cakes, smelling strongly of ammonia.
                    The salt has a variable composition. The greater part, as a rule, consists of

                <p>Of the several ammonia compounds which we have referred to, the sulphate is by
                    far the most important in an industrial sense. Immense quantities of the crude
                    salt are being used as a manure— the German sugar-beet growers alone consume a
                    considerable fraction of the British produce—while to the technical chemist
                    generally it serves as the most convenient starting-point for the manufacture of
                    ammonia, or of other ammonia salts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In the mode of distilling coal customarily carried on in gas works, only about
                    one-third of the nitrogen is obtained as ammonia in the tar-water, the remaining
                    two-thirds being lost by evaporation into the air, or remaining in the coke in
                    the carbide form. What used to go into the gas is now mostly recovered by
                    efficient scrubbers. But the more efficient condensation of the ammonia actually
                    formed is a matter of chemical engineering which cannot be more than touched on
                    here. According to Bilbey the nitrogen of the coke can be recovered, partly at
                    least, by distilling it at a very high temperature in a current of steam.
                    Bilbey’s process, however, has hitherto failed practically to give satisfaction,
                    because the intense heat required means a great expense for fuel, and destroys
                    the retorts at an alarming rate. The analytical chemist has no difficulty in
                    extracting the whole of the nitrogen in a given sample of coal as ammonia by
                    mixing it with soda-lime and heating the mixture in a combustion-tube to
                    redness, and possibly the technical chemist will one day bring this process into
                    a remunerative form. What, however, is meanwhile more easy of attainment is the
                    recovery of the large quantities of ammonia which are being produced in the
                    manufacture of coke and in iron smelting (as far as carried out with coal), and
                    which hitherto have been allowed to go to waste. Quite a number of chemists and
                    engineers have tried their hands at this problem. The apparatus proposed,
                    generally speaking, all come to this, that the coal-smoke produced in the
                    furnace, instead of being allowed to have its own way, is sucked out by
                    exhausters, made to pass through refrigerators to deposit at least part of its
                    tar and ammonia water, and the uncondensed combustible gases are led away to be
                    used as fuel for steam-boilers, or, what in the case of coking is far better,
                    led back to the coke oven and consumed there to increase the temperature, and
                    thus improve the qualities of both coke and tar. The very high temperature of
                    the oven or furnace smoke throws great difficulties in the way of a perfect
                    condensation of the ammonia. These, in a Scottish iron-work, have been turned
                    most ingeniously by mixing the smoke with the sulphureous vapour formed by the
                    roasting of pyritic shale or coal, whereby the ammonia is converted into
                    sulphite and sulphate, which can easily be condensed in even hot water.</p>
                <p>Should it not be possible to produce ammonia synthetically from atmospheric
                    nitrogen? This question is still waiting for an industrial solution;
                    scientifically it may be answered in more than one way. Magnesium, boron, and a
                    number of other solid and non-volatile elementary substances, when kept in
                    nitrogen gas at the proper temperature, unite with the nitrogen into solid
                    nonvolatile nitrides; and these, when heated in steam, yield ammonia and the
                    corresponding oxide. Thus we have 3Mg + N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Mg <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and N <hi

                    Unfortunately the reagents are all expensive, and there is no economical method
                    for their regeneration. The following method is not subject to this one
                    objection. A mixture of baryta or carbonate of baryta with charcoal, when heated
                    intensely in nitrogen gas, yields cyanide of barium, Ba(NC) <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 2</hi>, and this salt when heated in steam gives off ammonia while carbonate
                    of baryta is left, which latter can be used for starting <hi rend="italic">de

                    succeeded in working it profitably even as a means for obtaining cyanides, whose
                    value, per unit of nitrogen, is higher than that of ammonia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nitrates.</hi></p>
                <p>Nitrates (the generic term for nitric acid, HN0 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and
                    its salts) are produced naturally by the electric discharges in the atmosphere,
                    and in the processes of “nitrification,” a fermentative oxidation which always
                    sets in when moist nitrogenous animal or vegetable matter is left to itself in
                    the presence of air and some basic substance (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fermentation,</hi> vol. ix. p. 98). This process in former times used to be
                    carried out for the production of saltpetre, but as an industrial operation is
                    now obsolete. The deposits of native nitre in India and elsewhere which nature
                    has produced for us by the same method are, of course, still being utilized as
                    far as they go. But they amount to very little compared with the immense masses
                    of native nitrate of soda which exist in South America, and which, at present,
                    constitute by far the most important raw material for the nitrate industry.</p>
                <p>This native <hi rend="italic">nitrate of soda</hi> forms part of a salty earth

                    <hi rend="italic">terra salitrosa,</hi> which abounds especially in the district
                    of Atacama and the Peruvian province of Tarapaca. The caliche there lies from ’
                    25 to 1'5 metres deep, and stretches over a distance of forty leagues; it is
                    covered by a layer, from a half to two metres thick, of a hard conglomerate of
                    sand, felspar, phosphates, and other mineral matters, which is designated
                    “lostra.” In other places the caliche forms part of a sandy deposit which
                    sometimes comes to the surface and never goes down to a depth beyond 2’6 metres.
                    The caliche contains from 48 to 75 per cent, of nitrate of soda and from 20 to
                    40 per cent, of common salt, which are associated with various minor saline
                    components, including iodate of soda, and more or less of insoluble mineral, and
                    also some organic matter, guano amongst other things, which suggests the idea
                    that the nitrate was formed by the nitrification of this kind of excre-mental
                    matter. The caliche is worked up <hi rend="italic">in loco</hi> for crude
                    nitrate of soda; by extracting the salts with hot water, allowing the suspended
                    earth to settle, and then transferring the clarified liquor, first to a cistern
                    where it deposits part of its chloride of sodium at a high temperature, and then
                    to another where, on cooling, it yields a crop of crystals of purified nitrate.
                    The nitre thus refined is imported chiefly from Valparaiso, whence the name of
                    “Chili saltpetre.” The mother-liquors used until a few years ago to be thrown
                    away, but are now being utilized for the extraction of their iodine, which,
                    although little in a relative sense, on account of the large masses of raw
                    material wrought, amounts to a good deal absolutely, as is illustrated by the
                    fact that Peruvian iodine has put an end to the kelp industry in Scotland.
                    Chemically pure nitrate of soda can be obtained by repeated recrystallization of
                    Chili saltpetre or by synthesis from pure nitric acid and pure carbonate of
                    soda. It forms colourless transparent rhombohedra, like those of Iceland spar,
                    only the angles are more nearly equal to right angles, so that the crystals look
                    like cubes. Hence the name of cubic saltpetre, which is sometimes given to the
                    salt. One hundred parts of water at 0°, 20°, 50°, 100°, 110° C. dissolve 72 9,
                    87’5, 112, 180, 200 parts of the salt; at 120°, the boiling-point of the
                    saturated solution, 216 parts. It fuses at 330° C. (Camelley); at higher
                    temperatures it loses oxygen (more readily than the corresponding potash salt)
                    with formation of nitrite N0 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Na, which, at very
                    high temperatures, is reduced ultimately to a mixture of peroxide, Na <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. Industrially the salt is important as being the raw
                    material for the manufacture of nitric acid and of nitrate of potash.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nitrate of potash</hi> (saltpetre), which forms the
                    predominating component of gunpowder, occurs native in India and other parts of
                    the world, and such native nitre has only to be purified by crystallization to
                    become fit for the market. But the bulk of what occurs in commerce is made by
                    double decomposition of Chili saltpetre with (a) caustic potash, (δ) carbonate
                    of potash, or (c) chloride of potassium, which processes yield (a) caustic soda,
                    (5) carbonate of soda, (c) common salt as bye-products. The third form (c) of
                    the method is most largely wrought, the necessary supplies of cheap chloride of
                    potassium being furnished by the works at the Stassfurt deposits. The two raw
                    materials are analysed, and quantities corresponding to NaNO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = 85 of nitrate of soda and KCl = 74 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 parts of chloride of potassium respectively are
                    dissolved together in an iron basin in the least quantity of hot water. The
                    solution is boiled down to l <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 specific gravity
                    (hot), when the common salt formed gradually crystallizes out. It is fished out,
                    allowed to drain, and the runnings are returned to the basin. The highly
                    concentrated mother-liquor is allowed to cool with frequent agitation, so that
                    the saltpetre, which crystallizes and assumes the form of a “meal,” is more
                    readily freed from mother-liquor, by judicious washing with cold water. The
                    crude saltpetre which is thus obtained is recrystallized until it is almost
                    chemically pure, because an even slightly contaminated salt is unfit for
                    gunpowder making. Nitrate of potash is isomorphous with the soda salt in this
                    sense that it is possible to obtain it in the form of rhombohedra; but these
                    rhombohedra have no great stability, and under ordinary conditions the salt
                    always assumes the form of long six-sided prisms of the right-rhombic system. It
                    is far less soluble in water than nitrate of soda, and, unlike it, is absolutely
                    non-hygroscopic. One hundred parts of water at 0°, 10°, 20°, 50°, 80°, 100° C.
                    dissolve 13'3, 21’1, 31'2, 86, 172, 247 parts of salt. The boiling fully
                    saturated solution is at 114°, and contains 327 parts of salt per 100 of water
                    (Mulder). It fuses at 352° C. (Carnelley) into a colourless liquid, which
                    freezes into a hard compact mass exhibiting a coarse, fibrous fracture if the
                    salt is pure. In an impure salt this structure becomes the less distinct the
                    greater the proportion of impurities; with a saltpetre which contains 3 <hi
                    rend="italic">'5</hi> per cent, of common salt, the fibres appear only at the
                    edges of the surface of fracture. This is the basis of a now almost forgotten
                    test for purity, and explains that to the present day the term “refraction” is
                    used to designate the sum total of impurities contained in 100 parts of nitre
                    analysed. When heated sufficiently beyond its fusing point it decomposes
                    similarly to nitrate of soda, only it gives up its oxygen far less readily. A
                    mixture of nitre with charcoal, sulphur, or other combustible matter, when
                    kindled, burns off with explosive violence.</p>
                <p>Hence its application for the manufacture of gunpowder ami in pyrotechnics, and
                    its use in the laboratory as a powerful oxidizing agent in operations of the dry
                    way.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nitric Acid,</hi> HN0 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi> p. 511 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> is prepared
                    from nitrate of potash or soda by distillation with sulphuric acid. The
                    scientific chemist prefers the potash salt because it is more easily purified;
                    the manufacturer uses nitrate of soda because it is cheaper and a lower
                    temperature and a less excess of oil of vitriol (over and above 1H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> for 2RNO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) suffice for its successful conversion into acid. For
                    manufacturing purposes the distillation is effected from out of horizontal
                    cylindrical or deep hemispherical retorts made of cast iron (a material which is
                    far less attacked by the acids than one might be inclined to think). The retort
                    communicates with a series of λVoulfe ’ s bottles made of stoneware, which are
                    sometimes provided with taps for letting off the distillate. The retort, after
                    having been charged and connected with the receivers, is heated over a naked
                    fire until all the acid is driven off, and nothing but a (more or less acid)
                    sulphate of soda is left. The details of the manufacture vary according to the
                    kind of acid which is intended to be produced. If the manufacture of ordinary
                    aquafortis (of 1 ’ 3 to 1 '4 specific gravity) is aimed at the receivers are
                    charged with the proper proportion of water, and less than 1H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> may be used for the
                    decomposition of lNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> Na, because the "peroxide of
                    nitrogen from the dissociated part of the acid, by the action of the water and
                    the air in the receivers, is to a great extent reconverted into nitric acid. The
                    preparation of acid of highest strength demands the full equivalent of vitriol.
                    But even then the product, apart from the contents of the first few condenser
                    bottles nearest to the retort, is strongly contaminated with dissolved peroxide,
                    which imparts to the acid a deep red colour. This impurity can be brought down
                    to about 2 per cent, by blowing air through the gently heated acid, which
                    carries away the peroxide as a vapour. To utilize the latter, the mixture is
                    made to ascend through a tower filled λvith coke kept moist by a constant rain
                    of water running downwards against the stream of acid fumes. Water alone would
                    convert two-thirds of the nitrogen into nitric acid, thus:—3N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> ( + aqua) = 2NO + (2N
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> +aqua); but by the
                    cooperation of the oxygen of the air a larger proportion of acid is being
                    regenerated as aquafortis of about 1 ’ 3 specific gravity. Two kinds of acid are
                    chiefly being produced, viz., (1) full-strength fuming acid of 1'5 to 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 52 specific gravity at 15° C., which is largely used
                    (in the tar-colour industry fi&gt;r the making of nitro-bodies, and also for the
                    manufacture of gun-cotton and nitroglycerin), and (2) aquafortis of l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 35 to 1 '42 specific gravity, for the charging of
                    batteries, and as a reagent generally. Either acid is sold in two qualities,—as
                    colourless acid relatively free of peroxide of nitrogen, and as red acid charged
                    with it, which admixture is not always an impurity in a technical sense, but
                    desired for certain purposes to be present. Most commercial acid is contaminated
                    with chlorine and sulphuric acid, which can both be removed by fractional
                    distillation—most easily from the strongest acid. The chlorine accumulates in
                    the first runnings; the sulphuric acid remains in the retort, if the
                    distillation be stopped in time.</p>
                <p>For most purposes the strength of an acid can be determined with sufficient

                <p>Regarding the reactions of nitric acid with elementary substances and with
                    inorganic compounds generally, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(ut sup.</hi> pp. 511-514). The general effect of the treatment of
                    an organic substance with aquafortis is that the acidis reduced to lower oxides
                    of nitrogen and water, while the organic substance undergoes some kind of
                    oxidation, which sometimes assumes the character of a combustion. With regard to
                    the more immediately formed oxidation products it is difficult to speak in
                    general terms; suffice it to say that, according to Carius, all organic
                    substances when heated with nitric acid in sealed-up tubes to 150° to 300° C.
                    are burned completely into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogen or nitrogen
                    oxides. Any other element that may be present passes into its highest state of
                    oxidation: sulphur, for instance, becomes sulphuric acid; phosphorus,
                    phosphoric, &amp;c. Very remarkable is the action of real nitric acid, when
                    employed in the cold, and under conditions precluding the accumulation of water
                    or lower oxides of nitrogen. The acid then, if it acts at all, unites with the
                    respective substances, with elimination of water and formation from the body B
                    of a product B + nHNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>-nH <hi rend="subscript">

                    are sometimes called, divide themselves into two classes:— (1) <hi rend="italic"

                    sugar, mannite, cellulose, and many other OH-compoun&lt;ls not usually called
                    alcohols (in these the group NO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.0 stands where the
                    OH was in the original substance); and (2) <hi rend="italic">nitro-bodies
                    proper,</hi> in which the NO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-group has taken the
                    place of an H which was combined directly with carbon. An example is the
                    nitrobenzol, C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> (NO

                    treated with nascent hydrogen, the NO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> as a rule
                    goes out and is replaced by an amidogen NH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; thus C

                    to us here chiefly as a link between the two elements on the one hand and
                    nitrogenous organic bodies proper on the other. Hydrocyanic acid, NCH, can be
                    produced synthetically in a number of ways; we may, for instance, synthesize
                    cyanide of barium, BaN <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, as shown above, and decompose it by sulphuric acid. A more direct method
                    is to first combine carbon with hydrogen into acetylene and then to subject a
                    mixture of this and nitrogen gas to a spark-current, when hydrocyanic acid is
                    produced, thus:—C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> +
                    N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2HNC.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alkylamines.—</hi> When hydrogen is generated within an
                    acidified solution of hydrocyanic acid by means of zinc, the cyanide, by taking

                    This shows the possibility of producing from hydrocyanic acid, in the first

                <p>With the so-called aromatic bodies a very general method for producing

                    hydrogen. Thus, for instance, we can convert nitrobenzol, C <hi rend="subscript"

                    and, in a relative sense at least, exclude water as a medium. In the case of
                    nitrate of aniline, for instance, the two atoms of oxygen in the nitrous acid
                    combine with all the hydrogen of the generic radicals, while all the rest unites

                    that the method there given as that of Dumas, for combustible carbon compounds,
                    can be made to apply to metallic nitrates by simply substituting finely divided
                    metallic copper for the oxide of copper as a burning agent, and that Varrentrapp
                    and Will’s method applies’as it stands to metallic nitrides and amides, to
                    metallic cyanides, and to all metal-amines. We confine ourselves here to the
                    more important methods for the detection of certain classes of nitrogen
                    compounds.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Ammonia-salts</hi> and most acid-amides and amin-acids, when
                    treated with aqueous potash, give off their nitrogen as ammonia gas, which, if
                    sufficient in quantity, is easily detected by (a) its pungent smell, (ά) its
                    action on turmeric or red-litmus paper, (c) its forming dense clouds of
                    sal-ammoniac when brought into contact with a glass rod moistened with muriatic
                    acid. Should the vapours of ammonia be too highly attenuated to be thus
                    identified, condense them in dilute muriatic acid, and to the distillate
                    obtained (after neutralization of the free acid by potash or soda) apply
                    “Nessler’s reagent” (a solution of the salt HgI <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.2KI
                    in aqueous caustic potash or soda; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mercury,</hi> vol.
                    xvi. p. 34). The least trace of ammonia, if present, assumes the form of iodide
                    of mercur-ammonium, which, if too little to come down as a precipitate, will
                    announce itself by imparting to the liquid an intense brown or yellow colour.
                    One-hundredth of a milligram of ammonia diffused throughout 50 c.c. of liquid
                    <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> five million times its weight) can thus be
                    detected with unerring certainty.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Nitrous and Nitric Acid.—</hi> We assume the acids to be
                    given as solutions of their alkaline salts, and may well do so because other
                    metallic salts of either acid can easily be brought into this form by suitable
                    operations. A solution of alkaline nitrite, when mixed with aqueous sulphuric
                    acid, gives off brown fumes (of N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) if it is sufficiently concentrated. In more dilute
                    solutions the liberated nitrous acid breaks up into nitric acid and nitric oxide
                    gas, which latter forms brown fumes (of N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) as soon as it comes into contact with the air. In
                    still more dilute solutions the liberated nitrous acid remains undecomposed, but
                    is readily detected by a sufficiency of a strong solution of ferrous sulphate or
                    chloride, which reagents liberate nitric oxide from it and dissolve it with
                    formation of an inky-black solution. This is the most characteristic and a
                    highly delicate test. But in the latter respect it is far surpassed by “Gries’s
                    reagent,”—a solution of sulphate of meta - diamido-benzol in dilute sulphuric
                    acid. When this solution is added to even the most dilute solution of nitrous
                    acid, a yellow coloration is developed which attains its maximum of intensity
                    after about fifteen minutes standing. This test is fully as delicate as
                    Nessler’s for ammonia.</p>
                <p>A nitrate solution, when mixed with aqueous sulphuric acid or that acid and
                    ferrous salt, exhibits no visible change. But when the solution is mixed with
                    its own volume of (concentrated) oil of vitriol, so as to not only liberate but
                    also dehydrate the nitric acid, and a strong solution of ferrous sulphate is
                    cautiously poured on the top of the mixture, nitric oxide is eliminated which
                    dissolves in, and strikes an inky-black colour with, the ferrous salt layer.
                    This is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> test for nitrates.</p>
                <p>When a solution containing nitrates or nitrites is distilled with concentrated
                    caustic potash or soda and aluminium foil or zinc-foil and iron filings (or any
                    metal or combination which, with the pure alkali-solution, would give off
                    hydrogen), the nitrogen is gradually eliminated as ammonia, which can be
                    condensed, and, however little it may amount to, detected by Nessler’s reagent,
                    as above explained. (W. D.)</p>
