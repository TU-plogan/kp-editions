                    rend="smallcaps">jin,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Nyezhin,</hi> a district town
                    of Russia, situated in the government of Tchernigoff, 50 miles south-east of
                    that town, on the railway between Kursk and Kieff. The old town is built on the
                    left bank of the (canalized) river Oster, and its suburbs, Novoye Myesto and
                    Magherki, on the right. It has an old cathedral, two Greek churches, one
                    Catholic church, a synagogue, and two monasteries. The high school (lyceum of
                    Bezborodko) formerly had 200 students, but now only from 30 to 40, since its
                    transformation into a philological institute. The 23,000 inhabitants are mostly
                    Little Russians and Jews (about 3000); there are also some 400 Greeks,
                    descendants of those who immigrated in the 17th century, at the invitation of
                    Bogdan Khmelnitski, and have since then constituted a privileged trading
                    corporation. About 7000 of the population of Niezhin are engaged in agriculture,
                    in market gardening, and especially in the cultivation and preparation of
                    tobacco. Cast-iron wares and agricultural implements are manufactured, but not
                    extensively; candlemaking and tanning are also carried on. In the district there
                    are several distilleries, producing about 160,000 gallons of wine-spirit. The
                    commerce of Niezhin, which formerly was very prosperous, has fallen off since
                    the opening of the Black Sea ports. Its merchants, however, especially the
                    Greeks, still carry on an active trade in tobacco, which is exported from
                    Niezhin to the amount of nearly 200,000 cwts., in all kinds of manufactured
                    wares, in cattle, in wine-spirit, and also in preserved fruits and vegetables,
                    which are a kind of specialty with the citizens.</p>
                <p>The date of the foundation of Niezhin is unknown, but Unyezh, which is supposed
                    to have been its former name, is mentioned as early as 1147. At that time it
                    belonged to the principality of Tchernigoff; afterwards it fell under the rule
                    of Poland. It was ceded to Russia about 1500, but became again a Polish
                    possession after the treaty of Deuliu. In 1649, after the revolt of Little
                    Russia and its liberation from the Polish rule, Niezhin was the chief town of
                    one of the most important Cossack regiments. It was annexed to Russia in 1664.
                    In the 18th century it was a flourishing commercial city, owing to its situation
                    on the highways from Kiefl <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> to Moscow and from
                    Tchernigoff to Poltava, and to the Greek merchants who kept up commercial
                    relations with Turkey, Italy, and Austria.</p>
