                    than to the <hi rend="italic">notarius.</hi> In the canon law the notary was a
                    person of great importance, and it was a maxim of that law that his evidence was
                    worth that of two unskilled witnesses.</p>
                <p>In most European countries he still holds something of his old position under the
                    canon law. In France, for instance, a document attested by a notary is said to
                    be “legalized,” a term much too strong to express the effect of such attestation
                    in England, where the notary public, in spite of his name, is not recognized as
                    a public officer to such a degree as the notary in other countries. The office
                    of notary in England is a very ancient one. It is mentioned in statute law as
                    early as the Statute of Provisors, 25 Edward III. stat. 4. The English notary is
                    a skilled person, nominated since 25 Henry VIII. c. 21 by the archbishop of
                    Canterbury through the master of the faculties (now the judge of the provincial
                    courts of Canterbury and York), in order to secure evidence as to the
                    attestation<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0654-0597"/> of important documents. All registrars of
                    ecclesiastical courts must be notaries.</p>
                <p>The office is still nominally an ecclesiastical one, though its duties are mainly
                    of a secular character. “The general functions of a notary consist in receiving
                    all acts and contracts which must or are wished to be clothed with an authentic
                    form; in conferring on such documents the required authenticity; in establishing
                    their date; in preserving originals or minutes of them which, when prepared in
                    the style and with the seal of the notary, obtain the name of original acts; and
                    in giving authentic copies of such acts” (Brooke, <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Office of a Notary,</hi> chap, iii.). The act of a notary in authenticating or
                    certifying a document is technically called a “notarial act.” In most countries
                    the notarial act is received in evidence as a semi-judicial matter, and the
                    certificate of a notary is probative of the facts certified. But English law
                    does not recognize the notarial act to this extent. An English court will, in
                    certain cases, take judicial notice of the seal of a notary, but not that the
                    facts that he has certified are true, except in the case of a bill of exchange
                    protested abroad.</p>
                <p>The most important part of an English notary’s duty at the present day is the
                    noting and protest of foreign bills of exchange in case of non-acceptance or
                    non-payment. This must be done by a notary in order that the holder may recover.
                    He also prepares ship protests and protests of other kinds relating to
                    mercantile matters. The office of notary is now usually, though not necessarily,
                    held by a solicitor. In London he must be free of the Scriveners’ Company. The
                    principal statutes relating to English notaries are 25 Henry VIII. c. 21; 41
                    George III. c. 79; 3 and 4 William IV. c. 70; 6 and 7 Vict. c. 90.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, before the reign of James III., papal and imperial notaries
                    practised until the third parliament of that king, held at Edinburgh on the 29th
                    November 1469, when an Act was passed declaring that notaries should be made by
                    the king. It would appear, however, that for some time afterwards there were in
                    Scotland two kinds of notaries, clerical and legal,—the instruments taken by the
                    latter bearing faith in civil matters. In 1551 an Act was passed directing
                    sheriffs to bring or send both kinds of notaries to the lords of session to be
                    examined; and in a subsequent statute, passed in 1555, it was ordained that no
                    notary, “by whatsoever power he be created,” should use the office “except he
                    first present himself to the said lords, showing his creation, and be admitted
                    by them thereto.” It does not appear that this statute vested the right of
                    making notaries in the court of session; but in 1563 it was by law declared that
                    no person should take on him the office, under the pain of death, unless created
                    by the sovereign’s special letters, and thereafter examined and admitted by the
                    lords of session. Since then the court of session has in Scotland exercised full
                    and exclusive authority on the admission of notaries in all legal matters,
                    spiritual and temporal. The position of notaries in Scotland is somewhat higher
                    than it is in England. Certain facts connected with the title to land must be
                    authenticated by notarial instrument, 21 and 22 Vict. c. 76. A notary may
                    execute a deed for a person unable to write, 37 and 38 Vict. c. 94, s. 41. The
                    parish clergyman has notarial powers to the extent of executing a will,—a relic
                    of the old ecclesiastical position of notaries.</p>
                <p>In America the duties of a notary vary in different States. “They are generally
                    as follows :—to protest bills of exchange and draw up acts of honour; to
                    authenticate and certify copies of documents; to receive the affidavits of
                    mariners and draw’ up protests relating to the same; to attest deeds and other
                    instruments; and to administer oaths” (Bouvier, <hi rend="italic">Law
                    Dictionary).</hi></p>
