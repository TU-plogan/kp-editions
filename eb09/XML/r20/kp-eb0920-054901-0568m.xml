                <p><label type="entry">RIDDLES</label> are probably the oldest extant form of
                    humour. They spring from man’s earliest perception that there are such things as
                    analogies in nature. Man observes an example of analogy, puts his observations
                    in the form of a question, and there is the riddle ready made. Some Boeotian
                    humorist, for example, detected the analogy between the life of humanity—the
                    child on all fours, the man erect on two legs, old age with its staff—on one
                    side, and on the other the conception of an animal with a varying number of
                    limbs. Put this in a question, and it is the riddle of the Sphinx. Another
                    instance is the question—“What we caught we threw away, what we could not catch
                    we kept.” Homer is said to have died of vexation at not being able to discover
                    the answer to this riddle, still current on the coast of Brittany, in Germany,
                    and in Gascony. After inventing the riddle, men began to use it in a kind of
                    game; bets were staked on the answer, and sides were made, each side backing its
                    champion. These sports in Marriner’s time were common in Tonga; they are no less
                    popular among the African Woloffs. The example of Samson’s riddle set to the
                    Philistines is an instance of the sport in a Semitic country. In mährchen and
                    ballads, the hero’s chance of winning his beloved, or of escaping threatened
                    punishment, is often made to turn on his power of answering riddles. It follows
                    from the artless and primitive character of the riddle that regular popular
                    riddles <hi rend="italic">(Devinettes)</hi> are widely distributed, like popular
                    tales, popular songs, and popular customs. The Woloffs ask, “What flies for ever
                    and rests never?” Answer, The Wind. The Basutos put this riddle—“What is
                    wingless and legless, yet flies fast and cannot be imprisoned ?” Answer, The
                    Voice. The German riddle runs—“What can go in face of the sun yet leave no
                    shadow <hi rend="italic">Ί”</hi> Answer, The Wind. In riddles may perhaps be
                    noticed the animistic or personalizing tendency of early human thought, just
                    beginning to be conscious of itself. The person who asked these riddles had the
                    old sense of wind, for example, as a person, yet probably, unlike the Bushmen,
                    he would never expect to see the personal wind. He knew the distinction between
                    the personal and impersonal well enough to be sure that his enigma would present
                    some difficulty. The riddle, to be brief, is an interrogatory form of the fable,
                    and like the fable originates among rude people, and is perpetuated in the
                    folklore of peasantry.</p>
                <p>Probably the best book on the riddle (a subject less frequently studied than the
                    mährchen or the myth) is Eugène Rolland, <hi rend="italic">Devinettes ou Énigmes
                    Populaires,</hi> with a preface by M. Gaston Paris. The power of answering
                    riddles among the people who invented the legend of Solomon and the queen of
                    Sheba seems to have been regarded as a proof of great sagacity. The riddle
                    proper is all but extinct outside folklore and savage life, and has been
                    replaced by the conundrum, which is a pun in the interrogative form.</p>
