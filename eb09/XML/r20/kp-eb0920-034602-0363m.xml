                <p><label type="entry">REGNAULT</label><hi rend="smallcaps">Henri</hi> (1843-1871),
                    French painter, born at Paris on the 31st October 1843, was the son of Henri
                    Victor Régnault (noticed below). On leaving school he successively entered the
                    studios of Montfort, Lamothe, and Cabanel, was beaten for the Great Prize (1863)
                    by Layraud and Montchablon, and in 1864 exhibited two portraits in no wise
                    remarkable at the Salon. Nothing, in short, produced by Régnault up to 1866 led
                    men to suspect the brilliancy of his endowments, but in that year he made a
                    mark, carrying off the Great Prize with a work of unusual force and
                    distinction—Thetis bringing the Arms forged by Vulcan to Achilles (School of the
                    Fine Arts). The past and the works of the past in Italy did not touch him, but
                    his illustrations to Wey’s <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> show how observant he was
                    of actual life and manners; even his Automedon (School of Fine Arts), executed
                    in obedience to Academical regulations, was but a lively recollection of a
                    carnival horse race. At Rome, moreover, Régnault came into contact with the
                    modern Hispano-Italian school, a school highly materialistic in its aims and
                    tendencies, and inclined to regard even the human subject only as one amongst
                    many sources whence to obtain amusement for the eye. The vital, if narrow,
                    energy of this school told on Régnault with ever-increasing force during the few
                    remaining years of his life. In 1868 he had sent to the Salon a life-size
                    portrait of a lady in which he had made one of the first attempts to render the
                    actual character of fashionable modern life, and, on his return from a visit to
                    the exhibition, he seized the opportunity of making a tour in Spain. There he
                    saw Prim pass at the head of his troops, and received that lively image of a
                    military demagogue which he afterwards put on canvas somewhat to the displeasure
                    of his subject. But this work made an appeal to the imagination of the public,
                    whilst all the later productions of Régnault were addressed exclusively to the
                    eye. After a further flight to Africa, abridged by the necessities of his
                    position as a pensioner of the school of Rome, he painted Judith, then (1870)
                    Salome, and, as</p>

                    played with the blood of the victim as were he a jeweller toying with rubies.
                    The war arose, and found Régnault foremost in the devoted ranks of Buzenval,
                    where he fell on January 19, 1871.</p>
