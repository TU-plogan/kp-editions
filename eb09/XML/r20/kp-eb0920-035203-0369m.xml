                    teacher. Until his twelfth year the son received his education almost entirely
                    from his father. He passed from his father’s tuition into the class of the
                    famous scholar Johann Albrecht Fabricius, whose son-in-law he subsequently
                    became. In his twentieth year he entered the university of Jena, where he
                    studied theology, ancient languages, and philosophy. After making a tour in
                    Holland and England (1720), he became privat-docent in the university of
                    Wittenberg; and in 1723 he accepted the post of rector of the high, school at
                    Wismar in Mecklenburg, which he exchanged four years afterwards for that of
                    professor of Hebrew and Oriental languages in the high school of his native
                    city. This post he held till his death, though offers of more lucrative and
                    distinguished positions were at various times made to him. His professional
                    duties were but light, and he employed his ample leisure in the study of
                    philology, mathematics, philosophy, history, political economy, natural science,
                    and natural history, for which he made expensive collections. Philosophy and
                    theology, however, became with his advancing years the chief subjects of
                    pursuit. From 1744 to 1768 lie had in hand the theological work from which
                    Lessing published the notorious <hi rend="italic">Fragments</hi> in 1774-78.
                    Reimarus was held by his contemporaries in the highest esteem as a scholar, a
                    thinker, an author, and a man. His house was the centre of the highest culture
                    of Hamburg, and a monument of his influence in that city still remains in the
                    <hi rend="italic">linns</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >patriotischen Gesellschaft,</hi> where the learned and artistic societies
                    partly founded by him still meet. His wife bore him seven children, three only
                    of whom lived to grow up, namely his only surviving son׳—the distinguished
                    physician Johann Albrecht Heinrich—and two daughters, one of them being Elise,
                    Lessing’s friend and correspondent. Ten days before his death he invited a
                    select number of friends to dine with him, and, with his wonted cheerfulness and
                    amiability, declared to them solemnly that this was h!3 <pb break="no"

                    taken seriously ill, and died March 1, 1768.</p>
                <p>Reimarus’s reputation as a classical and historical scholar rests on the valuable
                    edition of Dio Cassius (1750-52) which he prepared from the. materials collected
                    by his father-in-law, J. A. Fabricius. In the department of philosophy he
                    published a work on logic ( <hi rend="italic">Vernunftlehre als Anweisung zum
                    richtigen Gebrauche der Vernunft,</hi> 1756, fifth edition 1790), and two very
                    popular books bearing on the great religious questions of the day. The first of
                    these works was a collection of essays on the principal truths of natural
                    religion <hi rend="italic">(Abhandlungen von den vornehmsten Wahrheiten der
                    natürlichen Religion</hi> , 1754, 6th ed. 1791) ־ the second ( <hi rend="italic"
                    >Betrachtungen über die Kunsttriebe der Thiere,</hi> 1762, 4th ed. 1798) dealt
                    with one particular branch of the same subject. In these works he appears as a
                    powerful opponent of French materialism and Spinoza’s pantheism, a zealous
                    teleologist and able wielder of the ai’gument from design. His philosophical
                    position is essentially that of Christian Wolff. But it is the work (carefully
                    kept back during his lifetime, strangely enough) from which Lessing published
                    certain chapters after the author’s death with which his name is most widely
                    associated. Lessing’s relation to this work has been stated in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lessing.</hi> Its title in the MS. is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apologie oder Schutzschrift für die vernünftigen Verehrer Gottes.</hi> The
                    original MS. is in the Hamburg town library <hi rend="italic">;</hi> a copy was
                    made for the university library of Göttingen, 1814, and other copies are known
                    to exist. In addition to the seven fragments published by Lessing, a second
                    portion of the work was issued in 1787 by C. A. E. Schmidt (a pseudonym), under
                    the title <hi rend="italic">TJebrige noch ungedruckte Werke des
                    Wolfenbüttelschen Fragmentisten,</hi> and a further portion by D. W. Klose in
                    <hi rend="italic">JViedner’s Zeitschrift für historische Theologie</hi> ,
                    1850-52. Two of the five books of the first part and the whole of the second
                    part, as well as appendices on the canon, remain still, and will probably always
                    remain, unprinted. But D. F. Strauss has given an exhaustive analysis of the
                    whole work in his book on Reimarus.</p>
                <p>The standpoint of Reimarus in his <hi rend="italic">Apologie</hi> is that of pure
                    naturalistic deism. Miracles and mysteries are denied, and natural religion is
                    put forward as the absolute contradiction of revealed. The essential truths of
                    the former are the existence of a wise and good Creator and the doctrine of the
                    immortality of the soul. These truths are discoverable by reason, and are such
                    as can constitute the basis of a univei'sal and rational religion. A revealed
                    religion could never obtain universality, as it could never be made intelligible
                    and credible to all men. Even supposing its possibility, the Bible does not
                    present such a revelation. It abounds in error as to matters of fact,
                    contradicts human experience, reason, and morals, and is one tissue of folly,
                    deceit, enthusiasm, selfishness, and crime. Moreover, it is not a doctrinal
                    compendium, or catechism, which a revelation would have to be. What the Old
                    Testament says of the worship of God is little, and that little worthless, while
                    its writers are unacquainted with the second fundamental truth of religion, the
                    immortality of the soul. The design of the writers of the New Testament, as well
                    as that of Jesus, was not to teach true rational religion, but to serve their
                    own selfish ambitions, in promoting which Reimarus makes them exhibit an
                    inconceivable combination of conscious fraud and enthusiasm. With all his
                    acuteness as a rationalistic critic, and the destructive force of his attack
                    upon the old orthodox conception of the nature of the Bible and revelation,
                    Reimarus must be regarded simply as the classical representative of rationalism
                    in its absolute inability to form any remotely just conception of God, religion,
                    revelation, the Bible, and Christianity. His <hi rend="italic">Apologie</hi> is
                    the historical monument to the incapacity of rationalism with regard to
                    philosophy, religion, and true historical and literary criticism. By the higher
                    and profounder ideas and historical insight of Lessing, Herder, Semler, Kant,
                    and Schleiermacher, his entire position was rendered antiquated, and the
                    permanently valid portions of his criticism of the Bible are of value only as
                    destructive of a theory, now outlived, of it and religion. But as a learned,
                    acute, and logical assailant of that theory he must be honoured with a place
                    amongst the pioneers of truer views of both.</p>
