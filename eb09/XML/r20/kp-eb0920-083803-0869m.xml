                    jeweller in London, whose father had emigrated from Montpellier after the
                    revocation of the edict of Nantes, and who had married a Miss Garnault, a</p>
                <p>Huguenot refugee like himself, but of a far wealthier family. Samuel Romilly was
                    born in Frith Street, Soho, on lst March 1757, and was named after Sir Samuel
                    Fludyer, M.P. for the city of London and alderman, who was in partnership with
                    two of his uncles. He served for a time in his father’s shop; but his education
                    was not neglected, and he became a good classical scholar and particularly
                    conversant with French literature. A legacy of £2000 from one of his mother’s
                    relations led to his being articled to a solicitor and clerk in Chancery with
                    the idea of qualifying himself to purchase the office of one of the six clerks
                    in Chancery. In 1778, however, he determined to go to the bar, and entered
                    himself at Gray’s Inn. He went to Geneva in 1781, where he Inadetheacquaintance
                    of the chief democratic leaders, including Étienne Dumont. Called to the bar in
                    1783, he went the midland circuit, but was chiefly occupied with Chancery
                    practice. On the publication of Madan’s <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on Executive
                    Justice,</hi> advocating the increase of capital punishments, he at once wrote
                    and published in 1786 <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi> on Madan’s book. Of
                    more general interest is his intimacy with the great Mirabeau, to whom he was
                    introduced in 1784 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mirabeau).</hi> Mirabeau saw him
                    daily for a long time and introduced him to Lord Lansdowne, who highly
                    appreciated him, and, when Mirabeau became a political leader, it was to Romilly
                    that he applied for an account of the procedure used in the English House of
                    Commons. He visited Paris in 1789, and studied the <pb break="no"

                    published his <hi rend="italic">ThougJds on the Probable InJiuenxe of the Late
                    Revolution in France upon Great Britain,</hi> a work of great power. His
                    practice at the Chancery bar continued largely to increase, and in 1800 he was
                    made a K. C. In 1798 he married the daughter of Francis Garbett of Knill Court,
                    Herefordshire; and in 1805 he was appointed chancellor of the county palatine of
                    Durham. His great abilities were thoroughly recognized by the Whig party, to
                    which he attached himself; and in 1806, on the accession of the ministry of “All
                    the Talents” to office, he was offered the post of solicitor-general, although
                    he had never sat in the House of Commons. He accepted the office, and was
                    knighted and brought into parliament for Queenborough. He went out of office
                    with the Government, but remained in the House of Commons, sitting successively
                    for Horsham, Wareham, and Arundel. It was now that Sir Samuel Romilly commenced
                    the greatest labour of his life, his attempt to reform the criminal law of
                    England, which was at once cruel and illogical. By statute law innumerable
                    offences were punished by death, but, as such wholesale executions would be
                    impossible, the larger number of those convicted and sentenced to death at every
                    assizes were respited, after having heard the sentence of death solemnly passed
                    upon them. This led to many acts of injustice, as the lives of the convicts
                    depended on the caprice of the judges, while at the same time it made the whole
                    system of punishments and of the criminal law ridiculous. Romilly saw this, and
                    in 1808 he managed to repeal the statute 8 Eliz. c. 4, which made it a capital
                    offence to steal from the person. This success, however, raised opposition, and
                    in the following year three bills repealing equally sanguinary statutes were
                    thrown out by the House of Lords under the influence of Lord Ellenborough. Year
                    after year the same influence prevailed, and Romilly saw his bills rejected; but
                    his patient efforts and his eloquence ensured victory eventually for his cause
                    by opening the eyes of Englishmen to the barbarity of their criminal law. The
                    only success he had was in securing the repeal, in 1812, of the statute 39 Eliz.
                    c. 17, making it a capital offence for a soldier or a mariner to beg without a
                    pass from a magistrate or his commanding officer. Sir Samuel Romilly’s efforts
                    made his name famous not only in England but all over Europe, and on 4th July
                    1818 he had the honour of being returned at the head of the poll for the city of
                    Westminster. He did not long survive his triumph. On the 29th of October 1818
                    Lady Romilly died in the Isle of Wight. Her husband’s grief was intense, and he
                    committed suicide in a fit of temporary insanity on the 2d November. No man of
                    his time was more loved than Sir Samuel Romilly; his singularly sweet nature,
                    his upright manliness, his eloquence, and his great efforts on behalf of
                    humanity secured him permanent fame. His second son John rivalled his reputation
                    as a lawyer, and after being appointed master of the rolls in 1851, an office
                    which he held for twenty-two years, was raised to the peerage as Lord Romilly in
                    1866.</p>
