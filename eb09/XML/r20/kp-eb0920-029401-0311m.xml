                    (1777-1857), one of the most celebrated sculptors of modern times, was born at
                    Arolsen in the principality* of Waldeck on the 2d of January 1777. The opening
                    career of the young artist was attended with considerable difficulty, his
                    parents being poor and unable to place him under efficient masters. His first
                    instructor taught him little else than the art of sculpturing grave-stones, and
                    Professor Ruhl of Cassel could not give him much more. A wider field of
                    improvement opened up before him when he removed to Berlin in 1797; but poverty
                    still hampered all his efforts. He was obliged to earn a livelihood by becoming
                    a royal lackey, and to reserve the prosecution of his favourite art for his
                    spare hours. The genius of Rauch, however, soon forced itself into notice and
                    recommended him to several persons of influence who were able to give him
                    assistance. Queen Louisa, surprising him one day in the act of modelling her
                    features in wax, sent him to study at the Academy of Art. Not long afterwards,
                    in 1804, Count Sandrecky gave him the means to complete his education at Rome,
                    where William von Humboldt, Canova, and Thorwaldsen befriended him. Under such
                    patronage the young sculptor made rapid progress. Among other works, he executed
                    bas-reliefs of Hippolytus and Phaedra, Mars and Venus wounded by Diomede, and a
                    Child praying. In 1811 Rauch entered upon the eminent part of his career, when
                    he Avas commissioned to execute a monument for Queen Louisa of Prussia. The
                    statue, representing the queen in a sleeping posture, was placed in a mausoleum
                    in the grounds of Charlottenburg, and procured great fame for the artist.
                    Commissions for portraits came pouring in upon him. The consummate tact with
                    which he seized individual characteristics and the artistic manner in which he
                    treated them at once established his reputation. The erection of nearly all
                    public statues came to be entrusted to him. He began to execute that long series
                    of representations of great Germans in which his genius is exhibited to full
                    advantage. In course of time almost every important town throughout the country
                    possessed a bust of some eminent statesman, patriot, or man of genius from his
                    chisel. There were, among others, Blücher at Breslau, Maximilian at Munich,
                    Francke at Halle, Dürer at Nuremberg, Luther at Wittenberg, and the grand-duke
                    Paul Frederick at Sch Averin. At length, in 1830, he commenced, along Avith
                    Schinkel the architect, the models for a colossal monument at Berlin to
                    Frederick the Great. This Avork was inaugurated with great pomp in May 1851, and
                    has ever since been regarded as one of the masterpieces of modern sculpture. On
                    a granite pedestal 25 feet in height stands the colossal equestrian statue of
                    the king. His plain pinched features and his grotesque costume are given Avith
                    historical exactness Avithout impairing the artistic effect. An air of
                    resistless majesty ennobles the mean countenance, and a bold and skilful
                    treatment hides the absurdity of the garb. The excellence of his masterpiece was
                    recognized throughout the Avorld. Princes decorated him with honours. The
                    academies of Europe enrolled him among their members. Especially did his OAvn
                    sovereign and countrymen regard him with proud affection and respect. A statue
                    of Kant for Königsberg and a statue of Thaer for Berlin occupied his attention
                    during some of his last years; and he had just finished a model of Moses praying
                    betAveen Aaron and Hur Avlien he was attacked by his last illness. He died on 3d
                    December 1857.</p>
