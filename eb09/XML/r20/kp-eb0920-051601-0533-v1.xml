                <p><label type="entry">RHEUMATISM</label> a constitutional disease having for its
                    chief manifestations inflammatory affections of the fibrous textures of joints
                    and other parts, together with a liability to various complications. Two forms
                    of rheumatism are recognized, and will be now briefly described, namely, the
                    acute and the chronic, the latter either resulting from the former or arising
                    independently. In addition to these, a disease -which has received the name of
                    chronic rheumatic (or rheumatoid) arthritis, and which presents many
                    resemblances to chronic rheumatism, although the relation between them is
                    questionable, may be noticed here.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Acute Rheumatism, frequently called Rheumatic Fever, is
                        mainly characterized by inflammation affecting various joints, with a
                        tendency to spread in an erratic manner, and accompanied with much pain,
                        febrile disturbance, and perspiration.</hi></p>
                <p>The nature of this disease has been extensively discussed by pathologists and
                    physicians; but, although numerous, and many of them ingenious, theories have
                    been advanced and supported by evidence drawn from experimentation as well as
                    clinical observation, it cannot yet be said that any one of them has gained
                    general acceptance. It has been held that rheumatism is produced by an excess of
                    lactic acid in the system in connexion with morbid states of the nutritive
                    functions. Support to this view was given experimentally by Dr Richardson, but
                    experiments by others have led to a different conclusion. Again, it has been
                    held that the disease is a textural inflammation due to chill acting upon the
                    parts, either locally through the circulation or through the agency of the
                    nervous system, whereby the nutrition of the joints and Other structures is
                    lowered. Another view regards it as arising primarily in a profound disturb ance
                    of the heat-regulating mechanism of the body by chill, which specially affects
                    the muscular system, causing heat to be generated without work, one of the
                    consequences being that impressions of pain are conveyed to the brain by the
                    articular nerves instead of those of work performed (see Pathology). The view
                    has been held, too, that rheumatism is to be referred to a germ or parasite, or
                    a miasm analogous to the poison of malaria.</p>
                <p>Without attempting to discuss the relative probability of these and other
                    theories, it may be stated that those which point in the direction of a
                    nutritional change in the special tissues affected (the fibrous) as the result
                    of chill or other depressing cause operating through the agency of the nervous
                    system appear more consonant with the pathological evidences of the disease
                    itself than those which would refer the morbid process to the influence of any
                    poison circulating in the blood.</p>
                <p>There are certain points of importance in connexion with the causation of this
                    form of the disease which are generally agreed upon. Thus an hereditary tendency
                    is recognized as among the causes predisposing to acute rheumatism. The extent
                    of this has been variously estimated, but it would appear to be well established
                    that it shows itself in about one-fourth of the cases. Age is another important
                    predisposing condition, the acute form of rheumatism being much more a disease
                    of youth than of later life. The period of adolescence, from sixteen to twenty,
                    is that in which probably the greater number of the cases occur; but even in
                    early childhood the disease may manifest itself, or at any period of life,
                    although it is rarely observed in old age. Persons much exposed to all kinds of
                    weather are specially liable to suffer, and hence the disease is more common
                    among the poorer classes. Any depressing cause acting upon the general health,
                    such as overwork or anxiety, or any habitual drain upon the system, such as
                    overlactation, in like manner has a similar effect. Climate, too, is a factor of
                    great importance, for, although not unfrequently met with in temperate or even
                    warm climates, the disease is unquestionably of more common occurrence in cold
                    and damp regions. Attacks of acute rheumatism are brought on in most instances
                    by exposure to cold, by getting wet through, sometimes also by excessive fatigue
                    such as in walking long distances, especially if in addition there have been
                    overheating of the body and subsequent chill. Persons who have once suffered
                    from this disease are very liable to a recurrence on a renewal of the exciting
                    cause, and even apparently independently of this from such causes as digestive
                    disturbances.</p>
                <p>An attack of acute rheumatism is usually ushered in by chilliness or rigors
                    followed with feverishness and a feeling of stiffness or pain in one or more
                    joints, generally those of larger or medium size, such as the knees, ankles,
                    wrists, shoulders, &lt;fcc., which soon becomes intense, and is accompanied with
                    severe constitutional disturbance and prostration. The patient lies helpless in
                    bed, restless, but afraid to move or to be touched, and unable to bear even the
                    weight of the bed-clothes. The face is flushed, and the whole body bathed in
                    perspiration, which has a highly acid reaction and a sour disagreeable odour.
                    The temperature is markedly elevated (103° to 105°), the pulse rapid, full, and
                    soft; the tongue is coated with a yellow fur; and there are thirst, loss of
                    appetite, and constipation. The urine is diminished in quantity, highly acid,
                    and loaded with urates. At first the pain is confined to only one or two joints,
                    but soon others become affected, and there is often a tendency to symmetry in
                    the manner in which they suffer, the inflammation in one joint being shortly
                    followed by that of the same joint in the opposite limb. The affected joints are
                    red, swollen, hot, and excessively tender. The inflammation seldom continues
                    long in one articulation, but it may return to those formerly affected. In
                    severe cases scarcely a joint large or small escapes, and the pain,
                    restlessness, and fever render the patient’s condition extremely miserable.</p>
                <p>An attack of acute rheumatism is of variable duration, sometimes passing away in
                    the course of a few days, but more frequently lasting for many weeks.
                    Occasionally, when the disease appears to have subsided, relapses occur which
                    bring back all the former symptoms and prolong the case, it may be for months.
                    Again, after all acute symptoms have disappeared, the joints may remain swollen,
                    stiff, and painful on movement, and the rheumatic condition thus becomes
                    chronic.</p>
                <p>After an attack of rheumatism, the patient is much reduced in strength and
                    pale-looking for a considerable time, but should no complication have arisen
                    there may be complete recovery, although doubtless there remains a liability to
                    subsequent attacks. This disease derives much of its serious import from certain
                    accompaniments <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n534/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0920-0534-0517"/>or complications which are apt to attend its
                    progress. Among these may be mentioned excessive fever (hyperpyrexia), which is
                    sometimes developed in a sudden and alarming manner, the temperature rising
                    quickly to 108° -110° or more, and thus endangering life. Indeed in most of such
                    instances death speedily follows unless prompt treatment be resorted to. Another
                    danger is the occurrence of serious head symptoms in the form of delirium or
                    excitement, which may exist in conjunction with hyperpyrexia or independently.
                    Chorea or St Vitus’s dance is also an occasional accompaniment of acute
                    rheumatism. Besides these, other complications pertaining to the respiratory
                    organs, such as pleurisy, pneumonia, bronchitis, &amp;c., sometimes arise in the
                    course of the disease, as well as certain disorders of the skin. But the most
                    frequent and important of all are those affecting the heart. These cardiac
                    affections are regarded by some as an integral part of the rheumatic disease
                    rather than as results of it, especially as it would seem that occasionally they
                    are the Only local manifestation of the attack.</p>
                <p>Pericarditis (inflammation of the investing membrane of the heart) and
                    endocarditis (inflammation of the lining membrane of the heart) are the two most
                    common forms which these heart complications assume, and it is the latter which
                    is specially important as tending to lay the foundation for valvular heart
                    disease (see Heart). It is the liability to these inflammatory heart affections
                    that causes special anxiety during the earlier stages of an attack of acute
                    rheumatism, when it would appear they are more apt to occur. The risk of cardiac
                    complications seems to be greater the younger the patient, and doubtless the
                    foundation of organic heart disease is often laid in early childhood, when, as
                    is now well known, rheumatism is by no means uncommon.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">subacute rheumatism</hi> is sometimes applied to
                    attacks of the disease of less severe type than that now described, but where
                    yet the symptoms exist in a well-marked degree. Cases of this kind may be of
                    even longer duration and more intractable than the more acute variety, although
                    probably the danger to the heart is less.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chronic Rheumatism appears occasionally to be developed as
                        the result of the acute form, but is more frequently an independent
                        constitutional affection, and is usually a complaint of later life. The
                        causes associated with its occurrence are habitual exposure to cold and
                        damp; hence its frequency among outdoor workers. It is also apt to arise in
                        persons debilitated by overwork or privation. Certain poisons introduced
                        into the system are often attended with symptoms of chronic rheumatism,
                        e.&lt;∕., lead, syphilis, &amp;c. This disease is often hereditary. It
                        differs from acute rheumatism in being less frequently attended with fever
                        and constitutional disturbance and less liable to dangerous complications,
                        but on the other hand it is much more apt to produce permanent alterations
                        in the joints and parts affected. The joints tend to become swollen both
                        from effusion of fluid and from chronic inflammatory thickening of the
                        textures, and the result is stiffness and sometimes complete immobility. But
                        in addition the sheaths of muscles and of nerves are apt to be affected by
                        chronic rheumatism, causing much suffering. This form of rheumatism is less
                        migratory in its progress than the acute, and tends to remain fixed in a few
                        joints, often in those which are specially exposed to atmospheric influences
                        or to overwork. The chief symptoms are pain and stiffness in movement, more
                        particularly when the efforts begin to be made, becoming less after the
                        limbs and body have been in exercise. Creaking or crackling noises accompany
                        the movements. The pain is apt to be increased during the night, and is
                        besides markedly influenced by the state</hi> of the atmosphere, cold and
                    damp aggravating it.</p>
                <p>This form of rheumatism, although not directly dangerous to life, tends to lower
                    the health and render the patient more vulnerable to other morbid influences.
                    Besides this, by long continuance it may lead to great deformity and disablement
                    of the frame, in some instances resulting in a condition of utter
                    helplessness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treatment.—</hi> Few diseases have had so many remedies
                    recommended for their alleviation, and vaunted as specifics, as rheumatism; and,
                    when it is remembered how many are the theories of the nature of the malady, it
                    is obvious that even as regards principles the methods proposed must be numerous
                    and diverse. Nevertheless, there are certain well-recognized systems of
                    treatment which in most instances will be found to be of benefit. The treatment
                    differs in the two forms of the disease. As regards acute rheumatism the general
                    management of the case from the outset requires attention. The patient should be
                    placed in bed between blankets, and should wear a flannel shirt, the front and
                    arms of which should be opened to admit of the examination of the heart and of
                    the joints. Movements of all kinds should be as far as possible avoided. The
                    affected joints should be enveloped in cotton wool, kept in position by a light
                    bandage. Sometimes the bathing of these parts with warm water containing opium
                    or other sedative affords relief. The local application of blisters in the
                    neighbourhood of the painful joints, as proposed by Dr Herbert Davies, is in
                    some instances followed with benefit, but is obviously applicable only where the
                    rheumatism is limited in its extent. The same may be said of the local
                    application of electricity to the joints. Constitutional remedies are of
                    undoubted value in this disease, and the number of available agents for this
                    purpose is so large that mention can only be briefly made of some of the more
                    approved. For long the alkalis, especially the salts of potassium, were the
                    chief remedies resorted to, and for them it was claimed that they shortened the
                    attack, relieved pain, and prevented heart complications. They are certainly
                    very valuable in many instances. Of late a new series of substances has been
                    tried with great success, namely salicin (first suggested for acute rheumatism
                    by Dr T. J. Maclagan), salicylic acid, and salicylate of soda. These remedies,
                    which are known to have a powerful effect in reducing febrile temperatures,
                    appear to exercise a special influence in acute rheumatism, not merely by
                    lowering the fever, but by relieving pain and cutting short the attack, thereby
                    lessening the risk of complications. From 20 to 30 grains of these drugs every
                    two hours require to be given for about twenty-four hours in order to produce
                    the desired effect, and the quantity is reduced as the acute symptoms subside.
                    Although they do not succeed in all cases, and sometimes give rise to symptoms
                    (delirium, sickness, &lt;fcc.) which necessitate their suspension, it will be
                    admitted by most physicians that cases which appeared likely to be of a severe
                    character have under this treatment been cut short in a few days, and that even
                    where this result was not attained the pain and other distressing symptoms were
                    materially alleviated. Tonics, such as iron and quinine, have also been employed
                    in acute rheumatism, but their advantage is more apparent in the convalescence,
                    when there are anaemia and debility, rather than in the height of the disease.
                    The pain and sleeplessness may render necessary the administration of opiates,
                    but in many instances both are completely overcome by the remedies previously
                    mentioned. In the dangerous complication of hyperpyrexia the cold bath (in which
                    the water is quickly cooled down from 94° to 68°) has frequently been successful
                    in speedily lowering the temperature and saving life. Persons who have suffered
                    from acute rheumatism should ever afterwards be careful to avoid exposure to <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n535/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0920-0535-0518"/>damp and chill, and to protect the skin by
                    suitable underclothing.</p>
                <p>In chronic rheumatism the remedies are innumerable. This form of the disease is
                    less under the power of medicinal agents than the acute, although much may be
                    done to alleviate the suffering produced by it as well as to limit its
                    extension. Salicin and the salicylates so useful in acute rheumatism are not
                    found as a rule to be of much service, while on the other hand alkalis in
                    combination with sulphur, iodine, arsenic, and tonics, such as iron, quinine,
                    cod-liver oil, ιfec., are the most serviceable remedies. Turpentine is also
                    recommended. Friction of the affected parts with stimulating or soothing
                    liniments, counter-irritation with blisters, iodine, or the button cautery are
                    useful local applications, as is also galvanism. Hot baths or Turkish baths may
                    occasionally be used with advantage. The mineral waters and baths of various
                    well-known resorts are of undoubted benefit, especially those of Buxton, Bath,
                    Strathpeffer, or Harrogate in Great Britain, or those of Aix-les-Bains,
                    Wiesbaden, Homburg, Ems, Wildbad, Aix-la-Chapelle, and many others on the
                    Continent. Changes to warmer climates during the colder season where practicable
                    are also to be recommended, as well as every other measure calculated to improve
                    the general health.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rheumatoid Arthritis.—This term (syn.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >chronic rheumatic arthritis, arthritis deformans)</hi> is employed to
                    designate a chronic inflammatory affection of joints, involving specially the
                    synovial membranes and articular cartilages, of slow development and progressive
                    character, resulting in stiffening and deformity of the parts.</p>
                <p>This disease is held by some to partake of the nature of both rheumatism and gout
                    (hence occasionally termed rheumatic gout); others regard it as simply a variety
                    of chronic rheumatism; while in the opinion of several eminent authorities it is
                    an independent constitutional affection occurring in persons with a strumous or
                    tubercular tendency. It does not appear to be hereditary. It is more common in
                    women than in men, and occurs at all ages. It is closely connected with
                    conditions of ill health; and hence its frequent occurrence among those whose
                    blood is impoverished by insufficient food, by hardship, or by any drain upon
                    the system. It occasionally follows an attack of acute rheumatism; hence the
                    supposed connexion.</p>
                <p>The disease in most cases is slowly developed, and shows itself first by pain and
                    swelling in one joint (knee, wrist, finger, &amp;c.), which soon subside and may
                    remain absent for a considerable time. Sooner or later, however, another attack
                    occurs either in the joint formerly affected or in some other, and it is noticed
                    that the affected articulation does not now regain its normal size but remains
                    somewhat swollen. The attacks recur with increasing frequency, gradually
                    involving more joints, until, in course of time (for its progress is very
                    chronic), scarcely an articulation in the body is free from the disease.
                    Thickening of the textures, with stiffness, is the result, and often
                    considerable deformity from the joints being fixed in certain positions. The
                    muscles of the affected limbs undergo atrophy and contrast strikingly with the
                    abnormally enlarged joints. Painful inflammatory attacks often occur in the
                    affected joints, and the patient is much reduced in strength by the constant
                    irritation of the disease. In the young the hands are very liable to suffer, and
                    the disease gradually extends to involve other parts; while in old persons it is
                    apt to fasten upon one joint, often the hip, and is not so apt to spread. The
                    chief changes in the joints are (1) in the synovial membrane, which is at first
                    simply inflamed and contains fluid, but ultimately becomes much thickened, and
                    (2) in the articular cartilage, which tends to split up and become gradually
                    absorbed, leaving the articular ends of the bone exposed. The osseous surfaces
                    thus brought into contact become hard and polished by friction. These changes
                    and others affecting the ligaments are apt to produce partial dislocation as
                    well as stiffening of the joint, rendering it deformed and useless. This disease
                    often lasts for many years, sometimes continuing for a lengthened period without
                    much change, but tending gradually to progress and to render the patient more
                    and more helpless. It is not attended with the complications of rheumatism, and
                    is not inconsistent with long life, but its weakening effects upon the system
                    and the ill health with which it is usually associated render the subject of it
                    more liable to the inroads of other diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis is less
                    amenable to treatment than rheumatism, the remedies for which are not found to
                    be of much value in this disease. Most success is obtained if it is recognized
                    early and measures are taken to strengthen the patient’s general health. The
                    best medicinal agents are iron, quinine, cod-liver oil, arsenic. Chalybeate
                    mineral waters, such as those of Schwalbach, Spa, Pyrmont, &lt;fcc., are often
                    of service. Locally blisters or milder counter-irritation to the affected
                    joints, as well as the employment of galvanism, may be advantageously resorted
