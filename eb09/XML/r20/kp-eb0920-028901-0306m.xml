                    which is most common in English theological literature, it is the name of that
                    mode of thought generally which finds the final test of religious truth in the
                    human understanding, conscience, or reason, and particularly in the
                    understanding. In its narrower sense, which is almost the only sense it bears in
                    Germany, it denotes a definite school, or rather phase of theological thought,
                    and a phase of thought which has now been outlived. It is with rationalism in
                    this limited sense and as a tendency of German theological thought that this
                    article deals. Rationalism had as its antitheses on the one hand
                    supernaturalism, and on the other naturalism or simple deism. The matter of the
                    contention between the rationalists and these two classes of opponents was
                    supernatural revelation—its necessity, its existence, its possibility. The
                    naturalists denied revelation altogether; the supernaturalists maintained the
                    fact of a supernatural revelation, possessing an authority above “reason,”
                    though capable of being proved by “reason.” The rationalists did not deny the
                    fact of a revelation, though in the end they ignored it and claimed the right to
                    submit every supposed revelation to the judgment of the “reason” or the moral
                    sense. The rationalists themselves are, however, divided by some German writers
                    into two classes—relative and absolute—those who hold that the matter of
                    revelation is identical with the truths of reason, but admit that of necessity,
                    or as a matter of fact, revelation anticipated reason, and those who really call
                    in question the fact of a revelation, without going quite the length of the
                    naturalists in the rejection of Christianity. Kant drew a distinction between
                    the “rationalist” and the “pure rationalist,” defining the former as one who
                    maintains that natural religion alone is essential, and the latter as one who
                    admits the fact of a supernatural revelation but denies that it is a part of
                    religion to know and accept it.</p>
                <p>German rationalism was a specific theological form of the general intellectual
                    movement of the last century known as “illuminism” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aufklärung;</hi> but, while the illu-minati generally ended in rejecting
                    Christianity, the rationalists retained and defended it in a form approved by
                    the logical understanding or the moral sense. While rationalism, as a child of
                    the general intellectual movement of the age in which it appeared, owed much to
                    the philosophy, science, and humanism of the intellectual life of Europe, as a
                    specially theological tendency it was powerfully influenced by English deistical
                    writings. Both Lechler and Ritschl assign to these writings a great immediate
                    effect on the development of German rationalism. Of German thinkers it was
                    especially the philosopher Wolff—who threw into a compact and systematic form,
                    suited for German students, the philosophy of Leibnitz—who initiated German
                    theologians into the rationalistic habit and method, though Wolff himself was a
                    supernaturalist. The condition of the German church and the state of theology
                    also contributed to the creation of rationalism. The hard intellectual orthodoxy
                    of Lutheranism had already done its part towards producing the pietistic
                    movement, and, while pietism helped to free men’s minds from bondage to the
                    Lutheran creeds and once more directed attention to the</p>
                <p>Bible, the cold intellectual habit of orthodoxy nurtured the same habit of
                    rationalism while it failed to satisfy it, and so created a reaction against
                    itself. Thus both orthodoxy and pietism were agents in calling forth
                    rationalism, which was to prove the most dangerous opponent to both. More than
                    one of the foremost rationalists had passed through the school of pietism.</p>
                <p>Regarding rationalism as the opponent of supernaturalism and naturalism, and as
                    an opponent which appealed in the conflict almost exclusively to either the
                    logical understanding or the moral sense as the criterion of religious truth, it
                    may be said to have existed in Germany for nearly a century (c. 1740-1836), and
                    to have flourished about half that length of time ( <hi rend="italic">c</hi> .
                    1760-1810),—that is, it took its rise simultaneously with the publication of
                    Wolff’s writings (1736-50) and the translation into German of the works of the
                    English deists (Tindal’s <hi rend="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation
                    was</hi> translated in 1741), displayed its greatest strength in Sender's
                    critical works (1760-73) and in Kant’s philosophy (178193־), began then to
                    decline gradually under the influence of the works of Herder, Jacobi, Fichte (in
                    his later period), and Hegel, and at last died out when Schleiermacher
                    especially, in the department of theology proper, and Baur and Strauss, amongst
                    others, in the department of Biblical criticism, had given currency to ideas and
                    issues which rendered its main contentions objectless and its criteria of
                    religious truth invalid.</p>
                <p>The English deists, the German illuminati, and the French philosophers had before
                    the middle of the last century, with a vast array of argument, called in
                    question the idea of a supernatural revelation, and had seriously attacked the
                    supernatural origin of the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures. Christian Wolff
                    undertook the defence, and claimed to have demonstrated the supernatural
                    revelation of the Bible. He made the old distinction between natural and
                    revealed religion of fundamental importance, and maintained that <hi
                    rend="italic">demonstrable</hi> truths alone can be regarded as part of natural
                    religion. Revealed religion he drew solely from the Scriptures, and sought to
                    prove by a chain of reasoning and historical evidence their divine origin. Thus
                    in reality the intellect alone was constituted the faculty for ultimately
                    determining the truth of revelation as well as for constructing a natural
                    religion. The general adoption of the distinction between natural and revealed
                    religion, of the appeal to logical and historical evidence and argument for
                    proof of the truths of both, and of the supposition that the truths of natural
                    religion could be demonstrated while those of revealed religion were above, if
                    not contrary to reason, and rested solely on the authority of Scripture,
                    naturally divided theologians into two hostile camps, and proved, contrary to
                    Wolff’s expectations, more favourable to the naturalists and rationalists than
                    to the supernaturalists. If it was admitted by all that the appeal in the
                    contention was to be to the understanding, and the religious nature and higher
                    reason were left out of account, and if, moreover, the truths of natural
                    religion —God, duty, immortality—were supposed by all to be demonstrable,
                    supernatural revelation was certain in that age to be put to great disadvantage.
                    The result of Wolff’s philosophy was a natural theology, a utilitarian system of
                    morals, without any religious fervour or Christian profundity. Wolff’s
                    philosophy thus inaugurated in Germany a theological period corresponding, in
                    its way, with the period in England between 1688 and 1750, when “Christianity
                    appeared to be made for nothing but to be ‘proved,’” and the only test to be
                    applied was “reason,” which was simply the philosophy in vogue. In both cases
                    religion was regarded as substantially a set of doctrines, revelation as the
                    publication of them, and God as teaching them after the most anthropomorphic
                    manner. Ho profound concep<pb break="no"

                    revelation, and none at all of their relation to each other, while the idea of
                    God was simply that of the deists.</p>
                <p>It was in the application of its principles and method (thus brought into vogue)
                    to Biblical studies that rationalism won its greatest triumphs, and really
                    accomplished its greatest measure of good work. Johann Salomo Semler
                    (1725-1791), the father of modern Biblical criticism, as the Germans call him,
                    was the greatest representative of the school in this department. A pietist by
                    education, with something of Gottfried Arnold’s liking for heretics and all his
                    dislike of ecclesiasticism, but with none of Arnold’s mysticism, a man of
                    immense learning, without any clear and systematic management of it, he was the
                    first German to apply the strict principles of historical criticism, in
                    conjunction with the rationalistic truths and errors of his day, to the study of
                    the Scriptures and ecclesiastical history, particularly the history of
                    doctrines. He assailed with all the wealth of his learning the traditional view
                    of the limits and authority of the Biblical canon especially, and having, as he
                    held, demonstrated its human origin and fallibility, he proceeded to deal freely
                    with the books composing it, as sharing the failings common to everything human.
                    He found the Scriptures pervaded with “local ideas,” and his Christianity was
                    really limited to the “natural religion” of the deists and the moral truths
                    taught by Christ. As a man who had been under a pietistic training, he was, it
                    is true, unwilling to refer to the understanding alone for evidence of the
                    truths of Christianity, but his enlargement of the test is confined to the
                    admission of an appeal to the measure of virtue and happiness produced. By this
                    extended test he tries the matter of the Scriptures, assigning to his category
                    of local ideas “whatever is not adapted to make men wise unto their true
                    advantage.” The supernatural origin of the Scriptures as writings and most of
                    the miracles recorded in them he rejected; but, on the other hand, he was a
                    vigorous opponent of the adversaries of Christianity and of the naturalists who
                    denied revelation altogether,—Reim-arus, for instance, the author of the
                    Wolfenbüttel <hi rend="italic">Fragmente.</hi> Other decided rationalists
                    contemporaneous with Semler were Teller (1734-1804), Eberhard (1739-1809), and
                    Steinbart (1738-1809), who all agreed in confounding religion with morality, and
                    in reducing Christianity to a popularization of utilitarian morals.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the profounder spirits of the nation—Lessing, Herder, Hamann, and
                    others—were conceiving truer ideas of the nature of religion, of the human
                    conditions of revelation, and of the character of the Bible and the mission of
                    Christianity. It was, however, Kant who produced the greatest immediate effect
                    on the history of rationalism. Himself a rationalist, regarding religion only as
                    a form of morality, and revelation as at most a possible aid to the earlier
                    propagation of moral principles, he nevertheless started doubts and ideas which
                    sealed the doom of rationalism in its first shallow form. There was an end of
                    the <hi rend="italic">demonstrable</hi> natural religion of Wolff when once
                    Kant’s criticism of the proofs of the existence of God and of the immortality of
                    the soul met with even partial acceptance. The breath of lofty mysticism which
                    inspired his grand ethical system was also fatal to the cold shallow reasoning
                    and commonplace utilitarianism of previous rationalists. Yet, though Kant
                    proclaimed principles which compelled rationalism to assume other positions, and
                    which really contained within them the seeds of its destruction, he remained
                    himself a rationalist, for the reason especially that he never advanced to a
                    profound conception of the nature of either religion or revelation and the
                    conditions and relations of both. His fruitful idea of the relation of
                    revelation to a community rather than to an individual he was unable to apply
                    properly to the revelation contained in the Bible. Though his morality was
                    something infinitely beyond 18th-century utilitarianism, it still constituted
                    for him religion, and the only test he applied to a professed revelation was
                    that it must contain the purest moral teaching. Fichte, accepting Kant’s ethical
                    principles, taught that a revelation—that is, proclamation of God as the moral
                    lawgiver of the world—might be a necessity in the case of a degeneration of
                    mankind to such an extent that the idea of goodness should be lost. On the other
                    hand, Fries and Jacobi took up the position of Kant regarding the limitations of
                    human <hi rend="italic">knoivledge</hi> of religious truth, and still further
                    prepared for the advance beyond rationalism by claiming for man a special
                    religious faculty, under the names of <hi rend="italic">faith, feeling,</hi> or
                    a <hi rend="italic">sense of the infinite.</hi> Fichte, in his later period,
                    made an advance in the same direction, abandoning the abstract ethical position
                    of Kant by an appeal to love as the supreme principle in God and man. He thus
                    reached a position more suited for the apprehension of the nature of religion,
                    and he recognized in the workings of genius—with its incomprehensible light and
                    movements—manifestations analogous to the phenomena of revelation. Meantime, the
                    rationalists amongst theologians continued their work of reducing the Bible,
                    with its history, miracles, and doctrines, by one means or another, into harmony
                    with their notions of a rational and useful moral revelation, though for the
                    most part they did not acknowledge the claims of the Old Testament to be
                    considered a revelation at all, or at most a revelation for the childhood of the
                    race. The accounts of miracles in the Bible were either denied or explained away
                    as natural occurrences, or as poetical and Oriental phraseology, while the
                    doctrines of the Bible and the creeds were diluted into religious or moral
                    commonplaces. As representative Biblical scholars of this class J. G. Eichhorn
                    (1752-1827) and H. E. G. Paulus may be mentioned, as representative theologians
                    Henke (1752-1809), Wegscheider (1771-1849), and Rohr (1752-1848).</p>
                <p>But early in the new century the triumph of a profounder philosophy of religion
                    and of a worthier treatment of religious systems and the records of revelation
                    began rapidly to make itself felt. Schleiermacher once more carried religion
                    from the confined and frigid regions of the understanding and the distant
                    heights of abstract morals into the vaster and yet nearer, warmer and yet
                    clearer, world of feeling. Following Herder, he annihilated the rationalistic
                    distinction between natural and revealed religion by claiming revelation for all
                    religion and religions, and he mediated in the fruitless contention of
                    rationalism <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> supernaturalism by vindicating a
                    supernatural element for the religious life and Christianity, while at the same
                    time he justified rationalism in its rejection of any infraction of the laws of
                    nature. He put an end to the conception of revelation as the communication of
                    doctrine by substituting for it the, at all events, profounder and truer view
                    that it consists in a fundamental affection of the whole religious nature,
                    giving it a new and special direction, the organs of it being historical
                    personalities endowed with supreme religious genius. Hegel and Schelling
                    contributed in other ways, particularly by substituting another idea of God and
                    nature, to the decay of rationalism. Amongst Biblical critics De Wette, under
                    the influence of Herder’s poetic insight into early literatures and of Fries’s
                    religious philosophy, contributed largely to a truer appreciation of the Bible
                    as literature and the record of revelation than such scholars as Eichhorn and
                    Paulus had attained to. In the year 1828 Dr Pusey could inform English
                    theologians that the school had had its day, and early in the third decade of
                    the century Hase was able to sum up the work of the school, which was then
                    practically defunct,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n308/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0308-0291"/>
                <p>though some of its ablest representatives continued for some years to defend its
                    positions. Hase’s summary is, that rationalism failed to recognize the
                    historical forces that condition all religious life and progress; that it
                    necessarily issued in a barren religion of the intellect; that in the last
                    instance it drew its decisions, not from the depths of the soul, but from a
                    shallow popular philosophy which overlooked the rights of religious feeling;
                    that on that account it kept its God of the outward universe as far removed from
                    men’s hearts and lives as possible; but that, nevertheless, it was through it
                    especially that a breach between modern culture and the church was avoided and
                    the banner of free inquiry was kept waving. Even men as far removed from
                    rationalism as Tholuck, Dorner, Ritschl, and Alexander Schweizer acknowledge
                    that it was a means, however imperfect, of effectually upholding in the church
                    the great principle that religious truth has an intimate affinity to man’s
