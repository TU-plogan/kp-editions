                    musical theorist and composer, was born at Dijon, 25th September 1683. His
                    musical education, partly in consequence of his father’s desire to prepare him
                    for the magistracy, still more through his own wayward disposition, was of a
                    very desultory character; but his talent manifested itself at a very early age.
                    In 1701 his father sent him to Milan to break off a foolish love-match. But he
                    learned little in Italy, and soon returned, in company with a wandering
                    theatrical manager, for whom he played the second violin. He next settled in
                    Paris, where he published his <hi rend="italic">Premier Livre de Pièces de
                    Clavecin,</hi> in 1706. In 1717 he made an attempt to obtain the appointment of
                    organist at the church of St Paul. Deeply annoyed at his unexpected failure, he
                    retired for a time to Lille, whence, however, he soon removed to
                    Clermont-Ferrand, where he succeeded his brother as organist at the cathedral,
                    and here it was that his true art-life began.</p>
                <p>Burning with desire to remedy the imperfection of his early education, Rameau now
                    diligently studied the writings of Zarlino, Descartes, Mersenne, F. Kircher, and
                    certain other well-known authors. He not only mastered their several theories
                    but succeeded in demonstrating their weak points and substituting for them a
                    system of his own, which, notwithstanding its manifest imperfection, was based
                    upon firm natural principles, and ultimately led to discoveries of the utmost
                    possible value to musical science. His keen insight into the constitution of
                    certain chords, which in early life he had studied only by ear, enabled him to
                    propound a series of hypotheses, many of which are now accepted as established
                    facts; and, if, in his desire to carry out his system to a logical conclusion,
                    he was sometimes tempted into palpable and dangerous error, it was only in
                    obedience to the law which invariably renders the inventor of a new theory blind
                    to the stubborn facts which militate against its universal application. His
                    theory was based upon an instinctive anticipation of the discoveries of modern
                    science. While the older contrapuntists were perfectly satisfied with the laws
                    which regulated the melodious involutions of their vocal and instrumental parts,
                    Rameau demonstrated the possibility of building up a natural harmony upon a
                    fundamental bass, and of using that harmony as an authority for the enactment of
                    whatever laws might be considered necessary for the guidance either of the
                    contrapuntist or the less ambitious general composer. And in this he first
                    explained the distinction between two styles, which, in deference to the views
                    expressed by a popular critic of the present day, have been called the
                    “horizontal and vertical systems,” the “horizontal system” being that by which
                    the older contrapuntists regulated the onward motion of their several parts, and
                    the “vertical system” that which constructs an entire passage out of a single
                    harmony. From fundamental harmonies he passed to inverted chords, to which he
                    was the first to call attention; and the value of this discovery fully
                    compensates for his erroneous theory concerning the chords of the eleventh and
                    the great <hi rend="italic">(Angl.</hi> “added”) sixth. <note anchored="true"

                    voi. xvii. p. 92. </p></note></p>
                <p>Rameau first set forth his new theory in his <hi rend="italic">Traité de
                    VHarmonie</hi> (Paris, 1722), and followed it up in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nouveau Système</hi> (1726), <hi rend="italic">Génération Harmonique</hi>
                    (1737), <hi rend="italic">Démonstration</hi> (1750), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nouvelles Réflexions</hi> (1752). But it was not only as a theorist that he
                    became famous. Returning to Paris in 1722, he first attracted attention by
                    composing some light dramatic pieces, and then showed his real powers in his
                    first great opera, <hi rend="italic">Hijypolyte et Aricie,</hi> founded on
                    Racine’s <hi rend="italic">Phèdre,</hi> and produced at the Académie in 1733.
                    Though this work was violently opposed by the admirers of Lully, whose party
                    spirit eventually stirred up the famous “guerre des bouffons,” Rameau’s genius
                    was too brilliant to be trampled under foot by an ephemeral faction, and his
                    ultimate triumph was assured. He afterwards produced more than twenty operas,
                    the most successful of which were <hi rend="italic">Dardanus, Castor et Pollux,
                    Les Indes Galantes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Princesse de Navarre.</hi>
                    Honours were now showered upon him. He was appointed conductor at the Opéra
                    Comique, and the directors of the opera granted him a pension. King Louis XV.
                    appointed him composer to the court in 1745, and in 1764 honoured him with a
                    patent of nobility and the order of Saint Michael. But these last privileges
                    were granted only on the eve of his death, which took place in Paris on 12th
                    September 1764.</p>
