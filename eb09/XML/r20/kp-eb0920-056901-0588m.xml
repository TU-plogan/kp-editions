                    thoroughly carried out. His chief teacher, Spitzner, a pupil of Gottfried
                    Hermann, divined the boy’s genius and allowed it free growth, applying only so
                    much either of stimulus or of restraint as was absolutely needful. After a
                    wasted year at the university of Leipsic, where Hermann stood at the zenith of
                    his fame, Ritschl passed in 1826 to Halle. Here he came under the powerful
                    influence of Reisig, a young “Hermannianer” with exceptional talent, a
                    fascinating personality, and a rare gift for instilling into his pupils his own
                    ardour for classical study. The great controversy between the “Realists” and the
                    “Verbalists” was then at its height, and Ritschl naturally sided with Hermann
                    against Boeckh. The early death of Reisig in 1828 did not sever Ritschl from
                    Halle, where he brilliantly attained the doctorate, and in 1829 became
                    privat-docent, in 1832 an extraordinary professor. He began his professorial
                    career with a great reputation and brilliant success, but soon hearers fell
                    away, and the pinch of poverty compelled his removal to Breslau, where he
                    reached the rank of “ordinary” professor in 1834, and held other offices. The
                    great event of RitschΓs life was a sojourn of nearly a year in Italy (1836-37),
                    spent in libraries and museums, and more particularly in the laborious
                    examination of the Ambrosian palimpsest of Plautus at Milan. From this journey
                    Ritschl’s whole temperament and intellect received a new and richer colouring,
                    and the remainder of his life was largely occupied in working out the material
                    then gathered and the ideas then conceived. Bonn, whither he removed on his
                    marriage in 1839, and where he remained for twenty-six years, was the great
                    scene of his activity both as scholar and as teacher. The philological seminary
                    which he controlled, although nominally only joint director with Weicker, became
                    a veritable <hi rend="italic">officina litterαrum,</hi> a kind of Isocratean
                    school of classical study; in it were trained many of the foremost scholars of
                    the last forty years. The names of Georg Curtius, Ihne, Schleicher, Bernays,
                    Ribbeck, Lorenz, Vahlen, Hübner, Bücheier, Hel-big, Benndorf, Riese, Windisch,
                    Brugmann, who were his pupils either at Bonn or at Leipsic, attest his fame and
                    power as a teacher. In 1854 Otto Jahn took the place of the venerable Weicker at
                    Bonn, and after a time succeeded in dividing with Ritschl the empire over the
                    philological school there. The two had been friends, but after gradual
                    estrangement a violent dispute arose between them in 1865, which for many months
                    divided into two hostile forces the universities and the press of Germany. Both
                    sides were steeped in fault, but Ritschl undoubtedly received harsh treatment
                    from the Prussian Government, and pressed his resignation. He renounced not only
                    Bonn but Prussia, though strongly attached to his country, which he had often
                    refused to leave when plied with advantageous offers. He accepted a call to
                    Leipsic, where he died in harness in 1876.</p>
                <p>Ritschl’s character was strongly marked. The spirited element in him was
                    powerful, and to some at times he seemed overbearing, but his nature was noble
                    at the core; and, though intolerant of inefficiency and stupidity, he never
                    asserted his personal claims in any mean or petty way. He was warmly attached to
                    family and friends, and yearned continually after sympathy, yet he established
                    real intimacy with only a few. Both at Breslau and at Bonn he complained of
                    isolation, which (though he was himself unconscious of the fact) was in part the
                    natural fruit of his own superiority. The interests of his pupils were at all
                    times dear, perhaps even too dear, in his eyes. He was far from being a dreamy
                    scholar; his talent for practical affairs would have secured him eminence in
                    almost any walk of life, and he was credited with diplomatic finesse. That
                    Ritschl had a great faculty for organization is shown by his administration of
                    the university library at Bonn, and by the eight years of labour which carried
                    to success a work of infinite complexity, the famous <hi rend="italic">Priscae
                    Latinitatis Monunιenta Epigraphica</hi> (Bonn, 1862). This volume presents in
                    admirable facsimile, with prefatory notices and indexes, the Latin inscriptions
                    from the earliest times to the end of the republic. It forms an introductory
                    volume to the Berlin <hi rend="italic">Corpus Iηscriptioηum Latiηamm,</hi> the
                    excellence of which is largely due to the precept and example of Ritschl, though
                    he had no hand in the later volumes.</p>
                <p>In all that he did Ritschl exhibited rare genius combined with a precision
                    unsurpassed. But to bring out to the full his great powers the zest of discovery
                    was indispensable. When he was on the track of a new idea, he worked with a
                    fiery energy which triumphed over his almost life-long physical weakness, and
                    left him no peace till every difficulty was cleared away. But the toil of
                    carrying his discoveries to their consequences lie was only too apt to leave to
                    feebler hands than his own. He was fertile in great projects, and struck out the
                    main ideas which should guide them, but one only did he pursue to absolute
                    completion, the <hi rend="italic">Priscae Latinitatis Μonumenta,—</hi> precisely
                    because, from the nature of this work, he was buoyed up from first to last by
                    the occurrence or the expectation of novelty. The results of RitschΓs life are
                    mainly gathered up in a long series of monographs, for the most part of the
                    highest finish, and rich in ideas which have leavened the scholarship of the
                    time.</p>
                <p>As a scholar, Ritschl was of the lineage of Bentley, to whom he looked up, like
                    Hermann, with fervent admiration. His best efforts were spent in studying the
                    languages and literatures of Greece and Rome, rather than the life of the Greeks
                    and Romans. He was sometimes, but most unjustly, charged with taking a narrow
                    view of ‘ ‘ Philologie.” That he keenly appreciated the importance of ancient
                    institutions and ancient art both his published papers and the records of his
                    lectures amply testify. He had in reality no prejudice against any department of
                    learning. He was ever anxious to discern precisely the work for which each pupil
                    was fitted, and he despatched many explorers into fields where he could not
                    labour himself. Ritschl for the most part devoted himself to the study of
                    ancient poetry, and in particular of the early Latin drama. This formed the
                    centre from which his investigations radiated. Starting from this he ranged over
                    the whole remains of pre-Ciceronian Latin, and not only analysed but augmented
                    the sources from which our knowledge of it must come. Before Ritschl the
                    acquaintance of scholars with early Latin was so dim and restricted that it
                    would perhaps be hardly an exaggeration to call him its real discoverer.</p>
                <p>To the world in general Ritschl was best known as a student of Plautus. When he
                    began his studies, the text of that author was like some ancient picture,
                    defaced alike by time and by much repainting. He cleared away the accretions of
                    ages, and by efforts of that real genius which goes hand in hand with labour,
                    brought to light many of the true features of the original. It is infinitely to
                    be regretted that Ritschl’s results were never combined to form that monumental
                    edition of Plautus of which he dreamed in his earlier life. For one such palace
                    from the master builder’s hand we could well have sacrificed some of the
                    abundant material which he left for punier architects to handle. RitschΓs
                    examination of the Plautine MSS. was both laborious and brilliant, and greatly
                    extended the knowledge of Plautus and of the ancient Latin drama. Of this two
                    striking examples may be cited. By the aid of the Ambrosian palimpsest he
                    recovered the name T. Maccius Plautus, for the vulgate M. Accius, and proved it
                    correct by strong extraneous arguments. On the margin of the Palatine MSS. the
                    marks C and DV continually recur, and had been variously explained. Ritschl
                    proved that they meant “Canticum” and “Diverbium,” and hence showed that in the
                    Roman comedy only the conversations in iambic senarii were not intended for the
                    singing voice. Thus was brought into strong relief a fact without which there
                    can be no true appreciation of Plautus, viz., that his plays were comic operas
                    rather than comic dramas.</p>
                <p>In conjectural criticism Ritschl was inferior not only to his great predecessors
                    but to some of his contemporaries. His emendations do not often present that
                    perfect wedding of art and fortune which we see in the best work of Madvig or
                    Cobet. His imagination was in this field (but in this field only) hampered by
                    erudition, and his judgment was unconsciously warped by the desire to find in
                    his text illustrations of his discoveries. His remedies were often needlessly
                    violent. But still a fair proportion of his textual labours has stood the test
                    of time, and he forged the weapons which are destined to conquer for us the true
                    text of Plautus, so far as an envious fate permits. Ritschl rendered immense
                    service by his study of Plautine metres, a field in which little advance had
                    been made since the time of Bentley. In this matter Ritschl was aided by an
                    accomplishment rare (as he himself lamented) in Germany—the art of writing Latin
                    verse.</p>
                <p>In spite of the incompleteness, on many sides, of his work,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n589/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0589-0570"/>
                <p>Ritschl must be assigned a place in the history of learning among a very select
                    few. His studies are presented principally in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opuseula</hi> collected partly before and partly since his death. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Trinummus</hi> (twice edited) was the only specimen of his
                    contemplated edition of Plautus which he completed. The edition has been
                    continued by some of his pupils—Goetz, Loewe, and others— and is still (1885) in
                    progress.</p>
                <p>The facts of Ritschl’s life may be best learned from the elaborate biography by
                    Otto Ribbeck (Leipsic, 1879). An interesting and discriminating estimate of
                    Eitschl’s work is that by Lucian Mueller (Berlin, 1877). (J. S. R.)</p>
