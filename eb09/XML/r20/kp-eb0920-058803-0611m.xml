                    account of Luca’s early life is little to be trusted, he was apprenticed to the
                    silversmith Leonardo di Ser Giovanni, who from 1355 to 1371 was working on the
                    grand silver altar frontal for the cathedral at Pistoia <hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.)</hi>; this, however, appears doubtful from the great age which it would
                    give to Leonardo, and it is more probable that Luca was a pupil of Ghiberti.
                    During the early part of his life Luca executed many important and exceedingly
                    beautiful pieces of sculpture in marble and bronze. In technical skill he was
                    quite the equal of Ghiberti, and, while possessing all Donatello’s vigour,
                    dramatic power, and originality, he very frequently excelled him in grace of
                    attitude and soft beauty of expression. No sculptured work of the great 15th
                    century ever surpassed the singing gallery which Luca made for the cathedral at
                    Florence between 1431 and 1440, with its ten magnificent panels of singing
                    angels and dancing boys, far exceeding in beauty those which Donatello in 1433
                    sculptured for the opposite gallery in the same choir. This magnificent work now
                    lies scattered in various parts of the <pb break="no"

                    be seen at the South Kensington Museum, where a complete cast is fixed to the
                    wall. The same museum possesses a study in <hi rend="italic">gesso duro</hi> for
                    one of the panels, which appears to be the original sketch by Luca’s own
                    hand.</p>
                <p>In May 1437 Luca received a commission from the signoria of Florence to execute
                    five reliefs for the north side of the campanile, to complete the series begun
                    by Giotto and Andrea Pisano. These panels are so much in the earlier style of
                    Giotto that we must conclude that he had left drawings from which Luca worked.
                    They have representative figures chosen to typify grammar, logic, philosophy,
                    music, and geometry,—the last represented by Euclid and Ptolemy. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vasari is not quite right in
                    his account of these reliefs: he speaks of Euclid and Ptolemy as being in
                    different panels. </p></note> In 1438 Luca received an order for two marble
                    altars for chapels in the cathedral, a third being ordered from Donatello. The
                    reliefs from one of Luca’s—St Peter’s Deliverance from Prison and his
                    Crucifixion—are now in the Bargello. It is probable that these altars were never
                    finished. A tabernacle for the host, made by Luca in 1442, is now at Peretola in
                    the church of S. Maria. A document in the archives of S. Maria Nuova at Florence
                    shows that he received for this 700 florins 1 lira 16 soldi (about £1400 of
                    modern money). In 1437 Donatello received a commission to cast a bronze door for
                    one of the sacristies of the cathedral; but, as he delayed to execute this
                    order, the work was handed over to Luca on 28th February 1446, with Michelozzo
                    and Maso di Bartolomeo as his assistants. Part of this wonderful door was cast
                    in 1448, and the last two panels were finished by Luca in 1467, with bronze
                    which was supplied to him by Verrocchio. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Cavallucci, S. Maria del Fiore, pt. ii. p. 137.
                    </p></note> The door is divided into ten square panels, with small heads in the
                    style of Ghiberti projecting from the framing. The two top subjects are the
                    Madonna and Child and the Baptist, next come the four Evangelists, and below are
                    the four Latin Doctors, each subject with attendant angels. The whole is
                    modelled with the most perfect grace and dignified simplicity; the heads
                    throughout are full of life, and the treatment of the drapery in broad simple
                    folds is worthy of a Greek sculptor of the best period of Hellenic art. These
                    exquisite reliefs are perfect models of plastic art, and are quite free from the
                    over-elaboration and too pictorial style of Ghiberti. Fig. 1 shows one of the
                    panels. A terra-cotta relief at Berlin and another in the South Kensington
                    Museum are probably original studies by Luca for two of the panels of the
                    doctors.</p>

                    originally placed in the church of S. Pancrazio at Florence, but now in S.
                    Francesco di Paola on the Bello Sguardo road outside the city. A very beautiful
                    effigy of the bishop in a restful pose lies on a sarcophagus sculptured with
                    graceful reliefs of angels holding a wreath, which contains the inscription.
                    Above are three-quarter-length figures of Christ between St John and the Virgin,
                    delicately carved in low relief. The whole is surrounded by a rectangular frame
                    formed of painted majolica tiles of the most exquisite beauty, far surpassing
                    any other existing work of the same sort. On each tile is painted, with enamel
                    pigments, a bunch of flowers and fruit in brilliant realistic colours, the
                    loveliness of which is very hard to describe The perfect mean between truth to
                    nature and decorative treatment has never been more thoroughly obtained than in
                    these wonderful tile pictures, each of which is worthy of the most careful
                    study; and they are also of special interest as being among the earliest
                    examples of Italian majolica. Though the bunch of flowers on each is painted on
                    one slab, the ground of each tile is formed of separate pieces, fitted together
                    like a kind of mosaic, probably because the pigment of the ground required a
                    different degree of heat in firing from that needed for the enamel painting of
                    the centre. The few other works of this class which exist do not approach the
                    beauty of this early essay in majolica painting, on which Luca evidently put
                    forth his utmost skill and patience.</p>
                <p>In the latter part of his life Luca was mainly occupied with the production of
                    terra-cotta reliefs covered with enamel,—a process which he improved upon, but
                    did not invent, as Vasari asserts. The secret of this process was to cover the
                    clay relief with an enamel formed of the ordinary ingredients of glass <hi
                    rend="italic">(gnarzacottd)</hi> made an opaque white by oxide of tin,—a method
                    practised with great success in the 13th century in Persia <note anchored="true"

                    Artium Schedula (llth century), and by Pietro del Bono in his Margarita preeiosa
                    (1330). An example earlier than any of Luca’s exists at Florence over the door
                    of S. Egidio (in S. Maria Nuova). It is a relief of the Coronation of the Virgin
                    executed by Lorenzo de’ Bicci in 1424; see Milanesi, Archwio Stomco Itαliano,
                    1860, pp. 182-183. Contemporary writers call this enamelled clay “terra
                    invetriata.” </p></note> (see Pottery, vol. xix. pp. 620, 628). Though Luca was
                    not the inventor of the process, yet his genius so improved and extended its
                    application that it is not unnaturally known now as Della Robbia ware; it must,
                    however, be remembered that by far the majority of these reliefs which in Italy
                    and elsewhere are ascribed to Luca are really the work of some of the younger
                    members of the family. Comparatively few exist which can with certainty be
                    ascribed to Luca himself. Among the earliest of these are medallions of the four
                    Evangelists in the vault of Brunelleschi’s Pazzi chapel in S. Croce. These fine
                    reliefs are coloured with various metallic oxides in different shades of blue,
                    green, purple, yellow, and black. It has often been asserted that the very
                    polychromatic reliefs belong to Andrea or his sons, and that Luca’s were all in
                    pure white; this, however, is not the case: colours .were used more freely by
                    Luca than by his successors. A relief in the South Kensington Museum furnishes a
                    striking example and is of especial value from its great size, and also because
                    its date is known. This is an enormous medallion containing the arms of René of

                    fruit and flowers, especially apples, lemons, oranges, and fir cones, all of
                    which are brilliantly coloured. This medallion was set up on the façade of the
                    Pazzi Palace to commemorate Rene’s visit to Florence in 1442. Another early
                    relief by Luca, also highly polychromatic, is that of the Ascension in the
                    tympanum of one of the sacristy doors in the cathedral, executed between 1446
                    and 1450, as is recorded in a document published by Rumohr <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Italien. Forsch.,</hi> ii. pp. 364-365). Other existing works of Luca in
                    Florence are the tympanum reliefs of the Madonna between two Angels in the Via
                    dell' Agnolo, a work of exquisite beauty, and another over the door of S.
                    Pierino del Mercato Vecchio. The only existing statues by Luca are two lovely
                    enamelled figures of Kneeling Angels holding candlesticks, now in the canons’

                    made the four coloured medallions of the Virtues set in the vault over the tomb
                    of the young cardinal-prince of Portugal in a side chapel of S. Miniato in
                    Florence (see Rossellino). By Luca also are reliefs of the Madonna and various
                    medallions outside Or San Michele. One of his chief decorative works which no
                    longer exists was a small library or study for Piero de’ Medici, wholly lined
                    with painted majolica plaques and reliefs. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Luca, but have no resemblance to any known works of his. Their <hi rend="italic"
                    >provenance</hi> is unknown.</p>
                <p>In 1471 Luca was elected president of the Florentine artists’ guild, but he
                    refused this great honour on account of his age and infirmity. It shows,
                    however, the very high estimation in which he was held by his contemporaries. He
                    died on 20th February 1482, leaving his property to his nephews Andrea and
                    Simone. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>His will, dated
                    19th February 1471, is published by Gaye, Cart. Ined., i. p. 185. </p></note>
                    His chief pupil was his nephew Andrea, and probably also Agostino di Duccio, who
                    executed many pieces of sculpture at Rimini, and the graceful but mannered
                    marble reliefs of angels on the façade of S. Bernardino at Perugia. <note

                    was not related to him at all.</p>
                <p>II. Andrea della Robbia (1435-1525), the nephew and pupil of Luca, carried on the
                    production of the enamelled reliefs on a much larger scale than his uncle had
                    ever done; he also extended its application to various architectural uses, such
                    as friezes and to the making of lavabos (lavatories), fountains, and large
                    retables. The result of this was that, though the finest reliefs from the
                    workshop of Andrea were but little if at all inferior to those from the hand of
                    Luca, yet some of them, turned out by pupils and assistants, reached only a
                    lower standard of merit. Only one work in marble by Andrea is known, namely, an
                    altar in S. Maria delle Grazie near Arezzo, mentioned by Vasari (ed. Milanesi,
                    ii. p. 179), and still well preserved.</p>
                <p>One variety of method was introduced by Andrea in his enamelled work; sometimes
                    he omitted the enamel on the face and hands (nude parts) of his figures,
                    especially in those cases where he had treated the heads in a realistic manner;
                    as, for example, in the noble tympanum relief of the meeting of St Domenic and
                    St Francis in the loggia of the Florentine hospital of S. Paolo,—a design
                    suggested by a fresco of Fra Angelico’s in the cloister of St Mark’s. One of the
                    most remarkable works by Andrea is the series of medallions with reliefs of
                    Infants in white on a blue ground set on the front of the foundling hospital at
                    Florence. These lovely child-figures are modelled with wonderful skill and
                    variety, no two being alike. Andrea produced, for guilds and private persons, a
                    large number of reliefs of the Madonna and Child varied with much invention, and
                    all of extreme beauty of pose and sweetness of expression. These are frequently
                    framed with realistic and yet very “decorative garlands of fruit and flowers,
                    all painted with enamel colours, while the main relief is left white. Fig. 2
                    shows a good example of these smaller works. The hospital of S. Paolo, near S.
                    Maria Novella, has also a number of fine medallions with reliefs of saints, two
                    of Christ Healing the Sick, and two fine portraits, under which are white
                    plaques inscribed—“dall’ ano 1451 all’ ano 1495”; the first of these dates is
                    the year when the hospital was rebuilt owing to a papal brief sent to the
                    archbishop of Florence. Arezzo possesses a number of fine enamelled works by
                    Andrea and his sons —a retable in the cathedral with God holding the Crucified
                    Christ, surrounded by angels, and below, kneeling figures of S. Donato and S.
                    Bernardino; also in the cathedral is a fine relief of the Madonna and Child with
                    four saints at the sides. In S. Maria in Grado is a very noble retable with
                    angels holding a crown over a standing figure of the Madonna; a number of small
                    figures of worshippers take refuge in the folds of the Virgin’s mantle, a
                    favourite motive for sculpture dedicated by guilds or other corporate <pb

                    this class is at La Verna, not far from Arezzo (see Vasari, ed. Milanesi, ii. p.
                    179). The best of these, three large retables with representations of the
                    Annunciation, the Crucifixion, and the Madonna giving her Girdle to St Thomas,
                    are probably the work of Andrea himself, the others being by his sons. In 1489
                    Andrea made a beautiful relief of the Virgin and two Angels, now over the
                    archive room door in the Florentine Opera del Duomo; for this he was paid twenty
                    gold florins (see Cavallucci, 0 ’ . <hi rend="italic">Mana del Fiore).</hi> In
                    the same year he modelled the fine tympanum relief over a door of Prato
                    cathedral, with a half-length figure of the Madonna between St Stephen and St
                    Lawrence, surrounded by a frame of angels’ heads.</p>
                <p>In 1491 Andrea was still working at Prato, where many of his best reliefs still
                    exist. One of his finest works is a large retable at Volterra in the church of
                    S. Girolamo, dated 1501; it represents the Last Judgment, and is remarkable for

                    a nude kneeling figure of a youth who has just risen from his tomb. Other late
                    works of known date are a Resurrection of Christ, made in 1501 for S. Frediano
                    at Florence (the lower half of this only exists, in the court of the Casa
                    Mozzi), and a medallion of the Virgin in Glory, surrounded by angels, made in
                    1505 for Pistoia cathedral. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>III., IV. Five of Andrea’s seven sons worked with their father, and after his
                    death carried on the Robbia fabrique; the dates of their birth are shown in the
                    table on p. 588 above. Early in life two of them came under the influence of
                    Savonarola, and took monastic orders at his Dominican convent; these were Marco,
                    who adopted the name of Fra Luca, and Paolo, called Fra Ambrogio. One relief by
                    the latter, a Nativity with four life-sized figures of rather poor work, is in
                    the Cappella degli Spagnuoli in the Sienese convent of S. Spirito; a MS. in the
                    convent archives records that it was made in 1504.</p>
                <p>V. The chief existing work known to be by the second son Luca is the very rich
                    and beautiful tile pavement in the uppermost story of Raphael’s loggie at the
                    Vatican, finely designed and painted in harmonious majolica colours. This was
                    made by Luca at Raphael’s request and under his supervision in 1518. <note

                <p>VI. Giovanni della Robbia (1469-1529?) during a great part of his life worked as
                    assistant to his father, Andrea, and in many cases the enamelled sculpture of
                    the two cannot be distinguished. Some of Giovanni’s independent works are of
                    great merit, especially the earlier ones; during the latter part of his life his
                    reliefs deteriorated in style, owing mainly to the universal decadence of the
                    time. A very large number of pieces of Robbia ware which are attributed to
                    Andrea, and even to the elder Luca, were really by the hand of Giovanni. One of
                    his finest works, quite equal in beauty to anything of his father’s, from whom
                    the design of the figures was probably taken, is the washing-fountain in the
                    sacristy of S. Maria Novella at Florence, made in 1497. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See a document printed by Milanesi in his
                    Vasari, ii. p. 193. </p></note> It is a large arched recess with a view of the
                    seashore, not very decorative in style, painted on majolica tiles at the back.
                    There are also two very beautiful painted majolica panels of fruit-trees let
                    into the lower part. In the tympanum of the arch is a very lovely white relief
                    of the Madonna between two Adoring Angels (see fig. 3). Long coloured garlands
                    of fruit and flowers are held by nude boys reclining on the top of the arch. All
                    this part is of enamelled clay, but the basin of the fountain is of white
                    marble. Neither Luca nor Andrea was in the habit of signing his work, but
                    Giovanni often did so, usually adding the date, probably because other potters
                    had begun to imitate the Robbia ware. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Examples of these imitations are a retable in S. Lucchese
                    near Poggibonsi dated 1514, another of the Madonna and Saints at Monte San
                    Savino of 1525, and a third in the Capuchin church of Arceria near Sinigaglia;
                    they are all inferior to the best works of the Robbia family. </p></note></p>
                <p>Giovanni lacked the original talent of Luca and Andrea, and so lie not only
                    copied their work but even reproduced in clay the marble sculpture of
                    Pollaiuolo, Da Settignano, Verrocchio, and others. A relief by him, evidently
                    taken from Mino da Fiesole, exists in the Palazzo Castracane Staccoli. Among the
                    very numerous other works of Giovanni are the large retable in the Castellani
                    chapel of S. Croce, a relief in the wall of a convent in the Via Nazionale at
                    Florence, and two reliefs in the Bargello dated 1521 and 1522. The latter is a
                    many-coloured relief of the Nativity, and was taken from the church of S.
                    Girolamo in Florence; it is a too pictorial work, marred by the use of many
                    different planes. Its predella has a small relief of the Adoration of the Magi,
                    and is inscribed “Hoc opus fecit Joanes Andree de Robia, ac posuit hoc in
                    tempore die ultima lulii ano. Dili, mdxxii.” At Pisa in the church of S.
                    Silvestro is a relief in Giovanni’s later and poorer manner dated 1520; it is a
                    Madonna surrounded by angels, with saints below—the whole overcrowded with
                    figures and ornaments. Giovanni’s largest and perhaps finest work is the
                    polychromatic frieze on the outside of the Del Ceppo Hospital at Pistoia, for
                    which he received various sums of money between 1525 and 1529, as is recorded in
                    documents which still exist among the archives of the hospital. <note

                    crudeness of some of its colouring. Six of these reliefs are by Giovanni,
                    namely, Clothing the Naked, Washing the Feet of Pilgrims, Visiting the Sick,
                    Visiting Prisoners, Burying the Dead, and Feeding the Hungry. The seventh,</p>

                    Giovanni also executed the medallions in the spandrels of the arches under this
                    frieze, with reliefs of the Annunciation, the Visitation, and the Coronation of
                    the Virgin.</p>

                    pictorial in style and coarse in execution. Giovanni’s chief pupil was a man
                    named Santi, who was at first apprenticed to Buglioni, <note anchored="true"

                <p>VII. Girolamo della Robbia (1488-1566), another of Andrea’s sons, was an
                    architect and a sculptor in marble and bronze as well as in enamelled clay.
                    During the first part of his life he, like his brothers, worked with his father,
                    but in 1528 he went to France and spent nearly forty years in the service of the
                    French royal family. Francis I. employed him to build a palace in the Bois de
                    Boulogne called the Château de Madrid. This was a large well-designed building,
                    four stories high, two of them having open loggie in the Italian fashion.
                    Girolamo decorated it richly with terra-cotta medallions, friezes, and other
                    architectural features. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The Sèvres Museum possesses some fragments of these decorations. </p></note>
                    For this purpose he set up kilns at Suresnes. Though the palace itself has been
                    destroyed, drawings of it exist. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    this palace. </p></note></p>
                <p>The best collections of Robbia ware are in the Florentine Bargello and Accademia,
                    the South Kensington Museum (the finest out of Italy), the Louvre, the Cluny,
                    and the Berlin Museums. Many fine specimens exist in Paris in the private
                    collections of M. Alphonse de Rothschild, M. Gavel, and M. Dreyfus. The greater
                    part of the Robbia work still remains in the churches and other buildings of
                    Italy, especially in Florence, Fiesole, Arezzo, La Verna, Volterrä, Barga,
                    Montepulciano, Lucca, Pistoia, Prato, and Siena. The best accounts of the Della
