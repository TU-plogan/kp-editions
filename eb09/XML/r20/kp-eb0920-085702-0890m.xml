                    Dante, was born May 12, 1828, at 38 Charlotte Street, Portland Place, London. He
                    was the first of the two sons and the second of the four children of Gabriele
                    Rossetti, the Italian poet and patriot, whose career was at one period as
                    turbulent as that of his illustrious son was (as far as mere outward incidents
                    went) uneventful.</p>
                <p>About 1824 Gabriele Rossetti, the father, after many vicissitudes, reached
                    England, where he married in 1826 Frances Polidori, sister of Byron’s Dr
                    Polidori and daughter of a Tuscan who had in early youth been AlfierPs secretary
                    and who had married an English lady. From his mother the subject of this notice
                    inherited as many English traits as Italian, or indeed more. In 1831 Gabriele
                    became professor of Italian in King’s College, London, and afterwards achieved a
                    recognized position as a subtle and original, if eccentric, commentator on
                    Dante.</p>
                <p>Dante Rossetti’s education was begun at a private school in Foley Street,
                    Portland Place, where he remained, however, only nine months, from the autumn of
                    1835 to the summer of 1836. He next went (in the autumn of 1836) to King’s
                    College School, where he remained till the summer of 1843, having reached the
                    fourth class. From early childhood he had displayed a marked propensity for
                    drawing and painting. It had therefore from the first been tacitly assumed that
                    his future career would be an artistic one, and he left school early. In Latin,
                    however, he was already fairly proficient for his age; French he knew well;
                    Italian he had spoken from childhood, and he had some German lessons about
                    1844-45. But, although he learned enough German to be able to translate the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arme Heinrich</hi> of Hartmann von</p>
                <p>Aue, and some portions of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied,</hi> he
                    afterwards forgot the language almost entirely. His Greek too, such as it had
                    been, he lost. On leaving school he went to Cary’s Art Academy (previously
                    called »Sass’s), near Bedford Square, and thence obtained admission to the Royal
                    Academy Antique School towards 1846. He did not attend the Royal Academy Life
                    School, and no doubt his defective knowledge of anatomy was some obstacle to him
                    in after life. The truth is, however, that Rossetti’s occasionally defective
                    drawing (which, as regards the throat, is most striking) did not arise mainly
                    from ignorance; it was the result of a peculiar mannerism. Admiring long and
                    slender necks, and drawing them admirably in such masterpieces as Beata Beatrix
                    and Monna Vanna, he refused to see that in art as in ethics the point of virtue
                    lies midway between two opposite vices. Admiring large hands and massive arms in
                    a woman, and drawing them admirably in such designs as Proserpine, Reverie,
                    &amp;c., he refused to see that hands can be too large, arms too massive. As a
                    colourist, however, Rossetti may be said to have required no teaching. Mastery
                    over colour seemed to have come to him by instinct.</p>
                <p>Of the artistic education of foreign travel Rossetti had very little. But in
                    early life he made a short tour in Belgium, where he was indubitably much
                    impressed and influenced by the works of Van Eyck at Ghent and Memling at
                    Bruges. In the spring of 1848 he took an active part in forming the so-called
                    pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, the members of which believed that the time had come
                    for the artist to confront again Nature herself— imitating no longer man’s
                    imitations of her—even though the imitations be those splendid works of the
                    great Raphaelite or post-Raphaelite masters which had hitherto been the
                    inspiration of modern art. The revolution was to be one of motives no less than
                    of methods. Of motive Rossetti was from the first a master. His struggle with
                    methods we have already indicated.</p>
                <p>To “paint nature as it is around them, with the help of modern science,” was the
                    object of the pre-Raphaelites according to Mr Ruskin, but to do so artists
                    require something more than that “earnestness of the men of the 13th and 14th
                    centuries” which Mr Ruskin speaks of: they require knowledge. Without knowledge,
                    as we see in even such a marvellous design as Christ at the Door of Simon the
                    Pharisee (1859), the artistic camel has to be drawn from the artist’s inner
                    consciousness, and the result is rarely a satisfactory quadruped. Intensity of
                    seeing does not necessarily imply truth of seeing; otherwise what phenomenon can
                    be more real than Blake’s Ghost of a Flea Î</p>
                <p>But Rossetti’s genius absorbed from pre-Raphaelitism all that it had to give, and
                    then passed on its way towards its own special goal. Often and indeed mostly an
                    artist’s true and best education is unlearning rather than learning. It was so
                    in Rossetti’s case, though he had the most vivid personality and the rarest
                    imagination of any man of his time. Plastic as molten wax, the mind from the
                    dawn of consciousness begins learning, for good or ill. Youth, therefore, how
                    rich soever in individual force, can no more help being imitative than a river,
                    even though it be the Amazon itself, can help reflecting the scenery through
                    which it flows. The goal before the young Rossetti’s eyes (as we see in such
                    designs as Taurello’s First Sight of Fortune, 1848, and Cassandra) was to reach
                    through art the forgotten world of old romance—that world of wonder and mystery
                    and spiritual beauty which the old masters knew and could have painted had not
                    lack of science, combined with slavery to monkish traditions of asceticism,
                    crippled their strength. And he reached it—he reached early that world which not
                    all the pseudo-classicism that arose in the 15th century, ripened in the 16th,
                    and rotted <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0891-0858"/>in the ISth could banish from the dreams of man,
                    as we see in even such juvenile work as the pen and ink drawings of Gretchen in
                    the Chapel, and Genevieve. In that great rebellion against the renascence of
                    classicism which (after working much good and much harm) resulted in
                    18th-century materialism,—in that great movement of man’s soul which may be
                    appropriately named “the Renascence of the Spirit of Wonder in Poetry and Art”
                    —he became the acknowledged protagonist before ever the pre-Raphaelite
                    brotherhood was founded aud down to his last breath at Birchington.</p>
                <p>And it was by inevitable instinct that Rossetti turned to that mysterious side of
                    nature and man’s life which to other painters of his time had been a mere
                    fancy-land, to be visited, if at all, on the wings of sport. It is not only in
                    such masterpieces of his maturity as Dante’s Dream, La Pia, &amp;c., but in such
                    early designs as Plow they Met Themselves, La Belle Dame Sans Merci, Cassandra,
                    &amp;c., that Rossetti shows how important a figure he is in the history of
                    modern art, if modern art claims to be anything more than a mechanical imitation
                    of the facts of nature.</p>
                <p>For if there is any permanent vitality in the Renascence of Wonder in modern
                    Europe—if it is not a mere passing mood—if it is really the inevitable
                    expression of the soul of man in a certain stage of civilization (when the
                    sanctions which have made and moulded society are found to be not absolute and
                    eternal, but relative, mundane, ephemeral, and subject to the higher sanctions
                    of unseen powers that work behind “the shows of things ”), then perhaps one of
                    the first questions to ask in regard to any imaginative painter of the 19th
                    century is, In what relation does he stand to the newly awakened spirit of
                    romance? Had he a genuine and independent sympathy with that temper of wonder
                    and mystery which all over Europe had preceded and now followed the temper of
                    imitation, prosaic acceptance, pseudo-classicism, and domestic materialism? or
                    was his apparent sympathy with the temper of wonder, reverence, and awe the
                    result of artistic environment dictated to him by other and more powerful and
                    original souls around him?</p>
                <p>We do not say that the mere fact of a painter’s or a poet’s showing but an
                    imperfect sympathy with the Renascence of Wonder is sufficient to place him
                    below a poet in whom that sympathy is more nearly complete, because we should
                    then be driven to place some of the disciples of Rossetti above our great
                    realistic painters, and we should be driven to place a poet like the author of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>
                    beneath a poet like the author of <hi rend="italic">The Queen's Wake</hi>; but
                    we do say that, other things being equal or anything like equal, a painter or
                    poet of our time is to be judged very much by his sympathy with that great
                    movement which we call the Renascence of Wonder—call it so because the word
                    romanticism never did express it even before it had been vulgarized by French
                    poets, dramatists, doctrinaires, and literary harlequins. To struggle against
                    the prim traditions of the l8th century, the unities of Aristotle, the
                    delineation of types instead of characters, as Chateaubriand, Madame de Staël,
                    Balzac, and Hugo struggled, was well. But in studying Rossetti’s works we reach
                    the very key of those “high palaces of romance” which the English mind had
                    never, even in the 18th century, wholly forgotten, but whose mystic gates no
                    Frenchman ever yet unlocked. Not all the romantic feeling to be found in all the
                    French romanticists (with their theory that not earnestness but the grotesque is
                    the life-blood of romance) could equal the romantic spirit expressed in a single
                    picture or drawing of Rossetti’s, such, for instance, as Beata Beatrix or
                    Pandora. For, λvhile the French romanticists—inspired by the theories (drawn
                    from English exemplars) of Novalis,</p>
                <p>Tieck, and Herder—cleverly simulated the old romantic feeling, the “beautifully
                    devotional feeling” which Holman Hunt speaks of, Rossetti was steeped in it: he
                    was so full of the old frank childlike wonder and awe which preceded the great
                    renascence of materialism that he might have lived and worked amidst the old
                    masters. Hence, in point of design, so original is he that to match such ideas
                    as are expressed in Lilith, Hesterna Rosa, Michael »Scott’s Wooing, the Sea
                    Spell, &lt;fcc., we have to turn to the sister art of poetry, where only we can
                    find an equally powerful artistic representation of the idea at the core of the
                    old romanticism—the idea of the evil forces of nature assailing man through his
                    sense of beauty. We must turn, we say, not to art—not even to the old masters
                    themselves—but to the most perfect efflorescence of the poetry of wonder and
                    mystery—to such ballads as the “Demon Lover,” to Coleridge’s “Christa-bel” and
                    “Kubla Khan,” to Keats’s “La Belle Dame sans Merci,” for parallels to Rossetti’s
                    most characteristic designs. Now, although the idea at the heart of the highest
                    romantic poetry (allied perhaps to that apprehension of the warring of man’s
                    soul with the appetites of the flesh which is the basis of the Christian idea)
                    may not belong exclusively to what we call the romantic temper (the Greeks, and
                    also most Asiatic peoples, were more or less familiar with it, as we see in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Saldmdn and Absal</hi> of Jami), yet it became peculiarly a
                    romantic note, as is seen from the fact that in the old masters it resulted in
                    that asceticism which is its logical expression and which was once an
                    inseparable incident of all romantic art. But, in order to express this
                    stupendous idea as fully as the poets have expressed it, how is it possible to
                    adopt the asceticism of the old masters? This is the question that Rossetti
                    asked himself, and answered by his own progress in art. Not that it is possible
                    here to give a chronological catalogue of Rossetti’s pictures. Moreover this has
                    been already done in great measure by Mr William Sharp, Mr W. M. Rossetti, and
                    others. We shall only dwell upon a few of those which most strongly indicate the
                    course his genius took.</p>
                <p>In all of them, however, the poorest and the best, is displayed that power which
                    Blake calls vision—the power which, as he finely says, is “surrounded by the
                    daughters of inspiration,” the power, that is, of seeing imaginary objects and
                    dramatic actions—physically seeing them as well as mentally—and flashing them
                    upon the imaginations (even upon the corporeal senses) of others.</p>
                <p>It was as early as 1819 that Rossetti exhibited in the so-called Free Exhibition
                    the Girlhood of the Virgin, one of the most beautiful and characteristic of all
                    his works. He scarcely ever exhibited again in London, though just before his
                    death his largest and most ambitious picture, Dante’s Dream, was exhibited at
                    Liverpool.</p>
                <p>Then came, in 1850, <hi rend="italic">The Germ,</hi> that short-lived magazine of
                    four numbers upon which so much has of late been written. If <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Germ</hi> was really “an official manifesto· or apologia of
                    pre-Raphaelitism,” all that it had to preach was the noble doctrine of the
                    sacredness, the saving grace, of conscience in art. In it appeared Rossetti’s
                    poem the “Blessed Damozel,” the prose poem “Hand and Soul” (written as early as
                    1848), six sonnets, and four lyrics, but none of his designs, though two
                    illustrations had been Jjrepared and discarded on account of their
                    unsatisfactory condition when reproduced. Like the other contributors to <hi
                    rend="italic">The Germ</hi> Rossetti had a belief that can only be called
                    passionate in the value of subject in art. For some years liis fecundity as a
                    designer was called into astonishing activity, but not always in the field of
                    wonder and poetic mystery. The artist who had had the strongest influence upon
                    Rossetti’s early tastes was Madox Brown, whose genius, dramatic aud historic,
                    has at length obtained <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n892/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0892-0859"/>universal recognition through the magnificent
                    frescos at Manchester. Though not one of the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, he had
                    been a contributor to <hi rend="italic">The Germ.</hi> Rossetti was deeply
                    impressed with the power and fecundity of design displayed by Mr Brown’s
                    cartoons exhibited in Westminster Hall, and when he himself began serious work
                    as a painter he thought of Brown as the one man from whom he would willingly
                    receive practical guidance, and wrote to him at random. He became Brown’s pupil;
                    but only once or twice, as in Found and Dr Johnson at the Mitre, did Rossetti
                    try his hand at such realistic subjects as Brown loved, and then with a success
                    that is very surprising if we consider how entirely his artistic energy had
                    worked in very different lines. Found, begun in 1853, still remains unfinished.
                    A countryman entering London in the early morning is accidentally or fatally
                    encountered at the foot of the bridge by his rustic sweetheart, who, having gone
                    to London, has been, in the most pathetic and terrible sense of the word,
                    “lost.” At sight of her lover the girl falls fainting at his feet. The
                    expression of shame and horror on her still beautiful face as she cowers against
                    the wall, and the expression of pity and grief on the man’s as he clasps her
                    hands and tries to raise her are unsurpassed and perhaps for sheer power
                    unequalled in modern dramatic art.</p>
                <p>Many circumstances—for instance, the beginning of such grand designs as Magdalene
                    at the Door of Simon the Pharisee, “Aspectâ Medusa,” the Boat of Love,
                    &amp;c.,—interfered with the completion of Found. With the exception of the Boat
                    of Love, Dante’s Dream (1870) was perhaps Rossetti’s most ambitious design in
                    purely imaginative art. From the painting of this picture to his death Rossetti
                    never satisfactorily completed a large and elaborate design —not because his
                    faculty of invention was ever exhausted; in the very year of his death his brain
                    was teeming with ideas as restlessly as when he designed Found and the Boat of
                    Love. But the truth is that he wanted to write more poetry; and those wonderful
                    half-lengths of women for which, late in life, he became so famous were not only
                    beautiful and satisfying but comparatively easy of achievement; moreover
                    purchasers were keen to commission them. Among those half-lengths, however, will
                    be found some of his greatest works. Chief among them (if it is not Proserpine)
                    is the marvellous crayon design Pandora in the possession of the present writer.
                    In it is seen at its highest Rossetti’s unique faculty of treating classical
                    legend in the true romantic spirit. The grand and sombre beauty of Pandora’s
                    face, the mysterious haunting sadness in her deep blue-grey eyes as she tries in
                    vain to reclose the fatal box from which are still escaping the smoke and flames
                    that shape themselves as they curl over her head into shadowy spirit faces, grey
                    with agony, between tortured wings of sullen fire, are in the highest romantic
                    mood. And if the Proserpine does not equal this design in elaborate allegorical
                    richness it has perhaps the still higher merit of suggesting lofty tragedy by
                    the simplest means. By sheer force of facial expression, a woman clasping a
                    pomegranate renders a tragic situation as fully as though the canvas had been
                    crowded with figures.</p>
                <p>But we must turn to his poetry. “The Blessed Damozel” was written so early as
                    1848. “Sister Helen”</p>
                <p>was produced in its original form in 1850 or 1851. The translations from the
                    early Italian poets also began as far back as 1845 or 184G, and may have been
                    mainly completed by 1849. Materials for the volume of original poetry (1870)
                    accumulated slowly, and these having been somewhat widely read in manuscript had
                    a very great influence upon our poetic literature long before their appearance
                    in print; but this is not the place for criticizing them in detail. All that we
                    can here say is that in poetry no less than in art what makes Rossetti so
                    important a figure is the position he took up with regard to the Renascence of
                    Wonder—to that modern revival of what is called the “romantic” spirit, that
                    spirit without which English poetry, as the present writer has on a former
                    occasion said when discussing the romantic movement, can scarcely hold an
                    original place at all when challenged in a court of universal criticism. The
                    Renascence of Wonder culminates in Rossetti’s poetry as it culminates in his
                    painting. The poet who should go beyond Rossetti would pass out of the realm of
                    poetry into pure mysticism, as certain of his sonnets show. Fine as are these
                    sonnets, it is in his romantic ballads that Rossetti (notwithstanding a certain
                    ruggedness of movement) shows his greatest strength. In this opinion (which is
                    not the general one) we agree with Dr Hueffer. “Sister Helen,” “The Blessed
                    Damozel,” “Staff and Scrip,” “Eden Bower,” “Troy Town,” “Rose Mary,” as
                    representing the modern revival of the true romantic spirit, take a place quite
                    apart from the other poetry of our time.</p>
                <p>By the modern revival of the romantic spirit in English poetry we mean something
                    much more than the revival, at the close of the last century, of natural
                    language, the change discussed by Wordsworth in his famous Preface, and by
                    Coleridge in his comments thereon—that change of diction and of poetic methods
                    which is commonly supposed to have arisen with Cowper, or, if not with Cowper,
                    with Burns. The truth is that Wordsworth and Coleridge were too near the great
                    changes in question, and they themselves took too active a part in those
                    changes, to hold the historical view of what the changes really were. Important
                    as was the change in poetic methods which they so admirably practised and
                    discussed, important as was the revival of natural language, which then set in,
                    it was not nearly so important as that other revival which had begun earlier and
                    of which it was the outcome—the revival of the romantic spirit, the Renascence
                    of Wonder, even beneath the weight of 18th-century diction, the first movement
                    of which no one has yet been able clearly and decisively to point out, but which
                    is certainly English, and neither German nor French in its origin, and can be
                    traced through Chatterton, Macpherson, and the Percy Ballads. ∙</p>
                <p>As a mere question of methods, a reaction against the poetic diction of Pope and
                    his followers was inevitable. But, in discussing the romantic temper in relation
                    to the overthrow of the bastard classicism and didactic materialism of the 18 th
                    century, we must, as we have just seen in discussing Rossetti’s pictures, go
                    deeper than mere artistic methods in poetry. When closely examined it is in
                    method only that the poetry of Cowper is different from the ratiocinative and
                    unromantic poetry of Dryden and Pope and their followers. Pope treated prose
                    subjects in the ratiocinative—that is to say, the prose—temper, but in a highly
                    artificial diction which people agreed to call poetic. Cowper treated prose
                    subjects too—treated them in the same prose temper, but used natural language, a
                    noble thing to do, no doubt— but this was only a part (and by no means the chief
                    part) of the great work achieved by English poetry at the close of last century.
                    That period, to be sure, freed us from the poetic diction of Pope; but it gave
                    us something more precious still—it gave us entire freedom, from the hard
                    rhetorical materialism imported from France; it gave a new seeing to our eyes,
                    which were opened once more to the mystery and the wonder of the universe and
                    the romance of man’s destiny; it revived in short the romantic spirit, but the
                    romantic spirit enriched by all the clarity and sanity that the renascence of
                    classicism was able to lend.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0893-0860"/>
                <p>The greatest movement that has occurred in later times was that which substituted
                    for the didactic materialism of the 18th century the new romanticism of the
                    19th, the leaders of which movement, Coleridge and Scott, were admirably
                    followed by Byron, Shelley, and Keats. Not that Wordsworth was a stranger to the
                    romantic temper. The magnificent image of Time and Death under the yew tree is
                    worthy of any romantic poet that ever lived, yet it cannot be said that he
                    escaped save at moments from the comfortable 18th-century didactics, or that he
                    was a spiritual writer in the sense that Coleridge, Blake, and Shelley were
                    spiritual writers.</p>
                <p>Of the true romantic feeling, the ever present apprehension of the spiritual
                    world and of that struggle of the soul with earthly conditions which we have
                    before spoken of, Rossetti’s poetry is as full as his pictures—so full indeed
                    that it was misunderstood by certain critics, who found in the most
                    spiritualistic of poets and painters the founder of a “fleshly school.” Although
                    it cannot be said that “The Blessed Damozel” or “Sister Helen” or “Rose Mary”
                    reaches to the height of the masterpieces of Coleridge, the purely romantic
                    temper was with Rossetti a more permanent and even a more natural temper than
                    with any other 19th-century poet, even Includingtheauthorof “Christabel”
                    himself. As to the other 19th-century poets, though the Ettrick Shepherd in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Queen’s Wake</hi> shows plenty of the true feeling, Hogg’s
                    verbosity is too great to allow of really successful work in the field of
                    romantic ballad, where concentrated energy is one of the first requisites. And
                    even Dobell’s “Keith of Ravelston” has hardly been fused in the fine atmosphere
                    of fairy land. Byron’s “footlight bogies” and Shelley’s metaphysical
                    abstractions had of course but very little to do with the inner core of romance,
                    and we have only to consider Keats, to whose “La Belle Dame sans Merci” and “Eve
                    of St Mark” Rossetti always acknowledged himself to be deeply indebted. In the
                    famous close of the seventh stanza of the “Ode to a Nightingale ”—</p>
                <p>Charmed magic casements opening on the foam Of perilous seas in faery lands
                    forlorn—</p>
                <p>there is of course the true thrill of the poetry of wonder, and it is expressed
                    with a music, a startling magic, above the highest reaches of Rossetti’s poetry.
                    But, without the evidence of Keats’s two late poems, “La Belle Dame sans Merci”
                    and the “Eve of St Mark,” who could have said that Keats showed more than a
                    passing apprehension of that which is the basis of the romantic temper —the
                    supernatural? In contrasting Keats with Rossetti it must always be remembered
                    that Keats’s power over the poetry of wonder came to him at one flash, and that
                    it was not (as we have said elsewhere) “till late in his brief life that his
                    bark was running full sail for the enchanted isle where the old ballad writers
                    once sang and where now sate the wizard Coleridge alone.” Though outside
                    Coleridge’s work there had been nothing in the poetry of wonder comparable with
                    Keats’s “La Belle Dame sans Merci,” he had previously in “Lamia” entirely failed
                    in rendering the romantic idea of beauty as a maleficent power. The reader,
                    owing to the atmosphere surrounding the dramatic action being entirely classic,
                    does not believe for a moment in the serpent woman. The classic accessories
                    suggested by Burton’s brief narrative hampered Keats where to Rossetti (as we
                    see in “Pandora,” “Cassandra,” and “Troy Town ”) they would simply have given
                    birth to romantic ideas. It is perhaps with Coleridge alone that Rossetti can be
                    compared as a worker in the Renascence of Wonder. Although his apparent lack of
                    rhythmic spontaneity places him below the great master as a singer (for in these
                    miracles of Coleridge’s genius poetry ceases to appear as a fine art at all —it
                    is the inspired song of the changeling child “singing, dancing to itself ”), in
                    permanence of the romantic feeling, in vitality of belief in the power of the
                    unseen, Rossetti stands alone. Even the finest portions of his historical ballad
                    “The King’s Tragedy” are those which deal with the supernatural.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1860 Rossetti married Elizabeth Eleanor Siddall, who being very
                    beautiful was constantly painted and drawn by him. She had one still-born child
                    in 1861, and died in February 1862. Mrs Rossetti’s own water-colour designs show
                    an extraordinary genius for invention and a rare instinct for colour. He felt
                    her death so acutely that in the first paroxysm of his grief he insisted upon
                    his poems (then in manuscript) being buried with her. These were at a later
                    period recovered, however, and from this time to his death he continued to write
                    poems and produce pictures,—in the latter relying more and more upon his
                    manipulative skill but exercising less and less,—for the reasons above
                    mentioned,—his exhaustless faculty of invention.</p>
                <p>About 1868 the curse of the artistic and poetic temperament, insomnia, attacked
                    him. One of the most distressing effects of this malady is a nervous shrinking
                    from personal contact with any save a few intimate and constantly seen friends.
                    This peculiar kind of nervousness may be aggravated by the use of narcotics, and
                    in his case was aggravated to a very painful degree; at one time he saw scarcely
                    any one save his own family and immediate family connexions and the present
                    writer. During the time that his second volume of original poetry, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ballads and Sonnets,</hi> was passingthrough the press (in 1881)
                    his health began to give way, and he left London for Cumberland. A stay of a few
                    weeks in the Vale of St John, however, did nothing to improve his health, and he
                    returned much shattered. He then went to Birchington-on-Sea, but received no
                    benefit from the change, and, gradually sinking from a complication of
                    disorders, he died on Sunday the 9th April 1882.</p>
                <p>In all matters of taste Rossetti’s influence has been immense. The purely
                    decorative arts he may be said to have rejuvenated directly or indirectly. And
                    it is doubtful whether any other Victorian poet has left so deep an impression
                    upon the poetic methods of his time.</p>
                <p>One of the most wonderful of Rossetti’s endowments, however, was neither of a
                    literary nor an artistic kind: it was that of a rare and most winning
                    personality which attracted towards itself, as if by an unconscious magnetism,
                    the love of all his friends, the love, indeed, of all who knew him.</p>
