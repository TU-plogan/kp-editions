                <p><label type="entry">RABIES</label> a virulent disease, developed primarily in and
                    peculiar to the canine species. Its occurrence in the same manner in other
                    carnivorous animals, as the fox, wolf, hyaena, jackal, raccoon, badger, and
                    skunk, has been asserted; but there is every probability that it is originally a
                    disease of the dog. It is communicated by inoculation to nearly all, if not all,
                    warm-blooded creatures. The transmission from one animal to another only
                    certainly takes place through inoculation with viruliferous matters. The malady
                    is generally characterized at a certain stage by an irrepressible desire in the
                    animal to act offensively with its natural weapons,—dogs and other carnivora
                    attacking with their teeth, herbivora with their hoofs or horns, and birds with
                    their beaks, when excited ever so slightly. In the absence of excitement the
                    malady may run its course without any fit of fury or madness. Transmission of
                    the disease to man produces <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrophobia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> or dread of water, but in animals this symptom is
                    rarely, if ever, observed. Rabies has been known from the very earliest times,
                    and serious outbreaks have been recorded as occurring among dogs, wolves, and
                    foxes in different parts of the world, particularly in western Europe and in
                    North and South America. It is very frequent in Europe and appears to be on the
                    increase. France, Germany, upper Italy, and Holland evidently suffer more than
                    other Continental countries. England is becoming more frequently visited than
                    before, though Scotland and Ireland are much less troubled than England. Spain
                    is also sometimes severely scourged by it; but it is rare in Portugal. On the
                    American continent it is well known, though on the eastern side of the Andes it
                    is rarely if ever seen; and it has never been heard of in Quito. In the West
                    Indies —in Hispaniola, Jamaica, Domingo, Havana, Guadaloupe, and Hayti—as well
                    as in Ceylon, it is frequently witnessed, and in 1813 it was introduced into
                    Mauritius. It exists in North and South China, and has been reported in Cochin
                    China and the kingdom of Anam. It is frequent and fatal in India; and it is by
                    no means rare in Syria, Palestine, and Turkey. It has been observed in the Hijâz
                    in Arabia, and in North Africa and Egypt. Hydrophobia has been reported in
                    Algeria; but Rohlfs asserts that it is unknown in Morocco. Gibraltar and Malta
                    have been seriously invaded at times, and in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia,
                    and Lapland it has been frequently seen in an epizootic form; but it is not yet
                    positively decided whether it exists in the Arctic regions. Steller and Erman
                    assert that it is unknown in Kamchatka and Greenland; but Hayes <hi
                    rend="italic">(The Open Polar Sea)</hi> gives us the particulars of an outbreak
                    of disease in South Greenland, which persisted for several years, caused him the
                    loss of his sledge-dogs in 1870, and in 1872 extended from Smith’s Sound to
                    Jakobshavn, threatening the utter extinction of the species, and with it the
                    disappearance of the Eskimo. In most of its features it appeared to be rabies.
                    The scourge is unknown, according to reliable evidence, in Australia and New
                    Zealand, Tasmania, the Azores, and St Helena, as well as the island of Madeira;
                    it has not been seen at Sumatra, nor in East, South, and West Africa, nor in the
                    island of Réunion.</p>
                <p>Rabies (hydrophobia) is almost invariably fatal in man, and in the dog it nearly
                    always terminates in death, though instances of recovery are recorded; and it is
                    extremely probable that in those cases in which people have been bitten by dogs
                    and subsequently perished from hydrophobia, without the animals themselves
                    offering any marked indications of illness either at the time or afterwards,
                    these have been suffering from a mild form of the disease. It is also fatal to
                    horses, cows, pigs, goats, and cats, but not to fowls, many of these recovering
                    from accidental or experimental inoculation. Indeed rabies varies consider-</p>
                <p>ably in intensity and in the character of its symptoms in different species of
                    creatures. Pasteur has shown that, if it is transmitted from the diseased dog to
                    the monkey and ultimately from monkey to monkey, at each transmission it becomes
                    more attenuated in virulence, and remains so attenuated when passed again to the
                    dog, rabbit, or guinea-pig, nor will it any longer produce the disease in dogs
                    by hypodermic inoculations. Even inoculation by trepanning the cranium, which is
                    so infallible in conveying rabies, may produce no result, the dog thenceforward
                    being protected, and no longer capable of receiving the disease. On the other
                    hand, the rabific virus is intensified when passed from rabbit to rabbit, or
                    from guinea-pig to guinea-pig; and after several transmissions through the
                    bodies of these animals it regains the maximum virulence which it possessed
                    before it was enfeebled by being passed through the monkey. And the same thing
                    holds with respect to the virulence of the ordinary rabid dog: when virus which
                    is far from having reached its maximum intensity is conveyed to the rabbit, it
                    requires to be passed through several of these animals before it reaches its
                    maximum. It may be mentioned that the disease is not readily conveyed from man
                    to animals, either accidentally or experimentally. The virus appears to exist in
                    greatest intensity in the salivary glands and their secretion, in the brain and
                    spinal cord, and perhaps to a lesser degree in the blood; doubtless it exists
                    also in other fluids and tissues of the diseased animal. The principal
                    alterations found in the bodies of rabid animals after death are located in the
                    spinal cord, especially its upper portion, the medulla oblongata, certain parts
                    of the brain, and the salivary glands, more particularly the submaxillary and
                    sublingual,—less in the parotid. The stomach, kidneys, and other organs also
                    present alterations which are more or less significant, especially the former,
                    in which foreign bodies, as hair, wood, stones, earth, pieces of cloth, &amp;c.,
                    are very frequently found. But the nature of the lesions, as well as the
                    symptomatology, shows that the action of the poison is more especially exerted
                    on the brain or spinal cord, though the eighth pair of nerves, and branches of
                    the fifth and seventh pairs, are not involved in animals, as in man.</p>
                <p>The period in which the symptoms of the disease become manifest, especially after
                    accidental inoculations, as bites, varies extremely; indeed there is no disease
                    in which the period of latency or incubation is more variable or pro״ tracted,
                    this being sometimes limited to a few days or weeks and extending in rare cases
                    to more than twelve months. In experimental inoculations the period is greatly
                    shortened and the results more certain,—all the more so if the virus is
                    introduced into the cranial cavity by trepanning, or into the blood-stream by
                    intravenous inoculation. In accidental inoculations, as in wounds from rabid
                    dogs, a certain but varying percentage escape. This immunity may be due to
                    natural non-receptivity, to the wound not having been inflicted in a very
                    vascular part, or to the saliva having been expended from frequent bites on
                    other animals, or intercepted by clothing, hair, wool, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Symptoms.</hi> —The disease has been divided into three stages
                    or periods, and has also been described as appearing in at least two forms,
                    according to the peculiarities of the symptoms. But, as a rule, one period of
                    the disease does not pass suddenly into another, the transition being almost
                    imperceptible; and the forms do not differ essentially from each other, but
                    appear merely to constitute varieties of the same disease, due to the natural
                    disposition of the animal, or other modifying circumstances. These forms have
                    been designated <hi rend="italic">true</hi> or <hi rend="italic">furious
                    rabies</hi> (Fr. <hi rend="italic">rage vrai</hi>; Germ, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The malady does not commence with fury and madness, but in a strange and
                    anomalous change in the habits of the dog: it becomes dull, gloomy, and
                    taciturn, and seeks to isolate itself in out-of-the-way places, retiring beneath
                    chairs and to odd corners. But in its retirement it cannot rest: it is uneasy
                    and fidgety, and no <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0217-0200"/>sooner has it lain down than suddenly it jumps up
                    in an agitated manner, walks backwards and forwards several times, again lies
                    down and assumes a sleeping attitude, but has only maintained it for a few
                    minutes when it is once more moving about. Again it retires to its corner, to
                    the farthest recess it can find, and huddles itself up into a heap, with its
                    head concealed beneath its chest and fore-paws. This state of continual
                    agitation and inquietude is in striking contrast with its ordinary habits, and
                    should therefore receive attention. Not unfrequently there are a few moments
                    when the creature appears more lively than usual, and displays an extraordinary
                    amount of affection. Sometimes there is a disposition to gather up straw,
                    thread, bits of wood, &amp;c., which are industriously carried away; a tendency
                    to lick anything cold, as iron, stones, &amp;c., is also observed in many
                    instances; and there is also a desire evinced to lick other animals. Sexual
                    excitement is also frequently an early symptom. At this period no disposition to
                    bite is observed; the animal is docile with its master and obeys his voice,
                    though not so readily as before, nor with the same pleased countenance. There is
                    something strange in the expression of its face, and the voice of its owner is
                    scarcely able to make it change from a sudden gloominess to its usual animated
                    aspect. These symptoms gradually become more marked: the restlessness and
                    agitation increase. If on straw the dog scatters and pulls it about with its
                    paws, and if in a room it scratches and tumbles the cushions or rugs on which it
                    usually lies. It is incessantly on the move, rambling about, scratching the
                    ground, sniffing in comers and at the doors, as if on the scent or seeking for
                    something. It indulges in strange movements, as if affected by some mental
                    influences, or a prey to hallucinations. When not excited by any external
                    influence it will remain for a brief period perfectly still and attentive, as if
                    watching something, or following the movements of some creature on the wall;
                    then it will suddenly dart forward and snap at the vacant air, as if pursuing an
                    annoying object, or endeavouring to seize a fly. At another time it throws
                    itself, yelling and furious, against the wall, as if it heard threatening voices
                    on the other side, or was bent on attacking an enemy. Nevertheless, the animal
                    is still docile and submissive, for its master’s voice will bring it out of its
                    frenzy. But the saliva is already virulent, and the excessive affection which it
                    evinces at intervals, by licking the hands or face of those it loves, renders
                    the danger very great should there be a wound or abrasion. Until a late period
                    in the disease the master’s voice has a powerful influence over the animal. When
                    it has escaped from all control and wanders erratically abroad, ferocious and
                    restless, and haunted by horrid phantoms, the familiar voice yet exerts its
                    influence, and it is rare indeed that it attacks its master.</p>
                <p>There is no dread of water in the rabid dog; the animal is generally thirsty, and
                    if water be offered will lap it with avidity, and swallow it at the commencement
                    of the disease. And, when, at a later period, the constriction about the
                    throat—symptomatic of the disease—renders swallowing difficult, the dog will
                    none the less endeavour to drink, and the lappings are as frequent and prolonged
                    when deglutition becomes impossible. So little dread has the rabid dog of water
                    that it will ford streams and swim rivers; and when in the ferocious stage it
                    will even do this in order to attack other creatures on the opposite side. The
                    evidence on this head is overwhelming.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of the disease the dog does not usually refuse to eat, and
                    some animals are voracious to an unusual degree. But in a short time it becomes
                    fastidious, only eating what it usually has a special predilection for. Soon,
                    however, this gives place to a most characteristic symptom—either the taste
                    becomes extremely depraved or the dog has a fatal and imperious desire to bite
                    and ingest everything. The litter of its kennel, wool from cushions, carpets,
                    stockings, slippers, wood, grass, earth, stones, glass, horse-dung, even its own
                    feces and urine, or whatever else may come in its way, are devoured. On
                    examination of the body of a dog which has died of rabies it is so common to
                    find in the stomach a quantity of dissimilar and strange matters on which the
                    teeth have been exercised that, if there was nothing known of the animal’s
                    history, there would be strong evidence of its having been affected with the
                    disease. When a dog, then, is observed to gnaw and eat suchlike matters, though
                    it exhibits no tendency to bite, it should be suspected.</p>
                <p>The mad dog does not usually foam at the mouth to any great extent at first. The
                    mucus of the mouth is not much increased in quantity, but it soon becomes
                    thicker, viscid, and glutinous, and adheres to the angles of the mouth, fauces,
                    and teeth. It is at this period that the thirst is most ardent, and the dog
                    sometimes furiously attempts to detach the saliva with its paws; and, if after a
                    while it loses its balance in these attempts and tumbles over, there can no
                    longer be any doubt as to the nature of the malady. There is another symptom
                    connected with the mouth in that form of the disease named “dumb madness” which
                    has frequently proved deceptive. The lower jaw drops in consequence of paralysis
                    of its muscles, and the mouth remains open. The interior is diy from the air
                    passing continually over it, and assumes a deep red tint, somewhat masked by
                    patches of dust or earth, which more especially adhere to the upper surface of
                    the tongue and to the lips. The strange alteration produced in the dog’s
                    physiognomy by its constantly open mouth and the dark colour of the interior is
                    rendered still more characteristic by the dull, sad, or dead expression of the
                    animal’s eyes. In this condition the creature is not very dangerous, because
                    generally it could not bite if it tried,— indeed there does not appear to be
                    much desire to bite in dumb madness; but the saliva is none the less virulent,
                    and accidental inoculations with it, through imprudent handling, will prove as
                    fatal as in the furious form. The mouth should not be touched, —numerous deaths
                    having occurred through people thinking the dog had some foreign substance
                    lodged in its throat, and thrusting their fingers down to remove it. The
                    sensation of tightness which seems to exist at the throat causes the dog to act
                    as if a bone were fixed between its teeth or towards the back of its mouth, and
                    to employ its fore-pgws as if to dislodge it. This is a very deceptive symptom,
                    and may prove equally dangerous if caution be not observed. Vomiting of blood or
                    a chocolate-coloured fluid is witnessed in some cases, and has been supposed to
                    be due to the foreign substances in the stomach, which abrade the lining
                    membrane; this, however, is not correct, as it has been observed in man.</p>
                <p>The voice of the rabid dog is very peculiar, and so characteristic that to those
                    acquainted with it nothing more is needed to prove the presence of the disease.
                    Those who have heard it once or twice never forget its signification. Owing to
                    the alterations taking place in the larynx the voice becomes hoarse, cracked,
                    and stridulous, like that of a child affected with croup,—the “voix du coq,”as
                    the French have it. A preliminary bark is made in a somewhat elevated tone and
                    with open mouth; this is immediately succeeded by five, six, or eight decreasing
                    howls, emitted when the animal is sitting or standing, and always with the nose
                    elevated, which seem to come from the depths of the throat, the jaws not coming
                    together and closing the mouth during such emission, as in the healthy bark.
                    This alteration in the voice is frequently the first observable indication of
                    the malady, and should at once attract attention. In dumb madness the voice is
                    frequently lost from the very commencement, —hence the designation.</p>
                <p>The sensibility of the mad dog appears to be considerably diminished, and the
                    animal appears to have lost the faculty of expressing the sensations it
                    experiences: it is mute under the infliction of pain, though there can be no
                    doubt that it still has peripheral sensation to some extent. Burning, beating,
                    and wounding produce much less effect than in health, and the animal will even
                    mutilate itself with its teeth. Suspicion, therefore, should always strongly
                    attach to a dog which does not manifest a certain susceptibility to painful
                    impressions and receives punishment without any cry or complaint. There is also
                    reason for apprehension when a dog bites itself persistently in any part of its
                    body. A rabid dog is usually stirred to fury at the sight of one of its own
                    species; this test has been resorted to by Bouley to dissipate doubts as to the
                    existence of the disease when the diagnosis is othenvise uncertain. As soon as
                    the suspected animal, if it is really rabid, finds itself in the presence of
                    another of its species it at once assumes the aggressive, and, if allowed, will
                    bite furiously. All rabid animals indeed become excited, exasperated, and
                    furious at the sight of a dog, and attack it with their natural weapons, even
                    the timid sheep when rabid butts furiously at the enemy before which in health
                    it would have fled in terror. This inversion of sentiment is sometimes valuable
                    in diagnosing the malady; it is so common that it may be said to be present in
                    every case of rabies. When, therefore, a dog, contrary to its habits and natural
                    inclination, becomes suddenly aggressive to other dogs, it is time to take
                    precautions.</p>
                <p>In the large majority of instances the dog is inoffensive in the early period of
                    the disease to those to whom it is familiar. It then flies from its home and
                    either dies, is killed as “mad,” or returns in a miserable plight, and in an
                    advanced stage of the malady, when the desire to bite is irresistible. It is in
                    the early stage that sequestration and suppressive measures are most valuable.
                    The dogs which propagate the disease are usually those that have escaped from
                    their owners. After two or three days, frequently in about twelve hours, more
                    serious and alarming symptoms appear, ferocious instincts are developed, and the
                    desire to do injury is irrepressible. The animal has an indefinable expression
                    of sombre melancholy and cruelty. The eyes have their pupils dilated, and emit
                    flashes of light when they are not dull and heavy; they always appear so fierce
                    as to produce terror in the beholder; they are red and their sensibility to
                    light is increased; and wrinkles, which sometimes appear on the forehead, add to
                    the repulsive aspect of the animal. If caged it flies at the spectator, emitting
                    its characteristic howl or bark, and seizing the iron bars with its teeth, and
                    if a stick be thrust before it this is grasped and gnawed. This fury is soon
                    succeeded by lassitude, when the animal remains insensible to every excitement.
                    Then all at once it rouses up again, and another paroxysm of fury commences. The
                    first paroxysm is usually the most intense, and the fits vary in duration from
                    some horns to a day, and even longer; they are ordinarily briefer in trained and
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n218/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0218-0201"/>pet dogs than in those which are less
                    domesticated, hut in all the remission is so complete after the first paroxysm
                    that the animals appear to be almost well, if not in perfect health. During the
                    paroxysms respiration is hurried and laboured, but tranquil during the
                    remissions. There is an increase of temperature and the pulse is quick and hard.
                    When the animal is kept in a dark place and not excited, the fits of fury are
                    not observed. Sometimes it is agitated and restless in the manner already
                    described. It never becomes really furious or aggressive unless excited by
                    external objects,—the most potent of these, as has been said, being another dog,
                    which, however, if it be admitted to its cage, it may not at once attack. The
                    attacked animal rarely retaliates, but usually responds to the bites by acute
                    yells, which contrast strangely with the silent anger of the aggressor, and
                    tries to hide its head with its paws or beneath the straw. These repeated
                    paroxysms hurry the course of the disease. The secretion and flowing of a large
                    quantity of saliva from the mouth are usually only witnessed in cases in which
                    swallowing has become impossible, the mouth being generally dry. At times the
                    tongue, nose, and whole head appear swollen. Other dogs frequently shun one
                    which is rabid, as if aware of their danger.</p>
                <p>The rabid dog, if lodged in a room or kept in a house, is continually
                    endeavouring to escape; and when it makes its escape it goes freely forward, as
                    if impelled by some irresistible force. It travels considerable distances in a
                    short time, perhaps attacking every living creature it meets,—preferring dogs,
                    however, to other animals, and these to mankind; cats, sheep, cattle, and horses
                    are particularly liable to be injured. It attacks in silence, and never utters a
                    snarl or a cry of anger; should it chance to be hurt in return it emits no cry
                    or howl of pain. The degree of ferocity appears to be related to natural
                    disposition and training. Some dogs, for instance, will only snap or give a
                    slight bite in passing, while others will bite furiously, tearing the objects
                    presented to them, or which they meet in their way, and sometimes with such
                    violence as to injure their mouth and break their teeth, or even their jaws. If
                    chained, they will in some cases gnaw the chain until their teeth are worn away
                    and the bones laid bare. The rabid dog does not continue its progress very long.
                    Exhausted by fatigue and the paroxysms of madness excited in it by the objects
                    it meets, as well as by hunger, thirst, and also, no doubt, by the malady, its
                    limbs soon become feeble; the rate of travelling is lessened and the walk is
                    unsteady, while its drooping tail, head inclined towards the ground, open mouth,
                    and protruded tongue (of a leaden colour or covered with dust) give the
                    distressed creature a very striking and characteristic physiognomy. In this
                    condition, however, it is much less to be dreaded than in its early fits of
                    fury, since it is no longer capable or desirous of altering its course or going
                    out of its way to attack an animal or a man not immediately in the path. It is
                    very probable that its fast-failing vision, deadened scent, and generally
                    diminished perception prevent its being so readily impressed or excited by
                    surrounding objects as it previously was. To each</p>
                <p>Saroxysm, which is always of short duration, there succeeds a egree of exhaustion
                    as great as the fits have been violent and oft repeated. This compels the animal
                    to stop; then it shelters itself in obscure places—frequently in ditches by the
                    roadside—and lies there in a somnolescent state for perhaps hours. There is
                    great danger, nevertheless, in disturbing the dog at this period; for when
                    roused from its torpor it has sometimes sufficient strength to inflict a bite.
                    This period, which may be termed the second stage, is as variable in its
                    duration as the first, but it rarely exceeds three or four days. The
                    above-described phenomena gradually merge into those of the third or last
                    period, when symptoms of paralysis appear, which are speedily followed by death.
                    During the remission in the paroxysms these paralytic symptoms are more
                    particularly manifested in the hind limbs, which appear as if unable to support
                    the animal’s weight, and cause it to stagger about; or the lower jaw becomes
                    more or less drooping, leaving the parched mouth partially open. Emaciation
                    rapidly sets in, and the paroxysms diminish in intensity, while the remissions
                    become less marked. The physiognomy assumes a still more sinister and repulsive
                    aspect; the hair is dull and erect; the flanks are retracted; the eyes lose
                    their lustre and are buried in the orbits, the pupil being dilated, and the
                    cornea dull and semi-opaque; very often, even at an early period, the eyes
                    squint, and this adds still more to the terrifying appearance of the poor dog.
                    The voice, if at all heard, is husky, the breathing laborious, and the pulse
                    hurried and irregular. Gradually the paralysis increases, and the posterior
                    extremities are dragged as if the animal’s back were broken, until at length it
                    becomes general; it is then the prelude to death. Or the dog remains lying in a
                    state of stupor, and can only raise itself with difficulty on the fore-limbs
                    when greatly excited. In this condition it may yet endeavour to bite at objects
                    within its reach. At times convulsions of a tetanic character appear in certain
                    muscles; at other times these are general. A comatose condition ensues, and the
                    rabid dog, if permitted to die naturally, perishes, in the great majority of
                    cases, from paralysis and asphyxia.</p>
                <p>In dumb madness there is paralysis of the lower jaw, which imparts a curious and
                    very characteristic physiognomy to the dog; the voice is also lost, and the
                    animal can neither eat nor drink. In this condition the creature remains with
                    its jaw pendent and the mouth consequently wide open, showing the flaccid or
                    swollen tongue covered with brownish matter, and a stringy gelatinous-looking
                    saliva lying between it and the lower lip and coating the fauces, which
                    sometimes appear to be inflamed. Though the animal is unable to swallow fluids,
                    the desire to drink is nevertheless intense; for the creature will thrust its
                    face into the vessel of water in futile attempts to obtain relief, even until
                    the approach of death. Water maybe poured down its throat without inducing a
                    paroxysm. The general physiognomy and demeanour of the poor creature inspire the
                    beholder with pity rather than fear. The symptoms due to cerebral excitement are
                    less marked than in the furious form of the disease; the agitation is not so
                    considerable, and the restlessness, tendency to run away, and desire to bite are
                    nearly absent; generally the animal is quite passive. Not !infrequently one or
                    both eyes squint, and it is only when very much excited that the dog may
                    contrive to close its mouth. Sometimes there is swelling about the pharynx and
                    the neck; when the tongue shares in this complication it hangs out of the mouth.
                    In certain cases there is a catarrhal condition of the membrane lining the nasal
                    cavities, larynx, and bronchi; sometimes the animal testifies to the existence
                    of abdominal pain, and the faeces are then soft or fluid. The other
                    symptoms—such as the rapid exhaustion and emaciation, paralysis of the posterior
                    limbs towards the termination of the disease, as well as the rapidity with which
                    it runs its course—are the same as in the furious form.</p>
                <p>The simultaneous occurrence of furious and dumb madness is frequently observed in
                    packs of fox-hounds. Dumb madness differs, then, from the furious type in the
                    paralysis of the lower jaw, which hinders the dog from biting, save in very
                    exceptional circumstances; the ferocious instincts are also in abeyance; and
                    there is no tendency to aggression. It has been calculated that from 15 to 20
                    per cent, of rabid dogs have this particular form of the disease. Puppies and
                    young dogs chiefly have furious rabies.</p>
                <p>These are the symptoms of rabies in the dog; but it is not likely, nor is it
                    necessary, that they will all be present in every case. In other species the
                    symptoms differ more or less from those manifested by the dog, but they are
                    generally marked by a change in the manner and habits of the creatures affected,
                    with strong indications of nervous disturbance, in the majority of species
                    amounting to ferociousness and a desire to injure, timid creatures becoming bold
                    and aggressive. (See Fleming, <hi rend="italic">Rabies and
                    Hydrophobia.)</hi></p>
                <p>In order to prevent injury from this disease in countries in which it is
                    prevalent owners of dogs should be well acquainted with its symptoms, especially
                    the premonitory ones j of these a change in the demeanour and habits of the
                    animal—unusual irritability, depraved appetite, restlessness, and a tendency to
                    wander from home—are the most marked. One of the chief police measures is
                    diminution in the number of useless dogs. This is best enforced by the
                    imposition of a dog-tax or licence, which may be large or small in proportion to
                    the number of dogs or the urgency of the case. ^0n the licence-paper the chief
                    symptoms of the malady should be described so as to warn dog-owners. Every dog
                    should wear a collar with a brass plate, on which are inscribed the name and
                    address of the owner as well as a police register-number stamped thereon, or
                    some particular mark affixed by the police or inland revenue authorities, for
                    purposes of identification; all stray dogs without a collar of this description
                    ought to be captured, and sold or destroyed after three or more days if not
                    claimed. Blunting the canine and incisor teeth of dogs has also been proposed as
                    a precautionary measure. All dogs suspected of rabies should be captured and,
                    when the existence of the disease is confirmed, destroyed. Rabid dogs should be
                    destroyed at once. It is also well as a precautionary measure to kill dogs or
                    cats which have been bitten or “worried” by rabid animals. During an outbreak of
                    rabies all dogs should be securely muzzled and if possible led. It is a great
                    mistake to destroy immediately suspected dogs which have bitten people; they
                    should be kept until their condition is ascertained, as, if they are found to be
                    healthy, this will greatly relieve the mind of those who have been bitten.
                    Suspected dogs should be carefully kept under observation and frequently
                    inspected by a veterinary surgeon or other competent per<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n219/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0219-0202"/>son. All wounds inflicted by strange or suspected
                    dogs should be immediately attended to and treated by suction, washing, and
                    expression, until proper surgical treatment can be adopted. In those countries
                    in which the disease has not yet appeared, in order to prevent its admission,
                    the importation of dogs should be forbidden or an extended period of quarantine
                    imposed.</p>
                <p>We may here allude to the results of Pasteur’s experiments in rabies. By passing
                    modified virus into the bodies of dogs he has discovered that they are protected
                    from an attack of the disease—are, in fact, rendered refractory to rabies. For
                    instance, rabific virus is obtained from a rabbit which has died after
                    inoculation by trepanning, and after a period of incubation longer by some days
                    than the shortest period in these animals, which is invariably between seven and
                    eight days subsequent to inoculation with the most active virus. The virus of
                    the rabbit in the period of long incubation is inoculated by trepanning into a
                    second rabbit, the virus of this into a third; and on each occasion the virus,
                    which becomes more and more potent, is inoculated into a dog. The latter at last
                    becomes capable of supporting what would be to other dogs a deadly virus, and is
                    entirely proof against rabies either by intravenous inoculation, by trepanning,
                    or by the virus of a rabid animal. By using the blood of rabid animals in
                    certain determinate conditions Pasteur has been able to greatly simplify the
                    operations of inoculation, and to render dogs most decidedly refractory to the
                    malady. There is great importance attached to the suggestion that now, and until
                    rabies has been extinguished altogether by inoculation, it may be possible to
                    prevent development of the disease after bites from rabid dogs, owing to the
                    long duration of the incubative period. Admitting that rabies is produced by the
                    bite of rabid animals only, and that Pasteur’s inoculations are really
                    protective, it is suggested that a law compelling all dogs to be so protected
                    would in the end extirpate the disease. But certain important points have yet to
                    be decided before any definite conclusion can be arrived at. <hi
