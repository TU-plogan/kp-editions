                    Marquise de</hi> (1588-1665), a lady famous in tbe literary history of France,
                    was born in 1588. She was the daughter and heiress of Jean de Yivonne, marquis
                    of Pisani, and her mother Giulia was of the noble Roman family of Savelli. She
                    was married at twelve years old to Charles d’Angennes, vidame of Le Mans, and
                    afterwards marquis of Rambouillet. Her celebrity is due to the salon or literary
                    meeting-place which she established as early as 1608 in the Hôtel de
                    Rambouillet,—or, to give it its proper name, the Hôtel Pisani, for M. de
                    Rambouillet had shortly before his marriage sold his family mansion. Madame de
                    Rambouillet not merely endeavoured to refine the manners of her guests and gave
                    special attention to literary conversation, but also seems to have taken great
                    trouble to arrange her house for purposes of reception, and is said to have been
                    the first to devise suites of rooms through which visitors could move easily.
                    The hôtel was open for more than fifty years, and almost all the more remarkable
                    personages in French society and French literature frequented it, especially
                    during the second quarter of the century, when it was at the height of its
                    reputation. The incidents connected with the salon of the “incomparable
                    Arthénice” (an anagram for Catherine which is said to have taken two poets of
                    renown, Malherbe and Racan, a whole afternoon to devise) are innumerable, and it
                    would be impossible to recount them in any space here available. Among the more
                    noteworthy are the sonnet war between the Uranistes and the Jobistes—partisans
                    of two famous sonnets by Voiture and Benserade—and the composition by all the
                    famous poets of the day of the <hi rend="italic">Guirlande de Julie</hi> , a
                    collection of poems on different flowers, addressed to Julie d’Angennes, Madame
                    de Rambouillet’s eldest daughter. Even more important is the rise of the
                    Précieuses, who owed their existence to Madame de Rambouillet’s salon and
                    influence. These ladies—who are usually represented in the memory of posterity
                    by Molière’s avowed caricatures and by Mademoiselle de Scudéry, but whose name,
                    it must l be remembered, Madame de Sévigné herself was proud to <pb break="no"

                    their suitors ' and friends (though it seems from Tallemant’s account that
                    practical jokes of a mild kind were by no means excluded from the Hôtel de
                    Rambouillet), and especially favoured an elaborate and quintessenced kind of
                    colloquial and literary expression, such as at the end of the 16th and in the
                    earlier part of the 17th century was fashionable throughout Europe. The immortal
                    <hi rend="italic">Précieuses Ridicules</hi> was no doubt directly levelled not
                    at the Hôtel de Rambouillet itself but at the numerous coteries which in the
                    course of years (for the salon had been open for more than a generation when
                    Molière’s piece, which was patronized by the real Précieuses themselves,
                    appeared) had sprung up in imitation of it. But the satire did in truth touch
                    the originators as well as the imitators,—the former more closely perhaps than
                    they perceived. The Hôtel de Rambouillet continued open till the death of its
                    mistress, 27th December 1665, but latterly it lost its peculiar position. It had
                    no doubt a very considerable influence in bringing about the classicizing of
                    French during the 17th century, though the literary work with which it is
                    chiefly identified was of an older school than that of the age of Louis XIV.

                    his <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire des Précieuses.</hi> Many recent writers have
