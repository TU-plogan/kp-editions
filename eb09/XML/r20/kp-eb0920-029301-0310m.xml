                    tail which terminates in a chain of horny, loosely connected rings, the
                    so-called “rattle.״ The “pit <hi rend="italic">”</hi> by which the family is
                    distinguished from the ordinary vipers is a deep depression in the integument of
                    the sides of the snout, between the nostrils and the eye; its physiological
                    function is unknown. The rattle is a complicated and highly specialized organ,
                    developed from the simple conical scale or epidermal spine, which in the
                    majority of snakes forms the termination of the general integument of the tail.
                    The bone by which the root of the rattle is supported consists of the last
                    caudal vertebrae, from three to eight in number, which are enlarged, dilated,
                    compressed, and coalesced (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a).</hi> This bone is
                    covered with thick and vascular cutis, transversely divided by two constrictions
                    into three portions, of which the proximal is larger than the median, and the
                    median much larger than the distal (fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">a).</hi> This
                    cuticular portion constitutes the matrix of a horny epidermoid covering which
                    closely fits the shape of the underlying soft part and which is the first
                    commencement of the rattle, as it appears in very young rattlesnakes before they
                    have shed their skin for the first time. When the period of a renewal of the
                    skin approaches a new covering of the extremity of the tail is formed below the
                    old one, but the latter, instead of being cast off with the remainder of the
                    epidermis, is retained by the posterior swelling of the end of the tail, forming
                    now the first loose joint of the rattle. This process is repeated on succeeding
                    exuviations,—the new joints being always larger than the old ones as long as the
                    snake grows (fig. 3). Perfect rattles therefore taper towards the point, but
                    generally the oldest (terminal) joints wear away in time and are lost. As
                    rattlesnakes shed their skins more than once every year, the number of joints of
                    the rattle does not indicate the age of the animal but the number of exuviations
                    which it has undergone. The largest rattle in the British Museum has twenty-one
                    joints. The rattle (fig. 4) consists thus of a variable number of dry, hard,
                    horny cup-shaped joints, each of which loosely grasps a portion of the
                    preceding, and all of which are capable of being shaken against each other. If
                    the interspaces between the joints are filled with water, as often happens in
                    wet weather, no noise can be produced. The motor power lies in the lateral
                    muscles of the tail, by which a vibratory motion is communicated to the rattle,
                    the noise produced being similar to that of a weak child’s rattle and
                    perceptible at a distance of from 10 to 20 yards.</p>
                <p>The habit of violently and rapidly agitating the tail is by no means peculiar to
                    the rattlesnake, but has been observed in other venomous as well as innocuous
                    snakes with the ordinary termination of the tail, when under the influence of
                    fear or anger. The special object for which the rattle has been developed in
                    these snakes is unknown.</p>
                <p>Rattlesnakes are entirely confined to the New World. North-American authors
                    distinguish now a great number of different kinds, the most recent, Garman ( <hi
                    rend="italic">Reptiles and Batrachians of North America,</hi> 1883, 4to),
                    enumerating twelve distinct species and thirteen additional varieties; but all
                    these species or varieties fall into two groups, viz., one which has the upper
                    side of the head covered with the ordinary nine dermal shields, and the other in
                    which the shields between and behind the eyes are broken up or replaced by small
                    scales. The former group consists of two species only, of comparatively small
                    size, both North American, <hi rend="italic">Crotalus miliarius</hi> being the
                    more generally known. The second group comprises the more formidable kinds of
                    South as well as North America, which are generally described under the names of
                    <hi rend="italic">C. horridus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. durissus.</hi> In
                    the older standard works the former name was applied to the southern form, which
                    extends from Paraguay and Chili through Brazil into Mexico, and the latter to
                    the common North-American rattlesnake; in modern American works this
                    nomenclature is reversed. <hi rend="italic">C. horridus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">C. durissus</hi> belong to the most dangerous of poisonous snakes.
                    If a person bitten by an adult rattlesnake escapes with life, protracted illness
                    and the loss of or injury to the wounded limb are frequently the consequence.
                    They inhabit localities to which the sun has free access, prairies, rough stony
                    ground, &amp;c. Specimens of 5 feet in length are not rare. Formerly common in
                    the eastern parts of the United States, and still so in thinly inhabited
                    districts of the western States, rattlesnakes, like the vipers of Europe, have
                    gradually succumbed to the unceasing persecution of man. They vary much in
                    colour: a common type of coloration is a brownish ground-colour, sometimes
                    yellowish, sometimes blackish. Series of large dark spots, frequently edged with
                    yellow, and of very variable shape, run along the back and sides. The head and
                    neck are ornamented with dark or black longitudinal bands, or are marked by an
                    almost uniform coloration.</p>
