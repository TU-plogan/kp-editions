                    had a rather special reputation for devotion, had been marshal since 1429, and
                    had held the alms-dish at the coronation of Charles VII. Suddenly he was
                    arrested, tried, and, as above stated, executed on the evidence of accomplices
                    and his own confession. The crimes with which he was charged extended over some
                    fourteen years. During that period it was alleged that he had, through different
                    agents, especially a AA'oman called La Meffraie, kidnapped or enticed to his
                    various abodes large numbers (Monstrelet says 100, others 140) of children.
                    These children, after being subjected to every outrage of lust and cruelty,
                    Avere sacrificed to the devil, their blood used for magical ceremonies, their
                    bodies burned, and their bones buried in the precincts of Rais’s castles. The
                    ultimate purpose of this deAnl-worship Avas asserted to be the acquisition by
                    Rais (who was assisted by divers sorcerers, especially an Italian imported for
                    the purpose) of power and honours in the state. The depositions were A <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> ery full and still exist, and on them and his
                    confession Rais Avas executed. It is, however, somewhat suspicious that the
                    bishop of Nantes, who promoted, and the duke of Brittany, who sanctioned the
                    proceedings, were both bitter personal enemies of Rais, Ailiile the king, who
                    AA־as also concerned, had for a main part of his policy the putting doAvn of
                    feudal barons <hi rend="smallcaps">ayIio,</hi> like Rais, held posts of vantage
                    in the country. The tAA <hi rend="superscript">T</hi> o chief contemporary
                    authors <hi rend="smallcaps">avIio</hi> mention the case, Monstrelet and
                    Chastellain, speak of it Avith somewhat less horror than might, even alloAving
                    for possible political sympathies, have been expected. Monstrelet (who says that
                    Rais was charged Avith the murder of pregnant Avomen also) says that “many
                    ladies and damsels” begged his body of the duke, and that great part of the
                    nobles of Brittany, not only his relations, had great sorroAv and sadness for
                    his death. Chastellain introduces the ghost of Rais in rather striking fashion
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Temple de Bocace</hi> as “folloAved by a multitude of
                    little children crying ‘Vengeance.’” The affair affected public imagination as
                    much because of the rarity of a criminal of such rank being brought to justice
                    as of the heinousness of the crimes attributed to him. Locally it took a very
                    strong hold of the popular mind, and a tradition not easy to trace connects it
                    with the Bluebeard legend, which finally took shape in the hands of Perrault.
                    This connexion, liOAvever, hardly bears examination. In the first place, there
                    is no evidence that Rais ever was called Bluebeard, though a contemporary
                    English adventurer A\'ho is mentioned by Holinshed Avas so called, and may have
                    left a bad reputation in France. In the second, it is impossible to trace even
                    the most superficial resemblance betAveen the stories. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bluebeard</hi> there are no children concerned, no unnatural crimes, no
                    sorcery; it is merely one of the numerous stories of “punished curiosity” so
                    frequent in folk-lore. As it stands the Rais story is too horrible to make much
                    of a figure in literature; but it has attracted some students of <hi
                    rend="italic">causes célèbres,</hi> notably Dumas <hi rend="italic">fils</hi> in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Tristan le Roux.</hi></p>
                <p>For authorities besides the passages of Monstrelet and Chastellain above quoted,
                    Michelet, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de France,</hi> and Vallet de Viriville,
                    <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Charles VIL,</hi> may be consulted. Mézeray’s
                    account, usually followed in books of reference, is loose; he had evidently not
                    seen the records, nor even Monstrelet. But his assignment of a state crime
                    against the duke as the real cause of death is very probable, though not
                    formally correct.</p>
