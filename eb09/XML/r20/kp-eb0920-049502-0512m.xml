                    >Tallina),</hi> a seaport of Russia, capital of Esthonia, is situated in a bay
                    on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland, in 59° 27' N. lat. and 24° 45' E.
                    long., 230 miles west of St Petersburg by rail. The city consists of two
                    parts—the “Domberg” or “Dom,” which occupies a hill, and the lower town on the
                    beach—and is surrounded by pleasant suburban houses with gardens. The “Dorn”
                    contains the castle, where the provincial administration has its seat, and the
                    slopes of the hill are covered with the well-built houses of the German
                    aristocracy. It has <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0513-0496"/>its own administration, separate from that of the
                    lower town. This last retains a mediaeval character, λvith narrow tortuous
                    streets and high tile-roofed houses often enclosing large storehouses within
                    their thick walls. Reval has more interesting antiquities than any other town of
                    the Russian Baltic provinces. The old church of St Nicholas, built in 1317,
                    contains many antiquities of the old Catholic times and old German paintings, of
                    which a Dance of Death is especially worthy of notice. It contains also the
                    graves of Holstein Beck and of the Duc de Croy, who was denied burial for his
                    debts, and whose mummy, dressed in velvet and fine lace, was exposed until 1862.
                    The “Domkirche” contains many interesting shields, as also the graves of the
                    circumnavigator Krusenstern, of Pontus-de-la-Gardie, Henry Matthias, Karl Horn,
                    &lt;kc. The church of St Olai, first erected in 1240, and often rebuilt, was
                    completed in 1840 in Gothic style; it has a bell tower 429 feet high. The oldest
                    church is the Esthonian, built in 1219. Water is brought from Lake Järväkylä by
                    an aqueduct. The pleasant situation of the town, surrounded by beautiful parks,
                    attracts in summer thousands of people for sea-bathing.</p>
                <p>The population of Reval has increased rapidly since it has been connected by rail
                    with St Petersburg and with Baltic Port, 30 miles distant; it reached 50,490 in
                    1881, against 27,325 in 1867, of whom one-third are Germans, the remainder
                    Esthonians, with a few Russians and Jews. Nearly 15,000 inhabitants belong to
                    the Greek Church. The manufactures are not important, but trade grows steadily.
                    In Ï882 the exports (grain, spirits, &amp;c.) were £1,746,244, the imports
                    (coal, iron, chemicals, Ac.) £6,858,247. In 1882 Reval was visited by 589
                    foreign ships (291,450 tons), mostly English, German, and Scandinavian, and by
                    802 coasters (103,000 tons). It has regular steam communication with St
                    Petersburg, Helsingfors, Königsberg, ιfcc.</p>
                <p>The high Silurian crag now known as Domberg was early occupied by an Esthonian
                    fort, Lindanissa. In 1219 or 1233 the Danish king Waldemar II. erected there a
                    strong castle and founded the first church of the Holy Ghost. In 1228 the castle
                    was taken by the Livonian knights, but nine years later it returned to the
                    Danes. About the same time Lübeck and Bremen merchants settled there under the
                    protection of the castle, and their settlement soon became an important seaport
                    of the Hanseatic League. It was fortified early in the 14th century, and in 1343
                    sustained the siege of the revolted Esthonians. Waldemar III. sold Reval and
                    Esthonia to the Livonian knighthood for 19,000 silver marks, and the town
                    belonged to the knighthood till its dissolution in 1561, when Esthonia and Reval
                    surrendered to the Swedish king Erik XVI. A great conflagration in 1433, the
                    pestilence of 1532, the bombardment by the Danes in 1569, and still more the
                    Russo-Livonian War, broke down its formerly wealthy trade. The Russians not only
                    devastated the neighbouring country but also besieged Reval twice, in 1570 and
                    1577. It was still, however, an important fortress, the forts and walls having
                    been enlarged and fortified by the Swedes. In 1710 the commander Patkull
                    surrendered it to Peter I., who immediately began there the erection of a
                    military port for his Baltic fleet. The successors of Peter I. continued to
                    fortify the access to Reval from the sea, large works being undertaken
                    especially in the first part of the present century. During the Crimean War the
                    suburb Reperbahn, situated on a low slip of coast, was destroyed in view of a
                    possible landing of the allies.</p>
