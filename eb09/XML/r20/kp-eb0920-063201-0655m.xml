                <p>ROMANCE<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the 9th
                    century the Romana or Romance language made its first appearance in writing. For
                    many centuries, however, it was only used to embody the tales and ballads of
                    each country in which one or other form of the speech was vernacular, so that
                    the word “romance” became finally appropriated to the compositions which were

                    rend="italic">Romance,</hi></p></note> in its widest sense includes the entire
                    literature of fiction, as well as the early narrations in which fact and legend
                    were blended in historical form, before the simple minds of the people had
                    acquired a clear conception of their distinctness. There are, however, certain
                    ill-defined limitations in the analysis of fiction which enable us to assign
                    distinct places to the legend, the ballad, the epic, the fable, the tale, the
                    romance, and the novel. As usual in all attempts at precise classification, we
                    find that the lines of demarcation cannot be drawn with rigid exactness, and
                    that many works may be referred to more than one division. But the general
                    conception of romance is the one which will here be followed, and which roughly
                    divides the subject into (i.) <hi rend="italic">Romances of Chivalry—</hi>
                    chiefly their prose forms—and (ii.) the <hi rend="italic">Romances of Love and
                    Adventure,</hi> which follow them.</p>
                <p>Romance, as a distinct branch of the literature of fiction, belongs essentially
                    to the Middle Ages and to Europe. The romance of chivalry, as it is called,
                    prevailed during the four centuries of knighthood, and there can be little doubt
                    that the institutions of chivalry were considerably influenced by the works of
                    the early romancers. The establishment of the orders of St John and the Temple
                    was based upon an exalted conception of duty and devotion, which the hard test
                    of experience soon modified, and which would have perished utterly but for the
                    em <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n656/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0656-0633"/>bodiment of its ideal in the Round Table romances.
                    The characters of Galaad and the original Perceval represent types of
                    unattainable perfection, and were therefore models which, although commanding
                    reverence, failed to excite as deep an interest as did the second Perceval, Sir
                    Lancelot, Sir Tristan, and Sir Gawain. In these the noblest qualities were
                    blemished by human frailties, and, as a necessary consequence, the knights
                    miscarried a little below the summit of perfect achievement. Walter Map cannot
                    be sufficiently eulogized for the tact and skill with which he drew the two
                    first-named personages. Galaad is brought upon the stage for but a very short
                    time, and is then dismissed in a blaze of saintly glory, while Perceval,
                    although adapted from the French writer’s purer knight of that name, is allowed
                    a much larger space upon the canvas, at the cost of a few minor sins which
                    suffice to ensure his failure and to prove him a man. The other knights are
                    brave, generous, self-sacrificing, and devout, but the indispensable virtue of
                    chastity is absent from their lives, and they are foredoomed to misfortune. The
                    perfect ideal, however, underlies the description of all their acts and motives,
                    and the reader or hearer was never allowed to forget it amid the more powerful
                    attractions of the story.</p>
                <p>The real prototype of the chivalric romance was the ancient epic: the Greek and
                    Latin poems upon the winning of the Golden Fleece, the siege of Troy, the
                    wanderings of Ulysses and of Aeneas, furnish the truest parallel to the
                    mediaeval romances of knighthood. The tales which are usually dignified with the
                    name of “classical romances” have really no claim to that rank; they were
                    produced in the age of decadence and correspond much more closely to the
                    mediaeval <hi rend="italic">fabliau</hi> and the 17th-century novel than to the
                    romance proper. As a matter of course every nation had its legends and popular
                    tales, co-existent with literary works of greater importance; but the Greeks at
                    least, and the Romans following their example, never condescended during their
                    ages of intellectual vigour to put such figments into written form, so that even
                    the famous Milesian tales are now quite lost. It was not until the Greeks became
                    a widely dispersed, a subject and deteriorated race, and not till the strength
                    and manhood of Rome were buried in the slough of imperial corruption, that
                    sophists and rhetoricians began to construct those artificial tales which we
                    call Greek and Latin romances. They form, however, an epoch, as the earliest
                    prose works of imagination in a European language, and cannot therefore remain
                    unnoticed here. They were succeeded in time by Christian narratives, usually
                    woven into the lives of saints or used as illustrations in the sermons of great
                    preachers; these latter formed a transition to the semireligious story of the
                    Grail, a bowl or goblet confounded with the chalice used at the Last Supper,
                    with the cup used to collect the precious blood of our Lord, and symbolically
                    with the Holy Sepulchre itself. The achievers of the Grail-quest, or kings of
                    the Grail, were typified in the Knights Templars and the Knights of St John;
                    thus the true school of romance arose in intimate connexion with the changes in
                    European life and manners which were brought about by the crusades.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">chansons de geste,</hi> which constituted a poetical
                    introduction to the romances of chivalry in France, were followed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">fabliaux,</hi> metrical novelettes which furnished material to the
                    Italian writers of prose tales in the 14th and 15th centuries,—a form of
                    composition which was not acclimatized elsewhere than in Italy till the 16th
                    century, and which then became the remote prototype of the modern novel. The
                    older and nobler knighthood blossomed in France for the last time in Bayard, in
                    England in Sir Philip Sidney; but the genuine literature of chivalric romance
                    may be said to have come to an end with the l5th century. The knightly romances
                    produced in the 16 th century were belated and artificial examples of their
                    class; and, although the effects of the conquest of Granada and the discovery of
                    America did not wholly put an end to the lingering romantic spirit in Spain, it
                    hardly survived them for half a century. Hence the inferior character of most of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ubros de caballerias,</hi> which chiefly date from the
                    l6th century. Out of them grew the fictions known as 16th and 17th century
                    romance in Spain, France, and England,—monstrous and uninviting examples of
                    perverted ingenuity, utterly dissonant from the literature of pure romance as we
                    conceive it in the chivalrous fictions of the l2th, 13th, and l4th centuries. A
                    more practical and utilitarian spirit set in with the latter half of the 17th
                    century, in which readers found themselves out of sympathy with the imaginative
                    and mysterious atmosphere of romance. Accordingly the modern novel arose, a form
                    of composition in which the manners and customs of everyday life were more or
                    less faithfully depicted, and which has remained in undiminished popularity to
                    the present time.</p>
                <p>The subject will be dealt with in the following order :— I. Greek and Latin
                    romance, under the subdivisions—(a) classical and post-classical prose fictions
                    and (δ) pseudo-classical works. II. Mediaeval romance, embracing—(a) the
                    Arthurian cycle, (δ) the Charlemagne cycle, (c) the Spanish cycle, (&lt;7)
                    Teutonic and Anglo - Danish, and (e) unaffiliated. III. Modern romance to the

                <p>I.—Greek and Latin Romance.</p>
                <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Classical and Post-Classical Prose Fictions.</hi></p>
                <p>Although the distance in manner is immense between the Ass of Lucian and the
                    Awz&lt;A⅛ <hi rend="italic">de Gaula,</hi> and again between the latter and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ivanhoe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Eugenie Grandet,</hi> there are
                    few varieties of modern fiction which are not faintly shadowed forth in the
                    literatures of Greece and Rome (including in this denomination the
                    post-classical periods of Italy and Byzantium): fables and tales, historical,
                    philosophical, and religious novels, love-stories and narratives of adventure,
                    marvellous voyages, collections of fictitious letters—all forms are represented.
                    As even the Andaman Islander and the Bushman have their stories, it is
                    reasonable to suppose that the Greek, who attained a high state of civilization
                    at an extremely remote period, had long been familiar with this method of
                    intellectual gratification. Artistic form was first given to the higher class of
                    such narrations by the Ionians of the Asiatic colonies, when they sang the deeds
                    of gods and heroes in epic poetry and put together the story of Troy now current
                    under the name of Homer. F rom the Attic Greeks belonging to the same stock came
                    the drama in its highest development,—a fresh step in the representation of
                    events in oral shape. Greek romance is a double misnomer. First, the word
                    “romance” is wrongly applied to the tales we shall shortly discuss; and
                    secondly, we have no right to call anything in art or literature Greek unless it
                    w¾s produced before the time of Alexander the Great, either in Hellas or Ionia
                    or Sicily, or, say, between 800 and 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> After the
                    defeat of the Greeks at Chaeronea, Macedonia became the ruling centre, and the
                    free political life of the Greek cities passed away. The conquests of Alexander,
                    a Graeco-Albanian monarch, spread Greek civilization throughout the known world,
                    but crushed Greece proper out of existence. This civilization (see Greece, vol.
                    xi. p. 136 sg.), influencing peoples foreign to the Greek race, is designated
                    Hellenistic as opposed to the Hellenic, and the chief note of Hellenistic
                    literature is that of imitation. The original springs of Hellenic poetry were
                    dried up, and from the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the newly <pb

                    expressed their fancies in novels rather than in epics.</p>
                <p>When, about the lst century of the Christian era, verse gave place in general
                    favour to rhetorical prose the greater ease of the style lent itself to more
                    detailed narratives than the eclogue and love-poem; and the sophist who might
                    formerly have devoted his attention to poetry became in the decadence of Greek
                    literature a writer of novels. From this period to the 10th century were
                    published the works it is now proposed to analyse. The Greek novel being a late,
                    and it must be confessed an inferior, kind of prose, it would be well if one
                    could trace its rise, progress, and development. This is, however, impossible
                    here; it is sufficient to refer in passing to the fables of primitive invention,
                    the tales inserted by historians, the <hi rend="italic">Atlantis</hi> of Plato,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cyropaedia</hi> of Xenophon, the forged histories of
                    Alexander, the fictitious lives of eminent men, the fabulous voyages, <note

                    Diodorus Siculus (ii. 55-60) of the <hi rend="italic">Fortunate Island</hi> of
                    Iambulus we are led to believe that the writer, who lived before the 1st

                    imaginary voyages. </p></note> and the apocryphal sacred books of Christians and
                    Jews, as supplying in turn material for building up the highly artificial novel
                    which we find first represented by Iamblichus. One element may, however, be
                    spoken of specially, although it is rather a forerunner of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tale</hi> as distinct from the <hi rend="italic">novel</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">romance.</hi> The Ionic Greeks, living under an Asiatic sky and
                    corrupted by Oriental luxury, were the first to cultivate to any extent that
                    kind of literature which, without demanding any intellectual labour, tickles the
                    fancy by voluptuous pictures told in a brief and witty manner. Miletus was
                    especially famous for such tales; hence they were usually known as Milesian
                    (Μιλψτιακά). What was their exact shape it is difficult to say, as they have
                    entirely perished, leaving only the reputation of the universal favour they
                    enjoyed. Perhaps the story of the Ephesian matron told by Petronius in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Satirae,</hi> and (though less likely) that of Cupid and Psyche in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Asinus</hi> of Apuleius, are more closely allied to them
                    than anything we now possess. They must be considered as a natural growth of the
                    imagination, although some may have been contributed by Orientals or Egyptians;
                    and, while forming a portion of the materials upon which the later Hellenistic
                    novel was constructed, they differed widely from it in form and matter. Ovid
                    cannot be considered as a person easily shocked, yet in two passages of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tristia</hi> he says—</p>
                <p>“Junxit Aristides Milesia crimina secum” <hi rend="italic">(Trust.,</hi> ii.
                    413).</p>
                <p>“Vertit Aristiden Sisenna, nec obfuit illi</p>
                <p>Historiae turpes inseruisse joeos <hi rend="italic">” (ib.,</hi> 443-444).</p>
                <p>Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Crassus,</hi> 32) refers to the fact of a copy of
                    this very translation by L. Cornelius Sisenna (a contemporary of Sulla) having
                    been found in the baggage of a Roman officer, which gave occasion for Surenas to
                    animadvert upon the Romans carrying with them infamous books during war time.
                    This testimony gives sufficient indication of the nature of the Milesian tales.
                    They must have been short and witty anecdotes, turning chiefly upon the subject
                    of love in its grosser form, and may be regarded as the prototypes of the
                    Italian n <hi rend="italic">ovelle</hi> and the Provençal and French <hi
                    rend="italic">fabliaux.</hi> All that remains to us consists of the names of a
                    few writers and some imitations and translations. The best-known writer whose
                    fame has reached us is Aristides of Miletus, though we are ignorant of his life
                    and even of the age in which he lived. A more recent author of the same class
                    was Clodius Albinus, the rival of Septimius Severus. We also hear of Ephesian,
                    Cyprian, and Sybaritic tales, the last almost as famous as those of Miletus.
                    Aristophanes (as well as Ovid) specially refers to them. Yet after all they
                    exercised but little influence upon the Hellenistic novel beyond perhaps
                    furnishing the more indecent incidents. The lost ’Ερωτικά of Clearchus of Soli,
                    a pupil of Aristotle, may have been more closely connected with that branch of
                    our subject. The love-stories (∏∈pι cpωτικωv <hi rend="italic">παθημάτων')</hi>
                    of Parthenius of Nicaea are also different. They consist of thirty-six brief
                    tales ending in an unfortunate manner, and were dedicated to Cornelius Gallus as
                    forming subjects for poetical treatment. The author carefully indicates the
                    sources whence he took them, thus giving a special value to his collection. He
                    informs us that some were derived from “the Milesian adventures” of Hegesippus,
                    and also mentions Naxian, Pallenian, Lydian, Trojan, and Bithynian tales. Like
                    Parthenius, Conon was of the Augustan age, and compiled a collection of fifty
                    narratives (∆ι^γψr∈ιs) of heroic times, relating chiefly to the foundation of
                    colonies. They are analysed by Photius. Cervantes has used one of them in <hi

                <p>The first we hear of the Greek or Hellenistic novel is in the time of Trajan (c.
                    110), when Iamblichus, a Syrian by descent and a freeman, born and educated at
                    Babylon, wrote in Greek his <hi rend="italic">Babylonixa,</hi> which is known
                    from Suidas, Photius, and a scholium discovered by Henry Estienne on an ancient
                    MS. of the latter writer. A complete codex existed in 1671; and a considerable
                    fragment has been reprinted by Mai (A <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ora <hi
                    rend="italic">Coll. Script. Vet.,</hi> ii. 349, &lt;fcc.). Suidas states that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Babyloηixa</hi> consisted of thirty-nine books, but
                    Photius, who gives a full abstract <hi rend="italic">(^Bibliotheca,</hi> cod.
                    94), only mentions seventeen. The story is that of Sinonis and Rhodanes, married
                    lovers, persecuted by Garmus, king of Babylon, who is fascinated by Sinonis.
                    They fly, and are pursued by the royal eunuchs, who give them no peace through
                    many adventurous scenes. A remarkable resemblance between the fugitives and
                    another couple, Euphrates and Mesopotamia, is the chief subject of the plot. We
                    now meet, incorporated in the works of writers whose dignity might be supposed
                    above the suspicion of story-telling, short tales of a didactic nature, such as
                    those given by Plutarch under the title “On the Virtues of Women.” Dion
                    Chrysostom, the most eminent of the rhetoricians and sophists, has also left
                    among his orations a short novel called <hi rend="italic">The Hunter.</hi> The
                    narrator is supposed to have been wrecked on the shores of Euboea and meets a
                    hunter who tells him his history. Two married couples (the hunter and his wife
                    being one) were living in friendly solitude, when one day a stranger came, and
                    asking for money received all the recluses were able to give in the shape of two
                    deerskins. The hunter goes to the city with the traveller, and his first
                    impressions are happily told. He is frightened by the bustle and excitement, and
                    debates with an idler upon the comparative advantages of town and country life.
                    The return home is very delicately drawn. Lucian of Samosata, one of the chief
                    essay-writers of the post-Christian age, has left two romances, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucius or the</hi> Ass and the <hi rend="italic">True
                    History,</hi> both of which have beeil briefly analysed in the article Lucian
                    (vol. xv. p. 43). The former was considered by Photius (cod. 129) to have been
                    taken from a fable by Lucius of Patrae and to have thus had a common origin with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Asinus</hi> of Apuleius; others consider Lucian himself to
                    have been the original inventor of the story. The <hi rend="italic">True
                    History</hi> has been drawn on by Rabelais, Cyrano de Bergerac, Swift, and the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Baron Munchausen.</hi> Like the productions of more
                    modern satirists, it loses much of its point and meaning when the allusions upon
                    which the chief interest is based can no longer be understood. Rather of the
                    nature of the fictitious voyage was <hi rend="italic">The Wonders beyond
                    Thule</hi> of Antonius Diogenes, only known from the account given by

                <p>(cod. 166), who was of opinion that he belonged to a remote age, shortly after
                    Alexander, and that he served as model to all subsequent writers of romance,
                    including Lucius. A preliminary letter to a friend, Faustinus, indicates by the
                    Latin name a much later origin. The heroes visit the Celts and the Aquitanians,
                    both unknown to the Greeks at an early period. Certain paragraphs of the life of
                    Pythagoras by Iamblichus are nearly identical with passages in Diogenes, who in
                    his turn has similar correspondence with parts of Nicomachus Gerasenus, who
                    lived under Tiberius. The natural inference is that all three writers copied
                    from the same source. Modern authorities place Diogenes at the beginning of the
                    3d century. The recitals of their travels given by the Arcadian Dinias, the
                    Phoenician Dercyllis, and her brother Mantinias are such as would be imagined by
                    persons who had never left their native hamlet. The itinerary of the routes
                    followed by the different personages is extremely confused. By Thule the writer
                    probably understood Iceland or Norway, deriving his information from
                    Pytheas.</p>
                <p>The Latin <hi rend="italic">Apollonius of Tyre</hi> is undoubtedly derived from a
                    lost Greek original, and therefore claims a place here, as representing one of
                    the earliest love-stories we can assign to that literature. It may date from the
                    3d or 4th century, and was perhaps translated into Latin verse in the 5th
                    century. What we now possess (beyond the Anglo-Saxon version mentioned below) is
                    a second Latin prose translation made in the l2th or 13th century. The first
                    mention of the work is in a list of books belonging to Wando, abbot of
                    Fontanelle (742), in the diocese of Rouen. The story runs that Antiochus, king
                    of Syria, entertaining an undue affection for his daughter Tarsia, keeps oft'
                    suitors by an unsolvable riddle. But Apollonius, king of Tyre, discovers the
                    answer, is obliged to fly, and (as well as Tarsia) undergoes many trials from
                    pirates and other persecutors. An abridgment is included in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesta Romanorum.</hi> An ancient Anglo-Saxon translation was
                    printed by Thorpe in 1834. Gower derived his adaptation in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessio Amantis</hi> (bk. viii.) from the rhymed redaction of Godfrey of
                    Viterbo (1185). This formed the foundation of Shakespeare’s Pericles (1609). The
                    earliest English version (1510) is made from the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >Appoldyn, Roy de Thire.</hi></p>
                <p>The author of the <hi rend="italic">Cyropaedia</hi> has already been alluded to.
                    Suidas mentions other writers of fictions of the name of Xenophon,—a native of
                    Antioch, who wrote <hi rend="italic">Babyloηica</hi> like Iamblichus; a native
                    of Cyprus, who composed a similar book under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cypτiaca ’ ,</hi> and Xenophon of Ephesus, of whom alone we possess anything.
                    This last is the author of the romance <hi rend="italic">Ephesiaca, or the Loves
                    of Anthia and Abrocomas,</hi> of which the Monte Cassino MS. (first published in
                    1726) is the only one extant. His age is unknown: by Locella, one of his
                    editors, he is placed in the time of the Antonines; Peerlkamp, another editor,
                    considers him to be the oldest of the romancers writing in Greek, and that
                    similar writers imitate him closely. Some go so far as to regard him as an
                    imitator of Achilles Tatius and of Heliodorus, and bring him down to the 5th or
                    6th century. The story runs that Anthia and Abrocomas are married, and, being
                    forbidden by an oracle to travel, of course do so, and are captured by pirates,
                    who take them to Tyre, where Manto, daughter of the chief, falls in love with
                    Abrocomas. Repelled by him, she marries Mceris and accuses Abrocomas of an
                    attempt to violate her. Mceris in his turn pays improper attentions to Anthia.
                    The great beauty of the hero and heroine causes them many trials at the hands of
                    pirates, brigands, and other stock ornaments of the Greek novel. The local names
                    of the tales of Iamblichus and Xenophon were probably suggested by the Mιλψrιακα
                    collected by the earlier writers Dionysius and</p>
                <p>Aristides of Miletus. This is the weakest of the class we have under review; its
                    only merit lies in a simple and natural style. By far the best of the romances
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Aethiopica</hi> of Heliodorus of Emesa (g <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> .v.). From its first appearance and throughout the
                    whole Byzantine period this work enjoyed a reputation which it has not entirely
                    lost. Within recent times three Frenchmen of mark have praised it,—Amyot, who
                    translated it; Racine, with whom it was a favourite; and Boileau, who compared
                    it with the <hi rend="italic">Telemaque</hi> of Fénelon. It influenced
                    considerably the French romance-writers of the 17 th century, D’Urfé,
                    Gomberville, and Mademoiselle de Scudéry. The dénoûment is imitated in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pastor Fido</hi> of Guarini; Tasso drew from it the early life of
                    Clorinda in <hi rend="italic">Geru-salemme Liberata</hi>; and Raphael painted
                    scenes from it. It was first brought to light in modern times in a MS. from the
                    library of Matthias Corvinus, found at the sack of Buda (Ofen) in 1526, and
                    printed at Basel in 1534. Other codices have since been discovered. The title is
                    taken from the fact that the action of the beginning and end of the story takes
                    place in Aethiopia. The daughter of Persine, wife of Hydaspes, king of
                    Aethiopia, was born white through the effect of the sight of a marble statue
                    upon the queen during pregnancy. Fearing an accusation of adultery, the mother
                    gives the babe to the care of Sisi-mithras, a gymnosophist, who carries her to
                    Egypt and places her in charge of Charicles, a Pythian priest. The child is
                    taken to Delphi, and made a priestess of Apollo under the name of Chariclea.
                    Theagenes, a noble Thessalian, comes to Delphi and the two fall in love with
                    each other. He carries off the priestess with the help of Calasiris, an
                    Egyptian, employed by Persine to seek for her daughter. Then follow many perils
                    from sea-rovers and others, but the chief personages ultimately meet at Meroe at
                    the very moment when Chariclea is about to be sacrificed to the gods by her own
                    father. Her birth is made known, and the lovers are happily married. The rapid
                    succession of events, the variety of the characters, the graphic descriptions of
                    manners and of natural scenery, the simplicity and elegance of the style, give
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aethiopica</hi> great charm. Its chaste tone compares
                    favourably with many of the other works of the same class.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most widely known is the delightful pastoral of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Daphnis and Chloe</hi> (or Λεσβιακά), generally attributed to Longus, a Greek
                    sophist, who is supposed to have lived in the 4th or the early part of the 5th
                    century. Longus shows traces of an imitation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aethiopica</hi> of Heliodorus, with whom he may be placed in the first rank of
                    such writers. His work formed the model of the <hi rend="italic">Sireiηe</hi> of
                    Honoré d’Urfé, the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> of Montemayor, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aminta</hi> of Tasso, and the <hi rend="italic">Gentle
                    Shepherd</hi> of Allan Ramsay, and has been translated into every European
                    language. The translation of Amyot, afterwards revised by P. L. Courier, has
                    made it extremely popular in France, where the subject has frequently been made
                    use of by Gérard and other painters. The celebrated <hi rend="italic">Paul et
                    Virginie</hi> is an echo of the same story. Daphnis and Chipe, two children
                    found by shepherds, grow up together, nourishing a mutual love which neither
                    suspects. The development of this simple passion forms the chief interest, and
                    there are few incidents. Chloe is carried off by the inevitable pirate, and
                    ultimately regains her family. A few rivals alarm the peace of mind of Daphnis;
                    but the two lovers are recognized by their parents, and return to a married and
                    happy life in the country. The picture of rural felicity and the innocent
                    affection of the children make the charm of a book which comes nearer perhaps in
                    spirit to the modern novel than any other of its class. Unfortunately there are
                    details here and there which shock modern ideas of decent propriety. Achilles

                    upon the model of Heliodorus; though an ingenious story, it does not reach the
                    standard of the work it imitates. Like his predecessor, Achilles uses the
                    marvellous with discretion, but the accumulation of difficulties is very
                    tedious. Leucippe and Cleitophon fall in love and fly to escape parental anger.
                    They suffer shipwreck, are seized by brigands, and separated. Cleitophon first
                    believes that Leucippe is dead, then finds her, to lose her once more, and again
                    to meet her, a slave, at the very time he is going to marry her mistress,
                    Melitta, a rich Ephesian widow. It so happens that the husband of the latter is
                    not dead but returns to persecute with his love and jealousy both Leucippe and
                    Cleitophon. The descriptions are the best part, the incidents being either
                    tiresome or repulsive and the character of the hero pitiable. Most of the book
                    is written with taste and judgment, but the digressions are too frequent.</p>
                <p>Achiljes Tatius is the last of these authors who can be said to have the
                    slightest merit. Of the romances which followed his one of the least bad is
                    perhaps <hi rend="italic">Chaereas and Callirhoe,</hi> by one who called himself
                    Chariton of Aphro-disias, placed by various authorities between the 5th and the
                    9th century. Here the two lovers are already married, and as usual are of
                    superhuman beauty. Unfortunately Chaereas possesses a somewhat irritable temper,
                    and on a jealous suspicion gives his lovely wife a terrible kick in the stomach.
                    She is considered dead and is carried to her grave. But during the night
                    brigands carry her away to Ionia, where her purchaser, Dionysius, falls in love
                    with her. The wife remains faithful to her husband, but, as she is <hi
                    rend="italic">enceinte,</hi> consents to marry Dionysius in order that her child
                    may have a father. Meanwhile Chaereas, having learned the ravishment of the
                    supposed corpse, starts in pursuit of his wife. He also is captured by pirates
                    and taken to Caria. The two finally come together, when Callirhoe forsakes
                    Dionysius and her son and returns to Sicily with her first husband.</p>

                    the l2th century, but who may have lived six hundred years earlier. Only a few
                    more remain to be mentioned. Philip of Amphipolis wrote 'Poδtακα (specially

                    Severus of Alexandria, a man of fortune with a large library, living in the
                    latter part of the 5th century, has left a few short stories after the style of
                    Parthenius. Photius (cod. 130) also preserves the titles of some works by a
                    certain Damascius, such as <hi rend="italic">Incredible Fictions, Tales of
                    Demons, Marvellous Stories of Appearances from the Dead,</hi> &amp;c. The same
                    authority tells us (cod. 188) of a writer of the name of Alexander who compiled
                    a book of marvels. The credit of having written the worst of the Greek romances
                    may be claimed either by Theodoras Prodromus, a monk of the early part of the
                    l2th century, for his metrical history, in nine books, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhod-αnthe and Dosixles,</hi> or by Nicetas Eugenianus, who lived somewhat

                    development of the story by St John of Damascus, which belongs rather to
                    religious apologues than to romances. Its origin is entirely Eastern, from
                    India. The early Christians eagerly seized upon fiction as affording them a
                    vehicle for spreading their views.</p>
                <p>Their contributions to our subject have a strong family likeness, and usually
                    either close with a martyrdom or are written in praise of a monastic life. To
                    the former class belong the <hi rend="italic">Clementine Recognitions</hi> (2d

                    rend="italic">Cyprian and Justina,</hi> which contains the germs of the episode
                    of Faust and Gretchen. The ascetic novels include <hi rend="italic">Xenophon and
                    his Sons, Euphrosyne, Zosimus and Mary, Thais,</hi> Ac. Christian imaginary
                    travels are represented by the <hi rend="italic">Voyage of Macarius to

                    rend="italic">Chioηia.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the forged letters attributed to men of mark, we have from the Greek
                    sophists collections of fictitious letters serving the same purpose as the
                    epistolary novels of Rousseau and Richardson. The best known of those writers
                    were Alciphron, Aristaenetus, and Theophylactus Simocatta. Alciphron, the most
                    eminent, of whom we possess 116 <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> in three books,
                    lived in the 3d or 4th century. Many of the letters are written by courtezans
                    and supply curious information on contemporary life and manners. The fifty <hi
                    rend="italic">Erotic Epistles</hi> of Aristaenetus form a much less entertaining
                    series than those of Alciphron. Theophylactus Simocatta, an Egyptian by birth,
                    died at Constantinople about the year 640. He wrote eighty-five <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters,</hi> divided into moral, rustic, and amatory. They are
                    little else than brief moral treatises mingled with stories.</p>
                <p>The review of the <hi rend="italic">origines</hi> of the Greek novel shows that
                    it arose with the decay of old Greek literature and carried on a feeble
                    existence down to the 12th century. Two facts make themselves apparent. First,
                    the romance (or novel) proper came late into the field, where it remained in a
                    secondary place; and secondly, it invariably turned upon a hackneyed circle of
                    incidents and never attained anything of the highly artistic development reached
                    by modern examples. The sameness observable in Greek romance arises from the
                    fact that it was the product of literary decrepitude and impotence. The writers
                    were incapable of rivalling the glories of the old Hellenic literature, and they
                    endeavoured to supply originality with reminiscences more or less disguised. The
                    literary and social surroundings in which these authors passed their lives gave
                    them few fresh subjects for investigation, and the characters they describe are
                    mere names. Human nature and the human heart have little meaning for them; but,
                    as with the Western writers of fiction who closely follow them in point of date,
                    incident is crowded upon incident to the verge of satiety, in order that the
                    attention of the reader may never flag.</p>
                <p>The contributions of Roman literature are limited to productions by two writers,
                    Petronius and Apuleius and one story by Martianus Capella, of more recent date
                    and less typical nature. In the comic romance of Petronius Arbiter <hi
                    rend="italic">{g.v.'),</hi> the tale of the matron of Ephesus first appears
                    among Western popular fictions. This was undoubtedly one of the Ephesian tales
                    already referred to. We find it reproduced in the <hi rend="italic">Seven Wise
                    Masters,</hi> in the French <hi rend="italic">fabliaux,</hi> and in Brantôme. It
                    is also to be found in the Chinese. The opening words of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Golden Ass</hi> of Apuleius indicate that his romance and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ass</hi> of Lucian were both inspired from the same source, perhaps through the
                    medium of Lucius of Patrae mentioned by Photius. Lucian seems to have reproduced
                    the story in a condensed form; the Latin writer paraphrased and embellished it
                    with other tales, among which the best known is that of Cupid and Psyche,—an
                    antique gem in an unworthy setting. The hero, punished for his curiosity by
                    being turned into an ass, passes through adventures similar in kind to those
                    depicted in the Greek romance. The story ends with a fine description of the
                    mysteries of Isis, into which the hero is initiated and through <pb break="no"

                    the cyclopaedia of the 5th century, the <hi rend="italic">Satyrica</hi> of
                    Martianus Capella, known as <hi rend="italic">De Nuptiis Philologiae et
                    Mercurvi,</hi> form a kind of philosophico-allegorical romance in prose mingled
                    with verse. Mercury, wishing to marry, goes, accompanied by Virtue, to Apollo on
                    Parnassus and finds him occupied in taking from four urns the elements of all
                    things. Apollo proposes that Mercury should marry Philology, but the consent of
                    Jupiter must be asked. Jove hesitates and assembles a council of the gods to
                    decide the question. The request is granted and Philosophy transcribes a decree
                    permitting mortals of superior merit to be admitted among the gods. The second
                    book is devoted to the marriage. At first Philology has fears as to its
                    advisability, and the Muses form a chorus by whom she is admonished. She is
                    visited by Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and the three Graces. At last the
                    bride goes to Mercury’s house and all set out for the palace of Jupiter, who
                    receives them surrounded by the gods and many deified mortals.</p>
                <p>Of these three works the last does not comply with all our conditions, and of the
                    first two Apuleius is after all merely a translator. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satirae</hi> of Petronius is thus the sole genuine representative of Latin
                    prose romance. When compared with the Greek compositions it will be found to
                    offer a remarkable variation. In the <hi rend="italic">Satirae</hi> we at once
                    come in contact with contemporary scenery and habits; the characters have
                    well-marked individuality; and the book is full of life. It must not, however,
                    be considered merely as a novel; its chief object was to satirize the manners of
                    the time. The same tendency to draw a strongly marked picture of the vices and
                    follies of the hour appears also in the <hi rend="italic">A sinus.</hi> In the
                    qualities of vigour, interest, and originality of form and substance Apuleius
                    and Petronius are far beyond their Greek rivals.</p>

                <p>The literature of the Middle Ages recognized three great epic cycles, distinctly
                    defined by Jean Bodel (13th century) in his <hi rend="italic">Chanson des
                    Saisnes (i.e.,</hi> Saxons):</p>
                <p>“Ne sont que troi materes, a nul homme entendant—</p>
                <p>De France, de Bretaigne, et de Rome la Grant;</p>
                <p>Et de ces troi materes n’i a nule semblant.”</p>
                <p>Under “Rome la Grant” were comprehended the stories of Troy and the Trojans,
                    Aeneas, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Judas Maccabaeus, &lt;fcc., from
                    Latin sources, —that is to say, the whole ancient world seen through the
                    language of Rome.</p>
                <p>The romances derived from antiquity may be arranged in three classes—(1) those
                    which were believed to be direct reproductions, such as <hi rend="italic">Eneas,
                    Thebes, Cesar,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Roman de Troie,</hi> whose authors
                    acknowledged indebtedness, after their fashion, to Virgil, Statius, Dares
                    Phrygius, Dictys Cretensis, &amp;c.; (2) those based upon ancient histories not
                    previously versified,—for example, the legend of Alexander from Quintus Curtius
                    and the Pseudo-Cal-listhenes; (3) those which merely reproduce the names of
                    antiquity and nothing else, such as <hi rend="italic">Athis et Profilias,
                    Ypomêdon,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Protesilaus.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The chief of the first class was the <hi rend="italic">Roman de Troie,</hi>
                    which exercised greater influence in its day and for centuries after its
                    appearance than any other work of the same order. Just as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chansons de geste</hi> of the lθth century were the direct ancestors of the
                    prose romances which afterwards spread throughout Europe, so, even before the
                    novels of Heliodorus and Achilles Tatius, there were quasi-histories which
                    reproduced in prose, with more or less exactness, the narratives of epic poetry.
                    Among these nothing has ever equalled in vitality the tale of the two sieges and
                    capture of Troy, and the subsequent destinies of the Trojan and Greek heroes.
                    “It would require a large volume,” says Grote <hi rend="italic">(History ofi
                    Greece, fit.</hi> p. 386), “to convey any tolerable idea of the vast extent and
                    expansion of this interesting fable, first handled by so many poets, epic,
                    lyric, and tragic, with their endless additions, transformations, and
                    contradictions, then purged and recast by historical inquirers, who, under
                    colour of setting aside the exaggeration of the poets, introduced a new vein of
                    prosaic invention.” Long previous to the Ηpωικos of Philostratus (2d century)
                    the Trojan War had been the subject of many a prose fiction dignified with the
                    title of history; but to remodel the whole story almost in the shape of annals,
                    and to give a minute personal description of the persons and characters of the
                    principal actors, were ideas which belonged to an artificial stage of
                    literature. This task was commenced by Philostkatus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cpvfi,</hi> whose Ηpωικos bears ample traces of having been compiled from a
                    number of current figments. Philostratus, however, only pictures several
                    characters and a few isolated scenes. His method was subsequently followed in a
                    more complete fashion by two anonymous writers, who either borrowed from him or
                    from a more ancient source common to all three. A spurious history, professing
                    to give the chief incidents of the siege, and said to have been written by
                    Dictys of Crete, a follower of Idomeneus, was known as early as the time of
                    Aelian, and has been largely quoted by the Byzantine chroniclers. This was
                    translated into Latin prose at an early period under the title of <hi

                    always associated Dares, a pseudo-historian of more recent date. Old Greek

                    Hephaestus at Troy, was believed to exist. Nothing has since been heard of it;
                    but an unknown Latin writer living between 400 and 600 took advantage of the
                    tradition to compile what he styled <hi rend="italic">Daretis Phrygii de Excidio
                    Trojae Histoma.</hi> It is in prose, and professes to be translated from an old
                    Greek manuscript. Of the two works that of Dares is the later, and is inferior
                    to Dictys. The matter-of-fact form of narration recalls the poem of Quintus
                    Smyrnaeus. Both compilations lack literary merit; the gods and everything
                    supernatural are suppressed; even the heroes are degraded. The long success,
                    however, of the two works distinguishes them above all apocryphal writings, and
                    they occupy an important position in literary history on account of the impetus
                    they gave to the diffusion of the Troy legend throughout western Europe. The
                    Byzantine writers from the 7th to the 12th century exalted Dictys as a
                    first-class authority, with whom Homer was only to be contrasted as an inventor
                    of fables. Western people preferred Dares, because his history was shorter, and
                    because, favouring the Trojans, he flattered the vanity of those who believed
                    that people to have been their ancestors. Many MSS. of both writers were
                    contained in old libraries; and they were translated into nearly every language
                    and turned into verse. In 1272 a monk of Corbie translated “sans rime <hi
                    rend="italic">L'Estoire de Troiens et de Troie</hi> [de Dares] du Latin en
                    Roumans mot à, mot” because the <hi rend="italic">Roman de Troie</hi> (to be
                    mentioned lower down) was too long. Geoffrey of Waterford put Dares into French
                    prose; and the British Museum possesses three Welsh MS. translations of the same
                    author,—works indeed of a much later period.</p>
                <p>We know that the taste for Greek letters was never entirely lost in western
                    Europe. Eginhard tells how Charlemagne understood Greek and how he encouraged
                    the study. Alcuin states, with pardonable pride, that the library at York
                    contained “Graecia vel quidquid trans-misit clara Latinis,” which may, however,
                    simply refer to Latin translations. Under any circumstances, however, this
                    knowledge must have been confined to a few. It was through Latin that the Middle
                    Ages knew the ancient world, and in that language read the Pseudo-Dares and
                    Dictys, the <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> of Aesop, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> of Homer. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The name of Homer never ceased to be held in honour; but he is invariably
                    placed in company with the Latin poets. Few of those who praised him had read
                    him except in the Latin redaction in 1100 verses which passed under the name of
                    Pindar. It supplied the chief incidents of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> with
                    tolerable exactness and was taught in schools. </p></note> Through these
                    translations came many of the traces of Greek literature which occur in the
                    fabliaux and romances. How numerous these traces were in the Arthurian cycle
                    will be pointed out. The tale of the Dog of Montargis, familiar to readers of
                    <hi rend="italic">Milles et Amys</hi> (Carolingian cycle), is derived from
                    Plutarch. Cerberus may be found in the <hi rend="italic">Chanson
                    d'Antioche</hi>; the story of Tarquin in the <hi rend="italic">chanson de geste
                    Moniage Guillaume</hi>; the judgment of Paris in <hi rend="italic">Foulkes de
                    Candie</hi>; and Cupid and Psyche in the romance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parten-opex of Blois.</hi></p>
                <p>For a thousand years the myth of descent from the dispersed heroes of the
                    conquered Trojan race was a sacred literary tradition throughout western Europe,
                    of which a possible survival still remains in the popular phrase which speaks of
                    a generous and courageous fellow as a Trojan. The classical traditions of
                    extensive colonization subsequent to the Trojan War were adopted by Western
                    nations at a very early date. The first Franco-Latin chroniclers considered it a
                    patriotic duty to trace their history to the same origin as that of Rome, as
                    told by the Latin poets of the Augustan era; and in the middle of the 7th
                    century Fredegarius Scholasticus <hi rend="italic">(Rer. Gall. Script.,</hi> ii.
                    461) relates how one party of the Trojans settled between the Rhine, the Danube,
                    and the sea. In a charter of Dagobert occurs the statement, “ex nobilissimo et
                    antiquo Trojanorum reliquiarum sanguine nati.” The fact is repeated by
                    chroniclers and panegyrical writers, who also considered the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Troy</hi> by Dares to be the first of national books. Succeeding
                    kings imitated their predecessors in giving official sanction to their legendary
                    origin: Charles the Bald, in a charter, uses almost the same words as
                    Dagobert—“ex praeclaro et antiquo Trojanorum sanguine nati.” In England a
                    similar tradition had been early formulated, as appears from the Pseudo-Nennius
                    (put together between the 7th and 9th centuries) and Geoffrey of Monmouth. Otto
                    Frisingensis (12th century) and other German chroniclers repeat the myth, and
                    the apocryphal hypothesis is echoed in Scandinavian sagas.</p>
                <p>In the llth century the tale of Troy became the theme of Neo-Latin verse. About
                    1050 a monk named Bernard wrote <hi rend="italic">De Excidio Trojae,</hi> and in
                    the middle of the 12th century Simon Chèvre d’Or followed with another poem on
                    the fall of the city and the adventures of Aeneas, blending the Homeric and
                    Virgilian records. We now come to a work on the same subject in a modern
                    language, which in its own day and for centuries afterwards exercised an
                    extraordinary influence throughout Europe. Benoît de Sainte-More, the
                    Anglo-Norman trouvère who wrote in verse <hi rend="italic">Chroniques des Dues
                    de Normandie,</hi> composed in England, under the eyes of Henry IL, about the
                    year 1184 a poem in 30,000 lines entitled <hi rend="italic">Roman de Troie.</hi>
                    It forms a true Trojan cycle and embraces the entire heroic history of Hellas.
                    The introduction relates the story of the Argonauts, and the last 2680 verses
                    are devoted to the return of the Greek chiefs and the wanderings of Ulysses.
                    With no fear of chronological discrepancy before his eyes, Benoît reproduces the
                    manners of his own times, and builds up a complete museum of the 12th
                    century,—its arts, costumes, manufactures, architecture, arms, and even
                    religious terms. Women are repeatedly introduced in unwarranted situations; they
                    are spectators of all combats. The idea of personal beauty is different from
                    that of the old Greeks; by Benoît good-humour, as well as health and strength,
                    is held to be one of its chief characteristics. The love-pictures are another
                    addition of the modern writer. We find traces of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi> of Homer and the trilogy of Aeschylus <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Middle Ages had their Latin Oresteia, see
                    <hi rend="italic">Οrestis Tragοedia, carmen epicum seculο post Christum nαtum

                    of Ovid and Virgil. The author speaks enthusiastically of Homer, but his chief
                    source of information was the pseudo-annals of Dictys and Dares, more especially
                    the latter, augmented by his own imagination and the spirit of the age. It is to
                    Benoît alone that the honour of poetic invention is due, and in spite of its
                    obligation for a groundwork to Dictys and Dares we may justly consider the <hi
                    rend="italic">Roman de Troie</hi> as an original work. From this source
                    subsequent writers drew their notions of Troy, mostly without naming their
                    authority and generally without even knowing his name. This is the <hi
                    rend="italic">chef d'oeuvre</hi> of the pseudo-classical cycle of romances: it
                    shows the most lofty conception, and in it poetical imagination has the freest
                    and most lively play. The <hi rend="italic">Roman de Troie</hi> was extremely
                    popular. When Benoît, by reason of his lengthiness, failed to please, the Latin
                    version of Guido revived general interest. The story passed through every
                    country of Europe, first in verse and then as a prose fiction, and portions of
                    it furnished matter for the genius of Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Shakespeare.</p>
                <p>The first work inspired by the success of the <hi rend="italic">Roman de
                    Troie</hi> was the <hi rend="italic">De bello Trojaηo</hi> of Joseph of Exeter,
                    in six books, a genuine poem of no little merit, written soon after Benoit’s
                    work or about the years 1187-88. It was directly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n662/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0662-0639"/>drawn from the pseudo-annalists, but the influence
                    of Benoît was considerable. Another was the <hi rend="italic">Troilus</hi> of
                    Albert of Stade (1249), a version of Dares, in verse, brought back to all its
                    severity and affected realism. But these Latin works can only be associated
                    indirectly with Benoît, who had closer imitators in Germany at an early period.
                    Herbort von Fritslar reproduced the French text in his <hi rend="italic">Lied
                    von Troye</hi> (early 13th century), as did also Konrad von Whrtzburg (d. 1287)
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Ruch von Troye</hi> of 40,000 verses. To the like
                    source may be traced a poem of 30,000 verses on the same subject by Wolfram von
                    Eschenbach, still unpublished. The Low Countries were not behind Germany. A
                    dozen <hi rend="italic">chansons de geste</hi> were translated into Flemish
                    towards the middle of the 13th century; and Jacob von Maerlant, an illustrious
                    poet, reproduced Benoît, and did not omit to acknowledge the authorship. The
                    fame of the romance travelled to the north, and in various forms the Norse or
                    Icelandic <hi rend="italic">Tro-jumanna Saga</hi> acquired a distinctly local
                    colour.</p>
                <p>In Italy Guido delle Colonne, a Sicilian, commenced in 1270 and finished in 1287
                    a prose <hi rend="italic">Hi stoma Trojana.</hi> Although Guido knew some Greek,
                    he did not translate Dictys and Dares, as some MSS. affirm, but reproduced the
                    <hi rend="italic">Roman de Troie</hi> of Benoît, and so closely as to copy the
                    errors of the latter and to give the name of Peleus to Pelias, Jason’s uncle. As
                    the debt was entirely unacknowledged, Benoît at last came to be considered the
                    imitator of Guido. The original is generally abridged, and the vivacity and
                    poetry of the Anglo-Norman trouvère disappear in a dry version. The immense
                    popularity of Guido’s work is shown by the large number of existing MSS. The
                    French Bibliothèque Nationale possesses eighteen codices of Guido to thirteen of
                    Benoît, while at the British Museum the proportion is ten to two. Guido’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History</hi> was translated into German about 1392 by Hans Mair of
                    Nördlingen. Two Italian translations, by Antonio Cessi (1324) and by Bellebuoni
                    (1333), are still preserved in MS. at Florence. The book passed the seas, and in
                    the 14th and the commencement of the 15th century four versions appeared in
                    England and Scotland. The best known is the <hi rend="italic">Troy Book</hi> of
                    Lydgate, who had both French and Latin texts before him. An earlier and
                    anonymous rendering exists at Oxford. There is the <hi rend="italic">Gest
                    Historiale of the Destruction of Troy</hi> (Early Eng. Text Soc., 1869), also an
                    earlier Scottish version by Barbour. The invention of printing gave fresh
                    impetus to the spread of Guido’s work. The first book printed in English was a
                    translation by Caxton from the French of Raoul Lefèvre, issued by the foreign
                    press of Caxton about 1474. Lefèvre’s own version appeared from the same press
                    about the same time and was the first book printed in the French language. There
                    were also translations into Italian, Spanish, High German, Low Saxon, Dutch, and
                    Danish; Guido had even a Flemish and a Bohemian dress. But not one of these
                    translators even suspected that the writer was only a feeble representative of
                    an old trouvère.</p>
                <p>Thus far we have only considered works more or less closely imitated from the
                    original. Boccaccio, passing by the earlier tales, took one original incident
                    from Benoît, the love of Troilus and the treachery of Briseida, and composed <hi
                    rend="italic">Filostrαto,</hi> a touching story. This was borrowed by Chaucer
                    about 1360 for his <hi rend="italic">Poke of Troilus and Cresside,</hi> and also
                    by Shakespeare for his <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> (1609). One
                    reason why the Round Table stories of the 12th and 13th centuries had a
                    never-ceasing charm for readers of the two following centuries was that they
                    were constantly being re-edited to suit the changing taste. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Roman de Troie</hi> experienced the same fate. By the 13th century
                    it was translated into prose and worked up in those enormous compilations, such
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Mer des Histoires,</hi> &amp;c., in which the Middle
                    Ages studied antiquity. It reappeared in the religious dramas called Mysteries.
                    Jacques Millet, who produced <hi rend="italic">La Destruction de Troie la
                    Grande</hi> between 1452 and 1454, merely added vulgar realism to the original.
                    Writers of chap-books borrowed the story, which is again found on the stage in
                    Antoine de Montchrestien’s tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Hector</hi> (1603)—a
                    last echo of the influence of Benoît.</p>
                <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">Troie</hi> reveals the greatest power of
                    imagination, and was the most influential and important, of these adaptations of
                    ancient classical stories, it was not the earliest of them. It was preceded by a
                    <hi rend="italic">Roman J Eneas,</hi> written, like the <hi rend="italic">Roman
                    de Troie,</hi> by an Anglo Norman at the court of Henry II., a contemporary of
                    Giraldus Cambrensis and John of Salisbury. There is, indeed, every reason to
                    believe that the author was Benoit de Sainte-More himself. The work is a
                    tolerably close reproduction of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> some passages
                    being faithfully translated and others elaborated. But the religious character
                    of Virgil’s work is wanting, as well as the spirit of Roman greatness shadowed
                    forth in the ancient epic. Long extracts from the <hi rend="italic">Eneas</hi>
                    have been published by M. Pey (Paris, 1856), but it has not yet been printed in
                    full. Soon after its appearance it was translated with great fidelity into
                    German by Heinrich von Veldeke. The <hi rend="italic">Roman de Thebes</hi> is an
                    imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Thcbais</hi> of Statius, with the same
                    general characteristics as the <hi rend="italic">Eneas.</hi> In each case the
                    trouvère found a Latin model on which to superimpose an elaborate structure of
                    his own. In each case also the original is abridged, while all polish is
                    effaced, and the pagan marvels replaced by others more familiar to contemporary
                    readers. The change is specially visible in matters of religion. Lydgate
                    translated the <hi rend="italic">Thebes,</hi> and Chaucer used the romance in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales.</hi> It was composed after the <hi
                    rend="italic">Troie</hi> by another pen than that of Benoit. Lucan’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> was the last of the great Roman epics to be
                    appropriated. <hi rend="italic">Li Romanz de Julius Cesar</hi> by Jacques de
                    Forez, of which only one MS. exists, dated 1280, is from this source. It adheres
                    to Lucan’s text with more fidelity than the other adaptations; but the general
                    intention is changed. While the classic poem ends in the middle of the 10th
                    book, Jacques de Forez conducts Caesar back to Rome. These romances— <hi

                    translations, and are, indeed, our first renderings of Virgil, Statius, and
                    Lucan in modern dialects. But the trouvères rearranged and transformed their
                    originals. Fairies, magic, and enchanters, the novel position of women, the
                    sentiments of Christianity, and the spirit of chivalry are strangely at variance
                    with the stories familiar to us in the language of imperial Rome. The influence
                    of new ideas derived from the crusades and the East is plainly visible. Some of
                    the marvels are found in William of Malmesbury, which indicates that they were
                    of popular acceptation.</p>
                <p>It is a remarkable fact that, while the <hi rend="italic">origines</hi> of the
                    pseudo-classical romances are earlier than any of the others, the prose
                    recompositions are of later construction than almost all those we are about to
                    consider. The <hi rend="italic">Recueil des Histoires de Troyes, Hercule, Jason,
                    Oedipus, Alexandre, Virgilizis,</hi> &amp;c., belong to the second half of the
                    15th century. They have little interest and intrinsic merit, but their immediate
                    originals exercised an extraordinary influence on the literature of the Middle
                    Ages, an influence which appears even in the romances of other cycles and in
                    those composed in prose at an earlier date than those we are now discussing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Recueil des Histoires de Troyes</hi> was “composé par vénérable

                    printed in 1474 by Caxton or Colard Mansion at Bruges. It is in three books, of
                    which the first deals with the story of Jupiter and Saturn, the origin of the
                    Trojans, the feats of Perseus, and the first achievements of Hercules; the
                    second book is wholly taken up with the “prouesses du fort Herculez”; the third,
                    “traictant de la generalle destruction de Troyes qui vint a l’ocasion du
                    rauissement de dame Helaine,” is little else than a translation of that portion
                    of Guido delle Colonne which relates to Priam and his sons. Two MSS. of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Recueil</hi> in the Bibliothèque Nationale wrongly attribute the
                    work to Guillaume Fillastre, a voluminous author, and predecessor of Lefèvre as

                    character and adventures of Hercules were of a nature to attract the fancy of a
                    romancist. His labours are represented as having been performed in honour of a
                    Boeotian princess; Pluto is a king dwelling in a dismal castle; the <pb

                    entrance to Pluto’s castle is watched by the giant Cerberus. Hercules conquers
                    Spain and takes Merida from Geryon. The book is translated into English as
                    Hercules of Greece (n.d.). The marquis de Villena took from the same source his
                    prose Lιbrο de los Trabajos de Hercules (Zamora, 1498), and Fernandez dc Heredia
                    wrote Tmbajos de Hercules (1682), also in prose. Le Fatiche JErcοle (1475) is a

                <p>Jason.—Les fais et prouesses du noble et vaillant chevalier Jason was composed in
                    the middle of the 15th century by Lefèvre on the basis of Benoit, and presented
                    to Philip of Burgundy, founder of the order of the Toison d’Or. Jason is shown
                    as a foremost figure in tournaments, overthrowing all competitors at one held by
                    the king of Boeotia to celebrate the knighting of his son Hercules. The two
                    become staunch friends and attend the marriage ceremony of Hippodamia. Centaurs
                    interrupt and are exterminated by Jason. He performs other knightly exploits,
                    and on his return is maliciously sent by his uncle Peleus (Pelias) on the
                    Argonautic expedition. The narrative of the journey to Lemnos and Colchos, the
                    love of Medea, and the episode of the Golden Fleece follows the classical
                    traditions. When Jason returns to the country of the Myrmidons, Medea by
                    enchantment restores the old king to youth and brings about the death of Peleus.
                    For this last good deed Medea is bauished, with Jason’s consent, and is carried
                    oft’ by four dragons. She soars long over Greece before she is able to find her
                    lover; at length she discovers that he is going to wed the princess of Corinth.
                    She descends amid thunder and lightning, kills the two children she bore to
                    Jason, and allows her attendant dragons to destroy with fire Corinth and all its
                    inhabitants. She then inveigles the old Egeus, king of Athens, into marriage,
                    but is banished upon suspicion of attempting to poison her new son-in-law
                    Theseus. Meeting with Jason, who had escaped the burning of Corinth, she becomes
                    reconciled to him, and, abjuring magic, on the death of Eson becomes a good wife
                    and queen. The manners and sentiments of the 15th century are made to harmonize
                    with the classical legends after the fashion of the Italian pre-Raphaelite
                    painters, who equipped Jewish warriors with knightly lance and armour. The story
                    is well told; the digressions are few; and there are many touches of domestic
                    life and natural sympathy. The first edition is believed to have been printed at
                    Bruges in 1474; the type is the same as that used in the first edition of the
                    Recueil. Caxton translated the book at the command of the duchess of Burgundy. A
                    Dutch translation appeared at Haarlem in 1495. M. Paulin Paris doubts whether
                    the romance was written by Lefèvre, whose authorship is distinctly asserted by
                    Caxton. Montfaucon refers to a MS. by Guido delle Colonne, Historia Medeae et
                    Jasonis (unpublished). There is a Histoire de la Tlιοisοn J Or (1516) by
                    Guillaume Fillastre, written about 1440-50.</p>
                <p>(Edipus.—A kind of introduction to the Recueil is Le Roman d'Oedipus, Fils de
                    Lαyus (n.d.), written in the 15th century by an unknown pen. The story follows
                    the fable told by the Greek poets, adapted, of course, to the taste and habits
                    of later times. The sphinx is drawn as a giant of great subtlety and
                    ferocity.</p>
                <p>2. The wonders revealed through the Asiatic expedition of Alexander gave rise to
                    a remarkable development of the marvellous in historical composition. The
                    histories of Onesicritus, Aristobulus, and Clitarchus, themselves members of the
                    expedition, were so full of unheard-of things that they soon fell into
                    disrepute. Callisthenes, another companion of Alexander, also wrote an account,
                    which is lost, but his name remains connected with a spurious work in which were
                    crystallized all the fabulous tales of the conqueror. The life of Alexander had
                    every quality to appeal to the imagination. His marvellous career, his genius as
                    a soldier and ruler, the beauty of his person, his early death, were subjects
                    for legend almost in his own day; and a cloud of mythical story soon floated
                    round his memory. Quintus Curtius, who drew from some of these suspicious
                    sources, is a more critical authority, though he allowed rhetorical fancy to
                    embellish his narration. It is a great fall from the Latin historian to the
                    Pseudo-Callisthenes. The work we possess under the latter title represents the
                    second stage of the Alexander myth. Some of the MSS. attribute it to Aristotle,
                    Ptolemy, and Aesop, as well as to Callisthenes,—all with equal verisimilitude.
                    To reconstruct the true from the spurious work is an impossible task after the
                    increased vogue given to the latter by the re-opening of the East to Europe by
                    the Romans, when all the traditions became remoulded in the form they now
                    possess. Among the histories separate from Pseudo-Callisthenes and subsequent to
                    Quintus Curtius is an <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium Alexandra,</hi> in Latin,
                    but of Greek origin, which is little else than an amplification of the
                    apocryphal letter of Alexander to Aristotle. It is dedicated to Con-stans, son
                    of the emperor Constantine. Similarities between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Itinerarium</hi> and the Latin version of Pseudo-Callisthenes prove that the
                    stories were current in the 4th century, and may have emanated from the same
                    source; but, while the <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium</hi> is inferior in
                    authority to Quintus Curtius, it is less a collection of mere fables than is
                    Callisthenes. The Greek text of the latter is supposed to have been written in
                    Alexandria at the commencement of the third century, and to have been translated
                    into Latin by Julius Valerius before 340. The translation was abridged in Latin
                    some time before the 9th century. Much of the work is a running travesty of the
                    true history of the conqueror. The first book deals with his birth and early
                    exploits. The trace of Alexandrian influence is to be found in the pretence that
                    his actual father was Nec-tanebus, a fugitive king of Egypt. The latter was a
                    great magician, able, by operating upon waxen figures of the armies and ships of
                    his enemies, to obtain complete power over their real actions. He was obliged,
                    however, to fly to Pella, where he established himself as a doctor and was
                    visited by Queen Olympias to get advice upon her continued sterility. He
                    promised that Jupiter Ammon should perform the cure in the shape of a dragon. To
                    make quite sure Nectanebus himself took the place of the animal, and nine months
                    afterwards Philip became the father of the future Alexander. At first there was
                    some unpleasantness, but a reappearance of the dragon convinced everybody that
                    the infant really was the son of a god, so that the putative father could no
                    longer object. Alexander was small and somewhat deformed, but of great courage
                    and intelligence. He was educated under the supervision of Nectanebus, who at
                    last died through a fall into a pit, into which he had been playfully pushed by
                    his royal pupil. The second book continues the various conquests, and the third
                    contains the victory over Porus, the relations with the Brahmans, the letter to
                    Aristotle on the wonders of India, the histories of Candaces and the Amazons,
                    the letter to Olympias on the marvels of Further Asia, and lastly the account of
                    Alexander’s death in Babylon.</p>
                <p>Callisthenes was translated into Syriac and Armenian in the 5th century. A second
                    Latin abridgment is known as <hi rend="italic">Historia de Praeliis.</hi> The
                    letter from Alexander to Aristotle on the marvels of India, the correspondence
                    between the king and the wise Brahman Dindimus, and <hi rend="italic">De
                    Geηtibus Indiae,</hi> ascribed to Palladius, are different parts of the same
                    legend. The myth had a wider circulation than any of the others we have yet
                    dealt with, and the East contributed its share as well as the West. Persians and
                    Arabs told the deeds of Iskander; and Firdousi made use of the story in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shah-Namah.</hi> Another early Persian poet, Nizami, made the
                    story specially his own. The crusaders brought back fresh developments; Gog and
                    Magog (partly Arab and partly Greek) and some Jewish stories were then added. In
                    the llth century Simeon Seth, protovestiarius at the Byzantine court, translated
                    the fabulous history from the Persian back into Greek. In the following century
                    was built up the <hi rend="italic">Geste d ’ Alexandre</hi> by the successive
                    labours of Lambert le Cort, Alexandre Bernai, Jehan le Nevelais, Gautier de
                    Cambrai, Pierre de Saint-Cloud, Brisebarre, &amp;c. Alexander becomes then a
                    knightly king, surrounded by his twelve paladins. Bernai says that the
                    foundation was Latin (? Valerius or some other Latin version of
                    Pseudo-Callisthenes):</p>
                <p>“Un clerc de Casteldun, Lambert li Cors l’escrit,</p>

                <p>The same origin is to be sought for the Alexander myths found in <hi
                    rend="italic">Renart le Bestoume</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Speculum
                    Historiale</hi> of Vincentius Bellovacensis. Quintus Curtius was largely used
                    for the <hi rend="italic">Alexaηdreis (c.</hi> 1176-1202) of Gaultier de
                    Châtillon. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The author
                    of the much-quoted line, “Incidis in Scillam cupiens vitare Charybdim.” The

                    from being first used in the French Geste J Alexandre. </p></note> It was the
                    theme of poetry in all European languages: six or seven German poets dealt with
                    the subject, and it may be read in English, Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic,
                    Flemish, and Bohemian.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the 15th century an anonymous writer worked up the subject
                    into a prose romance, <hi rend="italic">H histoire du noble et vaillant roy
                    Alixandre le Grant</hi> (1506), in which the <hi rend="italic">Historiα de
                    Praeliis</hi> is followed with tolerable exactness. After an account of the
                    ancient history of Macedonia and of the intrigue of Nectanebus we are told how
                    Philip dies, and how Alexander subdues Rome and receives tribute from all
                    European nations. He then makes his Persian expedition; the Indian campaign
                    gives occasion to descriptions of all kinds of wonders. The conqueror visits a
                    cannibal kingdom and finds many marvels in the palace of Porus, among them a
                    vine with golden branches, emerald leaves, and fruit of other precious stones.
                    In one country he meets with women, who, after burial in the winter, become
                    alive again in the spring full of youth and beauty. Having reached the ends of
                    the earth and conquered all nations, he aspires to the dominion of the air. He
                    obtains a magic glass cage, yoked with eight griffins, flies through the clouds,
                    and, thanks to enchanters knowing the language of birds, gets information as to
                    their manners and customs, and ultimately receives their submission. The
                    excessive heat of the upper regions compels him to descend, and he next visits,
                    the bottom of the sea in a kind of diving-bell. The fish crowd round him and pay
                    homage. Alexander returns to Babylon, is crowned with much pomp, and mass is
                    celebrated. He dies by poison soon afterwards.</p>
                <p>The Voeux du Paon and Rcstor du Paon are chansons de geste attached to the
                    Alexander cycle, to which also belongs Florimont, a poem by Aimé de Varennes,
                    said to have been written in 1188. Florimont was a son of the duke of Albania
                    and father of Philip of Macedon by the heiress of the latter country. This poem
                    gave rise to two prose romances—La conqueste de Grèce fniete par Philippe de
                    Madien, by Perrinet du Pin, first printed in 1527, and Histoire du roi Florimond
                    (1528).</p>
                <p>3. We now come to the third order of romances included in the cycle of “Rome la
                    Grant,” or those which merely reproduce the names of antiquity. The enchanter
                    Virgil is the most famous of those who have given rise to prose works, and what
                    passes under his name is less a romance than a collection of popular tales, many
                    of Eastern derivation. Among romances in verse we have <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Enchanter Virgil.—After turning the heroes of antiquity into knights-errant,
                    it was a simple task to transform ancient poets and philosophers into
                    necromancers; and Virgil and Aristotle became popularly famous, not for poetry
                    and science, but for their supposed knowledge of the black art. One of the
                    earliest references to the magical skill of Virgil <note anchored="true"

                    pseudo-Virgilian stories. </p></note> occurs in a letter of the chancellor
                    Conrad (1194), reproduced by Arnold of Lübeck in the continuation of the
                    Clιroηican Slavorum of Helmold. John of Salisbury alludes to the brazen fly
                    fabricated by Virgil; Hélinand (d. 1227) speaks of similar marvels in a work
                    from which Vincentius Bellovacensis has borrowed; and Gervase of Tilbury, in his
                    Οtia Imperial™, (1212), and Alexander Neckham (d. 1217), in De Natura Rerum,
                    have reproduced these traditions, with additions. German and French poets did
                    not overlook this accessory to their répertoire. The Roman de Cléomades of
                    Adenez (12th century) and the Image du Monde, an encyclopaedic poem of Gauthier
                    de Metz (13th century), contain numerous references to the prodigies of the
                    enchanter. Reynard the Fox informs King Lion that he had from the wise Virgil a
                    quantity of valuable receipts. He also plays a considerable part in the popular
                    folk-tale The Seven Wise Masters, and appears in the Gesta Romanorum and that
                    curious guidebook for pilgrims, the Mirabilia Romae. He is to be found in
                    Gower’s Confessio Amantis and in Lydgate’s Rochas. A Spanish romance, Vergilios,
                    is included by E. de Ochoa in his Tesσro (Paris, 1838), and Juan Ruiz,
                    archpriest of Hita (d. 1351), has also written a poem on the subject. Many of
                    the tales of magic throughout Europe were referred to Virgil, and gradually
                    developed into a completely new life, strangely different from that of the real
                    hero. They were collected in French under the title of Les Faitz Merveilleux de
                    Virgille (c. 1499), a quarto chapbook of ten pages, which became extremely
                    popular, and was printed, with more or less additional matter, in all languages.
                    We are told how Virgil beguiled the devil at a very early age, in the same
                    fashion as the fisherman used the jinn in the Arabian Nights when he got him to
                    re-enter Solomon’s casket. Another reproduction of a widely spread tale was that
                    of the lady who kept Virgil suspended in a basket. To revenge the affront the
                    magician extinguished all the fires in the city, and no one could rekindle them
                    without subjecting the lady to an ordeal highly offensive to her modesty. Virgil
                    made for the emperor a castle in which he could see and hear everything done or
                    said in Rome, an ever-blooming orchard, statues to preserve the safety of the
                    city, and a lamp to supply light to it. He abducted the soldan’s daughter, and
                    built for her the city of Naples upon a secure foundation of eggs. At last,
                    having performed many extraordinary things, he knew that his time was come. In
                    order to escape the common lot he placed all his treasures in a castle defended
                    by images unceasingly wielding iron flails, and directed his confidential
                    servant to hew him in pieces, which he was to salt and place in a barrel in the
                    cellar, under which a lamp was to be kept burning. The servant was assured that
                    after seven days his master would revive a young man. The directions were
                    carried out; but the emperor, missing his medicine - man, forced the servant to
                    divulge the secret and to quiet the whirling flails. The emperor and his retinue
                    entered the castle and at last found the mangled corpse. In his wrath he slew
                    the servant, whereupon a little naked child ran thrice round the barrel, crying,
                    “Cursed be the hour that ye ever came here,” and vanished.</p>

                <p>( <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ) <hi rend="italic">Arthurian Cycle.</hi></p>
                <p>The oldest and certainly the most important of the cycles of mediaeval romance is
                    that which passes under the name of King Arthur, or of the Round Table. The
                    names, characters, and actions of its heroes have permeated modern literature
                    throughout Europe; yet so little do we know concerning the <hi rend="italic"
                    >origines</hi> and the first authors of the tales which form the body of
                    Arthurian romance that there are few subjects in literary history more obscure
                    and undefined. It can only be said with assurance that from about the year 1150
                    several poems <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Chansons de geste,</hi> or ballads of knightly adventure, produced
                    by wandering minstrels called in northern France and England <hi rend="italic"
                    >trouvères,</hi> in southern France, Spain, and northern Italy <hi rend="italic"
                    >trobadors</hi> (troubadours), in Germany <hi rend="italic">minnesänger,</hi>
                    and intended for recitation with more or less musical accompaniment. </p></note>
                    were composed by minstrels (a class of men recruited from all ranks of society)
                    upon incidents and personages familiar to readers of what is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morte Arthur,</hi> a compilation of the second half of the 13th
                    century. The <hi rend="italic">Morte Arthur</hi> was not originally so called,
                    and it was not a direct compilation from the ballads of the 12th century, but
                    seems rather to have been a mere unskilful reduction into a single <hi
                    rend="italic">corpus</hi> of some five or six prose romances which had already
                    grown out of the poems, and each of which professed to relate the adventures of
                    nearly the same set of heroes. The first appearance of these stories in prose
                    compositions is here our chief concern; and it is, unfortunately, likewise our
                    chief difficulty. The sources of information upon the subject are defective and
                    vitiated to a singular degree; and the light thrown by the investigations of
                    recent writers is frequently of the nature of cross-lights. The following
                    attempt at constructing a brief literary history of the Arthurian romances is
                    not offered as a complete analysis of the work which has been done, but as a
                    summary of facts and probabilities.</p>
                <p>The Roman conquests in Spain, Gaul, and Britain imposed upon a large portion of
                    the conquered peoples the necessity of using the Latin language, which thereby
                    became, and for centuries remained, the medium of educated intercourse and the
                    language of the towns and the centres of government in those countries. In
                    common speech, naturally, it became depraved in course of time, and the pure <hi
                    rend="italic">lingua Latina</hi> of the high officials and the clergy existed
                    side by side with the corrupt <hi rend="italic">lingua Romana</hi> of the
                    Romanized people. The latter was, however, ignored by polite literature, and
                    probably never appeared in a written form till it was used for political
                    purposes on the occasion of the celebrated partition of Charlemagne’s empire
                    among his grandsons. We may say that the literature of romance begins with
                    popular poetry of the 10th or 11th century; but, as its subject-matter was
                    derived to some extent from the more respectable <hi rend="italic">lingua
                    Latina,</hi> we must go back a few centuries earlier to find the <hi
                    rend="italic">origines.</hi> When the people of Rome became acquainted with the
                    civilization and literature of Greece they framed a fabu-lous history to connect
                    themselves with the superior race, and the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>
                    exhibits that pseudo-tradition in its most permanent and powerful embodiment. A
                    similar desire affected the Romanized Britons, and we may confidently assume
                    that before the end of the 3d century a poetical form had been given to the
                    story of the Trojan Brutus who founded the kingdom of Britain, blended with
                    something of the real traditions of the Celtic race. No such form survives at
                    present, but we may discern its traces and results in Nennius (sec. viii.-x.),
                    Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. 1154), and in all the subsequent chronicles.</p>
                <p>In the 11th century the Anglo-Saxons of England had their old Germanic stories of
                    Beowulf, Sigfrid, and the Nibelungen; the Britons of the west enjoyed their
                    Celtic and Britanno-Celtic myths; the Saxonized Britons of Wiltshire and
                    elsewhere combined the legends of both the others; and the best educated men
                    amongst the clergy had an acquaintance with Virgil, Ovid, and Statius. Here was
                    a rich material for the imagination, and the invasion of the Normans brought a
                    fructifying element. In France, Roman, Franco-German, Celto-Breton, and
                    Scandinavian traditions were already intermingled; and the reintroduction into
                    Saxonized England, from the south, of Celtic myths nearly identical with those
                    which the Anglo-Normans found in Wales before the end of the 11th century gave
                    to the latter a fresh life and a distinct predominance over all the other
                    traditions of the composite people. Hence arose the British cycle of romance,
                    accepted partly as history, partly as fiction by the new people of Norman
                    England. Bretons, Britons, Normans and French, the Saxonized Britons, the
                    Franco-Gallicized Scandinavians, and the Dano-Saxons all found a common basis of
                    amalga-mation, and it is no mere metaphor to say that the publi-cation of
                    Geoffrey of Monmouth’s fabulous chronicle formed a momentous era in the history
                    of England.</p>
                <p>When the Saxons entered Britain in the 5th century they found in the middle and
                    the south a Romanized kingdom ruled by a monarch with a British or Cymric name.
                    The vernacular tongue of Britain was then and for centuries afterwards much
                    nearer in form to the Gaelic of Ireland and of western and northern Scotland,
                    the Pictish of Scotland, and the Gaulish of France than the Cymric of Wales is
                    now or was then. It was a long time before the Saxon conquests extended so far
                    as to leave the Cymry or Welsh the sole distinct people of the original
                    inhabitants of the country. In the meantime there had been conflicts with the
                    Pictish kings of the north, the Gaelic or Cambro-Gaelic kings of Strathclyde,
                    and the princes of North and South Wales. Amongst their opposers the most
                    successful and the most memorable was a prince or chief of Strathclyde, who is
                    called by Nennius “Arthur dux bellorum,” by the English “King Arthur,” by the
                    Welsh “the Emperor Arthur.” After the departure of the Romans there were several
                    independent monarchies or principalities in the island—that of the Romanized
                    Britons occupying the centre, south, and south-east of the country; two Cymric
                    principalities in Wales (North and South); the Cambro-Gaelic kingdom of
                    Strathclyde, extending from the Clyde to Chester; the unmixed Gaels in the
                    north-west of Scotland; the Pictish kingdom in the northeast; and a Scandinavian
                    population between the Firth of Forth and Norwich. It is now settled by scholars
                    that the Pictish speech was a dialect, like Gallic, Gaelic, and Cymric, of the
                    common Celtic language; and in the early centuries of the Christian era the
                    radical unity of all these tongues had not yet been effaced by the action of
                    local varieties of pronunciation and arbitrary rules of orthography;
                    consequently there was no such sentiment of national or racial distinction
                    between the divisions of the Celtic race as is nowadays produced by political
                    frontiers. The real Arthur, whoever he was, has been claimed by the <pb

                    Celts retiring westward to the mountain-fastnesses before the victorious Saxons.
                    They have lost sight of the fact that there were always Cymry in Wales, who must
                    have re-garded their brothers in Loegria (England) much in the same way as they
                    did those of Strathclyde, namely, as kinsmen and allies sometimes, as fair game
                    for attack and plunder more frequently. The struggle between the Celtic and
                    Germanic race was a long one, and it can only have been after the power of the
                    Romanized Britons of Loegria and of the men of Strathclyde was broken, in the
                    battles to which we may attach the name of Arthur, that the tide of war reached
                    Wales along with the British fugitives who crowded thither and to Brittany;
                    hence the appearance of Roman names among the British warriors. It may be
                    surmised that Arthur is not a name but a title given to a Strathclyde warrior,
                    corresponding to the Latin <hi rend="italic">imperator.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name Arthur is found for

                    bear” or the “iron hammer.” Now, although the former may refer equally well to
                    Cymric and to Gaelic, <hi rend="italic">i.e., αrth-vaur</hi> or <hi

                    there is no trace of it in Cymric. The second syllable of <hi rend="italic"

                    probably also meant “iron.” This observation shows that Nennius did not know
                    whether the name was a Gaelic or a Cymric one, and the mere uncertainty is in
                    itself an argument that Arthur was distinctly not Cambrian. If it were
                    permissible to seek a purely Gaelic etymology for Arthur we should find it in

                <p>The traces of Roman occupation and of Roman culture were not wholly effaced for
                    many centuries in the west of England, and, besides the Latin quasi-historical
                    writings attributed to Gildas and Nennius, there must have been something like a
                    British Livy and a British Virgil in existence between the time of Constantine
                    and that of the pseudo classical compositions of Geoffrey of Monmouth and Joseph
                    of Exeter. It is quite certain that the work we call by the name of Nennius did
                    not furnish all the sub-ject-matter of Geoffrey’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia,</hi> and the mysterious old volume which his friend William of
                    Wallingford brought to him from Brittany about 1130 must have contained poetic
                    legends as well as prose pseudo-history. Another mysterious volume is the “Latin
                    book” in the monastery at Salisbury, to which the romancists of 1160-1220
                    professed to have resorted for their narratives. In Geoffrey’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia,</hi> compiled, as he says, from William of Wallingford’s book, we
                    find three elements blended—(1) the epic of Brutus (which must have been written
                    in Britain before 300); (2) a record of British kings down to the Saxon invasion
                    (probably a corrupt version of the same real history that appears distorted and
                    truncated in Nennius); (3) the lives of Arthur, Guenhumara, and Merlin (old
                    British popular legends, wrought into union with a later Cymric tradition in
                    which the British or Gadelic Arth-vaur, Art-vor, or Ard-tur had been converted
                    into a Welsh king Arthur).</p>
                <p>The Round Table romances had their starting-point in Geoffrey’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia,</hi> first published in 1138-39, revised and republished in its

                    no mention in Geoffrey of Lancelot and Tristan, two heroes of much greater
                    importance in the romances than Arthur himself. It does not seem to have been
                    observed before that there is a curious set of resemblances between the
                    personages of the romances and those of the Homeric siege of Troy. The names of
                    Arthur and Uter suggest Atrides (Menelaus and Agamemnon rolled into one); Mark,
                    again, is Menelaus; Guenhumara and Yseult are like Helen, Guenhumara also
                    resembling Chryseis and Briseis; Lancelot and Tristan are like Achilles and
                    Paris. Lancelot becomes for a time the enemy of his king (Arthur = Atrides) and
                    stands aloof from him; he is unsuccessful in his quest of the Grail, as Achilles
                    dies before Troy is taken; his son Galaad, like the Achilleid Neo-ptolemus,
                    achieves the father’s unfinished task. Lancelot <hi rend="italic">(lanc-e-loc
                    =</hi> child of the lake) is brought up in concealment by the Lady of the Lake,
                    just as Thetis (the goddess of the sea) brings up her son Achilles, disguised as
                    a girl, in obscurity. Chiron, to whose care the young Achilles is at first
                    entrusted by Thetis, resembles Merlin, the friend or lover of the Lady of the
                    Lake, in his half divine, half human nature. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The names of several beings of this mixed
                    nature in the early romances begin with the same word, mer, merhl, or mel, as
                    Merlin, Melusine, Melior, Melion. </p></note> Again, not only does Galaad by his
                    name remind us of the hero of the <hi rend="italic">Achilleidos</hi> (it must
                    have been as usual to give this genitive name to the poem of Statius as that of
                    <hi rend="italic">Eneydos</hi> to Virgil’s), but there are other curious
                    similitudes. The name of King Perles or Pelles, by whose daughter Lancelot
                    becomes the father of Galaad, is suggestive of, or may have been suggested by,
                    the Graeco-Latin appellation of Achilles, Pelides son of Peleus. One of the
                    meanings that has been suggested for the name of Lancelot is <hi rend="italic"
                    >l'ancelot =</hi> the serving man, in reference to one of the incidents of his
                    story. Although a different origin is hinted at above, it would not be
                    inappropriate to designate Achilles in his female disguise at Delos <hi
                    rend="italic">l’ancillet</hi> ( = the male damsel, in attendance on Deidamia).
                    As in the old Greek poems we have Atrides and Pelides contesting for Briseis,
                    and the minor Atrides, Menelaus, similarly contending with Paris the ravisher of
                    Helen, so in the romances we find Guenhumara the object of mutual strife between
                    her lover Lancelot and her husband Arthur, son of Uter Pendragon, and Yseult the
                    cause of war between King Mark and Tristan. Again, a resemblance is to be found
                    in the incidents of fabulous birth between Arthur and Hercules, Arthur and
                    Alexander the Great.</p>
                <p>These observations are not intended to contradict the claims of the Cymric people
                    to have furnished the romances with much of their material; for it would be
                    difficult to resist the evidence of such names as Tristan and Yseult, which
                    indicate sufficiently their British or Breton origin, and even Lancelot might
                    have been, as first suggested above, a Welsh or British translation of an
                    epithet which would apply to Achilles in connexion with the following words from
                    Statius. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hugh of

                    the Lake might have said of Lancelot)—</p>
                <p>“Saepe ipsa (nefas! ) sub inania natum Tartara et ad Stygios iterum fero mergere
                    fontes;”</p>
                <p>while her son’s guardian, Chiron, is named in the same place “Carpathius vates,”
                    which at once reminds us of the “Caledonius vates” (Merlin) of Geoffrey of
                    Monmouth. At the same time the name of Guenhumara (Guinevere) makes one think of
                    Thetis, the white-footed lady of the sea. As the name Guenhumara certainly
                    preceded in date all the Anglo-French romances and is undoubtedly an old one, we
                    may as well say at once that the intention is here to suggest an hypothesis that
                    Britain produced Latin poets during the time of the Roman occupation, who wrote
                    works not only on the fable of a British descent from the Trojans through
                    Brutus, a fabled kinsman of Aeneas, but also on the various subjects of classic
                    mythology, the stories of Thebes, Troy, the Golden Fleece, and Alexander. <note

                    “robust.” Arthur proves his fitness for kingship by the performance of wonderful

                    the corollary that British translations or adaptations were formed when the
                    Roman influence began to wane, would account for the curious circumstance that
                    some of the Greek and Oriental fictions are found in Anglo-Saxon versions of
                    much greater antiquity than any that have survived in the other vernaculars of
                    Europe. Direct transference of such works from classical codices can hardly be
                    presumed to have been the custom of a rough and semi-barbarous nation of
                    Teutonic invaders; the medium must have been the existence of Brito-Latin and
                    British poems among the conquered people.</p>
                <p>The success of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> and of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Merlin</hi> brought indignant comment from some of the
                    Anglo-Norman historians, but it inflamed the minds of other writers already
                    excited by the extraordinary events of the period. The result was the genesis of
                    modern fiction. Within a few years after Geoffrey’s publication the Norman Wace
                    translated the <hi rend="italic">Historia Britonum</hi> into French verse
                    (1155), making some additions; and in his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Roman
                    de Brut</hi> we find the words—</p>
                <p>“King Ertur made the Round Table</p>
                <p>Of which Bretons tell many a fable ”—</p>
                <p>from which we may infer that the Round Table stories, which led to the
                    construction of the French romances, were derived directly from Brittany, just
                    as Geoffrey declares his <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> to have been. Wace, as
                    a Jersey man, could have made no confusion between the Waleis of Cambria and the
                    Bretun of Armorica.</p>
                <p>Recapitulating what has been already said, we may chronologically tabulate the
                    first elements of Arthurian story thus—I. <hi rend="italic">Arthur, Guinevere,
                    Merlin</hi> (in Geoffrey), 1136-49; II. the <hi rend="italic">Round Table</hi>

                    <hi rend="italic">Grail;</hi> and V. <hi rend="italic">Tristan.</hi></p>
                <p>The original <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> was earlier than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lancelot,</hi> and was presumably a French poem (or prose work?),
                    written about 1160 by Luc de Gast, a trouvère of English birth who lived near
                    Salisbury, and is said to have had access to the book of stories referred to in
                    a previous paragraph. The poem (?) and the book have perished, and the Tristan
                    story was written under the name of <hi rend="italic">Le Bret</hi> ( = the
                    Breton), to distinguish it from <hi rend="italic">Le Brut</hi> ( = the Briton)
                    of Wace, at a later date, with so much additional matter that it must be placed
                    after the <hi rend="italic">Lancelot.</hi> Walter Μαρ ( <hi rend="italic"
                    >q.v.</hi> ) of Here-ford, who died archdeacon of Oxford in the year 1210, was a
                    man of Welsh origin or kindred. In 1185 Hue de Rote-lande of Credenhill near
                    Hereford wrote a French romantic poem, in which the names of the characters are
                    all derived from the <hi rend="italic">Thebais</hi> of Statius, but the
                    incidents are wholly imaginative or derived from other sources. In it he speaks,
                    in deprecation of any blame for his falsification of the truth of history, of
                    Walter Map as being quite as great a romancer as himself. In connexion with
                    statements fre-quently repeated in the early MSS. of the romances, this remark
                    suffices to prove that before 1185 Walter Map had already published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lancelot.</hi> We may fairly put the date before 1175, say about
                    1170; and it would be probably correct to assume that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lancelot</hi> was a French poem (or prose work ?) composed while the author was
                    still young (1165-70). It has perished, like Luc de Gast’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tristan,</hi> and we can only conjecture that it had some similar connexion
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Achilles</hi> of Statius to that of Hue de
                    Rotelande’s poem with the <hi rend="italic">Thebais.</hi> It was, however,
                    reduced to or rewritten in prose and amplified before 1200 in the form in which
                    we now find it in several old MSS. (none earlier than the 13th century). It is
                    certain that Rustighello or Rusticien of Pisa was employed about 1270-75 to
                    unify or harmonize in a single compilation the scattered Arthurian romances, and
                    it is considered probable that the result was the French prose original of the
                    existing <hi rend="italic">Morte Arthur.</hi> But it is also certain that there
                    exist prose Arthurian romances in MSS. at least as old as 1270, and that they
                    were copies of yet older ones. Rusticien’s work must have been simply one of
                    compression and combination. We know from the MSS. of two different prose
                    translations of a totally different romantic chronicle (the Pseudo-Turpin’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle of Charlemagne),</hi> written in and about 1200, that
                    metrical narrative was losing credit and that French prose composition had
                    already set in. This statement, which refers to the French kingdom, is likely to
                    be yet more applicable to England, where metrical suc-cess would naturally be
                    more difficult to achieve than in the true home of French speech. As prose was
                    current in France before 1200, it is not rash to assume that it had an earlier
                    and less limited currency in England. Reckon-ing thus we may assume that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lancelot</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> were written
                    in prose before 1190.</p>
                <p>The Round Table and the Grail are so closely connected that it is difficult to
                    regard them as having had each a separate origin. The mention of the former by
                    Wace proves the existence of stories of a Round Table current before 1155. The
                    Round Table as it appears in the current texts of the romances is simply an
                    important portion of the furniture of the narratives: it does not represent a
                    cycle of incidents or even a number of special episodes. One might suppose from
                    the form of Wace’s phrase that the word was with him, as it is now, a general
                    epithet to designate Arthurian stories, rather than merely the name of a
                    material object, as it is in the romances. But we cannot assume the fact for
                    lack of specific information. The first and also the chief instance which we
                    have of the appearance of the· Round Table (beyond Wace’s allusion) is in the
                    existing <hi rend="italic">Lancelot,</hi> which we may refer to about 1190. In
                    the epilogue of the <hi rend="italic">Tristan,</hi> Hélie de Borron speaks of
                    Luc de Gast’s original work on that hero as the first of “les grans livres de la
                    tauble roonde.” There is no reason to imagine that this phrase was written after
                    the year 1200; and it indicates sufficiently that several books were
                    collectively styled “Romances of the Round Table” between 1155 and the end of
                    the century. One of these books was <hi rend="italic">Joseph of Arimathea, or
                    the History of the Holy Graal,</hi> written about 1170-80 by Robert de Borron or
                    Robert of Bouron, a trouvère born near Meaux. This narrative seems to have taken
                    at least two forms before it was incorporated in the prose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lancelot,</hi> and the alterations were so numerous and important that some
                    writers consider the <hi rend="italic">Grand Graal</hi> to have been a rewriting
                    effected in collaboration by Walter Map and Robert de Borron. The earlier
                    portion of the <hi rend="italic">History of the Graal</hi> was but lightly
                    treated on its incorporation in the <hi rend="italic">Lancelot,</hi> and the
                    form in which we have it in the separate romance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Graal</hi> is of more modern compilation. The later portion of the Grail
                    story—namely, the <hi rend="italic">Queste du Graal,</hi> which was utilized by
                    Map (or his recompiler) in the <hi rend="italic">Lancelot</hi> —differs from
                    that of the French writer in making Galaad the achiever, while Perceval was the
                    hero of the quest in Robert de Borron’s work and its recompilations, as well as
                    in the separate prose romance of <hi rend="italic">Perceval</hi> and the
                    separate <hi rend="italic">Histoire du Graal.</hi> We may conclude that the
                    older works (the original <hi rend="italic">Lancelot, Merlin,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Tristan)</hi> had nothing of the Grail in them, and that the
                    publication in French of the <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> by Luc de Gast and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lancelot</hi> by Walter Map (produced in this succession
                    between 1160 and 1180) were accidentally contemporaneous with Robert de Borron’s
                    poem (or prose work) on the grail ( = chalice) or cup of Christ’s passion and
                    the table of the Last Supper, based upon an old legend (connected in some way
                    with the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n668/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0668-0645"/>ancient popular <hi rend="italic">Gospel of
                    Nicodemus),</hi> according to which Joseph of Arimathea brought Christianity to
                    Britain in the time of Vespasian. Then Robert de Borron continued his story in
                    another work which represented the quest or rediscovery of the Grail in Avalon,
                    Brittany, or Britain, by Perceval, the grand-nephew of Joseph of Arimathea; and
                    Walter Map appropriated so much of De Borron’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Queste</hi> as suited him, working it up in a continuation
                    of his story on Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot, whilst adding to and altering
                    the incidents of the narrative very considerably. Finally, Hélie de Borron
                    (about 1190) rewrote the <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> in something like its
                    existent form, weaving it by enlargement into connexion with the other tales,
                    and probably soon after 1200 united for the first time in one enormous and
                    unharmonized corpus the full set of Arthurian stories. One reason why we cannot
                    assign this first combination to a later date (as those do who hold the work of
                    Rusticien of Pisa to have been something more than a mere compression) is that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Guiron,</hi> written by Hélie de Borron (probably soon
                    after 1200), is not incorporated in the <hi rend="italic">Morte Arthur,</hi>
                    which it would assuredly have been if Rusticien (about 1270-75) had been
                    employed to unite a number of detached stories rather than to re-edit an already
                    existing compilation. Of Hélie de Borron we only know that he was a relative of
                    Robert; that he was the virtual author of the <hi rend="italic">Bret</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Tristan,</hi> in which he incorporated the substance of tales
                    written by Luc de Gast and Gasse li Blont; that he also wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palamedes</hi> in two parts <hi rend="italic">{Meliadus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Guiron le Courtois)</hi>; and that his work was done at the
                    request of a king of England, alleged to have been Henry II. or Henry III. Of
                    the other early writers of Arthurian stories the chief were the trouvère
                    Chrestien de Troyes (about 1180-90), who composed a poem upon an episode of
                    Map’s Lancelot story, and another upon the <hi rend="italic">Perceval</hi> (in
                    which he may have combined Robert de Borron and Map), and Guyot de Provins
                    (about 1190-95), who wrote a romance of <hi rend="italic">Perceval,</hi> now
                    lost, and only known through the German translation of Wolfram von Eschenbach
                    (about 1205). As for the Welsh stories in the <hi rend="italic">Mabinogion</hi>
                    and the Welsh <hi rend="italic">Seint Greal,</hi> there is really no evidence to
                    show their anteriority to the English <hi rend="italic">Morte Arthur,</hi>
                    except the fact that two of the tales <hi rend="italic">(Geraint</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lady of the Fountain)</hi> are of similar substance to the
                    poems of Chrestien de Troyes, <hi rend="italic">Erec et Enide</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Chevalier au Lyon,</hi> — narratives of Arthurian personages
                    but not embodied in the French prose romances. Even the Welsh chronicles which
                    are supposed to have furnished the original text of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia</hi> have been ascertained to be merely translations from
                    the Latin version. It is a safe conclusion to say that anything in Welsh
                    literature corresponding with portions or incidents of the French romances was
                    simply a translation made in the 13th or 14th century from a French original.
                    This refers, of course, to what is now extant, for there can be little question
                    that Breton and Cymric legend furnished the earlier romancists with names and
                    legends in plenty. Returning to the consideration of names, it is obvious that
                    when Lawnselot dy Lak appears in Welsh it is simply a corruption of the
                    Franco-English Lancelot, and that the Cymric writer had no idea of its
                    above-suggested origin in a British <hi rend="italic">lanc-e-loe</hi> (a
                    conjecture which is fortified by the pleonasm of <hi rend="italic">du-lak</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">del-lak)</hi> or in a French <hi rend="italic">l ’
                    ancillet.</hi> Consequently the original Lancelot story has left no trace in
                    purely Welsh literature. With Perceval we may think differently; the Welsh name
                    Pere-dur, under which he is known, is a sufficient warrant for supposing that
                    portions of the Welsh tale are at least as ancient as Walter Map. The very form
                    Pered-ur, like that of Arth-ur, is archaic, and with the latter it requires a
                    different interpretation from that which Welsh scholars have given it. Here it
                    may be observed that the terminal <hi rend="italic">ur,</hi> whatever may have
                    been its true sense, is remarkable for its frequent use in the names of Pictish
                    princes. As for Perceval, wherever Robert de Borron got the name (see below),
                    Walter Map, in adopting it for the hero of the story that belongs to Peredur,
                    made the two names thenceforward identical.</p>
                <p>Analysis of the Arthurian Romances.</p>
                <p>I. II. Arthur and the Round Table had no separate romance, or else it has
                    perished. It exists now substantially as part of Lancelot (III. ).</p>
                <p>1. Merlin.—Most of his story appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth and in Wace, from
                    whom it was probably worked up into a French poem (or prose work) by Robert de
                    Borron about 1160-70. The French prose composition, embracing his life and, as
                    an appendix, his prophecies (Latin by Geoffrey), was apparently written about
                    1200 (by Hélie de Borron) in the form in which it exists in certain MSS., and
                    nearly as it appears in printed books. Merlin, the son of an incubus, rescued at
                    his birth by sudden baptism from the malignant destiny for which his diabolical
                    parent had begotten him, is always described as a magician. He is called by the
                    Welsh Myrddin, a form which betrays the posteriority of the existing Cambrian
                    legends not only to the date of Geoffrey but also to the French romances; in one
                    of the earliest incidents of his story, however, he himself gives his name as
                    Ambrosius. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When we
                    remember that the Ambrosius Aurelius of Gildas was </p></note> He is represented
                    as living apparently at the time of the Saxon invasion of England. He was not a
                    friend of Vortigern; this king, whom we know from English sources to have been
                    attached more to the Saxons than to his countrymen, was represented in the old
                    Merlin story as a usurper reigning in an interval between Moines, son of
                    Constans, and the two brothers of Moines, Uter and Pendragon. After the
                    successive deaths of Vortigern and Pendragon (on whose fall Uter adds his
                    brother’s name to his own) Merlin continues to be the friend and counsellor of
                    King Uter Pendragon. In that capacity he helps the king to assume the shape of
                    Gorlais, duke of Tintagel, and thereby to beget Arthur upon the Duchess Yguerne.
                    (The name Pendragon and the action remind us of the fabulous birth of Alexander
                    the Great; the name Uter, in connexion with the go-between Merlin, and the
                    probable Celtic meaning of Yguerne remind us of Jupiter, Mercury, and Alcmena. )
                    The result is the birth of a hero who resembles both Hercules and Alexander. He
                    grows up and is held to be merely the son of Gorlais, in spite of the fact that
                    he was born after Yguerne (already a widow) had married Uter Pendragon; but he
                    proves his right to royal place after the king’s death by performing some
                    extraordinary feats. In these he has Merlin’s aid, as well as in the conduct of
                    his subsequent wars with the Gauls and the Saxons. Merlin has a lover or
                    mistress in Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, to whom in an unlucky moment (as
                    Samson to Delilah) he betrays a certain spell. She uses it to try her power,
                    without having learned the converse charm, and poor Merlin vanishes into the
                    midst of a thornbush, whence his voice can be heard; but he is seen no more.
                    Here the romance ends,—one of the most interesting, as well as one of the
                    best-constructed and most simply told of the Arthurian series. The name and
                    deeds of the enchanter have found their way into most modern literatures. One of
                    Merlin’s actions was to institute a round table at Carduel, at which room was
                    made for King Arthur and fifty of his nobles, with a vacant place for the Holy
                    Grail. This was a ceremony to be performed once every year, and it was on the
                    first of these occasions that Gorlais brought his wife Yguerne with him to
                    court, and that King Arthur fell in love with her (as David with Bathsheba).
                    This circumstance, although of later date than the original Merlin, leads us to
                    the next romance in the cycle.</p>
                <p>IV. 1. The Holy Grail.—The Grail romance began with Borron’s poem (or prose
                    narrative) on Joseph of Arimathea. An old tradition maintained that Joseph of
                    Arimathea (confounded in some respects with the centurion at the crucifixion and
                    with Josephus the historian) brought the gospel to Britain or to Gaul in the
                    first century of our era. The French romance on this subject, whichever of its
                    existent early forms in verse and prose was the earlier, relates the story thus
                    :—Pilate allowed Joseph to take down the body of Christ from the cross, and gave
                    Him also son vaisseul, by which was evidently meant the chalice of His passion,
                    or the cup used at the Last Supper. Of all the numerous interpretations
                    suggested for the word “grail” or “graal” the only tenable one is that of “cup,”
                    which plainly refers to the words “son vaisseul.” In that cup Joseph collected
                    the precious blood of his Saviour. He loses it when put in prison by the Jews,
                    but it is restored to him in probably the Arthur of Nennius and the romances,
                    and that Merlin was called Ambrosius Merlinus, we are drawn to believe in the
                    Romano-Briton origin of the stories, and to conclude that “Arthur” and “Merlin”
                    are two explicative or distinguishing epithets attached to the older names.</p>

                <p>his cell by Christ Himself. Vespasian, son of the emperor Titus, falls ill, hears
                    of Christ, frees Joseph from his prison, becomes a Christian, and reduces the
                    Jews to slavery. Joseph takes leave of Vespasian, goes forth with those who had
                    joined him and his brother-in-law Bron. After a while the adherents suffer
                    privation for having sinned secretly, and Joseph is directed by the voice of
                    Jesus speaking from the vaisseul (graal) to establish a test of righteousness
                    and sin by means of the holy blood, calling to remembrance His own words about
                    Judas, that “he who shall betray Me is eating and drinking with Me.” The place
                    of the rejected Judas should be filled, not at the table of the Last Supper, but
                    at another table which Joseph should make in token of it,—a square one, and not
                    until Brou’s grandson (the third man of Joseph’s lineage) should be fit to take
                    it. The table was constructed, a repast prepared, one place left empty, and the
                    Graal put upon the board, with some fish which had been caught by Bron for the
                    occasion. Those who could find a place at the board felt a sense of satisfaction
                    and were known to be righteous; those who could find no place were recognized as
                    the sinners whose secret licentiousness had caused the distress among them. Then
                    the name of graal was given to the vaisseul, because of its gracious and
                    delightful <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This simply

                    hypocrite named Moyse who attempts to sit at the table without avowing his sins
                    is swallowed up in the earth. Alan, the son of Bron, grows up to be head of the
                    line, and is entrusted with the knowledge of all things that Joseph could teach
                    and a sight of the Grail. He leads his kinsmen to the far West, to the vale of
                    Avaron or Avalon, whither the disciple Petrus or Perron precedes them with a
                    letter given him by Joseph, after he has seen the latter transfer to Bron the
                    custody of the vaisseul. The son of Alan is in due time to grow to manhood, to
                    read Peter’s letter, and again to see the Grail—a boon which is as it were to
                    renew the covenant of the Saviour with the family and followers of Joseph of
                    Arimathea—to expose and expel the false, and to bring celestial happiness upon
                    all the true. The race is now settled in Britain, and Perceval, the son of Alan,
                    is the third man who is to see the Grail, after having passed through a perilous
                    quest. Up to this point the mystic and pious romance of the Grail was derived by
                    Robert de Borron from sources other than those which furnished the Arthurian
                    stories; but the new realm of fiction was open (it was about 1160-70), and the
                    Franco-British tales coming to his knowledge must have supplied him with the
                    incidents of his third man’s quest and even the very name of Perceval. It is
                    difficult to assign the exact proportion of give and take among the early
                    romances; but at this point there is a new departure in which several writers
                    took various parts. </p>
                <p>IV. 2. Perceval.—The original story of the knight Perceval, before he takes up
                    the quest, is simply that of an inexperienced youth who knows nothing of arms
                    and chivalry, but whose rustic retirement with his mother has not deteriorated
                    the instincts of his noble birth. After some amusing incidents, in which his
                    youthful awkwardness is playfully depicted, he exhibits so much courage and
                    skill as to become a doughty champion, the vanquisher of bullies and the
                    protector of ladies; and, when he reaches the court of King Arthur, knighthood
                    is offered him. Chrestien de Troyes related the tale in verse (before 1191), but
                    he probably had it from the (prose or poetic) narrative woven (about 1170-75) by
                    Walter Map into his work which we call Lancelot. The agreement, so far, of those
                    writers and the text of the Mabinogi of Peredur on the same subject leads to a
                    supposition that the latter represents a Cambrian story older than Walter Map;
                    but the introduction of the cup and the lance into it invalidates the theory
                    that its existent Welsh form is the original. Robert de Borron continued his
                    Graal, by relating the quest of the holy vessel—still in the hands of Bron, le
                    Roi Pêclieour, but hidden from all save the predestined perfect knight—pursued
                    by Bron’s grandson Perceval, the only man who, by his origin, had a right to
                    search for and find it so as to fill the vacant place at the table. Robert de
                    Borron must have written his story more than once, and the result was that he
                    also introduced his hero to Arthur’s court, where Merlin had founded a round
                    table. This round table, probably an independent element in the Breton legends,
                    must have caught Robert de Borron’s fancy as lending a further symbol of trinity
                    (being the third table) to his own conception of the third descendant of Joseph
                    of Arimathea. In his relation of the quest Perceval (whom he in no way
                    identifies with the rustic Perceval or Peredur mentioned above) starts from
                    Arthur’s court, and after various adventures sees his grandfather, the Grail,
                    the lance, and the broken sword without knowing with whom he is or making
                    inquiry. In a second attempt he is more successful. Bron reveals himself,
                    explains all the signs (the lance is that which pierced the Saviour’s side), and
                    communicates the precious truths which Joseph of Arimathea had ordered to be
                    told only to the third of his lineage. Then the fisher-king dies; all the
                    enchantments of Britain pass away (we presume the reign of idolatry is meant);
                    and Perceval is left as the custodian of the Grail. This version of the Perceval
                    and the preceding Saint Graal, both by Robert de Borron, have only been printed
                    of late years (the former as a supplement to the latter) from rare and little
                    known MSS., and differ enormously from the old printed Grail and Perceval, and
                    most of the MSS. which contain them. The introduction, however slightly, of
                    Arthur, Merlin, and Gawain into Robert de Borron’s Perceval simply shows that he
                    had made acquaintance with Walter Map’s Lancelot; yet the large use made by Map
                    of the Frenchman’s Grail and Perceval implies that they wrote contemporaneously,
                    but that De Borron’s second part preceded Map’s second part. In the latter the
                    young rustic is represented as tne youngest son of King Pellinore, brought by an
                    elder brother out of his retirement and presented for an inferior class of
                    knighthood at Arthur’s court. He then meets all the other companions of the
                    Round Table, to whom, as well as to Arthur and Guinevere, he makes himself very
                    dear. He becomes one of the knights who undertake the quest of the Grail, a task
                    which is proposed for accomplishment by him who is the best knight in the world.
                    According to the Lancelot fiction he fails because of having slightly

                    one even purer than himself among the Round Table heroes, namely, Galaad, the
                    son of Lancelot. All this is of Map’s own invention, and much of it must have
                    been posterior to Chrestien’s poem, in which (although based partly on Map and
                    partly on Robert de Borron) Perceval remained the achiever of the quest. <note

                    contempt the pleasant episodes of Perceval’s youth as told by Chrestien. In
                    Wolfram von Eschenbach’s poem there is a long succession of Grail-kings,

                    applicable to Bron, Alan, or the last achiever. The British words of which it

                    people are confounded with the Templars, struggling against the heathens. The
                    romance of Perceval le Gallois, such as we have it since its first appearance in
                    print in 1530, is a prose compilation derived from the poem begun by Chrestien

                <p>III. Lancelot.—This hero, like Perceval, has furnished an addition to European
                    nomenclature. In this romance, which there is so much evidence for ascribing to
                    the celebrated Walter Map (see above), the substance of Geoffrey’s Arthur,
                    Guinevere, and Merlin was used as the introduction to a powerful fiction in
                    which a new hero, Lancelot of the Lake, carries on an adulterous amour with
                    Queen Guinevere, while at the same time he reveres and loves King Arthur and
                    performs deeds of heroic daring under the influence of the most generous
                    feelings. The tale, although lengthy and overladen with a crowd of adventures
                    which have no bearing on the direct development of the plot, and notwithstanding
                    the unpleasant nature of the chief subject, is one of extraordinary interest.
                    The character of Lancelot remains unaltered throughout the course of the story,
                    and is drawn with a masterly hand. Although his love is criminal, and he
                    frequently does pious penance for his sins, yet his utter self-sacrificing
                    devotion to the queen weakens by its exquisite fidelity the reader’s sense of
                    his treachery towards the king, whom he never ceases to regard with a feeling of
                    the deepest affection and reverence. His faults are such that he recognizes his
                    own incompetence to become the achiever of the quest; but he begets, upon
                    Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles, a son Galaad, to whom the glory of winning
                    the Grail and redeeming his father’s sins is reserved. Even here the romancer
                    takes care to show that he was not untrue to Guinevere, his senses having been
                    deceived by a spell (used by Elaine’s maid to gratify her mistress’s longing),
                    which makes him imagine that his bedfellow is the queen. Nemesis begins to work
                    when, upon a second use of the spell, Guinevere, after having waited for him in
                    vain, finds him in the arms of King Pelles’s daughter. She reproaches him
                    bitterly and drives him from her presence with such cruel words that he becomes
                    insane and wanders about the woods and fields like Nebuchadnezzar. Some years
                    elapse before he is recognized by Elaine, when chance takes him to the castle of
                    Corbin, in which King Pelles has custody of the Grail. She cures him by means of
                    the sacred vessel; but it is not long before he quits her again and finds his
                    way to Camelot. Arthur and the queen and his fellow-knights are rejoiced to see
                    the lost Lancelot again, and the usual round of tournaments begins. We now come
                    to the episode of Galaad. On the eve of Pentecost an old man dressed in white
                    brings a youth to Arthur’s court. When all the knights are assembled at the
                    ensuing banquet every seat is filled save that which was always left vacant for
                    the Holy Grail, so that there is no place for young Galaad. Certain wondrous
                    signs are pointed out by the old man which indicate that the “seat perilous” is
                    meant to be filled by the young hero, who at once accomplishes another test
                    which has foiled Gawain and Perceval. The Grail appears, and light and perfume
                    fill the hall; it passes away again, and the next day the knights depart upon
                    the quest of the holy vessel, Arthur giving way to a pathetic regret that his
                    merry company of Round Table champions is to be broken up for ever. Galaad, the
                    pure knight, is the only one who succeeds, and becomes king of the Holy City;
                    then Joseph of Arimathea appears, and Galaad dies, his task accomplished. Gawain
                    and Bors fail; Lancelot and Perceval nearly succeed, but are foiled. Bors brings
                    back an account of Perceval’s death, and Lancelot returns to court, a moody man;
                    he and Guinevere fall back into the old sin. The queen is accused of having
                    poisoned a knight, and is exposed to the usual ordeal. Lancelot saves her by
                    conquering her accuser, but receives wounds which break open at the next secret
                    meeting between them. Scandal has been busy; spies are on the watch; and,
                    although, when the lovers are surprised, he escapes by dint of hard fighting,
                    the stains of blood found in the queen’s bed are sufficient to condemn them. She
                    is doomed to the stake, but at the moment of execution Lancelot appears and
                    rescues her. They fly together to his castle of Joyeuse Garde, in which he is
                    soon besieged by King Arthur, the king’s nephew Gawain, and the other faithful
                    knights. He offers to give up the queen if no harm shall be done her; Arthur
                    rejects the offer; and, after long fighting, news comes of a papal interdict
                    promulgated against the kingdom so long as King Arthur refuses to take back his
                    wife. Guinevere is then received by her husband, but Arthur is advised by Gawain
                    to continue the war against Lancelot, whom he follows to his castle of Gannes in
                    France. During the siege Arthur has tidings of an insurrection in Britain: his
                    nephew Mordred has seized the throne, and the queen has fortified herself in
                    London against the usurper. He returns, and after a series of desperate battles
                    Mordred is killed and Arthur wounded to death. Flinging his sword away, the king
                    disappears from mortal view and is borne by fairies to Avalon. Lancelot also
                    returns to England, laments the king’s death, pays a mournful visit to the
                    queen, now in a nunnery, retires himself to a monastery, and dies soon
                    afterwards in sorrow and repentance. The original Lancelot was the true Arthur
                    or Round Table romance, although when first written it probably contained no
                    mention of Perceval and Galaad. To it all the other tales and episodes
                    gravitated, and the above analysis represents probably its final form about the
                    year 1200. When at a later period, in the 13th century, it was abridged, and the
                    Bret (Tristan) also, and both of them amalgamated in the general Arthurian work
                    now extant in many MSS. of the 14th and 15th centuries, the compilation came
                    into existence which was translated into English by Sir Thomas Malory under the
                    title Morte A rthur. The original complete Lancelot may be considered as a
                    corporate work including the five branches which had previously been separate,
                    namely, (1) Merlin; (2) Arthur and the Round Table; (3) Arthur, Guinevere, and
                    Lancelot; (4) Joseph of Arimathea and the Grail; the Quest of the Grail and
                    Perceval modified into (5) the new Quest of the Grail and Galaad. A sixth
                    element was added in the French compilation, which formed the original of the
                    Morte Arthur of Sir Thomas Malory, namely, (6) the story of Tristan and
                    Yseult.</p>
                <p>V. Tristan.—This beautiful Breton or Cornish romance was originally a work
                    totally independent of the Arthurian, Round Table, and Grail fictions; and, if
                    it is said by Hélie de Borron to have been left incomplete by its first author,
                    the Anglo-Norman knight Luc or Luces, of the castle of Gast, Galt, or Gau, near
                    Salisbury, and by Gasse li Blont (Eustace Blunt), who is spoken of as a
                    continuator, we may presume that his statement was based upon no deficiency in
                    the original narrative, but simply on the absence of all allusion to the Round
                    Table. He therefore set to work to produce what he called the Bret, or the
                    complete Tristan, by constructing a number of episodes which exhibit Tristan as
                    one of the Round Table knights, as also having engaged in the quest, and as
                    having been with his lady-love entertained for some time at Lancelot’s castle of
                    Joyeuse Garde. The Saracen knight Palamedes, who takes an important place in the
                    complete Tristan, and who is not one of the least interesting characters, seems
                    to have been one of the additions. Whether the first author was really a knight
                    or not, and whether he wrote in poetry or prose, it may here be said once for
                    all that the earliest exoteric reference to the authors of the Round Table
                    romances is that of Hélinand, who, writing close to the date of Walter Map’s
                    death (c. 1210), mentioned them as “quosdam proceres,” a phrase w <hi

                    probably part of the original tale. He goes with the absolved monarch to Ireland
                    at his request, and is prayed to accompany Yseult to Cornwall, whither her
                    father sends her as King Mark’s bride. Yseult’s mother delivers a philtre or
                    love-potion to Brangian (or Bronwen), her daughter's nurse, which the latter is
                    commissioned to give Yseult to drink on the wedding-day, in order that she may
                    conceive a true wifely affection for her stranger husband. Brangian, however,
                    gives' it to Tristan and Yseult, who drink, unconscious of the spell that is
                    about to influence their lives. They love each other at once and for ever.
                    During the voyage they land on an island, where Tristan, by overcoming an
                    enchantment, proves that he and his companion are the best knight and fairest
                    lady in all the world. They reach Cornwall at last, and think with dread on the
                    approach of the fatal night which is to separate them and to make King Mark
                    aware of his bride’s fault. A device, which appeared to the old romancers one of
                    easy performance, is suggested by Brangian, who, to save her mistress’s honour,
                    takes her place on the marriage night, trusting that King Mark’s carousals and
                    the darkness will cover the fraud. The scheme is carried out satisfactorily; but
                    the fair Yseult hires two ruffians to slay Brangian, lest the fact should ever
                    come to light. The intending murderers, however, are smitten with pity, and
                    simply leave their victim bound to a tree, from which position she is soon
                    afterwards rescued. As her rescuer was Palamedes, the Saracen knight, who must
                    be looked upon as one of the inventions of Hélie de Borron, we may venture to
                    hope that Yseult’s unwomanly cruelty formed no part of the original story.
                    Palamedes is a magnanimous and interesting character, who loves Yseult with a
                    purer love than Tristan, and who spends his life in a generous antagonism to his
                    rival. The man who invented Palamedes and Guiron must have been himself a knight
                    of the noblest type. The intrigue of the two lovers is carried on for some time,
                    till Mark’s suspicions are aroused and Tristan leaves Cornwall. Again he
                    receives by treachery a poisoned wound; but, as he cannot return to Mark’s court
                    to obtain healing at the hands of the fair Yseult, he decides upon going to
                    Brittany, to seek a remedy there from her cousin, the white-handed Yseult, who
                    is equally expert in treating wounds. She cures him and falls in love with him;
                    he marries her from gratitude. The description of the wedding night proves that
                    he still loves the other Yseult, for he remains faithful to her in the most
                    material point, the white-handed lady being so innocent that she is unaware of
                    the slight cast upon her charms. He makes his wife’s brother Peredur or Pheredur
                    his confidant, and the two quit Brittany together and reach Cornwall. A fresh
                    source of misery opens for him now, as Pheredur falls in love with fair Yseult.
                    Tristan becomes insane and wanders away; but after some time he is brought back
                    to the court, where Yseult restores him to reason, at the cost, however, of
                    reawakening the jealous wrath of King Mark, who compels him to quit Cornwall,
                    making him swear never to return. Hélie’s Tristan now joins the Round Table
                    company at King Arthur’s court, and King Mark, still unsatisfied, goes thither
                    also with the purpose of bringing about his nephew’s death. The unfavourable
                    view of Mark’s character is here heightened by making him speak and act in the
                    most ridiculous manner. Arthur reconciles the uncle and the nephew; Tristan goes
                    back with Mark, and frees Cornwall from an invasion by the Saxons; but he fails
                    to win favour from the king, who puts him in a dungeon. He is released by an
                    insurrection and King Mark himself is imprisoned; Tristan flies with Yseult and
                    is received in Joyeuse Garde by Lancelot, until King Arthur brings about a fresh
                    reconciliation, and Yseult is restored to Mark along with his kingdom. Tristan
                    now returns to his neglected wife, but finds that a revolt has fortunately saved
                    him from the necessity of repaying her devotion with caresses. He goes forth to
                    fight, and subdues the rebel count, but is sorely wounded again. The
                    white-handed lady tends him, cures him, and becomes his wife in deed as well as
                    in name. He quits her once more, and renews his secret intercourse with fair
                    Yseult in Cornwall, until discovery compels him to return to Brittany. In giving
                    his aid to the unsuccessful prosecution of an amour by his brother-in-law he is
                    once more poisonously wounded. He comes to such a dangerous pass that at last he
                    sends a secret messenger to fair Yseult, to bring her back with him if possible.
                    Should she be able and willing to come the ship is to be rigged with white
                    sails; with black, on the contrary, if the mission is unsuccessful. Tristan’s
                    anxiety comes to the knowledge of white-handed Yseult, who, seized with sudden
                    jealousy, when the white-sailed vessel comes gaily dancing over the waves, goes
                    to her sick husband and tells him that the sails are black. He bids her at once
                    farewell and dies of a broken heart. Fair Yseult, on reaching land, hears of his
                    death, makes her way to the chamber where his corpse is lying, and dies upon her
                    dead hero’s breast. Their bodies are conveyed to Cornwall, along with Tristan’s
                    sword, formerly Morhoult’s, and Mark learns the story of the love-potion. Seized
                    with pity, he has the two lovers buried not far from each other, and a wondrous
                    tree extends its branches to overshadow their two graves.</p>
                <p>Palamedes: Meliadus and Guiron.— This, the last romance written by any of the
                    original writers of the Round Table stories, was composed by Hélie de Borron
                    about 1220 at the desire of Henry III. of England (who paid him noble guerdon
                    for his labour). He had already made Palamedes (the Saracen knight finally
                    baptized and adopted to the Round Table) so prominent and so noble a character
                    in his Bret, or romance of Tristan, that the king wished for another book on the
                    subject. Since the story was to be one of knightly courtesy, its name should be
                    Palamedes. As that hero takes only a minor part in the transactions of the story
                    it is difficult to believe that he meant the name as other than a metaphor. The
                    book is divided into two distinct tales,—one relating the adventures of
                    Meliadus, who begat Tristan upon the adulterous queen of Scotland, and the other
                    those of a knight whose name appears here for the first time,—Guiron le
                    Courtois. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Guiron
                    appears to be the Breton or Cymric word which means “loyal,’ “true,” or
                    “honest," and is a Otting title for the hero. </p></note> Meliadus is a dull and
                    clumsy composition, chiefly remarkable for the circumstance that it alludes to
                    the Charlemagne romances, and includes among its personages Aryhoan of Saxony,
                    ancestor of Ogyers le Danois (Ogier the Dane). Even the account which it gives
                    of Tristan’s birth is wholly at variance with that which the writer had already
                    given (or accepted) in the romance of Tristan and Yseult. As for Guiron, the
                    beauty of his character redeems the tediousness of the narrative. From the point
                    of view of human noble-mindedness it is the best of all the Arthurian tales,
                    Guiron being equally free from the criminal sensuality of Lancelot and Tristan
                    on the one hand, and distant from the superangelical purity of Galaad and
                    Perceval on the other. Under the most trying circumstances he keeps himself
                    chastely aloof from sin, although love is mutual between himself and his
                    friend’s wife; and, when on one occasion he reflects how near he has been to the
                    verge of criminality, he strikes his own sword into his breast as a punishment.
                    It is needless to say that he does not die but lives to see that same friend,
                    Denain le Roux, carry off a maiden on whom he (Guiron) has bestowed a more
                    justifiable affection. When, after a year’s vain search, he meets his false
                    friend and his ravished lady-love together, he fights and conquers Denain but
                    spares his life, and goes away with the lady, still in love with her. Denain
                    exhibits his friendship and gratitude effectually afterwards, but the story is
                    left unfinished, Guiron and Bloye having been entrapped by treachery and lying
                    still within the walls of a dungeon. The author refers to his Meliadus for an
                    account of their liberation; but this simply shows that he intended to rewrite
                    Meliadus. Fifty or sixty years later Rusticien of Pisa abridged the Palamedes,
                    and inserted the incidents of the two in his compilation of Arthurian romances,
                    now lost as a whole, although usually confounded with the Morte Arthur. From his
                    compilation the printed Meliadus and Guiron were further abridged and finally
                    printed so in separate form.</p>
                <p>Ysaie le Triste, Arthus de Bretaigηe, and Ρerceforest are three romances which
                    had also considerable vogue, but, although they belong to the Arthurian cycle,
                    they have no real connexion beyond the use of British names and the supposed
                    kinship of the heroes with those of the old stories. Almost as much might be
                    alleged against the Meliadus and the Gτιiron, but they were at least written by
                    one of the first authors of the genuine works, and he had presumably some
                    acquaintance with the British folk-legends. The fact that Rusticien of Pisa
                    about 1270-75 abridged and compiled in a single great book the scattered and
                    discordant stories of the earlier period, at the request of Prince Edward
                    (afterwards Edward I.) of England, is universally conceded. That compilation has
                    never been printed; it is even uncertain whether any MS. in existence represents
                    it, for, although the English Morte Arthur is usually supposed to have been
                    compendiously translated from it, we may infer with greater probability that Sir
                    Thomas Malory used an earlier compilation, perhaps the work of Hélie de Borron.
                    One reason to justify such a conjecture may be found in the absence of Guiron
                    and Meliadus from the English book, which would hardly be the case if the former
                    notion were correct, since we know that Rusticien published an abridged text of
                    those two works. Rusticien’s compilation could in fact only be recovered
                    approximately by reuniting the texts of the various Arthurian romances as
                    printed in French in the 15th and 16th centuries,—these abridged and inferior
                    texts having apparently been derived or rewritten from his book, not from MSS.
                    of the separate old romances. The Morte Arthur was printed by Caxton from Sir
                    Thomas Malory’s MS. translation or adaptation made in England not many years
                    before the printer’s establishment at Westminster. As an early English text and
                    as the only existing homogeneous embodiment of the ancient Franco-British
                    romances, it is of the highest interest, while at the same time it breathes the
                    earnest and simple feeling which animates the originals, — differing thus loto
                    coelo from the colder, more artificial, and less interesting narratives which
                    were invented in tho 15th century, and of which the Ysaie, Arthus de Bretaigne,
                    and Pereef orest are examples. All three may be referred to the first half of
                    that century, although it has been alleged that the second was written in the
                    14th. Ysaie forestalls to some extent the type of the 16th and 17th century
                    French romances. It is an early instance <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0672-0649"/>of the use of a favourite device in later fiction,
                    by which fairies are introduced who bestow special gifts at the birth of a hero;
                    and amongst its chief personages is the misshapen dwarf Tronc, afterwards named
                    Aubron—that is, Oberon—and made beautiful. He was adopted from the old French
                    story of Huon de Bordeaux, just as the Oberon of the latter had his origin in
                    the Elberich of the Heldenhuch. The original composition of Pereeforest has been
                    assigned without reason to the 13th century, and it is possible that some
                    insignificant portion of the romance may have been written in the 14th; but the
                    probability is that David Aubert was the real author of the extant work, and
                    that he wrote it at the court of Burgundy about 1450. It would be difficult to
                    imagine a work more absurd, heterogeneous, and wearying in its immensity than
                    this. The very “variety” for which Dunlop praises it merely indicates the mass
                    of multifarious and incongruous incidents, unconnected and uninteresting, of
                    which it is full. Antiquaries, however, find it useful for the history of those
                    knightly sports called tournaments, immense numbers of which are described in
                    minute detail. Arthur of Little Britain must have been considered a very
                    interesting romance when Lord Berners translated it into English, but we cannot
                    discover its attractiveness. It is a dull inartistic composition, with scarcely
                    any distinctiveness in the drawing of its personages.</p>
                <p>A great number of poetic and prose compositions, beginning with chansons and
                    fabliaux in the 12th and 13th centuries, form a large portion of the literature
                    of Arthurian romance; but in most instances they deal only with episodes, and
                    are better described in the articles relating to the literature to which they
                    belong than they could be, or ought to be, here. Some of them may, however, be
                    mentioned briefly in chronological succession. In the 12th century —that is,
                    between 1170 and 1200—Arnaud Daniel the troubadour wrote a poem, now quite lost,
                    on Lancelot and Guinevere; Chrestien de Troyes the trouvère wrote one entitled
                    the Charrette, i.e., in reference to Lancelot’s unknightly mode upon one
                    occasion of hurrying to the rescue of Guinevere in a cart for want of a horse;
                    this story was continued by Godefroi de Leigni. Chrestien wrote another poem on
                    (Peredur) Perceval, which was continued by three other hands, in which Perceval
                    remains the achiever of the Grail-quest. He also wrote Eree et Enide, a poem
                    which contains the same substance as the Welsh story of Geraint in the
                    Mabinogion, and which never appeared in any of the Arthurian romances; and the
                    Chevalier au Lyon, which is similarly identical with the Lady of the Fountain in
                    the Mabinogion. Owen or Ywain, the Chevalier au Lyon, is a prominent Round Table
                    knight in the romances, but his story is not incorporated in them. Hartmann von
                    der Aue translated Chrestien’s poem into German verse before 1200; in English it
                    appeared as Twain and Gawain in the 14th century; another English poem, ∕S⅛'r
                    Gawaine and the Green Knight, was written about 1360, as well as a Scottish
                    Golagrus and Gawaine, in the 14th century. A poem, dated 1212, containing Le
                    Roman de Joseph JA∣imathix, has been published by Francisque Michel, and is
                    supposed by many to be Robert de Borron’s original work. Its substance is the
                    same as the first part of the prose Petit Graal, which Hucher has published as
                    Borron’s real original. About the same time, or a few years earlier, Ulrich von
                    Zatzikhoven translated Arnaud Daniel’s Lancelot into German verse; the lost
                    Perceval in verse of Guyot de Provins and Wolfram von Eschenbach’s metrical
                    German version of it (in which he miscalls the trouvère “Kiot der Provenzal ”)
                    have already been mentioned. There is an early German poem called Wigalois,
                    composed by Wirnt of Grafenberg (i.c., Gui, son of Gawain), evidently derived
                    soon after 1200 from a French original, Gui Galeis or Giglan, which is lost. On
                    Gawain himself there are two French poems by Raoul and Renault or Raoul de
                    Beaujeu, of the 13th century; and one of Chrestien de Troyes’s chansons (before
                    1200) celebrates Cliges, a nephew of Gawain. A French poem on Merlin dates from
                    about 1300. There is a Petit Tristan or Brun de la Montagne, written in verse in
                    the 14th century. The French poems of Marie de France, written in England early
                    in the 13th century, contain lays of Lanνal and of Chevrc-feuille (on Tristan),
                    which are professedly Arthurian subjects. Of the English works on the Round
                    Table romances the chief are the metrical History of the Grail, translated early
                    in the 15th century by Henry Lonelich, and published from a MS. by ’the
                    Roxburghe Club, and Sir Thomas Malory’s Morte Arthur. An English prose romance
                    of Merlin was written about 1450, and a metrical Arthour and Merlin is probably
                    fifty or sixty years older. A further Life of Arthur in English verse is
                    supposed to have been composed about 1428. There is a metrical version of
                    Renault de Beaujeu’s Giglan, probably of the latter part of the 14th century.
                    Two poems both entitled Morte Arthur exist, one written about 1390, which
                    especially treats of King Arthur, and another belonging to the middle of the
                    15th century, of which the story of Lancelot is the subject-matter; and there is
                    a Scottish Lancelot of the Laik in verse, which was composed late in that
                    century. A romance of the Seint Graal, in verse, written about 1350, was
                    probably a translation of Robert de Borron’s Joseph d'Arirnathix. Between 1838
                    and 1849 Lady Charlotte</p>
                <p>Guest printed and translated the Mabinogion (Children’s Stories) from the Welsh
                    MS. known as the Llyfr Coeh o Hergest, transcribed late in the 14th century, and
                    now preserved at Oxford, in the library of Jesus College. At first it was
                    believed that these stories, so far as they agreed with the narratives of the
                    printed French romances, were copies of the original legends used by Walter Map
                    and the Borrons; but there can be little doubt that only those portions which
                    are not found in the romances are of independent Celtic or Cambrian origin,
                    while the remainder was derived from the French stories or poems of the 13th and
                    14th centuries.</p>

                    Frankish romance.</p>
                <p>We know from Eginhard that the Frankish heroic ballads were reduced to writing by
                    Charlemagne’s order, and thus the first step was taken which led to the creation
                    of similar ballads about himself and his principal warriors. His own large and
                    catholic spirit seems to have embraced all the people within his dominions, and
                    thus indirectly brought about the official employment of the French language in
                    the famous compact between his grandsons in 841. He was then only twenty-eight
                    years dead, yet his influence was still so mighty that even the Gauls and
                    Aquitanians are declared in a 9th-century chronicle to have gloried in bearing
                    the name of Franks. This both implies an amalgamation of the two races more
                    complete than is usually believed, and accounts for the creation of French as
                    well as of Frankish ballads on the life and exploits of Charlemagne in the
                    second half of the 9th century. The number of persons who could speak only
                    Theotisc (Teutonic language) and of those who could speak the two languages was
                    of course constantly diminishing, and the <hi rend="italic">chanson de
                    geste</hi> soon displaced the <hi rend="italic">Heldengedicht</hi> within the
                    limits of modern France. Of all the French ballads current in the 9th and lθth
                    centuries some have perished utterly, others survive only in later refusions;
                    the most ancient now extant is the <hi rend="italic">Chanson de Roland,</hi> in
                    the modified form which was given to it soon after 1066 by a Norman called
                    Turold. This poem contains so many references to others on Charlemagne and his
                    <hi rend="italic">douze pairs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">paladins</hi> as to make
                    it certain that such a ballad-literature existed in the 9th and lθth centuries.
                    None of the existing <hi rend="italic">chansons de geste</hi> represents those
                    older forms; all are rifaci-menti of the 12th and l3th centuries, and bear
                    evidence of additions, interpolations, and arbitrary changes. In the 13th
                    century we find the older episodical ballads rearranged in the form of “cyclic
                    poems,” and falling into three groups, which take each its name from the central
                    personage or subject. One is the <hi rend="italic">Geste</hi> of the king
                    (Charlemagne, his father, and grandfather); the next is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geste</hi> of Provence or of Garin de Montglane; and the third, the most
                    heterogeneous, is the <hi rend="italic">Geste</hi> of Doon of Mayence. Each of
                    these is composed of many separate parts, but the first may be generally
                    described as the entire mythical history of Charles the Great, his family, and
                    his faithful peers; the second a separate and independent set of narratives
                    concerning his conquest of Narbonne; the third a history of his wars with
                    rebellious vassals and with traitors, including Ganelon, through whom the peers
                    were defeated and slain at Roncesvalles. The number and names of the peers are
                    variously given in nearly all the poems, but Roland and Oliver are included in
                    all the lists, united as in a proverbial English phrase. Roland is the daring
                    warrior, Oliver the wise one; the one is the Achilles, the other the Ulysses of
                    the Carolingian epopee. Many of the early <hi rend="italic">chansons</hi> give
                    the name of Turpin, archbishop of Rheims (an actual historical contemporary of
                    Charlemagne), as one of the <hi rend="italic">pairs,—</hi> warrior and priest
                    combined; and there is a chronicle bearing his name which has furnished the

                    >Pseudo-Chronicle of Turpin</hi> was written in Latin, by various hands and in
                    various places between 1000 and 1150, being apparently constructed from the <hi
                    rend="italic">chansons</hi> for the purpose of forging history to suit monastic
                    ends. It took its final and existing form between 1160 and 1180, when edited by
                    Géoffroy de Brueil, and was for many centuries regarded as actual history. This
                    work was not the first so-called history which embodied monastic fiction in the
                    narrative of Charlemagne’s career. A monk of St Gall wrote about 890 a chronicle
                    <hi rend="italic">De Gestis Karoli Magni,</hi> based partly upon oral tradition,
                    in which certain fabulous incidents appeared for the first time, such as
                    Pippin’s fight with the lion, and the conversation about the Iron Emperor
                    between Ottokar the Frank (better known as Ogier the Dane) and the Lombard king
                    Desiderius, on the walls of Pavia, when Charlemagne was advancing to besiege it.
                    Another fabulous incident of great moment in the romances is Charlemagne’s
                    supposititious journey to the Holy Land, which was related for the first time by
                    Benedict, monk of St André, about 968, in his <hi rend="italic">Descmptio
                    qualiter Carolus M. Clavum et Coroηam Domini a C onstantinopli Aquisgrani
                    attulemt.</hi></p>
                <p>A great deal of historical truth underlies the absurdities of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Turpin Chronicle</hi> and the rhapsodies of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chansons de geste.</hi> Compare Roland, Legend of. In fact all the older poetic
                    literature of this cycle is based upon purely historical events and real
                    personages; it is only at a later date that the events are multiplied or
                    variously misapplied, and that the personages also are arbitrarily distorted and
                    augmented, according to the fancy and local sentiments of the various writers.
                    As for the language in which the older poems were written, the idea that they
                    were chiefly the work of troubadours in the <hi rend="italic">langue d <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> oc</hi> is now abandoned. Gaston Paris holds the
                    curious theory that the French language <hi rend="italic">(langue d <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> oiΓ)</hi> was popularly current over the north of
                    Italy, instancing the works of Rusticien of Pisa as an illustration, besides
                    certain works in Italianized French which belong to this class. Such a notion
                    cannot be accepted readily, as we know that the <hi rend="italic">langue
                    d’oc</hi> was the general language of southern France, western Spain, and
                    north-west Italy. But it is possible that the French language <hi rend="italic"
                    >(langue d <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> οiΓ)</hi> may have been used as a
                    general literary vehicle for the Charlemagne cycle of poetical fiction, and that
                    Rusticien or Rustighello may have compiled an abridgment of the Frankish
                    stories. Such a work, if it ever existed, has perished; and it is in the Italian
                    language of Tuscany that we find the first prose compilation of Carolingian
                    romance. The <hi rend="italic">Reali di Francia</hi> (Princes of France), if it
                    had been completed, -would have occupied a corresponding position to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morte Arthur</hi> of the British cycle; for, while no such popular
                    compilation appears to have ever been made in France itself and in the French
                    tongue (unless the late 15th-century <hi rend="italic">Fierabras</hi> may be
                    considered to take that rank), the <hi rend="italic">Reali</hi> in verse and in
                    prose was current in Italy early in the 14th century. From some peculiarities in
                    the language it is conjectured that the author, although writing in Tuscan, was
                    a Venetian. In France at the same period we find only the separate fictions,
                    mostly in verse, but a few in prose. The first French prose compilation of the
                    whole cycle was made by David Aubert in 1458 for Philip of Burgundy; but it Λvas
                    dead-born and has never been printed. The second, in three books, was made a few
                    years later by Jean Bagnyon, for Henri Bolomier, canon of Lausanne; it was first
                    printed in 1478, and is entitled in some editions <hi rend="italic">La Coηqueste
                    que fist Charlemagne es Espaigηes,</hi> and in others <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fierabras</hi>; both titles are insufficient, having apparently been merely
                    created to supply the lack of a general heading. The first section is a summary
                    chronicle of the history of the Franks from Clovis to Charlemagne, the second an
                    abridgment of the old poem of <hi rend="italic">Fierabras,</hi> and the third an
                    account of the Spanish expedition, taken from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pseudo-Turpin.</hi> This work became very popular in and out of France, and
                    most readers during the 16th and 17th centuries derived their entire knowledge
                    of the Charlemagne romance from it. Although the French prose works of the cycle
                    were for the most part very late in their construction, there were three French
                    prose translations or adaptations of the <hi rend="italic">Turpin Chronicle</hi>
                    executed soon after 1200.</p>
                <p>The names as well as the offices of the <hi rend="italic">douze pairs</hi> varied

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0674-0651"/>considerably in the earlier <hi rend="italic"
                    >chansons.</hi> The final conception appears to be that which is contained in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Eierabras;</hi> but the substitution of new personages for
                    the old ones is so great that it is not possible to regard the <hi rend="italic"
                    >douze pairs</hi> as a definite set of <hi rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi>
                    on the stage. Nor indeed do any of the heroes of the printed prose romances
                    belong to that society, however frequently its members appear in their stories.
                    Originally it would seem that some fortuitous coincidence between the number of
                    the apostles and the number of the captains who headed Charlemagne’s
                    evangelizing expedition into Spain had been utilized by some of the monkish
                    legendaries, and thus the early <hi rend="italic">chansons</hi> became affected
                    with a mystic respect for the <hi rend="italic">douze pairs.</hi> But each
                    writer allowed himself the licence of excluding and including any warrior he
                    chose in that number. The <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Turpin</hi> makes no
                    reference to such a society, although it gives the names of the more celebrated
                    knights. The full story of Roland has no prose romance to itself (see Roland,
                    Legend of). The story of Oliver is in similar case, unless the prose romance of
                    <hi rend="italic">Galien,</hi> Oliver’s son, may be held to embody it. Régnault
                    de Montauban (the chief of the four sons of Aymon), Huon of Bordeaux, Amys and
                    Milles, Jourdain, Galien, Maugis, Mabrian, and many other heroes of the printed
                    romances are unknown to the earliest ballad-histories of Charlemagne and his
                    barons. Ogier the Dane seems to have grown out of two historical personages, a
                    real Otlιger or Ottokar, a Frankish margrave of Charlemagne’s time, and a real
                    Olgar or Hulger, a Danish or Norse warrior who plundered Aix-la-Chapelle some
                    seventy odd years after the Frankish Othger had accompanied Roland into Spain.
                    Othger fought with the Lombards against Charlemagne in 773; and Amys and Milles,
                    in the battle in which they won the crown of martyrdom, are said to have fallen
                    by his hand. Beaten by the emperor, he became his vassal and five years later
                    commanded the advanced guard of the army whose rear-guard was destroyed at
                    Roncesvalles. M. Gaston Paris has admirably discussed the historical bearings
                    and the various phases of the original <hi rend="italic">chansons de geste</hi>
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire Poétique de Charlemagne,</hi> but has
                    dismissed with a brief reference all the printed prose romances we are now about
                    to consider.</p>
                <p>The Reali di Francia exists both in metrical and in prose form, and it is
                    difficult to decide which is the earlier; the metrical version was certainly
                    current in the 13th century, and there seems little reason to doubt that the
                    prose story was in existence before 1300. The latter was first printed at Modena
                    in 1491. It is a general work on the subject of Frankish romantic history, and
                    is divided into six books, of which the subjects are as follows :—(1) Clovis and
                    Rizier; (2) Fioravante and Rizier; (3) Ottaviano de Leone (the emperor Octavian
                    and his sons Florent and Lion); (4) Buovo d’Antonna (Bevis of Hampton); (5)
                    Buovo avenged by his sons Guido and Sinibaldo and King William of England; (6)
                    birth of Charlemagne, death of Pippin and his natural sons. Thus we may conclude
                    that it was, so far as printed under the name Rxali, the first part of a
                    compilation of all the Charlemagne cyclical stories. The first book of the
                    continuation Aspramοntx, a translation from the French poem of Aspremont <hi
                    rend="subscript">1</hi> or rather a prose composition from an Italian version of
                    that poem, exists in MS. The Reali di Franxia has been drawn upon by many later
                    writers.</p>
                <p>Chronicle of the Pseudo-Turpin.—The early part of this work was evidently forged
                    by some monk interested in exalting the glory of St James’s shrine at Padron in
                    Galicia (Spain), before it was transferred to Compostella. He represents St
                    James as appearing in successive visions to Charlemagne, urging him to conquer
                    Spain, the land in which the saint’s bones are laid and of which the Saracens
                    are masters. Charlemagne advances with a Frankish army and besieges Pamplona,
                    which is invincible to his arms, but falls a prey to his prayers. After further
                    exploits and the foundation of many churches, he returns home, but is brought
                    out again very speedily by news that the Saracen king, Aigoland, has once more
                    seized the country. This king is borrowed from the older chansons relating to
                    the war against the Lombards; but for the 12th century all Charlemagne’s foes
                    were Saracens. The topographical difficulty is made light of, and Aspremont is
                    placed in Spain. Roland, Oliver, and Ganelon (afterwards infamous for his
                    treachery, the hereditary result of his kinship to the family of which Doon of
                    Mayence was the head) distinguish themselves; Aigoland is beaten and killed.
                    Charlemagne next attacks Navarre, where his paladins enter into single combat
                    with the heathen giant Ferracute, who vanquishes all but Roland, and is overcome
                    by the latter by means of a stratagem. Cordova is next conquered and taken
                    possession of, and Charlemagne retraces his steps, but remembers that he has
                    left two other Saracen kings unsubdued— Marsilius and Baligant—in Saragossa. He
                    sends Ganelon to claim tribute from them; they contrive to rouse the predestined
                    spirit of traitorousness in the envoy, and he returns with a false tale, which
                    leads the monarch to forget military precautions by dividing his army into two
                    portions. He himself with the advanced half passes the Pyrenees in safety, but
                    Roland, Oliver, and the rear-guard are suddenly attacked in the pass of
                    Roncesvalles. All perish in the fight except Roland, who, mortally wounded, dies
                    alone in the wild mountain gorge, after having flung his famous sword away, and
                    blown such a blast upon his horn that it bursts and the sound reaches the ears
                    of Charlemagne. The emperor returns to Roncesvalles, slays the Saracen host,
                    recovers the body of Roland and gets it embalmed, and causes Ganelon to be torn
                    to pieces by wild horses. After a time his health suffers and his death
                    approaches. Turpin becomes aware of a multitude of demons who are preparing to
                    carry off the emperor’s soul on account of his sins. They are foiled, however,
                    by St Denis, who, in return for Charlemagne’s benevolence towards the church,
                    rescues his soul and bears it to heaven.</p>
                <p>Fierabras. —The basis of this romance was the lost poem upon the amir Balan, a
                    Saracen leader conquered by Charlemagne in Italy; the rest of the book was put
                    together from Turpin and other sources so as to form the one general prose
                    romance of Charlemagne. The scene is changed from Italy to Spain in the prose
                    romance. Fierabras, the giant, is son of Balan, and, after having sacked Rome,
                    is met by the Frankish host; Oliver encounters and defeats him in single combat;
                    the giant is converted and baptized by the name of Florent, and receives half
                    his father’s kingdom when his father is conquered and slain. Floripas, sister of
                    Fierabras, marries Gui de Bourgogne, who takes the other half. The Spanish prose
                    Historia del Emperador Carlo Magno, printed in 1528, is a translation; there is
                    also a German version.</p>
                <p>Guerin de Montglave (or properly Garin de Montglane).—This romance of the 15th
                    century is based upon the 13th-century poems on Girard de Vienne and Aimeri de
                    Narbonne of “le clerc Bertrand.” It is a spirited and entertaining fiction
                    relating the adventures of the four sons of Garin, one of the heroes of the
                    elder Provençal cycle, and is misnamed, in so far as it contains only the story
                    of his family, not of himself. The four sons are sent forth to seek adventures.
                    Arnaud, the eldest, asserts his right to the dukedom of Aquitaine against a
                    usurper who has succeeded on his uncle’s death. He is treacherously persuaded to
                    seek the hand of the princess Fregonde, daughter of the Saracen sultan of
                    Lombardy. His traitorous kinsman, Hernault, contrives to set Arnaud and the
                    sultan at enmity, and Arnaud is flung into a dungeon, where the daughter, ready
                    to accept Christianity for love of him, secretly visits him. Hernault
                    apostatizes and goes back with a promise of the sultan’s help to conquer
                    Aquitaine for himself, but turns aside from some qualm of conscience to confess
                    his sins to a giant hermit, who happens to have been an old comrade of Garin.
                    Thus learning the péril of Arnaud, the giant hermit Ribastre slays Hernault,
                    and, seeking assistance from another old comrade, a converted magician named
                    Perdigon, sallies forth to the aid of the imprisoned hero. In disguise he
                    obtains admittance to the captive and the princess, baptizes the latter, kills
                    the jailer, and sends Arnaud forth free to reconquer Aquitaine and to bring aid,
                    while he and the lady hold the dungeon-tower, which is at once besieged by the
                    sultan. After numerous fights, in which Perdigon’s magic is the chief actor,
                    Ribastre and the princess get aλvay without having received help from Aquitaine,
                    and on reaching that land find Arnaud a prisoner in the power of Hernault’s
                    uncle. Ribastre kills the latter; Arnaud is restored to his duchy and marries
                    Fregonde; the sultan turns Christian; and all ends well. But the romance does
                    not close here; it proceeds to narrate the honours which fall to the other sons,
                    Milon do Pouille, Regnier de' Gênes, and Girard de Vienne, or de Toulouse,
                    through the favour of Charlemagne, who feels himself bound to Garin’s family in
                    consequence of the obligation attached to a rash game of chess formerly lost by
                    him to that hero. How <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ever, when Arnaud’s son has
                    grown up, an accidental affront put upon the empress by him changes
                    Charlemagne’s friendly feeling to hate. He makes a long war upon Girard in
                    Vienne, who is aided by his brother, and it is agreed at last to settle the
                    affair by a duel betw <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> een Roland, the emperor’s
                    nephew’, and Oliver, the son of Regnier de Gênes. The two had previously become
                    fast friends, and Roland loves Aude, Oliver’s sister; consequently, although
                    they fight with great vigour and equality of strength, they throw aside their
                    swords in the middle of the combat and embrace one another as worthy
                    brothers-in-arms. A fitting compromise is found between the warring parties in
                    an agreement that they shall all unite and attack the Saracen conquerors of
                    Spain. Then begins the famous expedition which ended at Roncesvalles.</p>

                <p>Galien le Khetori.—T[\vi romance was first printed in 1500. It is partly of late
                    composition, although sufficiently ancient to have rendered the word “rhetoré”
                    (ι.c., rhetorized, or narrated in elegant prose) incomprehensible at the time of
                    its impression. The word was supposed to mean “restored,’ and to indicate the
                    restoration of chivalry by Galien. The chief substance of the story was the
                    ancient tide of Charlemagne’s journey to the East and the Turpin Chronicle.
                    Hugues, emperor of Constantinople, at first receives the Frankish emperor and
                    his peers courteously, but is informed by a spy of certain vaunting expressions
                    to which, as is the Frankish manner, they have given utterance amongst
                    themselves after supper. These “gabes,” as they are called, are merely
                    frolicsome braggadocio, spoken in lightheartedness, and not intended to convey
                    any serious intention. The spy and the Greek emperor, however, take them as the
                    threats of dangerous magicians; the Franks are seized and menaced with death if
                    they fail to fulfil their words. Oliver is first put to the test; his speech had
                    had reference to the Greek princess Jacqueline, and might better have befitted
                    the lips of a Parisian gamin of to-day than of a young paladin. He, however,
                    awakens a tender interest in the lady’s heart, and she indulgently informs her
                    father the next morning that the knight’s boast has been fulfilled. Hugues
                    requires that the others shall also exhibit their power, which they do to his
                    satisfaction, partly by celestial succour and partly by the use of mother-wit.
                    He finally dismisses them with presents. After Oliver has gone, Jacqueline
                    becomes the mother of Galien, who grows up in time to hear of the expedition to
                    Spain and to arrive just too late for the battle in the pass of Roncesvalles.
                    His dying father there acknowledges him, and Galien signalizes himself in the
                    renewed fighting in which Charlemagne takes reprisals for the loss of his peers
                    and the treachery of Ganelon. After various deeds of valour in the West, Galien
                    returns to the East, saves his mother from a shameful death, and resumes the
                    imperial crown.</p>
                <p>Milles et Amys.—The prose romance in its existing form was written in the 15th
                    century, and first printed by Vérard about 1503. The martyrdom of the two
                    friends is supposed to have taken place in 774 in Charlemagne’s war against the
                    Lombards, and their story was popularly current in the 12th century. Milles was
                    the son of Anceaume, count of Clermont, and Amis the son of the count’s
                    seneschal. Milles’s parents celebrate his birth by making a pilgrimage to
                    Jerusalem. During their adventures and captivity in the East Milles is robbed of
                    his inheritance at home and Amys is brought up under a feigned name. They enter
                    into the closest friendship and set out for Constantinople, where Milles
                    discovers his captive mother acting as nurse to the Greek princess Sidoine, whom
                    by her assistance he weds, after having taken a chief part in forcing the sultan
                    of Acre to raise the siege of Constantinople. He becomes emperor of Byzantium,
                    but after a while returns to France with Amys, regains possession of his
                    estates, and makes Amys a duke. Hearing that the Saracens have again attacked
                    Constantinople and that his Greek wife has perished in the flames, he allows
                    himself to be seduced by Bellisant, the daughter of Charlemagne, who, however,
                    makes an honest man of him by marriage and behaves honourably ever after. Amys
                    also gets married. Then the two friends also go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem,
                    from which Amys returns stricken with leprosy. His wife refuses to receive him,
                    but he is carefully tended by Milles in his own castle; and now the most
                    striking episode in the story takes place. Amys learns in a dream that lie can
                    only be healed by bathing in the blood of his friend’s offspring and tells
                    Milles of it. The latter is painfully affected, but does not hesitate to strike
                    off the heads of his two children. Amys is cured and the devotion of Milles
                    repaid by a miracle from heaven: the children’s heads are replaced upon their
                    shoulders. Afterwards Milles and Amys set out on another pilgrimage to Santiago
                    de Compostella. Ogier the Dane, then at war with Charlemagne, meets and
                    treacherously slays them on their way homeward. A continuation follows,
                    narrating the adventures of the infant children of Milles. The widow of Amys
                    plots for their destruction, but they are zealously tended by a wise ape, which
                    shares their fortunes until separated from them by malice and mishap. Florisset
                    becomes a Saracen leader hi Venice and Anceaume a brave warrior in the army of
                    Charlemagne. The two brothers have a desperate encounter in the war which takes
                    place, but are recognized by the ape (which has already brought about the
                    punishment of the wicked widow of Amys, in a similar fashion to that of the
                    celebrated dog of Mont-argis). A restoration takes place: the two young men are
                    acknowledged the emperor’s grandsons, and the ape dies of joy.</p>
                <p>Jourdain dx Blaves (or de Βlaye).—The prose romance, first printed in 1520, is
                    altered from a 15th-century poem. It is affiliated to Milles et Amys, the hero
                    being the grandson of Amys. He undergoes the most varied fortunes: he throws his
                    wife with his yet unborn child into the sea, enclosed in a box, when the vessel
                    bearing himself and his warriors is in peril of shipwreck; he searches for her
                    some years later, and finds her in a refuge, to which she has fled from the love
                    of the man who fished her out of the sea, and who exposed her baby-girl at the
                    birth; and next, when hunting in a forest, he finds his daughter running wild in
                    company with a bitch and her young. This is a reflexion of the story of
                    Apollonius of Tyre, and is rather a dull work.</p>
                <p>Doon of Mayence. —Doon or Doolin of Mayence is the hero of a 14th-century poem,
                    adapted as a prose romance in the 15th century, first printed by Vérard in 1501.
                    He is represented as defying and almost defeating his lord the emperor, whom he
                    treats at first with disrespect. In his earlier history he appears as a son of
                    Gui of Mayence, who, as penance for an unintentional crime, retires to a
                    hermitage. On his disappearance his wife is accused of murder, condemned to
                    death, and her children banished. Doon meets his father and returns to fight as
                    his mother’s champion, conquers his enemies, and assumes his rightful
                    possessions. He falls in love with a Saracen princess and wins her by force,
                    with the help of Charlemagne, after the episode of his quarrel with the emperor.
                    The lady’s father has been aided by the king of Denmark; Doon, after his
                    victory, seizes the Danish crown, which he transmits through his son Geoffrey to
                    his grandson Ogier.</p>
                <p>Ogier le Danois.—There are twelve chansons upon the story of this hero, dating
                    from the 12th and 13th centuries, and based upon still older poems now lost. The
                    trouvères Raimbert and Adenez le Roi were among the authors. The story was
                    recomposed in prose, from the poem of the latter writer, probably in the second
                    half of the 14th century. The fairies who preside at Ogier’s birth and endow him
                    with many gifts are a later addition to the story; one of them is Morgan la Fay,
                    King Arthur’s sister, who foretells that at the end of his career he shall go to
                    live with her in immortal youth at Avalon. While yet a little boy he is sent as
                    a hostage to Charlemagne and is brought up at the imperial court. When fourteen
                    years of age he is banished to the castle of St Omer, where he falls in love
                    with the young châtelaine, but is soon afterwards ordered out of his prison to
                    accompany Charlemagne on an expedition to Italy against the invading Saracens.
                    Here, for the first time, he is subjected to the hatred and envy of young
                    Chariot, the emperor’s son; but on the triumph of the Frankish arms he
                    accompanies the monarch in his return to Paris and learns that his father is
                    dead and that the châtelaine has borne him a son. He departs to assume the crown
                    of Denmark, but lays it down after a few years and returns to Charlemagne. His
                    son has grown up and is one day engaged in a game of chess with Chariot, who,
                    having lost it, becomes irritated, and kills him with the chess-board (an
                    incident frequently met with in old fiction). Ogier, in his fury for revenge,
                    uses such language that he is compelled to fly, and betakes himself to the court
                    of the Lombard king Desiderius, then at war with the emperor. It is on this
                    occasion that the famous dialogue takes place on the walls of Pavia. Desiderius
                    or Didier wonders, as he and Ogier look forth together, at the great number of
                    the Frankish warriors advancing over the plain, and, as each successive body of
                    troops, ever increasing in strength and grandeur, makes its appearance, he says,
                    “Is this the emperor ?” Ogier to each question answers, “Not yet,” till at last
                    he cries, “When thou shalt see the fields bristling with an iron harvest, and
                    the Po and the Ticino, swollen with sea-floods, inundating the walls of the city
                    with iron billows, then perhaps shall Karl be nigh at hand.” Soon after the Iron
                    Emperor with his mightiest host darkens the horizon, and Didier falls smitten
                    with terror. The Lombard king is beaten; Ogier is made prisoner while sleeping,
                    and brought to the emperor. He still refuses to be reconciled until the monarch
                    yields Chariot to his revenge. Charlemagne at last gives way; Ogier, when just
                    on the point of striking off the prince’s head, abstains, and foregoes his
                    vengeance. Then, returning to his old station as one of the emperor’s chief
                    paladins, he fights an invading army and slays their giant leader. He next saves
                    the king of England’s daughter Clarice from captivity, marries her, and is
                    recognized as king of that country; but he abandons for a second time the kingly
                    dignity and sets out for the conquest of the Holy Land. Whilst returning to
                    France, he is shipwrecked, comes upon a diamond castle, invisible by day, and
                    finds himself in Avalon in the company of Morgan la Fay. She puts the ring of
                    perpetual youth on his finger, the crown of forgetfulness on his head, and he
                    lives a life of joy for two centuries. Then the crown is taken off; he remembers
                    his old life, and betakes himself to the new and degenerate French kingdom which
                    has succeeded to the empire of Charlemagne. After restoring the spirit of the
                    older knighthood, vanquishing the Norse invaders, and passing through some
                    curious adventures in connexion with his ring, he is carried away by Morgan la
                    Fay and disappears for ever.</p>
                <p>Meurvin.—This was a romance of late origin, first printed at Paris in 1531.
                    Meurvin was the son of Ogier by Morgan la Fay, and is a personage of little
                    interest, except for his connexion with the romance of the Knight of the Swan,
                    whose ancestor he is represented to be through his son Oriant.</p>
                <p>The Four Sons of Aymon; or Regηault de Montαuban and his Three Brothers.—This,
                    one of the most popular and delightful of the romances of this cycle, was
                    printed many times in the 15th and 16th centuries, and in later abridgments as a
                    chap-book.</p>

                <p>Adapted from a 13th-century poem, it has been considered as the work of Huon de
                    Villeneuve based upon earlier chansons. Aymon de Dordogne, brother of Beuves
                    d’Aigremont and of Girard de Roussillon, brings his four sons to the court of
                    Charlemagne. They are knighted by the emperor, who makes a present of the
                    marvellous steed Bayard to the eldest, Régnault. This is the charger pictorially
                    represented as bearing all the four champions on his back at once. Bertholais,
                    the nephew of Charlemagne, plays one day a game of chess with Régnault, and,
                    losing, petulantly strikes his adversary, who smites him dead with the board.
                    All the four sons of Aymon are compelled to fly and war is immediately declared
                    against them as outlaws, in which their unhappy father, as the feudal vassal of
                    Charlemagne, is obliged to take an active part. Numerous incidents of deadly
                    peril and adventure on both sides are recorded, and Régnault displays so much
                    daring, skill, and magnanimity as to create in the reader’s mind a hatred of the
                    ungenerous monarch who relentlessly pursues the brothers. It will be remarked
                    how singularly the character of Charlemagne has deteriorated from the earlier
                    type. The famous Bayard plays a notable part in the story. On one occasion, by
                    the help of his cousin, the enchanter Maugis (son of Charlemagne’s assassinated
                    enemy Beuves), Régnault captures the emperor, Roland, Ogier, Naimes of Bavaria,
                    and Turpin. Although they are in his power, the chivalrous knight and his
                    brothers merely kneel to Charlemagne and beg for peace and pardon. The monarch’s
                    hatred is implacable; but Régnault nobly sets his captives free, and the war
                    begins again. Régnault, who is lord of Montauban, a castle given him by Yvon,
                    sovereign of Gascony, for having repelled a Saracen invasion, retires from the
                    strife and makes a pilgrimage to Palestine. On his return he goes as a simple
                    mason to aid in the building of Cologne cathedral, and is there slain by the
                    treachery of his fellow-workmen.</p>
                <p>Maugis J Aigremont.—The special romance bearing this title (first printed about
                    1520) is not the only one in which Maugis the enchanter plays a prominent part.
                    He is originally derived from the 13th-century poem on the four sons of Aymon,
                    to whom he furnished material assistance in the struggle against Charlemagne. He
                    also appears as a comrade and helper of Renaud in the Conquest of Trebisond, and
                    again in the romance of Mabrian (1530), in which he is elected pope, and finally
                    perishes in a cave to which Charlemagne sets fire. These are all three of late
                    origin; and the Conqueste de Trebisonde (s.a., about 1520) is not even of French
                    composition, but is adapted from the 14th-century Italian poem of Trabisοnda.
                    The four sons of Aymon, especially Régnault (Tasso’s hero Rinaldo), and their
                    kinsman Maugis seem to have been especially dear to the Italian imagination.</p>
                <p>Gerard J Euphrate.—This, printed in 1549, and professedly translated from a
                    metrical Walloon original, is an absurd tale of magic, containing nothing except
                    names to connect it with the ancient poem on Girard de Fratte, one of the
                    vassals who warred against the emperor. Although split into two personages in
                    course of time, Girard de Fratte (not d’Euphrate) and Girard de Roussillon seem
                    to have been originally identical. Girard was one of the sons of Doon of
                    Mayence, and therefore brother to Aymon. Consequently this romance may be placed
                    in connexion with the Four Sons of Aymon, and also serves to link it with Garin
                    de Montglane, as it is evident that Girard· de Vienne in the latter romance is
                    only another form of the older Girard.</p>
                <p>Huon of Bordeaux.—This interesting story was compiled in prose in 1454, from a
                    late form of a poem which was current towards the end of the 12th century, and
                    which has often been attributed to the trouvère Huon de Villeneuve, but without
                    reason. Huon, duke of Guienne, one of the paladins of Charlemagne, is on his way
                    to Paris to pay his respects to his liege lord, when he is attacked by the
                    malicious and envious Chariot, whom he kills in self-defence. The emperor'
                    grieves so much for his son’s death that he dooms the unlucky Huon to death
                    also, notwithstanding the intercession of all the peers and councillors. At last
                    Huon is pardoned, but only on condition that he shall make a journey to the East
                    and bring back from Baghdad a part of the Saracen amir’s beard and four of his
                    back teeth, after having slain one of the Saracen lords and kissed the amir’s
                    daughter before his face. These impossible tasks he is enabled to accomplish by
                    the help of the pretty dwarf Oberon, who presents him with a magical cup and
                    horn. A loud blast upon the latter suffices to bring Oberon and 100,000 warriors
                    to his aid. At the most critical instant his magic powers fail him, simply
                    because he had been guilty of deceit in announcing himself as a Mohammedan in
                    order to gain entrance. The princess Esclar-monde has, however, fallen in love
                    with him and succours him. He is at length brought out to fight the giant
                    Agrapard, who has invaded Baghdad; he conquers him, and tries to persuade the
                    amir to turn Christian. Again when he is in danger, Oberon saves him; and the
                    teeth and beard are taken from the dead Saracen. Then begins a series of
                    adventures full of peril and distress. Huon overcomes strong temptations
                    practised on his chastity and the deadly straits in which he is placed by
                    Saracen foes and treacherous kinsmen, and at last makes Esclarmonde his lawful
                    wife and justifies himself before Charlemagne. Oberon always makes his
                    appearance when the needs are sorest, and in fact plays the best part in the
                    narrative. This romance has no connexion with the actual history of Charlemagne;
                    but it is an attractive work of imagination.</p>
                <p>Valentin et Orson.—This well-known and charming story, first printed in 1489,
                    relates the lives of two brothers exposed in infancy, one of whom is suckled by
                    a bear. After many adventures, they regain their rightful position and each
                    learns his relationship. The events are supposed to take place in France in the
                    time of Pippin. It is a composition of the 15th century.</p>
                <p>Oetarnen, or Florent et Lyon, is a similar story, never printed in French,
                    although written in that language, probably in the 15th century, from an episode
                    of the Reali di Franeiα.</p>
                <p>Beuve JHanstοne, or, as he is called in English, Bevis of Hampton, is the subject
                    of an old French story which was embodied in the Reali, and is only connected
                    with Charlemagne by the mention of King Pippin and the hero’s kinship with the
                    sons of Aymon. As a French prose romance it was printed by Vérard about 1500. It
                    had been printed separately in Italian at Bologna in 1480. An old English poem
                    on Bevis was in the 15th or 16th century turned into a prose romance, and was
                    printed about 1560.</p>
                <p>Morgant le Géant is only a translation of Pulci’s poem Morgante Maggiore, and
                    Guerin Mesquin is similarly translated from an Italian prose recomposition of an
                    old Italian poem. Little more than the names was derived from the old
                    Charlemagne chansons de geste·, and the same may be said of the famous poems of
                    Boiardo, Berni, and Ariosto upon Roland (Orlando).</p>

                <p>Arthur had become in Britain not only a national hero of romance but also a
                    leading figure around whom might be grouped the adventures of subordinate
                    knights. Charlemagne filled a similar place for French writers, but had the
                    advantage of being a more distinct historical character than Arthur. In the
                    Iberian peninsula, where we find the next great cycle of stories, the
                    circumstances which produced the national hero (the Cid) were still progressive,
                    and his history was too real to melt into such romantic fiction as dealt in
                    France and England with remote and shadowy paladins and the wonders of
                    fairyland. Therefore, while the Cid had an ever-present reality in ballads, the
                    earliest appearance of prose romance in Spain was in an artificial imitation of
                    the Franco-British cycle. As it was a work of great merit, its fictitious hero
                    became, as it were, the central figure in the stories w <hi rend="superscript"
                    >τ</hi> hich followed and which bore to one another a strong family likeness.
                    Most of the chief heroes are illegitimate, like Amadis; the adventures of two
                    brothers are told; and there is much similarity of incident and character. Many
                    of the scenes are laid in Constantinople. <hi rend="italic">Amadis de Gaula</hi>
                    is the poetical sire of an extraordinary series of romances, which in the words
                    of Cervantes <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Under
                    Amadis of Gaul (vol. i. p. 650) may be seen the different references in Don

                    the most interesting and remarkable of them. Although its reputation is due to
                    the Spanish redaction of Montalvo, there was an earlier Portuguese version by
                    Vasco de Lobeira (d. 1403), a gentleman of the court of Joâo I.</p>

                <p>At the end of the 16th century a manuscript of this version was in the possession
                    of the dukes of Aveiro at Lisbon, but since the middle of the 18th century all
                    traces of it have been lost. There is, however, reason to believe that the
                    earliest form of the story was in Castilian (c. 1250 ?), also entirely lost. In
                    a moral poem, <hi rend="italic">El Rimado de Pαlario,</hi> written about 1400,
                    we find Pedro Lopez de Ayala speaking of having wasted his youth with</p>
                <p>“Libros de desvaneos e mentiras probadas Amadis e LαnzaroteC</p>
                <p>which is sufficient to prove that <hi rend="italic">Amadis</hi> existed about the
                    period 1350-60. There is also a reference to Galaor, brother of Amadis, in the
                    chronicle of Ramon Muntaner (1325-28), as well as to Tristan, Lancelot, and
                    “other knights of the Round Table.” There are several allusions in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cancionero</hi> of Baena (1440-50) to an ancient version, one
                    especially to its being “en très lybros.” The earliest form is likely to have
                    been in verse. The author was well acquainted with the Arthurian legends, and we
                    find a marked imitation of <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> and especially <hi
                    rend="italic">Lancelot.</hi> Many of the names indicate a Celtic origin: Gaula
                    certainly means Wales and not France, as they who insist upon a French original
                    of the romance would lead us to believe. There still remains much that is
                    entirely novel. In the words of M. Baret, to whom the literary history of this
                    romance owes so much—</p>
                <p>“Si, par la tradition primitive, l'Amadis de Gaule dérive de la source commune
                    des romans de la Table Ronde, si même il a existé une version Portugaise, c’est
                    néanmoins à l’Espagne que doit demeurer l’honneur d’avoir créé, sur un thème
                    ancien, une composition originale, en introduisant dans un cadre emprunté la
                    nuance particulière de sentiments et l’art nouveau qui donnent à notre roman son
                    importance et sa valeur spéciales” (De l' Amadis, p. 21).</p>
                <p>Of the primitive <hi rend="italic">Amadis,</hi> probably in three books, which
                    charmed the youth of Ayala nothing is known. The prose romance we now possess
                    was written about 1465 by Garci-Ordonez de Montalvo, governor of Medina del
                    Campo, to whom we may assign all traces of a spirit later than the first years
                    of the 14th century, and to whom the whole of the fourth book may be due. This
                    book is more refined and more romantic than the others. One of the chief reasons
                    of the popularity of this version is the happy manner in which the improvement
                    in manners-is indicated. For the first time in chivalric romances we find
                    distinct traces of the personality of the writer. The tastes, feelings, and
                    prejudices of Spain towards the end of the 15th century are well expressed,
                    without loss of the high chivalry of an earlier and simple time. It was first
                    printed at Saragossa in 1508. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Until recently bibliographers considered an edition printed
                    at Salamanca in 1519 as the eiditio priηceps, although Clemencin and others
                    cited one of 1510, which no one had seen. A most interesting discovery was,
                    however, made at Ferrara in 1872 of an entirely unheard-of edition produced at
                    Saragossa by G. Coci in 1508. </p></note> Within the next fifty years thirteen
                    or fourteen more editions issued from the press, and Amadis became fully
                    established as the popular hero of Spanish romance. When the Spaniards first saw
                    Mexico in 1519 they were reminded of the enchantments of the story.</p>
                <p>Francis I. made acquaintance with the Amadis during his Spanish captivity and
                    directed Nicolas de Herberay, seigneur of Essarts, a gentleman of Picardy, to
                    translate it. The first four books of the original work were first printed in
                    French in 1540. De Herberay also translated most of the continuations down to
                    the ninth book. He died about 1552, and Boileau, Gohorry, and others continued
                    the work. Estienne Pasquier, in his Recherches de la France (1611), alludes to
                    the popularity of the French Amadis, “dans lequel vous pouvez cueillir toutes
                    les belles fleurs de nostre langue Françoyse. Jamais livre ne feut embrassé avec
                    tant de faveur que cestuy.” De Herberay gives as his reason for the translation,
                    “pour ce qu’il est tout certain qu’il fust premier mis en nostre langue
                    Françoyse, estant Amadis Gaulois et non Espagnol. Et qu’ainsi soit, j’en ai
                    trouvé encores quelque reste d’un vieil livre escrit à la main en langage
                    Picard.” This contention, which cannot seriously be held, was insisted upon by
                    M. de Tressan in his abridgment of the Amadis de Cattle (1779), wherein a French
                    origin for the first three books is claimed upon the authority of certain MSS.
                    in that language. The commencement of an Italian translation of the Amadis
                    romances was printed at Venice in 1546, and the stories became equally popular
                    in that language. Bernardo Tasso, while on a mission to Spain about 1535, read
                    the Amadis with delight and afterwards based upon it his poem of Amadigi di
                    Francia (1560). He preferred the Amadis to all the French romances, not even
                    excepting Lancelot. Living at that time, his evidence is extremely valuable. He
                    does not seem to have heard of Lobeira’s version nor yet of the French and
                    Portuguese pretensions. In his opinion the story was taken from some ancient
                    British history. The romance was translated into German in 1569 and into Dutch
                    in 1619. Graesse (Trésor, vii. p. 30) describes a Hebrew translation of the
                    first four books by Jacob ben Moses Algabbai, printed at Constantinople by
                    Eliezer ben Gerson Soncini, without date. The Amadis was first read in English
                    through a version from the French by Anthony Munday (1592). Robert Southey’s
                    Amadis of Gaul (London, 1803, 4 vols. sm. 8vo) is an excellent translation, in
                    which, however, there are constant signs of editorial pruning. W. S. Rose put
                    the romance into verse from De Herberay’s French text (London, 1803, sm. 8vo).
                    Besides the Amadigi of Tasso, the romance gave rise to Amadis, a drama by Gil
                    Vicente (1521), the Portuguese Plautus, to an opera by Lulli, represented at the
                    Académie Royale de Musique at Paris (1684), to a poem by Wieland (1771), the
                    forerunner of his Oberon, and to another by Creuzé de Lesser (1813). The
                    translation of De Herberay had an extraordinary success. It penetrated even to
                    the convents. The Huguenot La Noue and the Catholic Possevino protested against
                    it in vain. The allusions to the Amadis and its continuations are endless; for
                    instance,—“La gloire de Nicquée,” used for the bracket seat of a coach; the
                    proverbial saying ’ ‘ envoyer chez Guillot le songeur”; “Dariolette,” the name
                    for a confidant; “Urgande la desconnue,” a phrase with Scarron and La Fontaine;
                    and many more. The romance even furnished Christian names to some noble
                    families, as to the lovely Corisande, countess of Guiche. The festal pageantries
                    in vogue at the court of Charles V. were imitated from it. A poetical title of
                    Queen Elizabeth was “the fair Oriana.” Burton refers to the reading of the
                    romance in his Anatomy of Melancholy (1621).</p>
                <p>The period of <hi rend="italic">Los Quatro Libros del Cavallero Amadis de
                    Gaula</hi> is supposed to be earlier than that of Arthur or of Charlemagne. The
                    hero is the illegitimate child of Perion, king of Gaul, and of Elisena, princess
                    of Brittany, and is set adrift at sea in a cradle. He is picked up by a Scottish
                    knight, who takes him to his own country; he calls him the Child of the Sea and
                    educates him at the king’s court. Having been knighted, Amadis goes to the
                    assistance of his father Perion (the relationship being then unknown), who in
                    the meantime had married Elisena, by whom he had a lawfully begotten son,
                    Galaor. The second child is stolen by a giant. Amadis becomes revealed to his
                    parents through a ring, and consoles them in their new loss. He overthrows the
                    king of Ireland, who had invaded Gaul, and returns to England. The adventures of
                    the two brothers Amadis and Galaor in England, France, Germany, and the East
                    occupy the remainder of the work, which is full of combats between them and
                    other knights, magicians, and giants. While a youth at the Scottish court Amadis
                    met Oriana, daughter of Lisuarte, king of England, who had been sent away from
                    home in consequence of political troubles. The vicissitudes of their love form a
                    marked feature of the tale. At one time the hero, disguised and under the name

                    derived from the romance of Tristan. Amadis was also known by the names of the

                    Oriana and the English court owing to the jealous suspicions of the king. He
                    returns to rescue the princess from the Romans, and afterwards carries on a long
                    war with Lisuarte, who is also attacked by a second enemy, Aravigo. In this
                    perplexity Lisuarte is generously assisted by Amadis, who <pb break="no"

                    marriage of his daughter with Amadis on the Firm Island, whose wonders are
                    brought to an end by Oriana entering a certain magic chamber,—a feat only to be
                    accomplished by the fairest and most faithful of women. <note anchored="true"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Amadis</hi> is one of the best of the romances and contains
                    many passages of much beauty and even tenderness. The boyish attachment between
                    the Child of the Sea and Oriana is well told. The princess is weak and jealous,
                    and not altogether a pleasing character. Amadis is a fine creation and is well
                    distinguished from his brother Galaor. Both are brave, but the elder is grave
                    and the younger gay. Amadis is the type of a constant lover; his brother is more
                    changeful. A modern reader may be wearied by the intolerable length of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amadis</hi> and by the continual recurrence of similar adventures
                    all ending in the same way. But these repetitions seemed no fault to readers
                    whose tastes were easily satisfied and to whom such fictions came as an entirely
                    new source of delight.</p>
                <p>The continuations are inferior to their prototype and become more full of
                    complicated incidents and strange adventures as they proceed. The characters
                    alter: for instance, the Urganda of the first four books is a fairy like Morgan
                    la Fay, but subsequently she develops into an enchantress of a more Eastern and
                    malignant nature like her rivals Zirfea and Melia. Besides his redaction of the
                    Amadis, Montalvo composed about 1485 an original work, about one-third as long,
                    giving the history of a son of the hero, called Esplandian. In order that it
                    might share in the popularity of the father’s achievements, it came forth as
                    Quinto Libro dl Amadis de Gaula, o las Sergas del Cavallero Espla'ndiane). The
                    curate justly decreed that “the merits of the father must not be imputed to the
                    son” when he cast the volume on the bonfire in Don Quixote’s courtyard. Although
                    perhaps the best of the continuations, it is not equal to the original. We read
                    that before marriage Oriana bore a child to Amadis, and in order to hide her
                    shame the boy is sent to a distant country. While those in charge of him are
                    passing through a forest a lioness carries him off, but a hermit meets and
                    rebukes the animal, which subsequently suckles the young Esplandian. When he
                    grows up the lioness continues her care and accompanies him to the chase. King
                    Lisuarte one day witnesses this, which is the cause of Oriana recognizing her
                    son by certain marks on his body. He is brought up at the court of Lisuarte and
                    receives knighthood. He then begins his adventures under the title of the Black
                    Knight (from his armour), and sails for Turkey, where most of his exploits take
                    place. The Christians are assisted by the enchantress Urganda and the infidels
                    by her rival Melia. Amadis, Galaor, Esplandian, and the knights being in great
                    danger of death, Urganda saves them by putting them all to sleep on the Firm
                    Island until Lisuarte, son of Esplandian, could obtain possession of a certain
                    magic sword. The romance was first printed in 1510, and five editions appeared
                    before the end of the century. This was soon followed by other similar romances,
                    each with an illegitimate descendant of Amadis for a hero, with a son who
                    performs exploits still more wonderful than those of his father, —a perpetual
                    succession of heroes. At the end of the Esplandian Montalvo speaks of wilting
                    another book to carry on the history still further. This caused some one,
                    believed to be Paez de Ribera, to bring out El Sexto Libro, en que se cuentan
                    los Grandes Hechos de Florisando, nephew of Amadis, taken from an Italian
                    source. This was translated into English and Italian, but not into French. The
                    Septimo Libro, en el qual se trata de los Grandes Hechos en armas de Lisuarte de
                    Grecia y Perion de Gaula, deals with the life of the son of Esplandian and
                    Leonorina. The other character is Perion, son of Amadis and Oriana, and the type
                    of the fickle lover, as opposed to Lisuarte, who is more like Amadis. The book
                    commences with the voyage of Perion from England to Ireland, but a lady in a
                    boat with a crew of four monkeys separates him from his followers. He goes to
                    Trebizond and falls in love with Gricileria, daughter of the emperor. When
                    Lisuarte is a prisoner in charge of the king of the Giants’ Isle, Gradaffile,
                    the daughter of the latter, escapes with him to Constantinople, where after many
                    combats he obtains the magic sword and enables Amadis and the knights to escape
                    from the magic sleep in the Firm Island (see Esq)landian above). Lisuarte
                    eventually marries Onoloria, sister of Gricileria. The work continues Florisand
                    and is attributed to Feliciano de Silva. Juan Diaz, the author of El Octavo
                    Libro, que trata de</p>
                <p>“The maske of Cupid and th' enchant-ed Chamber are displayed."</p>
                <p>Lisuarte de Grecia y de la Muerte del Rey Amodie, pretended that his work was
                    taken from the Greek. It also is a continuation of Florisand and was not
                    translated.</p>
                <p>We now come to Dibro Noveno, que es la Chronica del Principe y Cavallero de la
                    Ardixnte Espada, Amadis de Grecia, a continuation of the seventh and not of the
                    eighth book, and more full of marvels than any of its predecessors. Amadis of
                    Greece, the son of Lisuarte and Onoloria, is carried off by pirates when an
                    infant and sold to a Moorish king. He derived his name from the figure of a
                    flaming sword upon his breast. The exploits commence, like those in the
                    Esplandian, at the Forbidden Mountain, and the family history concludes, as in
                    the same romance, with the enchantment by Zirfea of all the heroes and
                    princesses in the Tower of the Universe in order to prevent their death at a
                    fated moment. Feliciano de Silva is the reputed author. Stimulated by the
                    success of his two anonymous productions, the same writer continued the series
                    with four more parts, of which the Cοronica de los Valientes Caballeros D.
                    Florisel de Niquea y el Fuerte Anaxartes forms the tenth book and contains the
                    first two parts. Genealogically the romance is a continuation of Lisuarte and
                    Amadis de Grecia. Florisel is the son of the latter person and the princess of
                    Niquea. In these fictions a new character is introduced, Darinel, a kind of
                    comic shepherd, in love with the heroine Sylvia, daughter of Lisuarte and
                    Onoloria, through whom Florisel becomes acquainted with the heroine. All three
                    go to the relief of Anastarax, who is confined by enchantment in a fiery prison.
                    But the achievement of the exploit is reserved for the Amazon Alastraxerea,
                    whose adventures occupy a great portion of the tale, which culminates in the
                    siege of Constantinople by all the potentates of western Europe in consequence
                    of Florisel having carried off Helena, princess of Apollonia. Among other new
                    characters are the enchantress Armida and the “strong” Anaxartes, who marries
                    young Oriana, sister of Florisel. The amount of bloodshed throughout the work is
                    only equalled by the number of marriages. The third part of Florisel forms the
                    eleventh book of Amadis and is known as Chronica de Don Florisel de Niquea, en
                    la quell se trata de D. Rogel de Grecia y el Segundo Agesilao. Rogel is the son
                    of Florisel and Helena, and brother of Agesilao the Second, so called to
                    distinguish him from Agesilao of Colchos. A few years later Feliciano de Silva
                    published the fourth part of Don Florisel, in two books, the second of which
                    treats of the loves of Rogel of Greece and Archisidea, and of Agesilao and
                    Diana, daughter of Queen Sidonia. The author in his preface implies that the
                    work was intended as an allegorical celebration of the military and domestic
                    virtues of Charles V.</p>
                <p>The hero of La Dozena Parte que tracta de los grandes Hechos en Armas del Caυ.
                    Don Silνes de la Selva, was the son of Amadis of Greece and Finistea. Born on a
                    desert island, Don Silvio first distinguishes himself at the siege of
                    Constantinople described in the tenth book. The Greek empresses and princesses
                    having been carried off by enchantment, he accompanies the knights who go in
                    search of them. The ladies are rescued, but during their absence have become
                    mothers, among others of Spheramond, son of Rogel, and Amadis of Astre, son of
                    Agesilao. Feliciano de Silva sometimes passes for the author, who was really
                    Pedro de Lujan. The work is in two parts, which in French make the thirteenth
                    and fourteenth books. Lepolemo ό el Caballero de la Cruz and Leandro el Bel are
                    considered to make the thirteenth and fourteenth books. From a unique first
                    edition (1521) of Lepolemo discovered a few years since it appears that it
                    professed to be a translation by Alonso de Salazar. The hero was the son of the
                    emperor Maximilian and was carried away in infancy to the East. N. Antonio
                    speaks of a certain romance composed by a Portuguese, entitled Penalνa, the last
                    of the line of the original Amadis. It is supposed to have dealt with the last
                    exploits and death of Lisuarte of Greece, but if it existed at all no printed
                    copy has ever yet been seen. The other Spanish romances usually appended to the
                    Amadis series are mentioned in the bibliographical list below.</p>
                <p>In the French series more and more liberties are taken with the original as the
                    work proceeds. As shown in the table below, the numbers of the books do not
                    tally. The fifteenth, entirely due to Antoine Tyron, describes the feats of
                    Sferamond (so called from a birthmark representing a globe) of Greece and Amadis
                    d’Astre. The sixteenth to the twenty-first books continue the adventures of
                    Sferamond and were translated from the Italian of Mambrino Roseo by Gabriel
                    Chappuys. Duplicate versions from the Italian were made by Nicolas de Montreux
                    of the sixteenth, by Jacques Chariot of the nineteenth, and by Jean Bovion of
                    the twentieth books. The twenty-second to the twenty-fourth books, devoted to
                    Fulgoran, Safiraman, and Hercules d’Astre, continue and form a new conclusion of
                    the French Amadis. Only one edition appeared (Paris, 1615, 3 vols. 8vo), now
                    extremely rare. The naive and pure style of tho earliest of the series
                    degenerates into an uninteresting succession of coarse and obscene incidents. In
                    the twenty-third book we are taken for the first time to America. Flores de
                    Grèce (1552) is considered to form the twenty-fifth book. Genealogically it
                    would be the sixth, as the hero is the second son of Esplandian. In the 16th
                    century the French Amadis library extended to 30 vols, of various <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0679-0656"/>sizes. In the 17th century appeared a new work
                    forming, as it were, the preliminary, being the history of the Chevalier du
                    Soleil and his Brother Rosidair, sons of the emperor Trebatius (Paris, 1620-25,
                    8 vols.),—not identical with the Spanish Febo. Beliaηis de Grèce (1625) forms
                    one vol., and the Raman des Romans (1626-29) —containing the end of the career
                    of the Knight of the Sun, all the Amadises, Flores, and Belianis—forms 8 vols.,
                    and finishes this long series of about 50 vols. The Thresor de tous les Livres
                    JAmadis (1559-60, frequently reprinted) is a selection of the speeches, letters,
                    cartels, complaints, &amp;c.; it was translated into English as The Treasury of
                    Amadis of France (H. Bynneman, n.d.; about 1575).</p>
                <p>The Italian translation, which is extremely difficult to obtain complete,
                    conforms more closely to the Spanish. The Sferamundi romances were first
                    composed in that language by Mambrino Roseo. A perfect set of the German version
                    is also very rare. Some of these volumes were translated by a Protestant, who
                    made changes to suit his religious views, such as altering “mass” to
                    “sermon.”</p>

                <p>Although the Palmerins have not enjoyed the celebrity of the line of Amadis, they
                    were nevertheless closely allied in dignity and importance, and their histories
                    are written in evident imitation of their distinguished original. At the head of
                    this second great family of Spanish romances stands <hi rend="italic">El libro
                    del Cauallero Palmerin de Oliva.</hi> From some Latin verses at the end it
                    appears to have been written by a woman, said to have been a carpenter’s
                    daughter of Burgos, or a lady of Puente del Arzobispo (Augustobriga), at the
                    beginning of the 16th century. Only one copy is known of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >editio princeps</hi> of Salamanca (1511). The love-scenes are described with
                    more voluptuous detail than is usually to be expected in a female author. But
                    this warmth of colouring may have been one of the causes of the success of the
                    romance. There are many Spanish and Portuguese editions, and it was first
                    translated into French by Jean de Voyer, vicomte de Paulmy, in 1546, into
                    Italian by Mambrino Roseo in 1544, into English by Anthony Munday in 1588, and
                    into Flemish in 1602.</p>
                <p>Like most of his compeers, Palmerin was not born in wedlock. He was the son of
                    Griana, daughter of Reymicio, emperor of Byzantium, and of Florendos of Macedon.
                    The infant was exposed on a hill covered with palm trees and olives (whence the
                    name) and was discovered by a peasant, who reared him as his own son. Palmerin’s
                    earliest exploit is to save a travelling merchant from a lioness. The grateful
                    traveller furnishes him λvith arms and a horse, and Palmerin sets forth in quest
                    of adventures, the first of which is to kill a serpent that guards a fountain
                    whose waters are necessary to Primaleon, king of Macedon. He then succours the
                    emperor of Germany, with whose daughter, Polinarda, he falls in love. Like the
                    lady in <hi rend="italic">Artlιus de Βretaigne,</hi> she had previously appeared
                    to him in a dream. Norway, England, and Greece are successively the scene of his
                    daring. He delivers from the power of the Grand Turk the princess Agriola, who
                    ultimately marries Trineus, the companion of Palmerin. After many combats,
                    enchantments, and love escapades, the hero at length marries Polinarda and
                    becomes emperor of Byzantium upon the death of Reymicio.</p>
                <p>The same fair unknown also produced Libro Segundo que trata de los Hechos en
                    Armas de Primaleon y Polendos, both of them sons of Palmerin by different
                    mothers, the first by Polinarda and the second by the queen of Tharsus. While
                    with his mother Polendos one day ill treats an old woman, who mutters that it
                    was not thus that his father treated the helpless. This sets him to look for his
                    sire. He meets with Primaleon and goes to the court of Duardos (Edward) of
                    England. The beautiful Gridonia, daughter of Duke Hormedes, bears tw <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> o sons to Primaleon, the second of whom is made the
                    hero of the next romance, or third book, Historia del Cav. Don Polindo {Polendo
                    is the fourth part of the Italian series). The fourth book is La Croηiea del
                    Cav. Platir, the son of Primaleon and Gridonia, and very properly condemned by
                    the barber. The fifth book consists of Historia del Cavallier Flortir, which is
                    only to be found in Italian.</p>
                <p>The sixth book, Libro del Cav. Palmerin de Inglaterra, was the most serious rival
                    to the popularity of Amadis. Formerly this work was considered to have been
                    first written in Portuguese and w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> as attributed to
                    Francisco Moraes, from the first edition then known in that language, printed at
                    Evora in 1567. The statement of Moraes, now proved to be true, that it was
                    translated from the French (1552), was looked upon merely as a literary device.
                    On the discovery of the original edition in Spanish (Toledo, 1547-48) it was
                    seen that the real author was Luis Hurtado, a Toledo poet. It was translated
                    into French by Jacques Vincent in 1552, and into Italian by Mambrino Roseo in
                    1554-55. The first Portuguese version was republished at Lisbon in 1786 (3 vols.
                    4to) under the name of Moraes, and from this Southey edited his revision of
                    Munday’s translation (London, 1807, 4 vols. sm. 8vo). Palmerin and Florian are
                    the twin children of Flerida (daughter of Palmerin de Oliva) and Duardos, king
                    of England. The mother gives birth to them in a forest and they are taken away
                    by a savage as food for his two lions. Duardos is in the power of an amiable

                    him under the name of the Child of the Desert. Palmerin, his twin brother, meets
                    with Polendos, who takes him and Selvian to Constantinople. Palmerin’s first
                    love-affair is with Polinarda, who repulses his affection, and he travels to
                    England under the title of the Knight of Fortune. In the middle of a battle with
                    Florian the brothers are separated by Flerida and the secret of their birth
                    divulged by Daliarte, a magician. Their subsequent adventures are beyond
                    enumeration, those of the Perilous Isle being the most interesting. A part of
                    the story relates to the castle of Almourol, where resides the proud Miraguarda,
                    whose peerless beauty is championed by enamoured knights. The giant Dramuziando
                    becomes one of her admirers. In this romance the marriages take place in the
                    middle, giving ample opportunity for many more combats, abductions, ravishments,
                    murders, and other deeds of violence or valour. This is evidently so close an
                    imitation of the Amadis, while only second to it in popularity and intrinsic
                    merit, that a comparison between the two naturally arises. As in its prototype,
                    there are two heroes. We have Palmerin, the faithful lover, and Florian, the
                    fickle one, as well as Daliarte, the magician, and the Perilous Isle. The
                    characters are well discriminated: Palmerin is generous, brave, and chivalrous;
                    Florian, witty and courageous. The giant Dramuziando actually excites our
                    sympathy and interest, and the emperor Primaleon is a fine and courtly old
                    gentleman. Much feeling for the beauties of nature is shown; the dialogue is
                    good. On the other hand, the story is not so simple and natural as the original
                    Amadis. There are too many knights and battles, and the romance is distinctly
                    inferior as a work of art.</p>
                <p>The seventh book consists of Tereeira [e Quarta] Parte de Pal-rnwrvm de
                    Inglaterra onde se contain os Feitos do Don Duardos Segundo sen Filho, which
                    continues the Portuguese version of Moraes, to which the two parts are the third
                    and fourth books. It was composed by Diogo Fernandez de Lisboa. The eighth and
                    last book of the Palmerin series are the fifth and sixth parts of the same work,
                    being Chronica do Famoso Prineepe Don Clarisol de Bretanha, by Balth. Gonçalvez
                    Lobato. Like the preceding, it was written in Portuguese and not translated.</p>

                <p>Outside the four great cycles of mediaeval romance there lie some minor cycles,
                    as well as various isolated fictions, to which we must now make reference.</p>
                <p>The origins of the Teutonic cycle belong to epic or ballad literature, as we find
                    them in the <hi rend="italic">Wilkinasaga,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nibelungenlied,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Heldenbuch.</hi> As those works
                    have already been treated separately or in connexion with the national
                    literature to which they belong, we need only make brief allusion to the fact
                    that the Germanic legend of Siegfried (Sigurd, Siegmund, Sigenot) is very
                    ancient, and that the Norse or Icelandic sagas embody its oldest existing form.
                    The High German <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied, Hilde-brandslied, Hαdubrand,
                    Dietrichssaga</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Heldenbuch∖ König Rother,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    are probably specifically older than the Norse books, but they contain the
                    legend in a later shape,— the <hi rend="italic">Heldenbuch</hi> especially
                    deviating from the first two by the introduction of a number of names and
                    incidents arbitrarily adapted from the history of the Gothic, Lombard,
                    Burgundian, and Hunnic wars during the 5th and 6th centuries. There are no prose
                    romances on these themes, but the mythical hero Siegfried, called Horn-Siegfried
                    or Hörnen-Siegfried, gave his name to the French and English stories of <hi
                    rend="italic">Horn and Rimenhild</hi> (Rimenhild being derived from Chrimhild,
                    the wife of Siegfried). Before these last came into existence there had arisen
                    in England a set of legends of which Anlaf Sitricson, the Danish king of Dublin
                    (converted to Christianity 943, deceased on a pilgrimage in 981), was the hero.
                    They were combined in a French poem called <hi rend="italic">Havelok,</hi> by
                    Geoffrey Gaimar (l2th century), the name Havelok being a corruption of Anlaf or
                    Olaf, and reappearing still later in the form of Hamlet. Various trouvères
                    composed ballads of greater length on the same theme, with many additions, and
                    finally others appeared in English. In all of them we find mixed elements,
                    including incidents which connect this Dano-Saxon romance with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guy of Warwick</hi> and the French <hi rend="italic">King Horn.</hi></p>
                <p>The fact last mentioned tends to justify the assumption of an Anglo-Danish cycle,
                    which may be said to begin with the poem of <hi rend="italic">Beowulf.</hi>
                    Between the mythical Siegfried and Beowulf of the early centuries and the
                    fictitious Horn and Guy of the l3th the Anglo-Danish Havelok of the 12th
                    intervened, and furnished material to the trouvères who composed the last two
                    works. In <hi rend="italic">Horn and Rimenhild</hi> there is little more than
                    the names to connect the story with the old Siegfried poem, but much that brings
                    it into contact with Anlaf and Danish or Norse history. Its reappearance in
                    prose as <hi rend="italic">Pontus et Sidoine</hi> belongs to the second half of
                    the 15th century. <hi rend="italic">Guy of Warwick,</hi> from whatever actual
                    personage its hero may have been derived, is a purely English story of the 13th
                    century, connected with <hi rend="italic">Havelok</hi> by its evident relation
                    to legends of Danish wars in England, and with <hi rend="italic">King Horn</hi>
                    by its embodiment of the most striking incidents of that story,— namely, the
                    return of Guy as a disguised palmer to his own castle, and the use of a ring by
                    which he discloses himself to his wife.</p>
                <p>Havelok the Dane appeared first in a French poem by Geoffrey Gaimar (l'2th
                    century), and was inserted by him between his Britt or translation of Geoffrey
                    of Monmouth (now lost) and his Estorie des Engles. The story runs that
                    Adelbriet, a Dane, is king of Norfolk, while Edelsi is king in Lindsey. The
                    former marries a sister of the latter, and both die; a girl, Argentille,
                    remains, who is given by her uncle, out of spite, in marriage to a
                    scullion-jongleur, Cuheran. She dreams that her new husband is of superior

                    and discover that Cuheran’s putative father, Grim, is dead. It turns out that
                    Cuheran is the son of Gunter, an exiled king of Denmark, and that his real name
                    is Havelok. He and Argentille set out for Denmark, where Edulf, the brother of
                    the usurper, has become king. Sigar, formerly seneschal to Gunter, is lord of
                    the town where Havelok lands and assists him when Argentille is attacked by
                    miscreants. Havelok is made known by his power to <pb break="no"

                    returns to England, fights with Edelsi, and gains the day through Argentine’s
                    device of setting up the dead warriors on stakes. When Edelsi dies Have-lok and
                    Argentille reign in Lindsey as well as in Norfolk. The tale may have filtered
                    through Welsh channels, as it seems to have</p>
                <p>Fathered British elements before it was taken up by the Anglo-&gt;anes.
                    Argentille (or Argantel) appears to be formed from a Welsh name, which the early
                    English writers converted to Goldborough. The French chanson belongs to the
                    early part of the 12th century. It has no direct prose representative. Gaimar’s
                    text was first edited by Hadden (Roxburghe Club, 1828), in the Monumenta Hist.
                    Brit. (1848), and by T. Wright (Caxton Soc., 1850). A French lai on the same
                    subject is included in the Roxburghe and in the Caxton volumes; it was issued
                    separately by Francisque Michel in 1833. An English poem is also to be found in
                    the Roxburghe volume, and was likewise edited by W. W. Skeat (Early Eng. Text
                    Soc. 1868).</p>

                <p>King Hom. —The primitive English form of the poem is lost, but is represented in
                    the existing chanson de geste (Horn et Rimenhild, 12th century). An early
                    version supplied some of the incidents for Richard of Ely’s Gesta Herewardi
                    Sαxoηis (first half of 12th century), which claims to be partly derived from an
                    old book written by Leofric, Hereward’s chaplain at Bourne. English MSS. (in
                    verse) are preserved at the British Museum, Oxford, and Cambridge. Allof, king
                    of Sudenne, is killed by Saracen (Danish) pirates, who also drive away his wife
                    Godylt and turn their son Horn adrift at sea, with Athulf, Fykenild, and ten
                    other children. They land at Westness (Cornwall) and the children are reared by
                    King Aylmer. Horn is banished for a love passage with the king’s daughter,
                    Rymenild, and sails for Ireland under the name of God-mod. He returns with Irish
                    warriors and by himself joins a feast held to celebrate the espousals of
                    Rymenild with a King Mody. Horn, disguised as a pilgrim, drops a ring into
                    Rymenild’s cup with the words “Drink to Horn of horn.” He defeats Mody and
                    reinstates his mother in Sudenne. Rymenild is carried off by Fykenild, who is
                    ultimately killed by the hero, by whom the lady is rescued. The only copy known
                    of the knightly romance of Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild is the Auchinleck MS.
                    The story was very popular in Scotland. Horn and Horn Childe have both been
                    printed by Ritson (Ancient Eng. Metr. Rom., 1802, ii., iii.). Francisque Michel
                    has edited Horn et Rimenhild, including the English and Scottish poems
                    (Bannatyne Club, 1845). The Cambridge MS. was edited by J. R. Lumby for the
                    Early Eng. Text Soc. (1866) and by E. Mätzner in Altenglisehe Spraxhρroben
                    (1867), and the Oxford text by C. Horstmann in Herrig’s Aehiυ (1872).</p>
                <p>Ponthus et la Belle Sidoine. —In this prose romance the soldan of Babylon sends
                    his three sons to seek their fortune at sea. One of them, Broadas, occupies
                    Galicia and kills King Thibor, whose young son Pontus with the other children is
                    sent off in a boat to France. They are wrecked off the coast of Brittany, and
                    the story proceeds very much as in the poem of Horn. Nearly all the names are
                    changed, however, and there are additional knightly episodes. The romance was
                    first printed at Lyons about 1480. A German translation appeared at Augsburg in
                    1483, and an English version was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1511.</p>
                <p>The Anglo-Danish cycle of romance, by reason of its origin and type of
                    adventures, may be fitly supplemented by the stories, eminently English in
                    character, although furnished with an Anglo-Norman setting, which have been
                    called “outlaw romances.”</p>
                <p>Tales of outlaws form a considerable portion of English fiction, and, as
                    elsewhere, the same incidents occur over and over again, being always attributed
                    to the favourite hero of the day. The oldest was that of Hereward the Saxon,
                    whose exploits against William were renowned in prose and verse soon after his
                    own time. Most of the outlaw stories remain in ballad form; a prose example is
                    the French <hi rend="italic">Fulk Fitzwarin</hi> (about 1320), descriptive of
                    outlaw life in the Welsh marches and other parts of England, Spain, &lt;fcc.,—an
                    embellished record of actual events from 1201 to 1203. We learn that Payn
                    Peverel, having overcome a devil that tenanted the body of a Cornish giant,
                    Geomagog, who haunts a ruined British village in Shropshire, builds a castle
                    near the place with the assistance of his kinsfolk. A certain Melette Peverel
                    marries Warin de Meez, and their son Fulk Fitzwarin is himself the father of
                    five sons, who go through scenes many of which are obviously suggested by the
                    Charlemagne <hi rend="italic">chansons,</hi> such as the fatal chess-board
                    quarrel, the taunting of Ogier by Roland, &lt;fcc. The five brothers are
                    outlawed and seek adventures. One of their followers, John de Rampayne,
                    resembles Friar Tuck in his skill in playing, singing, and the use of the
                    quarterstaff. The story ends with the submission and pardon of Fulk, the eldest
                    of the brothers, the death of his wife Mahaud, his marriage with Clarice de
                    Auberville, and his subsequent blindness,—all real historical events. It was the
                    first wife of Fulk who became a personage as Maid Marian in the Robin Hood
                    stories and in the plays of Munday and Chettle. The romance was first published
                    by Francisque Michel in 1840, by T. Wright in 1855 (Warton Club), and at the end
                    of <hi rend="italic">Ralph de Coggeshall</hi> (Rolls Series, 1875).</p>
                <p>The exploits of the earlier outlaws, Hereward and Fulk Fitzwarin, reappear under
                    the name of Robin Hood <hi rend="italic">{q.v.).</hi> The extensive ballad
                    literature relating to the last and his companions Maid Marian, Friar Tuck,
                    Little John, &lt;fcc., needs only a passing reference. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life of Robin Hood,</hi> a prose rendering of the <hi rend="italic">Geste of
                    Robyn Hode</hi> (Wynkyn de Worde, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1495), is reproduced
                    by W. J. Thoms in his <hi rend="italic">Early Eng. Prose Romances,</hi>
                    1858.</p>
                <p>One of the most popular stories connected with the Robin Hood cycle is Gamelyn
                    (e. 1340), sometimes inserted among Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. Here three sons
                    are left equal shares in their father’s property, —Gamelyn, the youngest, being
                    under the charge of the eldest, John, who neglects him. At the age of sixteen he
                    gains a ram at a wrestling match and invites the spectators home. After the
                    guests retire John and Gamelyn quarrel. The latter is imprisoned, but released
                    by Adam the Spencer, an old servant, and the two escape together. Gamelyn is
                    made king of the outlaws and John becomes sheriff. Gamelyn is captured, but is
                    bailed out by his other brother, Ote. Finally, John is hanged by Gamelyn. The
                    tale was used by T. Lodge for Rosalynde (1590) and dramatized by Shakespeare in
                    As You Like It (ed. W. W. Skeat, 1884).</p>
                <p>(e) <hi rend="italic">Unafiliated Romances.</hi></p>
                <p>The works of this class are of less importance than those which belong to the
                    great cycles; for, indeed, there are few which have not been drawn somehow into
                    one or pther of these last. Amongst the most striking we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pierre de Provence et la Belle Maguelonne,</hi> a story of love, adventure, and
                    magic, which existed in Provençal verse at the end of the 12th century, but was
                    first compiled in French prose in 1457 (the text being printed at Lyons about
                    1478). It was very popular in Spain, and a Spanish translation appeared as a
                    quarto volume at Toledo in 1526.—A similar romance is <hi rend="italic">Paris et
                    Vienne,</hi> belonging apparently to the first half of the 15th century; the
                    first edition was printed at Antwerp, by Gerard Leeuw, in 1487, five years after
                    the appearance of an Italian translation (Treviso, 1482), and two years after
                    Caxton had issued an English version (Westminster, 1485).—Another French romance
                    (better corresponding to the modern use of the word) is <hi rend="italic">Jean
                    de Paris</hi> (Paris, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1535), written by Pierre de la
                    Sippade (1490-1500). It is a pleasant fiction, full of disguises and surprises
                    like the works of G. P. R. James, and may be compared with <hi rend="italic">Le
                    petit Jehan de Saintrê</hi> (Paris, 1517), written by Antoine de la Sale about
                    1470, in which we find a true picture of the manners of the French court in the
                    first half of the 15th century.—The <hi rend="italic">Trois Filz de Roys</hi> is
                    a heavy and dull romance written in Flanders late in the 15th century.—A work of
                    far superior order is <hi rend="italic">Tirant lo Blanch,</hi> written in the
                    Valencian language in the 15th century by Joannot Martorell. This was printed,
                    with the fourth book added after the author’s death, at Valencia in 1490, and
                    has the honour of being the first romance which came from the Spanish press. The
                    author professes to derive his stories from English sources, but he seems to be
                    indebted only to <hi rend="italic">Guy of Warwick</hi> for some <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n682/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0682-0659"/>of his situations and the names of the English
                    localities in which his scenes are laid. Three other Spanish romances may be
                    mentioned here. Though the earliest printed edition of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oliveros y Artus</hi> is in French, the work (printed in Spanish at Burgos in
                    1499) is undoubtedly of Spanish origin. It has been popular in all languages. An
                    English version came from the press of Wynkyn de Worde in 1518. <hi
                    rend="italic">Felix Marte de Hyrcania</hi> (Valladolid, 1556), by Melchor
                    Ortega, is chiefly remarkable as having been read by Dr Samuel Johnson, who is
                    likely to have been the only person since the 16th century capable of such a
                    feat. The <hi rend="italic">Guerras de Granada</hi> (1595-1619) of Perez de Hita
                    contains some of the finest ballads in the language, and is an interesting and
                    well-written fiction. The first (and best) part deals with the reign of the last
                    Moorish king of Granada, and the second part relates the final ruin of the Moors
                    in Philip III.’s reign.—Another favourite fiction in many lands is that in which
                    a chaste wife is wrongfully accused of infidelity and punished. The character
                    even appears among the earliest ballads of the Charlemagne cycle (Z&lt;τ <hi
                    rend="italic">reine Sibelle)</hi>; but here we have to mention three distinct
                    narratives which have attracted generations of readers, and which are widely
                    known from their adoption by many writers. These are <hi rend="italic">Patient
                    Grizel (Griseldis), Genevieve of Brabant,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La belle
                    Helene.</hi> The story in each is similar, and the plot or some of the incidents
                    may be traced in the <hi rend="italic">Lai del Fresne</hi> of Marie de France
                    (c. 1220), in the Latin legendary history of St Geneviève (written about 1272),
                    in several old monkish lives of St Helena of Constantinople, in the late
                    romances of <hi rend="italic">Valentine and Orson, Florent et Lyon,</hi> and
                    other stories,—the heroine being variously described as the Chaste Empress, the
                    Chaste Queen, or the Chaste Duchess. The most celebrated of these stories is
                    that of Griseldis. She is said to have been the wife of Walter, marquis of
                    Saluces or Saluzzo, in the llth century, and her misfortunes were considered to
                    belong to actual history when they were handled by Boccaccio and Petrarch,
                    although the probability is that Boccaccio borrowed his narrative from a
                    Provençal <hi rend="italic">fabliau.</hi> He included it in the recitations of
                    the tenth day <hi rend="italic">(Deca-merone),</hi> and must have written it
                    about 1350. Petrarch Latinized it in 1373, and his translation formed the basis
                    of much of the later literature. These works, however, really belong to a
                    different class from that treated here, and may be referred to popular tales,
                    like the narratives which have been repeated in many forms and in many lands
                    from the time of Bidpai downwards. The prose French romance, <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Patience de Griselidis</hi> (Bréhan-Loudéac, 1484), was derived from
                    Petrarch, as also Chaucer’s narrative in the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury
                    Tales,</hi> and the Elizabethan drama in which Dekker was a collaborateur.—The
                    <hi rend="italic">De Duobus Amantibus</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Eurialus and
                    Lucretiaj</hi> of Aeneas Sylvius is usually included amongst romances, but it is
                    rather an historical novel based upon the imperial court gossip of his own
                    day.—The Spanish <hi rend="italic">Carcel de Amor,</hi> composed about 1480-90
                    by Diego de San Pedro, is also a novel; the famous or infamous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cdestina</hi> is a drama of surpassing vigour and interest; and the pastoral
                    romances of <hi rend="italic">Diana, Pastor Fido,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arcadia</hi> belong to a different class from that of mediaeval romance.—As
                    much may be said of the English romances produced in the 16th and the earlier
                    part of the 17th century, which are chiefly weak novelistic imitations of the
                    later adjuncts to <hi rend="italic">Amαdis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palmerin.—</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Seven Champions of Christendom</hi> is a
                    popular tale.— The <hi rend="italic">Romance of the Fox {Reynard the Fox)</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Roman de la Rose</hi> likewise belong to totally
                    distinct orders of literature, the former to that of tales ( <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volksbücher)</hi> and the latter to the large class of allegorical poems.—The
                    Norman stories of <hi rend="italic">Robert the Devil</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robert of Sicily</hi> are also popular tales.</p>
                <p>III. Modern Romance to the 17th Century.</p>
                <p>The inspiration of mediaeval romance is gone; but it is necessary briefly to
                    trace its final reflexions to the close of the 17 th century, when prose fiction
                    began to assume more definitely the character of the modern novel.</p>
                <p>We have seen how large a place in the history of romances is occupied by France
                    down to the end of the 16th century. We first meet with the so-called “pastoral
                    romance” in French in <hi rend="italic">HAstree</hi> (1612) of Honoré d’Urfé, an
                    enormous work inspired by Montemayor, which, however, La Rochefoucauld found

                    imitations. Camus de Pontcarré wrote in opposition religious pastorals such as

                    >Polexaηdre</hi> (1632-39) and <hi rend="italic">La Cytheree</hi> (1640-42),
                    which were the models for the still more ponderous productions of La Calprenède
                    and De Scudéry. <hi rend="italic">La jeune Alcidiane</hi> (1651), an unfinished
                    continuation of <hi rend="italic">Polexaηdre,</hi> was completed by Mademoiselle
                    M. A. Gomez. These form a link between the genuine romance of chivalry and the
                    so-called heroic style. We still meet with giants and extravagant exploits. The
                    adventures with pirates and the sea scenes show the influence of translations of
                    Greek novels. Madeleine de Scudéry produced her romances under the name of her
                    eccentric brother Georges, but the authorship was well known. The first to
                    appear was <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim, ou VIllustre Passa</hi> (1641); then the
                    work for which she is best known, <hi rend="italic">Aitamène, ou le Grand
                    Cyrus</hi> (10 vols., 1649-53); <hi rend="italic">Clelie, histoire romaine</hi>
                    (10 vols., 1650-53), contains the famous “carte du pays de Tendre”; then came
                    <hi rend="italic">Almahide, ou VEsclave Reyne</hi> (1660), <hi rend="italic">Les

                    Versailles</hi> (1669). One of the causes of her great popularity was her
                    representation of living characters under flimsy disguise. Keys to <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Grand Cyrus</hi> have been published. Gauthier de Costes,
                    chevalier de la Calprenède, wrote <hi rend="italic">Cassandre</hi> (1642-50);
                    <hi rend="italic">Cléopâtre</hi> (12 vols., 1647-58), the best of his works,
                    which contains the character of Juba satirized by Boileau; <hi rend="italic"

                    and <hi rend="italic">Les Nouvelles</hi> (1661). In spite of their appalling
                    length and their tedious conversations and descriptions, La Calprenède’s
                    romances are not without merit. The author has imagination, and his heroes have
                    a share of the noble sentiments of their predecessors. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Berenice</hi> (1648) by J. R. de Segrais, <hi rend="italic">La Précieuse</hi>

                    <hi rend="italic">Marcarise</hi> (1664), both by Hédelin, and the mystical
                    romances of the Jesuit Ceriziers, belong to the same school. Nearly all the
                    familiar machinery of the old romances is now absent: we no longer meet with
                    dragons, necromancers, giants, and enchanted castles. Formerly love was
                    secondary to heroic achievement; now it becomes the ruling passion, and knightly
                    deeds are performed only to excite the applauding smile of a mistress and not
                    for the sake of military glory. The jargon of gallantry used in these fictions
                    exercised an evil influence upon contemporary literature, until it was laughed
                    out of existence by the <hi rend="italic">Précieuses Ridicules</hi> of Molière
                    and the dialogue of Boileau on <hi rend="italic">Les Héros de Roman.</hi> Such

                    between the romance of De Scudéry and the modern historical novel.</p>
                <p>After the invention of printing England produced few original contributions to
                    the literature of chivalric romance. There was a large number of translations of
                    the old French works, and, in addition to these, a rich store of romantic
                    ballads, which formed the customary literature of the people. The yeoman and the
                    outlaw had succeeded the steel-clad knight in public favour. Robin Hood and his
                    merry men appealed to a wider range of sympathies than did Arthur and his
                    companions, and such tales as the <hi rend="italic">Exploits of Robin Hood, Tom
                    a Lincoln, George a Green the Pinder of Wakefield,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thomas of Reading</hi> retained their vogue in abbreviated shape as chapbooks
                    down to the end of the 18th century. The stage monopolized the chief forces of
                    imaginative narration during the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods, and the next
                    specimen of a native romance is to be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euphues</hi> (1579-80) of John Lyly, who drew largely from Spanish sources.
                    Euphuism gave rise to the <hi rend="italic">Philo-timus</hi> (1583) of Brian
                    Melbanck, to Lodge’s <hi rend="italic">Rosalynde</hi> (1590), to Greene’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Dοrastus and Fawnia</hi> (1588), which was the foundation of
                    Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Winter’s Tale,</hi> and to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philomela</hi> (1592) by the same writer. Sir Philip Sidney’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia,</hi> which appeared in 1590, after the
                    author’s death, is the most brilliant prose fiction in English of the century,
                    and a genuine pastoral and heroic romance. We should not forget <hi
                    rend="italic">Parismus, Prince of Bohemia</hi> (1598), based upon Palmerin de
                    Oliva, and <hi rend="italic">Ornatus and Artesia</hi> (1607), both by Emanuel
                    Ford; <hi rend="italic">Pheander, a Maiden Knight</hi> (1595), by Henry Roberts;
                    and <hi rend="italic">The Miseries of Malvillia</hi> (1606), by Breton. Such
                    compilations as Painter’s <hi rend="italic">Palace of Pleasure</hi> (1566),
                    Whetstone’s <hi rend="italic">Heptameron</hi> (1582), <hi rend="italic">Westward
                    for Smelts</hi> (1620), and Goulart’s <hi rend="italic">Admirable Histories</hi>
                    (1607) are composed of translations or imitations of Italian and French tales.
                    Boccaccio, Giraldi Cinthio, Apuleius, Heliodorus, and Montemayor appeared in
                    English in the latter half of the 16th century, and to the laborious Munday we
                    owe versions of <hi rend="italic">Amadis</hi> (1592) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palmervn of England</hi> (1602) through the French. In the 17th century La
                    Calprenède, Scudéry, Gombauld, and other romancists were translated, and Mrs.
                    Behn, Lee, Lord Orrery, Settle, Banks, and Dryden adapted their works for the
                    stage. Barclay’s <hi rend="italic">Argenis,</hi> a politico-heroic romance with
                    characters representative of real and historical personages, first came out in
                    Latin in 1622; Bishop Hall’s <hi rend="italic">Mundus alter et idem</hi> (1607)
                    is an imitation of Rabelais. <hi rend="italic">Eliana</hi> (1661) is a
                    caricature of all the absurdities of the contemporary French school. The last of
                    the English romances is the <hi rend="italic">Partheηissa</hi> (1665) of Roger
                    Boyle, earl of Orrery, which, although prolix and incongruous, has literary
                    merit and a certain narrative interest.</p>
                <p>The last of the Spanish romances is <hi rend="italic">Ρolicisne de Roeeia</hi>
                    (1602) by Juan de Silva. They received their death-blow in Spain at the hands of
                    <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> in 1605, and even those of the greatest merit
                    and popularity almost entirely ceased to be reprinted after that date. Although
                    the pastoral romance of <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> (1560) by Montemayor does
                    not really belong to the present subject, it should be mentioned as forming a
                    distinct school of fiction with a family of successors scarcely less numerous
                    than the lineage of Amadis. It was continued by Gil Polo, and in it, as in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Galatea</hi> (1584) of Cervantes, figure real persons and
                    incidents. The earliest representative of the <hi rend="italic">picaresque</hi>
                    tale is to be found in <hi rend="italic">Lazamllο de Termes</hi> (1554).</p>
                <p>The heroic romance never became thoroughly naturalized in Portugal, and the
                    narrative class chiefly found its way through Spain. The romancists Rodriguez
                    Lobo, Eloi de Sa Sotomayor, and Pires de Rebello may be mentioned. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Menina e Moςa</hi> (1554) of Bernardim Ribeiro is the earliest
                    specimen of the pastoral style in the Portuguese language.</p>
                <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">Pastorαlia</hi> of Longus is to be considered as
                    the remote prototype of the modern works, <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> (1502),
                    the Italian poem of Sannazaro, undoubtedly influenced the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diana</hi> of Montemayor, and through it inspired the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arcadia</hi> of Sir Philip Sidney. A few translations and weak imitations of
                    foreign romances were printed in Italy in the 16th and 17th centuries, but <hi
                    rend="italic">nουelle</hi> or short tales formed the staple of the uatioual
                    prose fiction during that period.</p>
                <p>French romance—translations of <hi rend="italic">Amadis</hi> in the 16th and the
                    writings of Mademoiselle de Scudéry and her compeers in the 17th
                    century—exercised a supreme influence in Germany, where the pastoral romance was
                    represented by innumerable “Schäfereien.” <hi rend="italic">Herkules und
                    Valisea</hi> (1659) of A. II. Bucholz is a specimen of the voluminous and
                    tiresome heroic romance of the period. <hi rend="italic">Simplicis-simus</hi>
                    (1669) by Hans Jakob von Grimmelshausen, in which the hero traverses the scenes
                    of the Thirty Years’ War, is less a romance than the first national novel. C. W.
                    Hagdorn’s <hi rend="italic">Acquαn, oder der grosse Mogul</hi> (1670) is an
                    adaptation of La Calprenède's <hi rend="italic">Cassaηdrc,</hi> and E. W.
                    HappeΓs <hi rend="italic">Der insulanisehe Mandorell</hi> (1682) is a kind of
                    foreshadowing of <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe.</hi> Two of the most admired
                    fictions of the time were the <hi rend="italic">Asiatische Banise</hi> (1688) of
                    H. Anselm von Ziegler und Klipphausen and the <hi rend="italic">Arminius und
                    Thusnelda</hi> (1689) of D. K. von Lohenstein. Historical tales and love stories
                    were the chief favourites at the end of the 17th and “Robin-sonad⅛n" or
                    imitations of Defoe in the second quarter of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>In Holland the French heroic school was mirrored in the works of Johan van
                    Heemskerk, Hendrik Zoeteboom, and Lambertus Bos, published in the middle of the
                    17th century.</p>
