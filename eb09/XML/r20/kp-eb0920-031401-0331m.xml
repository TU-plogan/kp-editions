                    among all classes in Great Britain as to have gained an almost sacred character.
                    The pleasing colour of its plumage—one striking feature of which is expressed by
                    its ancient name—its sprightly air, full dark eye, enquiring and sagacious
                    demeanour, added to the trust in man it often exhibits, but, above all, the
                    cheerful sweetness of its song, even “when winter chills the day” and scarce
                    another bird is heard—combine to produce the effects just mentioned, so that
                    among many European nations it has earned some endearing name, though there is
                    no country in which “Robin Redbreast” is held so highly in regard as England.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>English colonists in
                    far distant lands have gladly applied the common nickname of the Redbreast to
                    other birds that are not immediately allied to it. The ordinary “Robin” of North
                    America is a Thrush, <hi rend="italic">Turdus migratorius</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fieldfare,</hi> vol. ix. p. 142), and one of the Bluebirds of
                    the same continent, the <hi rend="italic">Sialia sialis</hi> of most
                    ornithologists, is in ordinary speech the Blue “Robin”; while the same familiar
                    name is given in the various communities of Australasia to several species of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Petrocca,</hi> though some have no red breast.
                    </p></note> Well known as is its appearance and voice throughout the whole year
                    in the British Islands, there are not many birds which to the attentive observer
                    betray more unmistakably the influence of the migratory impulse <hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but somewhat close scrutiny is needed to reveal this fact.
                    In the months of July and August the hedgerows of the southern counties of
                    England may be seen to be beset with Redbreasts, not in flocks as is the case
                    with so many other species, but each indi<pb break="no"

                    that <hi rend="italic">TJnum arhustum non alit duos Erithacos</hi> —one bush
                    does not harbour two Redbreasts. </p></note> —all, however, pressing forward on
                    their way to cross the Channel. On the European continent the migration is still
                    more marked, and the Redbreast on its autumnal and vernal passages is the object
                    of hosts of bird-catchers, since its value as a delicacy for the table has long
                    been recognized. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of
                    late years an additional impulse has been given to the capture of this species
                    by the absurd fashion of using its skin for the trimming of ladies’ dresses and
                    “Christmas cards.” </p></note> But even those Redbreasts which stay in Britain
                    during the winter are subject to a migratory movement easily perceived by any
                    one that will look out for it. Occupying during autumn their usual haunts in
                    outlying woods or hedges, the first sharp frost at once makes them change their
                    habitation, and a heavy fall of snow drives them towards the homesteads for such
                    food as they may find there, while, should severe weather continue long and
                    sustenance become more scarce, even these stranger birds disappear—most of them
                    possibly to perish—leaving only the few that have already become almost
                    domiciled among men. On the approach of spring the accustomed spots are
                    revisited, but among the innumerable returning denizens Redbreasts are apt to be
                    neglected, for their song not being powerful is drowned or lost, as Gilbert
                    White well remarked, in the general chorus.</p>
                <p>From its abundance, or from innumerable figures, the Redbreast is too well known
                    to need description, yet there are very few representations of it which give a
                    notion of its characteristic appearance or gestures—all so suggestive of
                    intelligence. Its olive-brown back and reddish-orange breast, or their
                    equivalents in black and white, may be easily imitated by the draughtsman; but
                    the faculty of tracing a truthful outline or fixing the peculiar expression of
                    this favourite bird has proved to be beyond the skill of almost every artist who
                    has attempted its portraiture. The Redbreast exhibits a curious uncertainty of
                    temperament in regard to its nesting habits. At times it will place the utmost
                    confidence in man, and again at times shew the greatest jealousy. The nest,
                    though generally pretty, can seldom be called a work of art, and is usually
                    built of moss and dead leaves, with a moderate lining of hair. In this are laid
                    from five to seven white eggs, sprinkled or blotched with light red.</p>
                <p>Besides the British Islands, the Redbreast (which is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mota-cilla rubecula</hi> of Linnaeus and the <hi rend="italic">Erithacus
                    rubecula</hi> of modern authors) is generally dispersed over the continent of
                    Europe, and is in winter found in the oases of the Sahara. Its eastern limits
                    are not well determined. In Northern Persia it is replaced by a very nearly
                    allied form, <hi rend="italic">Erithacus hyrcanus,</hi> distinguishable by its
                    more ruddy hues, while in Northern China and Japan another species, <hi
                    rend="italic">E. akahige,</hi> is found of which the sexes differ somewhat in
                    plumage—the cock having a blackish band below his red breast, and greyish-black
                    flanks, while the hen closely resembles the familiar British species—but both
                    cock and hen have the tail of chestnut-red. A beautiful bird supposed to inhabit
                    Corea, the <hi rend="italic">Sylvia komadori</hi> of Temminck, of which
                    specimens are very scarce in collections, is placed by some writers in the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Erithacus</hi> , but whether it has any very close affinity to
                    the Redbreasts does not yet seem to be proved. It is of a bright orange-red
                    above, and white beneath, the male, however, having the throat and breast black.
