                    begun to execute the purpose for which it assembled by a breach of the peace and
                    to the terror of the public. A lawful assembly may become a riot if the persons
                    assembled form and proceed to execute an unlawful purpose to the terror of the
                    people, although they had not that purpose when they assembled” (Stephen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Digest of the Criminal Law,</hi> art. 73). The above is the
                    definition of a riot at common law in England. The offence is the most grave
                    kind of breach of the peace known to the law, short of treason. In its previous
                    stages it may be an affray, an unlawful assembly, or a riot, according to
                    circumstances, and it may, if carried far enough, become treason. An affray is
                    the fighting of two or more persons in the public street. An unlawful assembly
                    is an assembly of three or more persons λvith intent to commit a crime by force
                    or carry out a common purpose, lawful or unlawful, in such a way as to give
                    reasonable grounds for fearing a breach of the peace. A rout is an unlawful
                    assembly which has made a motion towards the execution of its common purpose. If
                    the unlawful assembly should begin to demolish a particular inclosure, that
                    would be a riot; if it should proceed to pull down all inclosures, that would be
                    treason. It was considered as early as the 14th century that the common law gave
                    an insufficient remedy against riot. In 1360 the statute of 34 Edw. III. c. 1
                    gave jurisdiction to justices to restrain, arrest, and imprison rioters. In 1393
                    the statute of 17 Rie. II. c. 8 conferred similar powers on the sheriff and <hi
                    rend="italic">posse comitαtus.</hi> Numerous other Acts extending the common law
                    were passed, especially in the Tudor reigns (see Stephen, <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Criminal Law,</hi> vol. i. p. 202). The effect of existing
                    legislation is to constitute certain statutory offences similar to riot at
                    common law. The earliest Act now in force is one commonly called the Riot Act, 1
                    Geo. I. st. 2, c. 5. That Act makes it the duty of a justice, sheriff, mayor, or
                    other authority, wherever twelve persons or more are unlawfully, riotously, and
                    tumultuously assembled together to the disturbance of the public peace, to
                    resort to the place of such assembly and read the following proclamation :—“Our
                    Sovereign Lady the Queen chargeth and commandeth all persons being assembled
                    immediately to disperse themselves, and peaceably to depart to their habitations
                    or to their lawful business, upon the pains contained in the Act made in the
                    first year of King George for preventing tumultuous and riotous assemblies. God
                    save the Queen.” It is a felony punishable with penal servitude for life to
                    obstruct the reading of the proclamation or to remain or continue together
                    unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously for one hour after the proclamation was
                    made or for one hour after it would have been made but for being hindered. The
                    Act requires the justices to seize and apprehend all persons continuing after
                    the hour, and indemnifies them <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n584/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0584-0565"/>and those who act under their authority from
                    liability for injuries caused thereby. Any prosecution for an offence against
                    the Act must be commenced within twelve months after the offence.</p>
                <p>By 24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 97, § 11, it is a felony punishable with penal servitude
                    for life for persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together to the
                    disturbance of the public peace to unlawfully and with force demolish or begin
                    to demolish or pull down or destroy any building, public building, machinery, or
                    mining plant. By § 12 it is a misdemeanour punishable with seven years’ penal
                    servitude to injure or damage such building, &amp;c. A riotous assembly of three
                    or more seamen unlawfully and with force preventing, hindering, or obstructing
                    the loading or unloading or the sailing or navigation of any vessel, or
                    unlawfully and with force boarding any vessel with intent to do so, constitutes
                    a misdemeanour punishable with twelve months’ hard labour, 33 Geo. III. c. 67.
                    In addition to these Acts, there are others aimed at crimes of a somewhat
                    similar nature, such as assembly for the purpose of smuggling, going armed in
                    pursuit of game by night, forcible entry and detainer, political meetings in the
                    city of Westminster, tumultuous petitioning, and unlawful drilling. For these
                    offences see Stephen, <hi rend="italic">Digest of the Criminal Law,</hi> art.
                    76-82.</p>
                <p>It is the duty of a magistrate at the time of a riot to assemble subjects of the
                    realm, whether civil or military, for the purpose of quelling a riot. In this
                    duty he is aided by the common law, under which all subjects of the realm are
                    bound to assist on reasonable warning, and by various enactments enabling the
                    authorities to call out the auxiliary and reserve forces for the suppression of
                    riot, and to close public houses where a riot is apprehended. It is his duty to
                    keep the peace; if the peace be broken, honesty of intention will not avail him
                    if he has been guilty of neglect of duty. The question is whether he did all
                    that he knew was in his power and which could be expected from a man of ordinary
                    prudence, firmness, and activity. The law as thus stated is gathered from the
                    opinions of the judges on the trials of the lord mayor of London and the mayor
                    of Bristol on indictments for neglect of duty at the time of the Gordon riots of
                    1780 and the Bristol riots in 1831. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Reports of these trials will be found in Carrington and
                    Payne’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> vol. v., p. 254. </p></note> In addition
                    to his liability to an indictment at common law, a defaulting magistrate is
                    subject under the provisions of 13 Hen. IV. c. 7 and 2 Hen. V. st. 1, c. 8, to a
                    penalty of £100 for every default, the default to be inquired of by commission
                    under the great seal. A matter of interest is the extent of the protection
                    afforded by the Riot Act to soldiers acting under the commands of their
                    officers. The soldier is at the same time a citizen, and the mere fact of his
                    being a soldier is not sufficient to exonerate him from all responsibility. No
                    case in which the question has called for decision seems to have arisen. It is
                    the opinion of Mr Justice Stephen that a soldier would be protected by orders
                    for which he might reasonably believe his superior officer to have good grounds
                    ( <hi rend="italic">History of the Criminal Law,</hi> vol. i. 206). On the other
                    hand, he would probably not be protected by an order plainly unnecessary, such
                    as an order to fire into a crowd of women and children when no violence was
                    observable.</p>
                <p>The civil remedy given to those whose property has suffered by riot is of an
                    exceptional character. The action is brought against the hundred in which the
                    riot took place. This liability of the hundred is a survival of the pre-Conquest
                    obligation of the hundred and tithing to pursue and do justice on the thief: the
                    hundred is supposed to guarantee the orderly conduct of its inhabitants, and is
                    liable to damages for its failure to preserve order. The liability of the
                    hundred in case of robbery was enacted as early as the Statute of Winchester, 13
                    Edw. I. st. 2. That and subsequent Acts were repealed by 7 &amp; 8 Geo. IV. c.
                    27, and their provisions were consolidated and amended by 7 &amp; 8 Geo. IV. c.
                    31. The Act gives a remedy against the hundred in the case of any church,
                    chapel, house, machinery, &amp;c., being “feloniously demolished, pulled down,
                    or destroyed, wholly or in part, by any persons riotously and tumultuously
                    assembled together.” A summary remedy is given for damage not exceeding £30. The
                    remedy is extended to injury to threshing machines by 2 &amp; 3 Will. IV. c. 72.
                    It has been held that damage to a house will not entitle the owner to
                    compensation from the hundred unless the intention of the rioters was to totally
                    destroy the house.</p>
                <p>The Riot Act does not extend to Ireland. But similar provisions are contained in
                    the Act of the Irish Parliament of 27 Geo. III. c.</p>
                <p>15, as amended by 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 28. An offence peculiar to Ireland and
                    punishable with penal servitude for life under the provisions of the Acts above
                    mentioned is the sending of a notice, letter, or message exciting or tending to
                    excite a riot. The Prevention of Crimes Act, 1882, enabled summary proceedings
                    to be taken against rioters. The Act was temporary only, expiring with the
                    session of Parliament 1885.</p>
                <p>In Scotland a riot may be either rioting and mobbing or rioting and breach of the
                    peace. The first is much the same as the riot of English law. “Mobbing consists
                    in the assembling of a number of people and their combining against order and
                    peace to the alarm of the lieges” (Macdonald, <hi rend="italic">Criminal
                    Law,</hi> 180). The second offence occurs where concourse or a common purpose
                    are wanting. Numerous Acts against riot and unlawful convocation were passed by
                    the Scottish parliament at different times, beginning as early as 1457. The Riot
                    Act (1 Geo. I.) applies to Scotland. The liability of the county or burgh for
                    destruction of property by riot is provided for by the Riot Act and by several
                    Acts of Parliament of the reign of George III.</p>
                <p>In the United States the law is based upon that of England. In some States there
                    is a statutory proclamation for the dispersion of rioters in words almost
                    identical with those of the British Riot Act. The city, town, or county,
                    according to circumstances, is liable for the damage caused by rioters. In some
                    cases a remedy over against the rioters is given by legislation. (J. W+. )</p>
