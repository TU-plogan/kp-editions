                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0367-0350"/>as adventurous as any boy reader of his novels
                    could desire. He was a native of Ulster, born in 1818, and was educated for the
                    church, but, disliking the prospect of a regular profession, went to America at
                    the age of twenty in search of excitement and fortune. Among other experiences
                    he made trading excursions on the Red River, and studied the ways of the
                    retiring red man and the white pioneer on the spot. He made acquaintance with
                    the Missouri in the same practical manner, and roved about through all the
                    States of the Union. When the war with Mexico broke out in 1845 he obtained a
                    commission, was present at the siege and capture of Vera Cruz, and led a forlorn
                    hope at Chapultepec. In one of his novels he says that he believed theoretically
                    in the military value of untrained troops, and that he had found his theories
                    confirmed in actual warfare. But, though he saw a good deal of service in
                    America, he was disappointed in his plans for taking part in a conflict with the
                    regular troops of a European country. An enthusiastic republican, he offered his
                    services to the Hungarian insurgents in 1849, raised a body of volunteers, and
                    sailed for Europe, but arrived too late. Thereafter he settled in England, and
                    began his career of a novelist in 1849 with the <hi rend="italic">Rifle
                    Rangers.</hi> This was followed next year by the <hi rend="italic">Scalp
                    Hunters.</hi> He never surpassed his first productions, except perhaps in <hi
                    rend="italic">The White Chief</hi> (1855) and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Quadroon</hi> (1856); but he continued to produce tales of self-reliant
                    enterprise and exciting adventure with great fertility. Simplicity of plot and
                    easy variety of exciting incident are among the merits that contribute to his
                    popularity with boys. His reflexions are not profound, but are frequently more
                    sensible than might be presumed at first sight from his aggressive manner of
                    expressing them. He died in London, October 22, 1883.</p>
