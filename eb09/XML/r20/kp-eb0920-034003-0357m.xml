                    common law. “In judgment of law the king, as king, cannot be said to be a minor,
                    for when the royal body politic of the king doth meet with the natural capacity
                    in one person ,the whole body shall have the quality of the royal politic, which
                    is the greater and more worthy and ־wherein is no minority. For <hi

                    For reasons of necessity a regency, however anomalous it may be in strict law,
                    has frequently been constituted both in England and Scotland. There are fifteen
                    instances in English history, the earliest of which is the appointment of the
                    earl of Pembroke with the assent of the loyal barons on the accession of Henry
                    III. Whether or not the sanction of parliament is necessary for the appointment
                    is a question which has been much discussed. Lord Coke recommends that the
                    office should depend on the will of parliament <hi rend="italic">(Inst.,</hi>
                    vol. iv. p. 58), and it is certain that in modern times provision for a regency
                    has always been made by Act of Parliament. In Scotland the appointment of
                    regents was always either by the assent of a council or of parliament. Thus in
                    1315 the earl of Moray was appointed regent by Robert I. in a council. At a
                    later period appointment by statute was the universal form. Thus by 1542 c. 1
                    the earl of Arran was declared regent during the minority of Mary. By 1567 c. 1
                    the appointment by Mary of the earl of Moray as regent was confirmed. As late as
                    1704 c. 3 provision was made for a regency after the death of Anne. The earliest
                    regency in England resting upon an express statute was that created by 28 Hen.
                    VIII. c. 17, under which the king appointed his executors to exercise the
                    authority of the crown till the successor to the crown should attain the age of
                    eighteen if a male or sixteen if a female. They delegated their rights to the
                    protector Somerset, with the assent of the lords spiritual and temporal. No
                    other example of a statutory provision for a regency occurs till 1751. In that
                    year the Act of 24 Geo. II. c. 24 constituted the princess dowager of Wales
                    regent of the kingdom in case the crown should descend to any of her children
                    before such child attained the age of eighteen. A council called the council of
                    regency was appointed to assist the princess. A prescribed oath was to l&gt;e
                    taken by the regent and members of the council. Their consent was necessary for
                    the marriage of a successor to the crown during minority. It was declared to be
                    unlawful for the regent to make war or peace, or ratify any treaty with any
                    foreign power, or prorogue, adjourn, or dissolve any parliament without the
                    consent of the majority of the council of regency, or give her assent to any
                    bill for repealing or varying the Act of Settlement, the Act of Uniformity, or
                    the Act of the Scottish parliament for securing the Protestant religion and
                    Presbyterian church government in Scotland (1707 c. 6). The last is an
                    invariable provision, and occurs in all subsequent Regency Acts. The reign of
                    George III. affords examples of provision for a regency during both the infancy
                    and incapacity of a king. The Act of 5 Geo. III. c. 27 vested <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n358/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0358-0341"/>in the king power to appoint a regent under the
                    sign manual, such regent to be one of certain named members of the royal family.
                    The remaining provisions closely followed those of the Act of George II. In 1788
                    the insanity of the king led to the introduction of a Regency Bill. In the
                    course of the debate in the House of Lords the duke of York disclaimed on behalf
                    of the prince of Wales any right to assume the regency without the consent of
                    parliament. The necessity for the authority of parliament in the particular
                    circumstances was much discussed, as a reference to the parliamentary history of
                    the time will show. Owing to the king’s recovery the bill ultimately dropped. On
                    a return of the malady in 1810 the Act of 51 Geo. III. c. 1 was passed,
                    appointing the prince of Wales regent during the king’s incapacity. The royal
                    assent was given by commission authorized by resolution of both Houses. By this
                    Act no council of regency was appointed. There was no restriction on the
                    regent’s authority over treaties, peace and war, or parliament, as in the
                    previous Acts, but his power of granting peerages, offices, and pensions was
                    limited. At the accession of William IY. the duchess of Kent was, by 1 Will. IY.
                    c. 2, appointed regent, if necessary, until the Princess Victoria should attain
                    the age of eighteen. No council of regency was appointed. By 1 Yict. c. 72 lords
                    justices were nominated as a kind of regency council without a regent in case
                    the successor to the crown should be out of the realm at the queen’s death. They
                    were restricted from granting peerages, and from dissolving parliament without
                    directions from the successor. The last Regency Act was passed after the
                    marriage of the queen. By 3 &amp; 4 Yict. c. 52 Prince Albert was appointed
                    regent in case any of the queen’s children should succeed to the crown under the
                    age of eighteen. The only restraint on his authority was the usual prohibition
                    to assent to any bill repealing the Act of Settlement, &amp;c. By 10 Geo. IV. c.
                    7 the office of regent of the United Kingdom cannot be held by a Roman Catholic.
                    A similar disability is imposed in most, if not all, Regency Acts.</p>
