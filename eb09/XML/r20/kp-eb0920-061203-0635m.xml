                <p><label type="entry">ROCHELLE</label> La, a town and seaport of France, the
                    chef-lieu of the department of Charente-Inférieure, is situated on the Atlantic
                    coast in 46° 9' N. lat., 296 miles by rail south-west of Paris. Its
                    fortifications, which were constructed by Vauban, have a circuit of 3j miles
                    with seven gates. In population (20,028 in 1881; 22,464 in the commune) it ranks
                    after Rochefort. The harbour, one of the safest and most accessible on the
                    coast, comprises an outer harbour, a tidal basin, a wet dock, and a graving
                    dock. The outer harbour is still protected by the dry stone mole, about a mile
                    long, constructed by Richelieu. The wet dock (7 acres) is capable of receiving
                    ships of 1000 tons. Behind these is the Maubec basin, the water of which along
                    with that of the Niort Canal helps to scour the port and navigable channel. On
                    the fortifications towards the sea are three towers, of which the oldest (1384)
                    is that of St Nicholas. The apartment in the first story was formerly used as a
                    chapel. The chain tower (1476) was at one time connected with that of St
                    Nicholas by a great pointed arch. The lantern tower (1475-76), seven stories
                    high, affords a fine view of the town, the roadstead, and the surrounding
                    islands, and at present is used as a military prison. Of the ancient gateways
                    only one has been preserved in its entirety, that of the “grosse hor loge,” a
                    huge square tower of the 14th or 15th century,</p>

                <p>the corner turrets of which have been surmounted with trophies since 1746. The
                    cathedral of La Rochelle (St Louis or St Bartholomew) is a heavy Grecian
                    building (1742-1862) with a dome above the transept, erected on the site of the
                    old church of St Bartholomew, destroyed in the 16th century and now represented
                    by a solitary tower dating from the 14th century. Externally the town-house
                    (1486-1607) has the appearance of a fortress in the Gothic style and internally
                    that of a Renaissance palace. The belfries are beautifully decorated with carved
                    work, and the council-chamber, where the mayor Guiton presided during the siege,
                    is now adorned by his statue. In the old episcopal palace (which was in turn the
                    residence of Sully, the prince of Condé, Louis XIII., and Anne of Austria, and
                    the scene of the marriage of Alphonso VI. of Portugal with a princess of Savoy)
                    accommodation has been provided for a library of 25,000 volumes, a collection of
                    records going back to the 13th century, and a museum founded in 1842 by the
                    society of the Friends of the Arts. Other buildings of note are an arsenal, an
                    artillery museum, a large hospital, a special Protestant hospital, a military
                    hospital, and a lunatic asylum for the department. In the public gardens there
                    is a museum of natural history. Mediaeval and Renaissance houses still give a
                    peculiar character to certain districts of the town: several have French, Latin,
                    or Greek inscriptions of a moral or religious turn and in general of Protestant
                    origin. Of these old houses the most interesting is that of Henry II. or Diana
                    of Poitiers. The parade-ground, which forms the principal public square,
                    occupies the site of the castle, demolished in 1590. Some of the streets have
                    side-arcades; the public wells are fed from a large reservoir in the Champ de
                    Mars; and among the promenades are the Cours des Dames with the statue of
                    Admiral Duperré (1869), and, outside, the tree-planted ramparts and the Mail, a
                    beautiful piece of greensward. In this direction are the sea-bathing
                    establishments. La Rochelle, besides a celebrated manufactory of barrels,
                    contains saw-mills, copper and iron foundries, and factories for patent fuel
                    made out of coal dross. In 1882 465 vessels (225,449 tons) entered and 431
                    (215,820) cleared. Coals from England and iron-ore from Spain are among the
                    staple imports. In the neighbourhood the principal industries are getting salt
                    from the marshes and rearing oysters and mussels.</p>
                <p>La Rochelle existed at the close of the 10th century under the name of Rupella.
                    In 1199 it received a communal charter from Eleanor, duchess of Guienne, and it
                    was in its harbour that John Lackland disembarked when he came to try to recover
                    the domains seized by Philip Augustus. Captured by Louis VIII. in 1224, it was
                    restored to the English in 1360 by the treaty of Brétigny, but it shook off the
                    yoke of the foreigner when Duguesclin recovered Saintonge. During the 14th,
                    15th, and 16th centuries La Rochelle, then an almost independent commune, was
                    one of the great maritime cities of France. From its harbour iu 1402 Jean de
                    Béthencourt set out for the conquest of the Canaries, and its seamen were the
                    first to turn to account the discovery of the New World. The salt-tax provoked a
                    rebellion at Rochelle which Francis I. had to come to repress in person; in 1568
                    the town secured exemption by the payment of a large sum. At the Reformation La
                    Rochelle early became one of the chief centres of Calvinism, and during the
                    religious wars it armed privateers which preyed on Catholic vessels in the
                    Channel and the high seas. In 1571 a synod of the Protestant churches of France
                    was held within its walls under the presidency of Beza for the purpose of
                    drawing up a confession of faith. After the massacre of St Bartholomew, La
                    Rochelle held out for six and a half months against the Catholic army, which was
                    ultimately obliged to raise the siege after losing more than 20,000 men. The
                    peace of 24th June 1573, signed by the people of La Rochelle in the name of all
                    the Protestant party, granted the Calvinists full liberty of worship in several
                    places of safety. Under Henry IV. the town remained quiet, but under Louis XIII.
                    it put itself again at the head of the Huguenot party. Its vessels blockaded the
                    mouth of the Gironde and stopped the commerce of Bordeaux, and also seized the
                    islands of Ré and Oléron and several vessels of the royal fleet. It was then
                    that Richelieu resolved to subdue the town once for all. In spite of the
                    assistance rendered by the English troops under Buckingham and in spite of the
                    fierce energy of their mayor Guiton, the people of La Rochelle were obliged to
                    capitulate after eight months’ siege (October 1628). During this investment
                    Richelieu raised the celebrated mole which cut off the town from the open sea.
                    La Rochelle then became the principal port for the trade between the
                    mother-country of France and the colony of Canada. But the revocation of the
                    Edict of Nantes deprived it of 3000 of its most industrious inhabitants, and the
                    loss of Canada by France completed the ruin of its commerce. Its privateers,
                    however, still maintained a vigorous struggle with the English during the
                    republic and the empire.</p>
                <p>Among the men of mark born at La Rochelle may he mentioned Jean Guiton, Tallemant
                    des Réaux, Reaumur the physicist, Admiral Duperré, Bonpland the botanist, and
                    the painters Fromentin and Bouguereau.</p>
