                <p><label type="entry">RACHEL</label> (1820 or 1821-1858), the stage name of a
                    French actress, whose true name was <hi rend="smallcaps">Elizabeth Félix,</hi>
                    and who was the daughter of Jacob Félix and Esther Haya, Alsatian Jews, who
                    travelled on foot through France as pedlars. She was born according to one
                    account on 24th March 1820, according to another on 28th February of the
                    following year, in a small inn in Mumpf in the canton of Aargau, Switzerland. At
                    Rheims she and her eldest sister Sophia, afterwards known as Sarah, joined a
                    troupe of Italian children who made their living by singing in the cafés, Sarah
                    taking part in the singing and Elizabeth, then only four years of age,
                    collecting the coppers. In 1830 they came to Paris, where they sang in the
                    streets, Rachel giving such patriotic songs as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Parisienne</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> with a rude but
                    precocious energy which evoked special admiration and an abundant shower of
                    coppers. Choron, a famous teacher of singing, was so impressed with the talents
                    of the two sisters that he undertook to give them gratuitous instruction, and
                    after his death in 1833 they were received into the Conservatoire.</p>
                <p>Sophia gained a medal for singing, but Rachel at an early period gave her chief
                    attention to elocution and acting. Her voice, though deep and powerful, was at
                    first hard and inflexible; and her thin and meagre appearance conveyed an
                    impression of insignificance, which her plain features and generally impassive
                    manner tended to confirm. It was only her remarkable intelligence that
                    encouraged her instructors to persevere; but even they did not recognize her
                    talents as exceptional. She made her first appearance at the Gymnase in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Vendéenne</hi> in 1837 with only mediocre success. On 12th
                    June of the following year she succeeded, after great difficulty, in making a
                    début at the Théâtre Français, appearing as Camille in <hi rend="italic">Les
                        Horaces</hi> , when, attention having been directed to her remarkable genius
                    by Jules Janin in the <hi rend="italic">Débats</hi> and Madame de Girardin in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Presse,</hi> it at once received universal recognition.
                    Her range of characters was limited, but within this range she was
                    unsurpassable. It was especially in the tragedies of Racine and Corneille that
                    she excelled, and more particularly in the impersonation of evil or malignant
                    passion. By careful training her originally hard and harsh voice had become
                    flexible and melodious, and its low and muffled notes under the influence of
                    passion possessed a thrilling and penetrating quality that was irresistible.
                    When excited her plain features became transfigured by the glow of genius, and
                    in her impersonations of evil and malignant emotions there was a majesty and
                    dignity which fascinated whilst it repelled. Her facial elocution was
                    unsurpassable in variety and expressiveness, whilst the grace of her gestures
                    and the marvellous skill with which she varied her tones with every shade of
                    thought and emotion were completely beyond criticism. It was, however, the
                    predominance of intellect and will rather than the perfection of her art that
                    most specially characterized her impersonations and conferred on them their
                    unique excellence. She appeared successively as Émilic in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cinna,</hi> Hermione in <hi rend="italic">Andromaque,</hi> Ériphile in <hi
                        rend="italic">Iphigénie,</hi> Monime in <hi rend="italic">Mithridate,</hi>
                    and Aménaïde in <hi rend="italic">Tancrède;</hi> but it was in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phèdre,</hi> which she first played on 21st January 1843, that her peculiar
                    gifts were most strikingly manifested. In modern plays she created the
                    characters of Judith and Cleopatra in the tragedies of Madame de Girardin, but
                    her most successful appearance was in 1849 in <hi rend="italic">Adrienne
                        Lecouvreur.</hi> In 1840 she visited London, where her interpretations of
                    Corneille and Racine were the sensation of the season. She also played
                    successively in the principal capitals of Europe. In 1855 she made a tour in the
                    United States with comparatively small success. This was, however, after her
                    powers through continued ill-health had begun to deteriorate. She died of
                    consumption at Cannet, near Cannes, on 4th January 1858.</p>
