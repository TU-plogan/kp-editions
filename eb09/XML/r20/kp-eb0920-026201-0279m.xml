                    rend="smallcaps">Walter</hi> (1552-1618), admiral and courtier, was born at
                    Hayes in Devonshire in 1552. After a short residence at Oriel College, Oxford,
                    he took service in the autumn of 1569 with a body of volunteers serving in the
                    French Huguenot army, and he probably did not return to England till 1576.
                    During the course of these years he appears to have made himself master of
                    seamanship, though no evidence of this is obtainable. In 1579 he was stopped by
                    the council from taking part in a voyage planned by his half-brother Sir
                    Humphrey Gilbert, and in 1580 he commanded an English company in Munster
                    (Ireland). On 10th November he took part in the massacre at Smerwick. He
                    remained in Ireland till December 1581, distinguished for his vigour and ability
                    as well as for his readiness to treat Irish rebels as mere wild beasts, who were
                    to be pitilessly exterminated, and whose leaders might be smitten down if
                    necessary by assassination. In one way or another Raleigh’s conduct gained the
                    favourable notice of Elizabeth, especially as he had chosen to seek for the
                    support of Leicester, in whose suite he is found at Antwerp in February 1582.
                    For some years Raleigh shone as a courtier, receiving from time to time licences
                    to export woollen cloths and to sell wine, after the system by which Elizabeth
                    rewarded her favourites without expense to herself. In 1585 he became lord
                    warden of the Stannaries, soon afterwards he was vice-admiral of Devon and
                    Cornwall, and in 1587 was captain of the guard. But he was one of those who were
                    dissatisfied unless they could pursue some public object in connexion with their
                    chase after a private fortune. In 1583 he risked ¿£2000 in the expedition in
                    which Sir Humphrey Gilbert perished. In 1584 he obtained a charter of
                    colonization, and sent Amadas and Barlow to examine the country which he named
                    Virginia. In 1585 he despatched a fleet laden with colonists. They were,
                    however, soon discouraged and were brought back to England by Drake in the
                    following year. Shortly afterwards fifteen fresh colonists were landed, and
                    another party in 1587. All these, however, perished, and, though Raleigh did all
                    that was possible to succour them, the permanent colonizing of Virginia passed
                    into other hands.</p>
                <p>In 1584 Raleigh obtained a grant of an enormous tract of land in Munster, in one
                    corner of which he introduced the cultivation of the potato. To people that land
                    with English colonists was but the counterpart of the attempt to exterminate its
                    original possessors. This view of the policy of England in Ireland was not
                    confined to Raleigh, but it found in him its most eminent supporter. In his
                    haste to be wealthy, his love of adventure, his practical insight into the
                    difficulties of the world, and his unscrupulousness in dealing with peoples of
                    different habits and beliefs from his own, Raleigh was a representative
                    Elizabethan Englishman. He did his best, so far as a usually absentee landlord
                    could do, to make his colonists prosperous and successful; but he underestimated
                    the extraordinary vitality of the Irish race, and the resistance which was
                    awakened by the harsh system of which he was the constant adviser at Elizabeth's
                    court. Elizabeth, too, was unable to support him with the necessary force, and
                    his whole attempt ended in failure. Raleigh’s efforts were at least made on
                    behalf of a race whose own civilization and national independence were at stake.
                    The Elizabethan men were driven to take large views of their difficulties, and
                    it was impossible for Raleigh to separate the question whether English forms of
                    life should prevail in Munster from the question whether they should be
                    maintained in England. Two conceptions of politics and religion stood face to
                    face from the Atlantic to the Carpathians, and every one of vigour took a side.
                    The balancing intellects were silenced, or, like Elizabeth’s, were drawn in the
                    wake of the champions of one party or the other. Wherever the strife was hottest
                    Raleigh was sure to be found. If he could not succeed in Ireland he would fight
                    it out with Spain. In 1588 he took an active part against the Armada, and is
                    even supposed by some to have been the adviser of the successful tactics which
                    avoided any attempt to board the Spanish galleons. In 1589 he shared in the
                    unsuccessful expedition commanded by Drake and Norris, and for some time vessels
                    fitted out by him were actively employed in making reprisals upon Spain.</p>
                <p>Raleigh was a courtier as well as a soldier and a mariner, and as early as 1589
                    he was brought into collision with the young earl of Essex, who challenged him,
                    though the duel was prevented. Some passing anger of the queen drove him in this
                    year to visit Ireland, where he renewed his friendship with Spenser, and, as is
                    told in poetic language in <hi rend="italic">Colin Clout’s come Home again</hi>
                    , took the poet back with him to England, introduced him to Elizabeth, and
                    persuaded him to proceed to the immediate publication of a portion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Faerie Queen.</hi> If Raleigh could plead for a poet, he could
                    also plead for a Puritan, and in 1591 he joined Essex in begging for mercy for
                    Udall. In the end of 1591 or the beginning of 1592 Raleigh seduced and
                    subsequently married Elizabeth Throckmorton, and was consequently thrown into
                    the Tower by Elizabeth, who could not endure that the fantastic love-making to
                    herself which she exacted from her courtiers should pass into real affection for
                    a younger woman. Previously to his imprisonment Raleigh had been forbidden to
                    sail in command of a fleet of which a great part had been fitted out at his own
                    cost for service against Spain. The ships, however, sailed, and succeeded in
                    capturing a prize of extraordinary value known at the time as the “Great
                    Carrack.” No one but Raleigh was capable of presiding over the work of securing
                    the spoils. He was sent to Plymouth, still in the name of a prisoner, where his
                    capacity for business and his power of winning the enthusiastic affection of his
                    subordinates were alike put to the test. The queen at last consented to restore
                    him to complete liberty, though she tried to cheat him of his fair share of the
                    booty.</p>
                <p>Raleigh resolved to use his regained liberty on an enterprise more romantic than
                    the capture of a carrack. The fable of the existence of El Dorado was at that
                    time fully believed in Spain, and in 1594 Raleigh sent out Captain Wheddon to
                    acquire information about the lands near the Orinoco. In 1595 he sailed in
                    person with five ships for Trinidad. On his arrival he found that the Spaniards,
                    who had occupied a place called San Thome at the junction of the Orinoco and the
                    Caroni, had been obliged to abandon it. Raleigh ascended the river to the spot,
                    heard more about El Dorado from the Indians, brought away some stones containing
                    fragments of gold, and returned to England to prepare a more powerful expedition
                    for the following year. When he came back lies published an account of his
                    voyage. The hope of enriching himself, and of giving to his country a source of
                    wealth <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0280-0263"/>which would strike the balance in its favour in
                    the struggle with Spain, exercised a strong fascination over the imaginative
                    character of Raleigh. In the next year, 1596, however, he was wanted nearer
                    home, and was compelled to content himself with sending one of his followers,
                    Captain Keymis, to extend his knowledge of Guiana. He was himself called on to
                    take the command of a squadron in the expedition sent against Spain under Lord
                    Howard of Effingham and the earl of Essex. It was Raleigh who, on the arrival of
                    the fleet off Cadiz, persuaded Howard and Essex to begin by an attack on the
                    Spanish fleet, and who himself led the van in sailing into the harbour. Before
                    long the Spanish fleet was thoroughly beaten, and all of it, except two vessels
                    which were captured, was destroyed by the Spaniards themselves. Raleigh was
                    wounded in the action, and the subsequent capture of Cadiz was carried out by
                    others. In May 1597 Elizabeth, who was growing somewhat tired of the petulance
                    of Essex, readmitted Raleigh to court. It was arranged that he should go as
                    rear-admiral of a fleet, under the command of Essex, intended to cripple yet
                    further the maritime power of Spain. The “island voyage,” as it was called, was
                    on the whole a failure, the only notable achievement being the capture of Fayal
                    (Azores) by Raleigh in the absence of Essex. The generous nature of Essex was
                    overmastered by vanity, and, falling under the sway of meaner men, he grew to
                    regard Raleigh as a personal rival. He did not even mention the capture of Fayal
                    in his official account of the voyage.</p>
                <p>In 1598 Elizabeth, who was always ready to reward her courtiers at the expense of
                    others, completed a bargain in Raleigh’s favour. In 1591 he had obtained,
                    through the queen’s intervention, a lease for ninety-nine years of the manor of
                    Sherborne from the bishop of Salisbury. In 1598 the see was vacant. Aspirants to
                    the mitre were informed that only by converting the lease into a perpetual
                    estate in Raleigh’s favour could the object of their wishes be obtained. On
                    these terms Dr Cotton became bishop of Salisbury and Raleigh possessor of
                    Sherborne in full ownership. In 1600 Raleigh added to his other offices that of
                    governor of Jersey. A temporary reconciliation between Raleigh and Essex was
                    followed by a permanent estrangement when Essex was appointed to the government
                    of Ireland, the personal feeling on both sides being probably strengthened by
                    the divergence between their Irish policies,—Raleigh wishing to use force alone,
                    whilst Essex wished to come to terms with Tyrone. When Essex rushed into his
                    final act of rebellion he gave out as one of his reasons his fear of being
                    murdered by Raleigh and Lord Cobham, who at this time were allied.</p>
                <p>After the death of Essex the question of the succession assumed a pressing
                    importance with the imminence of the close of Elizabeth’s reign. Cecil, allying
                    himself with the intriguing Lord Henry Howard, assured himself of James’s
                    favour, and poisoned his ear against Raleigh and Cobham. Into Raleigh’s feelings
                    at this time it is impossible to penetrate with certainty, but it can hardly be
                    doubted that, though he professed himself ready to support James’s claim, he did
                    not throw his whole heart into the cause of the Scottish king. Raleigh was the
                    man of the struggle against Spain, self-reliant and unrelenting, eager to push
                    on the reprisals on Spain till the Spanish monarchy was utterly beaten down.
                    James was a lover of peace, anxious to live on good terms with all his
                    neighbours, and under the belief that by fair dealing the Catholic powers and
                    the pope himself might be brought to accept loyally the hand which he was ready
                    to hold out. Raleigh, in short, wished to emphasize the differences which
                    divided Christendom; James wished to treat them as hardly existing at all. When
                    James came to the throne, therefore, he was certain to come into conflict with
                    Raleigh, and not being able to see the advantage of keeping about him men of
                    different tempers he dismissed him from the captaincy of the guard, compelled
                    him to surrender the wardenship of the Stannaries, suspended his patent of wine
                    licences as a monopoly, and took from him the governorship of Jersey, though for
                    this he gave him a pension to compensate for his loss. That which followed it is
                    impossible to fathom to the bottom. Raleigh must have been very angry, and it is
                    quite possible that he may have used violent language and have even spoken of a
                    Spanish invasion as preferable to the rule of James, or have declared his
                    preference of the title of Arabella Stuart to that of the existing sovereign.
                    The main witness against him was Cobham, and Cobham made and retracted his
                    charges with such levity that it is impossible to trust to his evidence.
                    Raleigh, however, was imprisoned, and, after attempting to commit suicide, was
                    brought to trial at Winchester in November 1603, when he was condemned to death.
                    The king, however, commuted his sentence upon the scaffold to one of
                    imprisonment.</p>
                <p>During his imprisonment in the Tower Raleigh devoted himself to chemical
                    experiments and to literary work. It was here that he composed so much of the
                    <hi rend="italic">History of the World</hi> as was ever finished, and that he
                    also issued pamphlets on questions of passing politics. Here too he learned that
                    misfortune continued to follow him, and that there was a flaw in the conveyance
                    by which he had made over Sherborne to trustees to save it from the usual
                    consequences of attainder, and that James had seized it for his favourite Carr,
                    though he gave in compensation £8000 and a pension of £400 a year for the lives
                    of Lady Raleigh and her eldest son.</p>
                <p>Raleigh’s thoughts had often turned to Guiana. An offer made by him in 1612 to
                    send Keymis to the gold mine which he believed to exist near the Orinoco was
                    rejected, but in 1616 he was himself released at the intercession of Yilliers,
                    on the understanding that he was to go in person to Guiana, and was to visit the
                    gold mine. As a security that he would not encroach upon the territory of Spain,
                    he Avas to remain unpardoned, so that his life might be at the king’s mercy if
                    he broke his promise. It is probably not doing injustice to Raleigh to suppose
                    that he had no intention of keeping it if it proved inconvenient. As far as Avas
                    then knoAvn, indeed, the spot Avhere the mine Avas supposed to be might be
                    reached Avithout passing a Spanish settlement, though he Avas aAvare that the
                    Spaniards claimed the Avhole country as their OAvn. To seize Spanish territory
                    and to fight the Spaniards in every possible Avay was, lioAvever, regarded by
                    him as altogether righteous as well as politic, and he had no respect for
                    James’s scruples, which arose partly from Aveakness, but partly also from a
                    respect for international obligations, Avhich in the case of Spain Avas foreign
                    to Raleigh’s mind. Most likely Raleigh thought that all Avould be well if he
                    brought home sufficient evidence that the mine Avas AA <hi rend="superscript"
                    >T</hi> orth possessing. Before he sailed he suggested to James that he should
                    be alloAved to attack Genoa, a city in dependence on Spain, and AA’hen this plan
                    was rejected he entered into communication with the French ambassador and sent
                    to the admiral of France to ask permission to bring into a French harbour all
                    that he might gain on his voyage. The expedition turned out badly. His sailors
                    would not ascend the Orinoco unless he remained at the mouth to keep off the
                    Spaniards. Those who ascended found a Spanish village in the Avay, and after a
                    sharp fight drove the Spaniards out and burned the place. The mine, if it really
                    existed, they never reached, and Raleigh had to return to England with failure
                    on his head. He was soon arrested and lodged in the Tower.</p>
                <p>Whether James Avould have pardoned Raleigh if he had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n281/mode/1up"

                    be said. Coining home as he did, he had to bear the blame of the attack on the
                    Spanish village, which he had done nothing to avert in his orders to the party
                    going up the river. He was brought before a commission of the privy council.
                    Notes taken of the proceedings have only partially been preserved, but it
                    appears that there was strong evidence that after his failure he had attempted
                    to induce his captains to seize Spanish prizes, or, in other words, to commit
                    what James held to be an act of piracy, though Raleigh, with his views of the
                    rightfulness of fighting Spain in America whatever the Governments in Europe
                    might do, would doubtless have qualified it by another name. At last the
                    commission decided against him, and he was sent to execution formally on his old
                    sentence at Winchester, in reality for having allowed his men to shed Spanish
                    blood after engaging that he would not do so. He was executed on 29th October
                    1618. His attitude against Spain gave him popularity at a time when the attempt
                    of James to draw’ closer the bonds between Spain and England was repudiated by
                    the great majority of the nation. (s. R. G.)</p>
