                    school of the place, who designed his son for the medical profession. But the

                    Plympton schoolhouse, which greatly astonished his father. It was at length
                    decided that the lad should devote himself to art, and in October 1741 he
                    proceeded to London to study under Thomas Hudson, a mediocre artist, a native of
                    Devonshire, who was popular in the metropolis as a portrait painter. Reynolds
                    remained with Hudson for only two years, acquiring with uncommon aptitude the
                    technicalities of the craft, and in 1743 he returned to Devonshire, where,
                    settling at Plymouth Dock, he employed himself in portrait painting. By the end
                    of 1744 he was again in London. He was well received by his old master, from
                    whom he appears previously to have parted with some coldness on both sides.
                    Hudson introduced him to the artists’ club that met in Old Slaughters, St
                    Martin’s Lane, and gave him much advice as to his work. Reynolds now painted his
                    portraits of Captain Hamilton, father of the marquis of Abercorn, of Mrs Field,
                    of Alderman Tracey, now in the Plymouth Athenaeum, and of the notorious AIiss
                    Chudleigb, afterwards duchess of Kingston. To this period, or perhaps to one
                    slightly later, is referable the artist’s excellent oval bust portrait of
                    himself, which was included in the Grosvenor Gallery Exhibition of 1884. At
                    Christmas 1746 he was recalled to Plympton to attend the last hours of his
                    father, after whose death he again established himself, now with two of his
                    sisters, at Plymouth Dock, where he painted portraits, and, as he has himself
                    recorded, derived much instruction from an examination of some λvorks by William
                    Gandy of Exeter, whose broad and forcible execution must have been an excellent
                    corrective to the example of Hudson’s dry and hard method.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the pleasant urbanity of manner which distinguished Reynolds throughout
                    life had been winning for him friends. He had made the acquaintance of Lord
                    Edgcumbe, and by him was introduced to Captain (afterwards Viscount Keppel), who
                    was to play an important and helpful part in the career of the young painter.
                    Keppel was soon made aware of Reynolds’s ardent desire to visit Italy; and, as
                    he had just been appointed to the command of the Mediterranean squadron, he
                    gracefully invited the artist to accompany him in his own ship, the “Centurion.”
                    The offer was gladly accepted. While Keppel was conducting his tedious
                    negotiations with the dey of Algiers, relative to the piracy with which that
                    potentate was charged, Reynolds resided at Port Mahon, the guest of the governor
                    of Minorca, painting portraits of the principal inhabitants; and, in December
                    1749, he sailed for Leghorn, and thence, with all eagerness, made his way to
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>He has confessed that his first sight of the works of Raphael was a grievous
                    disappointment, and that it required lengthened study before he could appreciate
                    the correctness and grace of the master. By the dignity and imagination of
                    Michelangelo he was deeply impressed; to the end of life the great Florentine
                    remained for Reynolds the supreme figure in art; his name was constantly upon
                    his lips, and, as he had wished, it was the last that he pronounced to the
                    students of the Royal Academy. Of the influence of Correggio, of his sweetness
                    of expression, of his method of chiaroscuro, we find frequent traces in the
                    works of Sir Joshua, especially in his paintings of children; but after all it
                    was from the Venetians that the English painter learned most. His own strongest
                    instincts were towards richness and splendour of colour, and in these qualities
                    he found unsurpassable examples in the productions of Titian and Veronese.</p>
                <p>While in Rome he avoided, as far as possible, the temptation to spend his time in
                    copying specific pictures, which he considered “a delusive kind of industry,” by
                    which “the student satisfies himself with an appearance of doing something, and
                    falls into the dangerous habit of imitating without selecting.” His method of
                    becoming acquainted with the old masters, and of assimilating their excellences,
                    was by diligent examination and comparison, aided by studies of general effect
                    and of individual parts. His knowledge of the Roman art treasures was dearly
                    purchased. While working in the corridors of the Vatican he caught a severe
                    cold, which resulted in the deafness that clung to him for the rest of his life,
                    and rendered necessary the ear-trumpet which he used in conversation.</p>
                <p>After a residence of two years in Rome, Reynolds, in the spring of 1752, spent
                    four months in visiting Parma, Florence, Venice, and other important cities of
                    Italy; and, after a brief stay in Devonshire, he established himself as <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0520-0503"/>a portrait painter in St Martin’s Lane, London,
                    whence he afterwards removed to Great Newport Street, and finally, in 1760, to
                    Leicester Square, where he continued to paint till his death.</p>
                <p>His first reception on his return was hardly a favourable one. Hudson called to
                    see his productions and told him, “Reynolds, you don’t paint so well as when you
                    left England.” Ellis, another accepted portrait painter of the time, who had
                    studied under Kneller, exclaimed, “This will never answer. Why, you don’t paint
                    in the least like Sir Godfrey,”—adding, as he abruptly left the room,
                    “Shakespeare in poetry, Kneller in painting.” The verdict of the public,
                    however, was all on the side of the young innovator. Lord Edgcumbe played the
                    part of the generous patron, and exerted himself to obtain commissions for his
                    protégé, of whose ability the portraits which he now produced—of the duchess of
                    Hamilton, the countess of Coventry, Lord Holderness, and especially of his old
                    friend Keppel—were sufficient guarantee. The artist’s painting-room was thronged
                    with the wealth and fashion of London, “with women who wished to be transmitted
                    as angels, and with men who wished to appear as heroes and philosophers”; and he
                    was already afloat upon that tide of prosperity which never ebbed till the day
                    of his death. Various other artists contested with him for popular applause.
                    First the Swiss Liotard had his moment of popularity; and at a later period
                    there was Opie, and the more formidable and sustained rivalry of Gainsborough
                    and of Romney; but in the midst of all, then as now, Reynolds maintained an
                    admitted supremacy. And, if the magic of his brush brought him crowds of
                    sitters, his charm qî manner gathered round him numerous friends. During the
                    first year of his residence in London he had made the acquaintance of Dr
                    Johnson, which, diverse as the two men were, became a friendship for life. To
                    him Burke and Goldsmith, Garrick, Sterne, Bishop Percy, and, it seems, Hogarth,
                    were before long added. At the hospitable dinner table of Reynolds such
                    distinguished men enjoyed the freest and most unconstrained companionship, and
                    most of them were members of the “Literary Club,” established, at the painter’s
                    suggestion, in 1764.</p>
                <p>In 1760 the London world of art was greatly interested by the novel proposal of
                    the Society of Artists to exhibit their works to the public. The hall of the
                    society was at their disposal for the purpose; and in the month of April an
                    exceedingly successful exhibition was opened, the precursor of many that
                    followed. To this display Reynolds contributed four portraits. In 1765 the
                    association obtained a royal charter, and became known as “The Incorporated
                    Society of Artists”; but much rivalry and jealousy was occasioned by the
                    management of the various exhibitions, and an influential body of painters
                    withdrew from the society, and proceeded to consider the steps that should be
                    taken in order that their corporate existence might be recognized. They had
                    access to the young king, George III., who promised his patronage and help. In
                    December 1768 the Royal Academy was founded, and Reynolds was elected, by
                    acclamation, its first president, an honour which more than compensated for his
                    failure to obtain the appointment of king’s painter, which, the previous year,
                    had been bestowed on Allan Ramsay, a more courtly but more commonplace artist.
                    In a few months the king signified his approval of the election by knighting the
                    new president, and intimating that the queen and himself would honour him with
                    sittings for portraits to be presented to the Academy.</p>
                <p>Reynolds was fitted for his neλv position no less by his urbane and courteous
                    manner and by his wide general culture than by his eminence as an artist. With
                    unwearied assiduity, with unfailing tact, he devoted himself to furthering the
                    interests of the new Academy. It was at his suggestion that the annual banquet
                    was instituted. To the specified duties of his post he added the delivery of a
                    presidential address at the distribution of the prizes, and his speeches on
                    these occasions form the well-known “discourses” of Sir Joshua. Expressed as
                    they are with simple elegance and perspicuous directness, these discourses alone
                    would be sufficient to entitle their author to literary distinction; indeed,
                    when they were first delivered, it was thought impossible that they could be the
                    production of a painter, and Johnson and Burke have been credited with their
                    composition, in spite of the specific denials of both, and of Dr Johnson’s
                    indignant exclamation—“Sir Joshua, sir, would as soon get me to paint for him as
                    to write for him !”</p>
                <p>In the unwearied pursuit of his art, and in the calm enjoyment of his varied
                    friendships, Sir Joshua’s life flowed on peacefully and happily enough. He was
                    too prosperous and successful an artist altogether to escape the jealousy of his
                    less fortunate and less capable brethren, and he suffered in this way sometimes,
                    especially from the attacks of Barry, a painter who lived long enough to regret
                    and, so far as he was able, to rectify his fault. In 1784, on the death of
                    Ramsay, Reynolds was appointed painter to the king. Two years previously he had
                    suffered from a paralytic attack; but, after a month of rest, he was able to
                    resume his painting with unabated energy and power. In the summer of 1789 his
                    sight began to fail; he was affected by the <hi rend="italic">gutta serena,</hi>
                    but the progress of the malady was gradual, and he continued occasionally to
                    practise his art till about the end of 1790. His last years were embittered by a
                    most unfortunate disagreement with the Royal Academy, relative to the
                    appointment of a professor of perspective. Under the impression that there was a
                    conspiracy against him among the various members, he signified his intention of
                    leaving the presidential chair, a resignation which he was afterwards induced to
                    withdraw, and his final discourse was delivered on the 10th December 1790. He
                    was still able to enjoy the companionship of his friends, and he exerted himself
                    in an effort to raise funds for the erection of a monument in St Paul’s to Dr
                    Johnson, who had died in 1784. Towards the end of 1791 it was evident to the
                    friends of Reynolds that he was gradually sinking. For a few months he suffered
                    from extreme depression of spirits, the result of a severe form of liver
                    complaint, and on the 23d February 1792 this great artist and blameless
                    gentleman passed peacefully away.</p>
                <p>Reynolds’s first discourse deals with the establishment of an academy for the
                    fine arts, and of its value as being a repository of the traditions of the best
                    of bygone practice, of “the principles which many artists have spent their lives
                    in ascertaining.” In the second lecture the study of the painter is divided into
                    three stages, —in the first of which he is busied with processes and
                    technicalities, with the grammar of art, while in the second he examines what
                    has been done by other artists, and in the last compares these results with
                    nature herself. In the third discourse Reynolds treats of “the great and leading
                    principles of the grand style”; and succeeding addresses are devoted to such
                    subjects as “Moderation,” “Taste,” “Genius,” and “Sculpture.” The fourteenth has
                    an especial interest as containing an appreciative but discriminating notice of
                    Gainsborough, who had died shortly before its delivery; while the concluding
                    discourse is mainly occupied with a panegyric on Michelangelo.</p>
                <p>The other literary works of the president comprise his three essays in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Idler</hi> for 1759-G0 (“On the Grand Style in Painting,” and
                    “On the True Idea of Beauty ”), his notes to Du Fresnoy’s <hi rend="italic">Art
                    of Painting,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Art of the Low
                    Countries,</hi> his brief notes in Johnson’s <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare,</hi>
                    and two singularly witty and brilliant fragments, imaginary conversations with
                    Johnson, which were never intended by their author for publication, but, found
                    among his papers after his death, were given to the world by his niece, the
                    marchioness of Thomond.</p>
                <p>But the literary works of Reynolds, excellent as these arc, were <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n521/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0521-0504"/>the occupation of his mere bye hours and times of
                    leisure. The main effort of his life was directed to painting, a pursuit which,
                    as he was never weary of impressing on younger artists, was enough to occupy a
                    man’s whole time, even were it longer than it is, and to call forth his utmost
                    energy. The unceasing application, perseverance, and assiduity which form the
                    recurrent burden of Reynold’s discourses found the most complete illustration in
                    his own career. He laid it down as a distinct principle that each fresh portrait
                    to which he set his hand should excel the last, and no effort was wanting to
                    realize this aim. In his search for perfection he would paint and repaint a
                    subject; when a visitor asked how a certain portion of the infant Hercules had
                    been executed, he replied, “How can 1 tell! There are ten pictures below this,
                    some better, some worse.” A method like this contrasts curiously with the swift
                    certainty of Gainsborough’s practice, but it must be confessed that the
                    productions of Reynolds have an abiding charm that is wanting in the exquisite
                    but slighter and more mannered work of his great rival. In range, too, of
                    subject, as well as of method, the art of Sir Joshua has by far the wider reach.
                    “How various the man is,” said Gainsborough once, after he had been examining
                    the president’s portraits hung in an Academy exhibition; and the remark gains an
                    added point and emphasis when we compare the paintings of Reynolds with
                    Gainsborough’s own.</p>
                <p>In the work which the painter produced shortly after his return from Italy—in the
                    Lady Cathcart and her Daughter of 1755, the Lady Elizabeth Montague and the
                    George, Earl of λVarwick, of 1756, and the Countess of Hyndford of 1757—we find
                    a certain dignity and elegance of pose and arrangement which bears witness to
                    his foreign studies, joined to some coldness of colour, hardness of execution,
                    and insistance on definiteness of outline, which contrasts with the sweet
                    felicity and tenderness of his fully developed manner, with its perfect colour,
                    and its form which is lost and found again in an exquisite mystery. But soon all
                    that is tentative and immature disappears from his works. In 1758 we have the
                    gracious and winning full-length of Elizabeth Gunning, Duchess of Hamilton, and
                    the stately Duke of Cumberland, followed in 1760 by the Kitty Fisher, and a host
                    of admirable portraits in which the men and women and children of the time live
                    still before our eyes, each possessed with a nameless dignity, or grace, or
                    sweetness. As the artist advanced towards old age his hand only gained in power,
                    his colour in richness and splendour; his works show no decadence till the day
                    when he finally laid aside his brush. We have nothing finer from his hand than
                    the Mrs Nesbitt as Circe of 1781, the Mrs Siddons as The Tragic Muse of 1784,
                    the Duches3 of Devonshire and her Child of 1786, and the Infant Hercules and the
                    Miss Gawtkin as Simplicity of 1788.</p>
                <p>In the midst of his constant practice as a portrait-painter Reynolds was true to
                    his early admiration of “the grand style,” to his veneration for the old masters
                    of Italy, to his belief that the imaginative paths which these men pursued were
                    the highest ways of art. At the conclusion of his last Academy discourse, while
                    speaking of Michelangelo, he breaks forth with uncontrollable emotion, “Were I
                    now to begin the world again, I would tread in the steps of that great master;
                    to kiss the hem of his garment, to catch the slightest of his perfections, would
                    be glory and distinction enough for an ambitious man.”</p>
                <p>From the Italians Reynolds conveyed into his own portrait-subjects a dignity and
                    a grace, along with a power of colour, which were previously unknown in English
                    art; but he essayed also to follow them into their own exalted and imaginative
                    paths, to paint Holy Families and Nativities, to picture the cardinal virtues,
                    and to realize the conceptions of the poets. But the English portrait-painter
                    wanted the visionary power necessary for such tasks; his productions of this
                    class form the least interesting portion of his work. They are most successful
                    when the symbolism and the allegory in them are of the slightest, when the human
                    element is the main attraction, when he paints as cherub faces five different
                    views of the countenance of one living English girl, or titles as “Simplicity”
                    his portrait of Offy Gawtkin or as “Hebe” his portrait of Miss Meyer. His series
                    of “The Virtues,” designed for the window of New College, Oxford, show simply
                    studies of graceful women, lightly draped, and pleasantly posed. His Macbeth and
                    his Cardinal Beaufort have no real impressiveness, no true terror; and the
                    finest of the subjects that he painted forBoydell’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shakespeare</hi> is the Puck, in which the artist’s inspiration was caught, not
                    from the realms of imagination or fancy, but from observation of the child
                    nature which he knew and loved.</p>
                <p>Much has been said regarding the recklessness and want of care for permanency
                    which characterized the technical methods of Sir Joshua. While he insisted that
                    his pupils should follow only such ways of work as were well known and had been
                    tested by time, he was himself most varying and unsettled in his practice. In
                    his earnest desire for excellence he tried all known processes, and made all
                    kinds of fantastic experiments. He was firmly convinced that the old masters
                    were possessed of technical secrets which had been lost in later times, and he
                    even scraped the surfaces from portions of valuable works by Titian and Rubens
                    in the vain attempt to probe the mystery. In his efforts to attain the utmost
                    possible power and brilliancy of hue he made use of pigments which are
                    admittedly the reverse of stable and permanent, he worked with dangerous
                    vehicles, he employed both colours and varnishes which in combination are
                    antagonistic. Orpiment was mingled with white lead; wax-medium, egg-varnish, and
                    asphaltum were freely used; and, when we read the account of his strangely
                    hap-hazard methods, we are ready to echo Haydon’s exclamation—“The wonder is
                    that the picture did not crack beneath the brush !” and are prepared for such a
                    sight of the vanishing ghosts of masterpieces as was afforded by so many works
                    in the Reynolds Exhibition at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1884. Our only
                    consolation lies in the truth expressed by Sir George Beaumont, when his
                    recommendation of Sir Joshua for the execution of a certain work was met by the
                    objection that his colours faded, that he “made his pictures die before the
                    man.” “Never mind,” said Sir George, “a faded portrait by Reynolds is better
                    than a fresh one by anybody else.”</p>
