                    of Russia, in 56° 57' N. lat. and 24° 6' E. long., 375 miles south-west of St
                    Petersburg, is in population the fifth city of the empire, while in foreign
                    trade it ranks next to St Petersburg and Odessa. It is the seat of the
                    governor-general of the Russian Baltic provinces, and also the capital of the
                    province of Livonia. The Gulf of Riga, 115 miles long and 100 miles in width,
                    with shallow "waters of inconsiderable salinity (greatest depth 27 fathom»),
                    freezes to some extent every year. The town is situated at the southern
                    extremity of the gulf, 8 miles above the mouth of the Düna (Dwina), w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> hich brings Riga into water communication with an
                    extensive region, as also with the basins of the Dnieper and Volga. Below the
                    town the Düna, from 580 to 2300 yards in breadth, divides into several branches,
                    among islands and sand banks, receiving before it enters the sea the Bolderaa
                    river, and expanding towards the east into wider lacustrine basins. At its sea
                    entrance the water on the bar has an average depth of only 14 feet, and the
                    entrance of the river is protected by the fortress of Dünamünde, connected by
                    rail with Riga, while another line on the right bank connects the city with the
                    Mühlgraben village opposite. As the Düna freezes at Riga for an average of 127
                    days annually, the port remains closed for navigation from December to March.
                    The roadstead at the mouth of the river, though now protected by a mole, is
                    still too much exposed, so that only such vessels as cannot pass the bar remain
                    there, the others discharging part of their cargo at Bolderaa or Mühlgraben and
                    then entering the Düna, which also they leave only partially laden. Improvements
                    designed to obviate these inconveniences are now going on both at the outer
                    harbour and at the new one, the “Zollliafén.”</p>
                <p>Riga consists of four parts—the old town and the St Petersburg and the Moscow
                    suburbs standing on the right bank of the Düna, and the Mitau suburb on the left
                    bank, connected by a floating bridge which is removed in winter, and by a
                    viaduct, 820 feet long, resting on light piers of solid stone, and leaving a
                    passage for ships. The old town still preserves its Hanseatic features—high
                    storehouses, with spacious granaries and cellars, lining the narrow', winding,
                    and busy streets. The only open spaces are the market-place and two other
                    squares, one of which, facing the citadel, is ornamented by a granite column
                    erected in commemoration of the defeat of Napoleon I. The old <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n573/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0573-0554"/>city is so limited that its population increases
                    very slowly. The so-called suburbs on the other hand, with their broad and quiet
                    boulevards on the site of the former fortifications, are steadily growing and
                    undergoing new improvements. The St Petersburg suburb, connected with the city
                    by an avenue of trees, is the seat of the wealthy German aristocracy and
                    merchant community. The rich “poly-technicum” and the new theatre are situated
                    there.</p>
                <p>Few antiquities of the mediaeval town still remain. The oldest church, the
                    “Domkirche,” founded in 1204, was burned in 1547, and the present building dates
                    from the second half of the 16th century. Its organ, with a gas-engine of
                    4-horse power, and 6826 pipes—dating from 1883—is said to be the largest in the
                    world. St Peter’s church, with a beautiful tower 440 feet high, was erected in
                    1406. The castle, built in 1494-1515 by the master of the Knights of the Sword,
                    Walter von Plettenberg—a spacious building often rebuilt—is now the seat of the
                    governor-general and the Russian authorities. The “House of the Black Heads”
                    (opposite the elegant new town-house), which was the seat of a military
                    corporation founded in 1232, and subsequently became the meeting place of the
                    wealthier youth of the place, has some valuable contents. Of the recent
                    erections, the polytechnic, the exchange, the municipal picture gallery, the
                    monument of Herder, who lived at Riga towards the end of the last century, the
                    gymnasiums of Lomonossofi and Alexander I., and the large bonded warehouse are
                    worthy of notice. The esplanade (where a Greek cathedral now stands), the quiet
                    Wöhrmaun’s Park, and the well-shaded “Kaiserliche” Park are much visited. The
                    environs of Riga are undergoing constant improvement, and some of them, such as
                    Dubbeln and the sea-bathing resorts of Bilder-liugshof and Majorenhof, have
                    numerous, visitors in summer.</p>
                <p>In 1867 Riga had a population of 102,590 (city, 18,246; St Petersburg suburb,
                    27,155; Moscow suburb, 41,318; Mitau suburb, 15,871). On December 25, 1881 it
                    had 168,728 inhabitants, the suburbs alone showing an increase of 64,263 (city,
                    20,091; suburb of St Petersburg, 45,345; of Moscow, 73,705; and of Mitau,
                    29,587). About one half of the population is German, the remainder being Russian
                    and Lettish in nearly equal proportions, with some 2000 Esthonians and nearly
                    5000 foreigners. The life of the city has a German character throughout, but the
                    Russians (many of whom were serfs until 1861), and still more the Letts and
                    Esthonians, also display a steadily progressive intellectual life. Both are
                    seeking to counteract the German influence by increasing the number of their
                    educational institutions, the Letts also by the stage and the press. The larger
                    commerce is wholly in German and (to a less extent) English hands. Owing to its
                    communication by water and rail with the forests of White Russia and Volhynia,
                    Riga is a great mart for timber, which in value stands third among the exports.
                    Flax and linseed occupy the first place, Riga being the chief Russian port for
                    the extensive fiax-producing region of north-west Russia. Owing to the great
                    railway which crosses the country from Riga to Smolensk, afterwards dividing
                    into two branches, to Orenburg and Tsaritsyn on the lower Volga respectively,
                    Riga is also the great storehouse and place of export for hemp coming by rail
                    from west central Russia, and for corn, Riga merchants sending their buyers as
                    far east as Tamboff. Oats, in particular, are extensively exported to England
                    from the central provinces. Tallow, leather, tobacco, rugs, feathers, and other
                    minor items add considerably to the total value of the exports. The competition
                    of the port of Libau (with exports amounting in 1882 to 31,473,590 roubles) is
                    counterbalanced by the steady development of the Russian railway system, so that
                    the exports of Riga, which in 1851-1860 averaged 17,737,000 roubles, and were
                    23,964,000 in 1866, amounted in 1882 to 64,159,076 roubles or £6,415,900 (food
                    stuffs, £1,706,300; raw produce, £4,690,170, including timber, £1,295,520; and
                    manufactured wares, £19,436). The imports, consisting chiefly of salt, fish,
                    wine, and cotton, with metals, machinery, coal, oils, fruits, tobacco, and other
                    minor articles, are also rapidly increasing (4,876,OOO roubles in 1851-1860,
                    6,751,000 roubles in 1866, and 34,304,100 roubles in 1882). The food stuffs
                    (salt, fish, tobacco, wine, oils, &amp;c. ) reached £514,847; raw produce
                    (chiefly cotton, coal, and metal), £2,043,804; and manufactured wares, £871,132.
                    In 1882 the port was visited by 2347 foreign vessels of 906,200 tons burden; of
                    these 537 (367,110 tons) were from Great Britain;</p>
                <p>161 vessels of 89,990 tons, engaged in the coasting trade, also entered the port.
                    Riga is in railway communication with Libau <hi rend="italic">(via</hi> Mitau),
                    and with St Petersburg <hi rend="italic">(via</hi> Dünaburg), Warsaw, and
                    central Russia; the traffic is very active,—no less than 11,247,000 cwts. of
                    various wares having been brought to Riga by rail, and 844,000 cwts. shipped on
                    the Düna.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of the town and neighbourhood are yearly developing; the chief
                    items are woollen cloth, cottons, machinery, metal wares, cigars, corks, glass,
                    and paper.</p>
                <p>The educational institutions include, besides the polytechnic, a Greek seminary,
                    four gymnasiums, some ten private schools for secondary education of boys and
                    girls, and a comparatively large number of primary schools. The municipal
                    library contains very interesting materials relating to the history of the
                    Baltic provinces. The book trade is rapidly extending.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Riga was founded in 1158, as a storehouse at the
                    mouth of the Düna, by a few Bremen merchants. Its name is supposed to be derived
                    from Righ-ö, an island formerly separated from the mainland by a branch of the
                    Diina. About 1190 the Augustinian monk Meinhard erected a monastery there, and
                    in 1199-1201 Bishop Albert I. of Livonia obtained from Innocent III. permission
                    for German merchants to land at the new settlement, and chose it for his seat,
                    exercising his power over the neighbouring district in connexion with the
                    Teutonic Knights. As early as the first half of the 13th century the young city
                    obtained the right of electing its own magistracy, and enlarged the walls
                    erected during Albert l.’s time. It joined the Hanseatic League, and from 1253
                    refused to recognize the rights of the bishop and the knights. Early in the 14th
                    century Riga repelled the attack of the Kuron ruler Lamehinas, and during the
                    next century it had to contend with the knights. In 1420 it fell once more under
                    the rule of the bishop, who maintained his authority until 1566, when it was
                    abolished in consequence of the Reformation. Sigismund III., king of Poland,
                    took Riga in 1547, and in 1558 the Russian commander Prince Serebryanyi reached
                    the town, burned its suburbs and many ships on the Düna, and remained for three
                    days under the walls of the fort. In 1561 Gotthard Kettler publicly abdicated
                    his mastership of the order of Knights of the Sword, and Riga, together with
                    southern Livonia, became a Polish possession; after some unsuccessful attempts
                    to reintroduce Roman Catholicism, Stephen Batory recognized the religious
                    freedom of the Protestant population. Throughout the 17th century Riga—which for
                    nearly three centuries had been a wealthy centre of the commerce of the whole
                    region, and was at this time visited by from three to five hundred ships
                    annually—became a bone of contention between Sweden, Poland, and Russia. In 1621
                    Gustavus Adolphus took it from Poland, and held it against the Poles and the
                    Russians who besieged it in 1656. During the Northern War it was courageously
                    defended, but after the battle of Poltava it succumbed, and was taken in July
                    1710 by Sheremetyeff. In 1781 it was made by Russia the capital of the Riga
                    viceroyalty, but fifteen years later, the viceroyalty having been abolished, it
                    was made and still remains the capital of Livonia. In 1812, the approach of the
                    French being apprehended, the suburbs were burnt. Riga still maintains many of
                    its old municipal institutions. The “magistrate” of Riga exercises patrimonial
                    rights over a district comprising several communes around the city. (P. A.
