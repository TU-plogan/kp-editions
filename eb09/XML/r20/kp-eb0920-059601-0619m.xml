                    historical writer, who lived in the second half of the 13th century, was a monk

                    (from which Hearne printed his edition) there occurs (fol. 159b to 160) an
                    account of the battle of Evesham. The narration implies that the writer was
                    living at that time (1265), for he describes the dark and dismal weather that
                    pre vailed on the day of the battle, adding, “This isci Roberd, That verst this
                    boc made,”—a passage, however, which may possibly have reference not to the
                    versifier but to the original compiler of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There
                    were others known by the same name; see Hearne, Pref., p. 58. </p></note><hi
                    rend="italic"/> The period at which the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> was
                    composed was evidently late in the 13th or early in the 14th century, as it
                    contains a reference to the canonization of St Louis, king of France, which took
                    place on lltlι August 1297. From an historical point of view, however, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> is of but little value. The internal evidence shows
                    it to have been a translation from the French and the original in turn to have
                    been a mere compilation. The narrative commences with a description of Britain,
                    taken from Henry of Huntingdon; the material is next derived mainly from
                    Geoffrey of Monmouth, and then, again, from William of Malmesbury, special
                    information being supplied, here and there, from Henry of Huntingdon, Ailred of
                    Rievaulx, and the Annals of Winchester.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the value of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> as an
                    illustration of the versification and language of the period is considerable. Λs
                    a writer of English verse Robert comes first in order, being prior to both
                    Robert of Brunne and Laurence Minot, and he has accordingly been styled the
                    Ennius of English literature. His diction, again, affords many interesting
                    points of comparison with that known as Old English on the one hand and the
                    language of Chaucer and William Tyndale on the other. In his verses we first
                    find the term “Saxons” used in opposition to Normans (Hearne, p. 363), although
                    “English” is the term by which, throughout the <hi rend="italic">Chronide,</hi>
                    the original population is more generally designated. Of the English tongue
                    itself, however, he says <hi rend="italic">Cb.,</hi> p. 125) that “]je Saxones
                    speche it was, and ]&gt;orw hem ycome yt ys.” Many of the most noteworthy
                    peculiarities of his diction will be found pointed out in Mr. Kingdon Oliphant’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Old and Middle English,</hi> pp. 430-439.</p>
                <p>Other compositions attributed to Robert of Gloucester are—a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life</hi> of St Alban in verse (MS. Ashmole, 43), a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>
                    of St Patrick, also in verse (MS. Tanner, 17), a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of
                    St Bridget (MS. C.C.C. Camb., 145), and a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of St
                    Alphege (MS. Cott. Julius, D. ix.).</p>
                <p>The only complete edition of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> is that edited
                    by Thomas Heamb (Oxford, 1724), 2 vols. Svo, partly from the Harleian MS. 201,
                    and partly from the Cottonian MS. Calig. A. xi., and reprinted at London in
                    1810, 2 vols. 8vo. This, however, is extremely defective, Hearne's collation of
                    the important MS. in the library of the college of Arms being very imperfect.
