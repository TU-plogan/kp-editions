                    Rheims she and her eldest sister Sophia, afterwards known as Sarah, joined a
                    troupe of Italian children who made their living by singing in the cafés, Sarah
                    taking part in the singing and Elizabeth, then only four years of age,
                    collecting the coppers. In 1830 they came to Paris, where they sang in the
                    streets, Rachel giving such patriotic songs as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parisienne</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> with a rude but
                    precocious energy which evoked special admiration and an abundant shower of
                    coppers. Choron, a famous teacher of singing, was so impressed with the talents
                    of the two sisters that he undertook to give them gratuitous instruction, and
                    after his death in 1833 they were received into the Conservatoire.</p>
                <p>Sophia gained a medal for singing, but Rachel at an early period gave her chief
                    attention to elocution and acting. Her voice, though deep and powerful, was at
                    first hard and inflexible; and her thin and meagre appearance conveyed an
                    impression of insignificance, which her plain features and generally impassive
                    manner tended to confirm. It was only her remarkable intelligence that
                    encouraged her instructors to persevere; but even they did not recognize her
                    talents as exceptional. She made her first appearance at the Gymnase in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vendéenne</hi> in 1837 with only mediocre success. On 12th June of
                    the following year she succeeded, after great difficulty, in making a début at
                    the Théâtre Français, appearing as Camille in <hi rend="italic">Les Horaces</hi>
                    , when, attention having been directed to her remarkable genius by Jules Janin
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Débats</hi> and Madame de Girardin in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Presse,</hi> it at once received universal recognition. Her range
                    of characters was limited, but within this range she was unsurpassable. It was
                    especially in the tragedies of Racine and Corneille that she excelled, and more
                    particularly in the impersonation of evil or malignant passion. By careful
                    training her originally hard and harsh voice had become flexible and melodious,
                    and its low and muffled notes under the influence of passion possessed a
                    thrilling and penetrating quality that was irresistible. When excited her plain
                    features became transfigured by the glow of genius, and in her impersonations of
                    evil and malignant emotions there was a majesty and dignity which fascinated
                    whilst it repelled. Her facial elocution was unsurpassable in variety and
                    expressiveness, whilst the grace of her gestures and the marvellous skill with
                    which she varied her tones with every shade of thought and emotion were
                    completely beyond criticism. It was, however, the predominance of intellect and
                    will rather than the perfection of her art that most specially characterized her
                    impersonations and conferred on them their unique excellence. She appeared
                    successively as Émilic in <hi rend="italic">Cinna,</hi> Hermione in <hi
                    rend="italic">Andromaque,</hi> Ériphile in <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie,</hi>
                    Monime in <hi rend="italic">Mithridate,</hi> and Aménaïde in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tancrède;</hi> but it was in <hi rend="italic">Phèdre,</hi> which she first
                    played on 21st January 1843, that her peculiar gifts were most strikingly
                    manifested. In modern plays she created the characters of Judith and Cleopatra
                    in the tragedies of Madame de Girardin, but her most successful appearance was
                    in 1849 in <hi rend="italic">Adrienne Lecouvreur.</hi> In 1840 she visited
                    London, where her interpretations of Corneille and Racine were the sensation of
                    the season. She also played successively in the principal capitals of Europe. In
                    1855 she made a tour in the United States with comparatively small success. This
                    was, however, after her powers through continued ill-health had begun to
                    deteriorate. She died of consumption at Cannet, near Cannes, on 4th January
                    1858.</p>
