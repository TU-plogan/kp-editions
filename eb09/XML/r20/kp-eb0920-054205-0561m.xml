                    perfect and sincere observance of religion for upwards of thirty years. In 1400
                    Richard was in the infirmary of the abbey, where his death took place in the
                    following year. His only known extant work is <hi rend="italic">Speculum
                    Historiale de Gestis Regurn Angliae, IH <hi rend="subscript">f</hi> 7-1066.</hi>
                    The manuscript of this is in the university library at Cambridge, and has been
                    edited for the Master of the Rolls by Professor John E. B. Mayor (2 vols.,
                    1863-1869). It is in four books, and at the conclusion of the fourth book
                    Richard expresses his intention of continuing his narrative from the accession
                    of William I., and incorporating a sketch of the Conqueror’s career from his
                    birth. This design he does not, however, appear to have carried into effect. The
                    value of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> as a contribution to our historical
                    knowledge is but slight, for it is mainly a compilation from Rodger Wendover,
                    Geoffrey of Monmouth, William of Malmesbury, Florence, Asser, Henry of
                    Huntingdon, and other writers; while even in transcribing these the compiler is
                    guilty of great carelessness. He gives, however, numerous charters relating to
                    Westminster Abbey, and also a very complete account of the saints whose tombs
                    were in the abbey church, and especially of Edward the Confessor, with w <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> hose reign the fourth book is entirely occupied. The
                    work was, notwithstanding, largely used by historians and antiquaries, until,
                    with the rise of a more critical spirit, its value became more accurately
                    estimated. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> Richard also wrote,
                    according to the statement of William Woodford in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Answer</hi> to Wickliffe (Brown, <hi rend="italic">Fasciculus Rerum
                    expetendarum,</hi> p. 193), a treatise <hi rend="italic">De Offi,ciis</hi>; and

                    however, does any known copy now exist.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> the main value may be said to be of a
                    negative character, in that it affords the most conclusive proof of the
                    spuriousness of another work attributed to Richard and long accepted by the
                    learned world as his. This was the <hi rend="italic">De Situ Britanniae,</hi> an
                    elaborate forgery relating to the antiquities of Roman Britain which first
                    appeared at Copenhagen in the year 1758. It was printed along with the works of
                    Gildas and Nennius, under the editorship of Charles Julius Bertram, professor of
                    English in the academy of Copenhagen in the middle of the last century, with the
                    following special title :—“Richardi Corinensis monachi Westmonasteriensis de
                    situ Britanniae libri duo. E Codici MS. descripsit, Notisque et Indice adornavit
                    Carolus Bertram.”</p>
                <p>This forgery was accepted, as genuine by a well-known antiquary of the last
                    century, Dr William Stukeley, and under the sanction of his authority continued
                    for a long time to be regarded in the same light by numerous scholars and
                    antiquaries. Among their number were Gibbon, John Whitaker, Richard Gough, and
                    Lingard. On the other hand, critics of a later date, such as J. J. Conybeare, Dr
                    Guest, Wex, Raine, and Woodward, from time to time gave expression, on various
                    grounds, to a contrary conclusion. All doubt on the subject may, however, be
                    held to have been effectually set at rest by the masterly and exhaustive
                    exposure of the whole fraud drawn up by Professor Mayor in the preface to the
                    edition above referred to of the Speculum. He has there not only demonstrated,
                    from the external and internal evidence alike, the spuriousness of the whole
                    treatise, but in a collation (extending to nearly a hundred pages) of numerous
                    passages with corresponding passages in classical mediaeval authorities, has
                    also traced out the various sources from whence Bertram derived the terminology
                    and the facts which he reproduced in the De Situ. “To say nothing,” says
                    Professor Mayor, “of antiquaries whose canons of criticism are so lax that they
                    cite a supposed monk of 1400 a.d. as authority for events of 1000 b.c., we find
                    a forger alike contemptible as penman, Latinist, historian, geographer, critic,
                    imposing upon members of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and of the two
                    ancient universities, of the youthful Society D. U. K., on the writers of
                    Germany and Denmark, of England, and of Scotland,—the last bribed by the
                    invention of Vespasiana.” (J. B. M.)</p>
