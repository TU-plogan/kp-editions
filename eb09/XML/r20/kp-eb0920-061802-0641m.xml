                    sides it is surrounded by a coral reef, which on the north and south forms a
                    large flat area partly dry at low water. The island proper was long believed to
                    consist of granite overlaid with limestone and other modern formations, and thus
                    it was regarded as a striking exception to the rule that all mid-ocean islands
                    are of volcanic origin, and served in the hands of Peschel and others as a proof
                    of the former existence in the Indian Ocean of the hypothetical continent of
                    Lemuria. The investigations of the Transit of Venus Expedition have shown that
                    it is built up of “doleritic lavas which have been poured out at a considerable
                    number of orifices,” now difficult to identify, at successive periods of
                    uncertain date. The lavas are rich in olivine. In some places, as in the Cascade
                    Valley, the disintegration of the rocks has produced beds of earthy clays
                    varying in colour from a dull brick red to a liver brown, and forming a
                    prominent feature in the landscape. A central ridge of considerable elevation
                    (Grande Montagne, 1140 feet) runs through the island from east to west, sending
                    off a variety of spurs (Le Piton, 1160 feet). Deep-cut river valleys, often
                    interrupted by cascades, run down in all directions to the sea. On the
                    south-west there is a large plain of coralline limestone, remarkable for the
                    caves of all sizes (some beautifully stalactitic) with which it is riddled.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n642/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0642-0619"/>
                <p>Along the north and west coast there are on the reef a number of islands of
                    volcanic origin; those on the southeast are all of coralline limestone or sand.
                    There are only two passages through the reef available for large vessels, —these
                    leading respectively to Port Mathurin and to Port South-East. Rodriguez is
                    comparatively arid; and the streams are as short-lived for the most part as they
                    are beautiful. The climate is like that of Mauritius, but more subject to
                    hurricanes during the north-west monsoon (November to April).</p>
                <p>About 1845 the population of Rodriguez was about 250 persons. The original
                    nucleus consisted of slaves from Mauritius, and recruits arrived from Madagascar
                    and the African continent. By 1871 they had increased to 1108 and by 1881 to
                    1436. The island is governed by a civil commissioner, who is also a police
                    magistrate. Capitalists from Mauritius are beginning to pay attention to the
                    natural advantages of the island. A carriage road has been constructed from
                    Mathurin to Gabriel, the only other village, where the Roman Catholic priests
                    have their chapel and residence.</p>
                <p>When originally discovered and down into the 17th century Rodriguez was clothed
                    with fine timber trees; but goats, cattle, and bush-fires have combined to
                    destroy the great bulk of the old vegetation, and the indigenous plants have in
                    many cases been ousted by intrusive foreigners. When the island was in French
                    possession many settlers cultivated large estates, and fortunes were realized;
                    but with the liberation of the slaves the area of cultivation decreased, and it
                    is now of very limited extent. The staple crop is the sweet potato; and manioc,
                    maize, millet, and rice grow well, but are not much cultivated. Wheat is seldom
                    seen, mainly because of the parakeets and the Java sparrows. Beans <hi
                    rend="italic">(Fhaseolus lunatus'),</hi> lentils, gram (C⅛cer «rieiinwn),dholl
                    <hi rend="italic">(Cajaηus indicus),</hi> and ground-nuts are all grown to a
                    certain extent in spite of the ravages of the rats (Balfour). Mangoes, bananas,
                    guavas, pine-apples, custard-apples, and especially oranges, citrons, and limes,
                    are the fruits that flourish best. Of the timber trees the most common are <hi
                    rend="italic">Elaeoden-dron orientale,</hi> much used in carpentry and for
                    pirogues, and <hi rend="italic">Latania Verschaffelti</hi> (Leguat’s plantane).
                    At least two species of screw-pine <hi rend="italic">{Paηdanus
                    heteroearpus,</hi> Balf. fil. and <hi rend="italic">Ρ. teηuifolius)</hi> occur
                    freely throughout the island. The total number of known species, according to
                    Professor I. B. Balfour, is 470, belonging to 8δ families and 293 genera; and of
                    these 297 are phanerogamous and 173 cryptogamous. The families represented by
                    the greatest number of species are <hi rend="italic">Gramineae {21</hi>
                    indigenous, 6 introduced), <hi rend="italic">Leguminosae</hi> (14 ind., 15

                    Central America, and the family has not hitherto been found in the Mascarenes.
                    Of 33 species of mosses 17 are peculiar. Variability of species and heterophylly
                    are characteristic of the flora to quite an unusual degree. To the naturalist
                    Rodriguez is as interesting as it is to the botanist. At present the only
                    indigenous mammal is a species of fruit-eating bat <hi rend="italic">(Pteropus
                    rodericensis'),</hi> and the introduced species are such familiar creatures as
                    the pig, rabbit, rat, mouse, &amp;c.; but down to a recent period the island was
                    the home of a very large land-tortoise ( <hi rend="italic">Testudo Vοsmaeri</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">rodericensis),</hi> and its limestone caves have yielded a
                    large number of skeletons of the dodo-like solitaire <hi rend="italic">Hezophaps
                    solitaries),</hi> which still built its mound-like nest in the island in the
                    close of the 17th century, but is now extinct (see vol. iii. p. 732). Of
                    indigenous birds 13 species have been registered. The guinea-fowl (introduced)
                    has become exceedingly abundant, partly owing to a protective game-law; and a
                    francolin <hi rend="italic">{F. ponticerianus),</hi> popularly a “partridge,” is
                    also common. The marine fish-fauna does not differ from that of Mauritius, and
                    the freshwater species, with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Mugil
                    rodericensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myxus caecuticus,</hi> are common to all
                    the Mascarenes. Thirty-five species of crustaceans are known. The insects
                    (probably very imperfectly registered) comprise 60 species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coleoptera,</hi> 15 <hi rend="italic">Hymxno-ρtera,</hi> 21 <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Hemiptera.</hi> Forty-nine species of coral have been collected,
                    showing a close affinity to those of Mauritius, Madagascar, and the
                    Seychelles.</p>
                <p>Rodriguez or Diego Ruy’s Island was discovered by the Portuguese in 1645. In 1690
                    Duquesne prevailed on the Dutch Government to send a body of French refugees to
                    the Island of Bourbon, at that time, he believed, abandoned by the French
                    authorities. As the refugees, however, found the French in possession they
                    proceeded to Rodriguez, and there eight of their number were landed on 30th
                    April 1691 with a promise that they should be visited by their compatriots
                    within two years. The two years were spent without misadventure, but, instead of
                    waiting for the arrival of their friends, the seven colonists (for one had
                    meanwhile died) rashly left the island on 8th May 1693 and made their way to
                    Mauritius, where they were treated with great cruelty by the governor. The
                    account of the enterprise left us by Francis Leguat— <hi rend="italic">Voyages
                    et Aventures</hi> (London, 1708), or, as it is called in the English
                    translation, <hi rend="italic">A New Voyage to the East Indies</hi> (London,
                    1708)—is a most garrulous and amusing narrative, and was for a long time almost
                    the only source of information about Rodriguez. His description of the solitaire
                    is of course unique.</p>
