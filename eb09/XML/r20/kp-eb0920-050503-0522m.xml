                    a South-American bird which, though long before known and described by the
                    earlier writers—Nieremberg, Marcgrave, and Piso (the last of whom has a
                    recognizable but rude figure of it)—had been without any distinctive scientific
                    appellation. Adopted a few years later by Brisson, the name has since passed
                    into general use, especially among English authors, for what their predecessors
                    had called the American Ostrich; but on the European continent the bird is
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">Nandu,</hi><note anchored="true"

                    word corrupted from a name it is said to have borne among the aboriginal

                    >Ema (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Emeu, vol. viii. p. 171). The resemblance of
                    the Rhea to the Ostrich (vol. xviii. p. 62) was at once perceived, but the
                    differences between them were scarcely less soon noticed, for some of them are
                    very evident. The former, for instance, has three instead of two toes on each
                    foot, it has no apparent tail nor the showy wing-plumes of the latter, and its
                    head and neck are clothed with feathers, while internal distinctions of still
                    deeper significance have since been dwelt upon by Prof. Huxley</hi><hi

                    A. Forbes <hi rend="italic">(fip. cit.,</hi> 1881, pp. 784-787), thus justifying
                    the separation of these two forms more widely even than as Families; and there
                    can be little doubt that they should be regarded as types of as many Orders— <hi

                    the Emeus, and, apart from their very different physiognomy, the former can be
                    readily recognized by the rounded form of their contour-feathers, which want the
                    <hi rend="italic">hyporrhachis</hi> or after-shaft that in the Emeus and
                    Cassowaries is so long as to equal the main shaft, and contributes to give these
                    latter groups the appearance of being covered with shaggy hair. Though the Rhea
                    is not decked with the graceful plumes which adorn the Ostrich, its feathers
                    have yet a considerable market value, and for the purpose of trade in them it is
                    annually killed by thousands, so that it has been already extirpated from much
                    of the country it formerly inhabited, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    question of time. Its breeding habits are precisely those which have been
                    already described in the case of other Ratite birds. Like most of them it is
                    polygamous, and the male performs the duty of incubation, brooding more than a
                    score of eggs, the produce of several females—facts known to Nieremberg more
                    than two hundred and fifty years since, but hardly accepted by naturalists until
                    recently. From causes which, if explicable, do not here concern us, no examples
                    of this bird seem to have been brought to Europe before the beginning of the
                    present century, and accordingly the descriptions previously given of it by
                    systematic writers were taken at second hand and were mostly defective if not
                    misleading. In 1803 Latham issued a wretched figure of the species from a
                    half-grown specimen in the Leverian Museum, and twenty years later said he had
                    seen only one other, and that still younger, in Bullock’s collection <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ge)i. Hist. Birds,</hi> viii. p. 379). <note anchored="true"

                    >Companion</hi> to this collection (1810, p. 121) states that the specimen “was
                    brought alive” [? to England], </p></note> A bird living in confinement at
                    Strasburg in 1806 was, however, described and figured by Hammer in 1808 ( <hi
                    rend="italic">Ann. du Museum,</hi> xii. pp. 427-433, pl. 39), and, though he
                    does not expressly say so, we may infer from his account that it had been a
                    captive for some years. In England the <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> of the
                    Zoological Society for 1833 announced the Rhea as having been exhibited for the
                    first time in its gardens during the preceding twelvemonth. Since then many
                    other living examples have been introduced, and it has bred both there and
                    elsewhere in Britain, but the young do not seem to be very easily reared. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Interesting accounts of the
                    breeding of this bird in confinement are given, with much other valuable matter,

                <p>Though considerably smaller than the Ostrich, and, as before stated, wanting its
                    fine plumes, the Rhea in general aspect far more resembles that bird than the
                    other <hi rend="italic">Ratitae.</hi> The feathers of the head and neck, except
                    on the crown and nape, where they are dark brown, are dingy white, and those of
                    the body ash-coloured tinged with brown, while on the breast they are
                    brownish-black, and on the belly and thighs white. In the course of the
                    memorable voyage of the “Beagle,” Darwin came to hear of another kind of Rhea,
                    called by his informants <hi rend="italic">Avestruz petise,</hi> and at Port
                    Desire on the east coast of Patagonia he obtained an example of it, the
                    imperfect skin of which enabled Mr Gould to describe it <hi rend="italic">{Proc.
                    Zool. Society,</hi> 1837, p. 35) as a second species of the genus, naming it
                    after its discoverer. <hi rend="italic">Rhea daηvini</hi> differs in several
                    well-marked characters from the earlier known <hi rend="italic">R.
                    americana.</hi> Its bill is shorter than its head; its tarsi are reticulated
                    instead of scutellated in front, with the upper part feathered instead of being
                    bare; and the plumage of its body and wings is very different, each feather
                    being tipped with a distinct whitish band, while that of the head and neck is
                    greyish-brown. A further distinction is also asserted to be shewn by the
                    eggs—those of <hi rend="italic">R. americana</hi> being of a yellowish-white,
                    while those of <hi rend="italic">R. darwini</hi> have a bluish tinge. Some years
                    afterwards Mr Sclater described ( <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> 1860, p. 207)
                    a third and smaller species, more closely resembling the <hi rend="italic">R.
                    americana,</hi> but having apparently a longer bill, whence he named it <hi
                    rend="italic">R. rnacrorhyηcha,</hi> more slender tarsi, and shorter toes, while
                    its general colour is very much darker, the body and wings being of a
                    brownish-grey mixed with black. The precise geographical range of these three
                    species is still undetermined. While <hi rend="italic">R. americana</hi> is
                    known to extend from Paraguay and southern Brazil through the state of La Plata
                    to an uncertain distance in Patagonia, <hi rend="italic">R. darwini</hi> seems
                    to be the proper inhabitant of the country last named, though</p>
                <p>M. Claraz asserts <hi rend="italic">{op. cit.,</hi> 1885, p. 324) that it is
                    occasionally found to the northward of the Rio Negro, which had formerly been
                    regarded as its limit, and, moreover, that flocks of the two species commingled
                    may be very frequently seen in the district between that river and the Rio
                    Colorado. On the “pampas” <hi rend="italic">R. americana</hi> is said to
                    associate with herds of deer <hi rend="italic">{Cariacus campestris),</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">R. darwini</hi> to be the constant companion of guanacos <hi
                    rend="italic">{Lama huanaco)</hi> —just as in Africa the Ostrich seeks the
                    society of zebras and antelopes. As for <hi rend="italic">R. rnacrorhynchα,</hi>
                    it was found by Forbes <hi rend="italic">{Ibis,</hi> 1881, pp. 360, 361) to
                    inhabit the dry and open “sertoês” of north-eastern Brazil, a discovery the more
                    interesting since it was in that part of the country that Marcgrave and Piso
                    became acquainted with a bird of this kind, though the existence of any species
                    of Rhea in the district had been long overlooked by or unknown to succeeding
                    travellers.</p>
