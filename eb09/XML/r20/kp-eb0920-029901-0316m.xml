                <p><label type="entry">RAY</label>. The Rays ( <hi rend="italic">Batoidei)</hi>
                    together with the Sharks ( <hi rend="italic">Selachoidei</hi> ) form the
                    suborder <hi rend="italic">Plagiostomata</hi> of Cartilaginous fishes, and are
                    divided into six families, as already noticed in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ichthyology,</hi> vol. xii. pp. 685, 686.</p>
                <p>The first family contains only the Saw-fishes <hi rend="italic">(Pristis</hi> ),
                    of which five species are known, from tropical and subtropical seas. Although
                    saw-fishes possess all the essential characteristics of the rays proper, they
                    retain the elongate form of the body of sharks, the tail being excessively
                    muscular and the sole organ of locomotion. The “saw” (fig. 1) is a flat
                    protruding intestines. The and enormously devel-teeth proper, with which the
                    oped prolongation of the mouth is armed, are exsnout, with an endo-tremely small
                    and obtuse, skeleton which consists and unsuitable for inflicting of from three

                    in alveolar sockets, on saw-fishes, but lack the each side. The saw is a saw.

                    about sixteen species, from abdomen to feed on the ־ tropical seas.</p>
                <p>The third family, <hi rend="italic">Torpedinidae,</hi> includes the Electric
                    Rays. The peculiar organ (fig. 2) by which the electricity is produced has been
                    described in vol. xii. p. 650. The fish uses this power voluntarily either to
                    defend itself or to stun or kill the smaller animals on which it feeds. To
                    receive the shock the object must complete the galvanic circuit by communicating
                    with the fish at two distinct points, either directly or through the medium of
                    some conducting body. The electric currents created in these fishes exercise all
                    the other known powers of electricity: they render the needle magnetic,
                    decompose chemical compounds, and emit the spark. The dorsal surface of the
                    electric organ is positive, the ventral negative. Shocks accidentally given to
                    persons are severely felt, and, if proceeding from a large healthy fish, will
                    temporarily paralyse the arms of a strong man. The species of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Torpedo,</hi> six or seven in number, are distributed over the
                    coasts of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean, and two reach northwards to the coasts
                    of Great Britain ( <hi rend="italic">T. marmorata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T.
                    hebetcms).</hi> They are said to attain to a weight of from 80 to 100 lb, but
                    fortunately such gigantic specimens are scarce, and prefer sandy ground at some
                    distance from the shore, where they are not disturbed by the violent agitation
                    of the surface-water. Other genera, comprising species of smaller size, inhabit
                    different parts of the tropical and subtropical seas. All the rays of this
                    family have, like electric fishes generally, a smooth and naked body.</p>
                <p>The fourth family, <hi rend="italic">Raiidee,</hi> comprises the Skates and Rays
                    proper, or <hi rend="italic">Raia.</hi> More than thirty species are known,
                    chiefly from the temperate seas of both hemispheres, but much more numerously
                    from the northern than the southern. A few species descend to a depth of nearly
                    600 fathoms, without, however, essentially differing from their surface
                    congeners. Rays, as is sufficiently indicated by the shape of their body, are
                    bottom-fishes, living on flat sandy ground, generally at no great distance from
                    the coast or the surface. They lead a sedentary life, progressing, like the
                    flat-fishes, by an undulatory motion of the greatly extended pectoral fins, the
                    thin slender tail having entirely lost the function of an organ of locomotion,
                    and acting merely as a rudder. They are carnivorous and feed exclusively on
                    molluscs, crustaceans, and fishes. Some of the species possess a much larger and
                    more pointed snout than the others, and are popularly distinguished as “skates.”
                    The following are known as inhabitants of the British seas :— <hi rend="italic"

                    the Starry Ray ( <hi rend="italic">R. radiata),</hi> (4) the Sandy Ray (R. <hi

                    or Skates: (5) the Common Skate ( <hi rend="italic">R. batis</hi> ), (6) the
                    Flapper Skate <hi rend="italic">(R. macrorhynchus</hi> ), (7) the Burton Skate
                    <hi rend="italic">(R. marginata),</hi> (8) and (9) the Shagreen Skates ( <hi
                    rend="italic">R. vomer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">R. fullemica).</hi> A deep-sea
                    species <hi rend="italic">(R. hyper-borea)</hi> has recently been discovered
                    near the Faroe Islands at 600 fathoms. Most of the skates and rays are eaten,
                    except during the breeding season; and even the young of the former are esteemed
                    as food. The skates attain to a much larger size than the rays, viz., to a width
                    of 6 feet and a weight of 400 and 500 R&gt;.</p>
                <p>The members of the fifth family, <hi rend="italic">Trygonidae</hi> or Sting-rays,
                    are distinguished from the rays proper by having the vertical fins replaced by a
                    strong spine attached to the upper side of the tail. Some forty species are
                    known, which inhabit tropical more than temperate seas. The spine is barbed on
                    the sides and is a most effective weapon of defence; by lashing the tail in
                    every direction the sting-rays can inflict dangerous or at least extremely
                    painful wounds. The danger arises from the lacerated nature of the wound as well
                    as from the poisonous property of the mucus inoculated. Generally only one or
                    two spines are developed. Sting-rays attain to about the same size as the skates
                    and are eaten oil the coasts of the Mediterranean and elsewhere. One species <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trygon pastinaca</hi> ) is not rarely found in the North Atlantic
                    and extends northwards to the coasts of Ireland, England, and Norway.</p>

                <p>The rays of the sixth and last family, <hi rend="italic">Myliobatida,</hi> are
                    popularly known under various names, such as “Devil-fishes,” “Sea-devils,” and
                    “Eagle-rays.” In them the dilatation of the body, or rather the development of
                    the pectoral fins, is carried to an extreme, whilst the tail is very thin and
                    sometimes long like a whip-cord (fig. 3). Caudal spines are generally present
                    and similar to those of the sting-rays; but in the pectoral fin a portion is
                    detached and forms a “cephalic” lobe or pair of lobes in front of the snout. The
                    dentition consists of perfectly flat molars, adapted for crushing hard
                    substances. In some of the eagle-rays the molars are large and tessellated (fig.
                    4), in others extremely small. Of the twenty species which are known, from
                    tropical and temperate seas, the majority attain to a very large and some to an
                    enormous size: one mentioned by Risso, which was taken at Messina, weighed 1250
                    lb. A foetus taken from the uterus of the mother (all eagle-rays are
                    viviparous), captured at Jamaica and preserved in the British Museum, is 5 feet
                    broad and weighed 20 if). The mother measured 15 feet in width and as many in
                    length, and was between 3 and 4 feet thick. At Jamaica, where these rays are
                    well known under the name of “devil-fishes,” they are frequently attacked for
                    sport’s sake, but their capture is uncertain and sometimes attended with danger.
                    The eagle-ray of the Mediterranean <hi rend="italic">(Myliobatis aquila)</hi>
                    has strayed as far northwards as the south coast of England. (A. C. G.)</p>
