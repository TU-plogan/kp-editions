                    that the workmen were in the habit of lending him their tools and teaching him
                    their various uses. In his twelfth year he left school and placed himself under
                    Meikle, but at the end of two years he went to a school at Dunbar, in order to
                    obtain a more thorough knowledge of mathematics and mechanical drawing.
                    Afterwards he occasionally assisted Meikle, but before his eighteenth year he
                    had erected several corn mills, on his ׳own account, while in the winter months
                    he visited Edinburgh to attend the classes of physical science at the
                    university. By Prof. Robison of Edinburgh he was introduced to Messrs Boulton
                    &amp; Watt of Soho near Birmingham, for whom in 1786 he superintended the
                    construction of the Albion flour mills near Blackfriars Bridge, London. It is
                    believed that the difficulties which occurred at the Albion mills in regard to
                    the ebb and flow of the tide first led Rennie to the study of that branch of
                    civil engineering connected with hydraulics and hydrodynamics, in which he
                    became so celebrated as to have no rival after the death of Smeaton. Immediately
                    after the completion of the Albion mills Rennie’s reputation was so firmly
                    established in everything connected with mill work that he found himself in a
                    very extensive line of business. In the construction of sugar mills in Jamaica
                    and the other West Indian Islands he soon had almost a monopoly, and among
                    ·other mills constructed by him in England mention may be made of the powder
                    mill at Tunbridge, the great flour mill at Wandsworth, and the rolling and
                    triturating mills at the Mint on Tower Hill. Wherever the machinery of his mills
                    was impelled by steam, the engines of his friends Messrs Boulton Watt supplied
                    the motive power. It is, however, on his achievements as an architect and civil
                    engineer that the fame of Rennie chiefly rests. Of the bridges connecting the
                    banks of the Thames at London, three have been built from his designs,—Southwark
                    Bridge, in the construction of which he introduced a method of ׳employing cast
                    iron which formed a new epoch in the history of bridge-building; Waterloo
                    Bridge, which then had no parallel for its magnitude, elegance, and solidity;
                    and London Bridge, on the model of Waterloo Bridge. Bridges at Leeds,
                    Musselburgh, Kelso, Newton-Stewart, Boston, New Galloway, and numerous other
                    places bear similar testimony to his skill and taste. His earliest canal project
                    was that of the Crinan Canal, and following it was the Lancaster Canal, which
                    besides other difficulties presented that of an aqueduct over the Lune. His
                    execution of these works so established his reputation that his opinion and
                    assistance were required from all quarters in regard to similar undertakings,
                    among others the construction of the Great Western Canal in Somersetshire, the
                    Polbrook Canal in Cornwall, the Portsmouth Canal, and the Avon and Kennet Canal.
                    But more important than these were his works in connexion with docks and
                    harbours, his designs embracing the London Docks, the East and West India Docks
                    at Blackwall, and docks at Hull, Greenock, Leith, Liverpool, and Dublin. The
                    harbours of Queens-ferry, Berwick, Howth, Holyhead, Kingstown, Newhaven, and
                    several others owe their security and convenience to his labours. But even these
                    works mast yield to what he executed in connexion with the Government dockyards
                    at Portsmouth, Chatham, Sheerness, and Plymouth. One other effort of his genius
                    falls to be mentioned, the drainage of that vast tract of marsh-land bordering
                    upon the rivers Trent, Witham, Welland, and Ouse which for cen turies had
                    baffled the skill of some of the ablest men in that department of civil
                    engineering. Rennie’s industry was very extraordinary; though fond of the
                    society of his select friends and of rational conversation, he never suffered
                    amusement of any kind to interfere with his business, which seldom engaged him
                    less than twelve hours and frequently fifteen in the day. His conversation was
                    always amusing and instructive. In person he was of great stature and strength;
                    and his noble bust by Chantrey, when exhibited in Somerset House, obtained the
                    name of Jupiter Tonans. He died 16th October 1821.</p>
                <p>His son <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John Rennie</hi> (born August 30, 1794, died
                    Sept. 1874) succeeded him as engineer to the Admiralty, and acquired a high
                    reputation in the same line of business as his father. On the completion of the
                    London Bridge from his father’s designs in 1831, he received the honour of
                    knighthood. He was the author of <hi rend="italic">The Theory, Formation, and
                    Construction of British and Foreign Harbours,</hi> 4 vols., 1851-54.</p>
