                    north of Harrogate. The Ure is crossed by a fine bridge of 9 arches. The streets
                    are for the most part narrow and irregular, and, although most of the houses are
                    comparatively modern, some of them still retain the picturesque gables
                    characteristic of earlier times. In the spacious market-place there is a modern
                    cross, erected in 1781. The cathedral, although not ranking among those of the
                    first class, is celebrated for its fine proportions, and is of great interest
                    from the various styles of architecture which it includes. Its entire length
                    from east to west is 266 feet, the length of the transepts 130 feet, and the
                    width of the nave and aisles 87 feet. Besides a large square central tower,
                    there are two western towers. The cathedral was founded on the ruins of St
                    Wilfrid’s abbey about 680 a.d. in the reign of Egfrid, but of this Saxon
                    building nothing now remains except the crypt, called St Wilfrid’s Needle. The
                    present building was begun by Archbishop Roger (1154-81), and to this Transition
                    period belong the transepts and portions of the choir. The western front and
                    towers, fine specimens of Early English, were probably the work of Archbishop
                    Gray (1215-55), and about the close of the century the eastern portion of the
                    choir was rebuilt in the Decorated style. The nave and portions of the central
                    tower were rebuilt towards the close of the 15th century in the Perpendicular
                    style. The whole building underwent renovation under the direction of Sir G. G.
                    Scott from 1862 to 1876 at a cost of £40,000. There are a number of monuments of
                    historical and antiquarian interest. The bishop’s palace, a modern building in
                    the Tudor style, is situated in extensive grounds about a mile from the town.
                    The principal secular buildings are the town-hall, the public rooms, and the
                    mechanics’ institution. There are several old charities, including the hospital
                    of St John the Baptist founded by the archbishop of York in 1109, the hospital
                    of St Mary Magdalene for women founded by the archbishop of York in 1341, and
                    the hospital of St Anne founded about the time of Edward IV. by an unknown
                    benefactor. From an early period till the 16th century Ripon was celebrated for
                    its manufactures of woollen cloth. After this industry declined the town became
                    so well known for its spurs that “as true steel as Ripon rowels” became a
                    current phrase; and both Ben Jonson and Da venant refer to Ripon spurs in their
                    verses. This manufacture, with those of buttons and various kinds of hardware,
                    continued to prosper till the beginning of the present century, when the rise of
                    the mechanical industries in the large towns caused it to decline. The
                    population of the borough (area 1580 acres) in 1871 was 6806, and in 1881 it was
                    7390.</p>
                <p>The city is first mentioned under the name of <hi rend="italic">Inhrypum</hi> in
                    connexion with the establishment of a monastery in 660 by Abbot Eata of Melrose.
                    A few years after it was bestowed on St Wilfrid, who was elevated to the see of
                    Northumbria. After the division of the bishopric in 678, a see was erected at
                    Ripon. The city suffered severely in connexion with the incursions of the Danes
                    and the invasion of William the Conqueror, and was burnt by Robert Bruce in 1319
                    and 1323. During the Civil War it was for a time occupied by the Parliamentary
                    forces, but it was retaken by the Royalists in 1643. It was first represented in
                    parliament in the reign of Edward I. it lost one of its two members in 1868, and
                    ceased to be separately represented in 1885. Surrounding the town is an
                    extensive district called the liberty of Ripon, over which the archbishop of
                    York at one time exercised special jurisdiction, not yet altogether
                    annulled.</p>
