                <p>The period occupied by the great movement known as the Protestant Reformation
                    stands identified, for the most part, with the period which marks the transition
                    from the mediaeval to the modern era in European history. Taken within its
                    narrowest limits, it may be looked upon as commencing with the year 1517 and as
                    finding a certain consummation with the year 1545. In the former year Luther’s
                    theses, published at Wittenberg.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Most of the details of the main facts connected with the

                    renunciation of mediaeval doctrine which he initiated; in the latter year the
                    assembling of the council of Trent marks the renewed sanction and promulgation
                    of that doctrine whereby an insuperable barrier was erected between the
                    communion of Rome and the churches of Protestantism. From that time each
                    communion possessed its distinctive organization and formulary of faith, and the
                    struggles which subsequently took place between Romanism and Protestantism
                    represent, not attempts to bring about or to resist reform (whether of
                    discipline or of doctrine), but endeavouis on the part of both communions to
                    bring about, if possible, the extinction of the opposed form of faith.</p>
                <p>But, although the contest which Luther initiated had, long before his death,
                    resulted in complete and irreparable rupture between the contending parties, it
                    is certain that in order to understand the true nature and origin of that
                    contest we must go back to events long anterior to 1517; while in order fully to
                    estimate its effects we must follow the history of events long after 1545. In
                    Germany, for example, the Reformation can hardly be regarded as finding even a
                    formal consummation before the peace of Augsburg (1555); in Switzerland the
                    movement went on with important modifications down to the death of Calvin in
                    1564; in France the onward progress was not materially checked before the
                    massacre on the eve of St Bartholomew (1572); in Bohemia its independent and
                    peculiar fortunes found a final solution only with the battle of the White Hill
                    in 1620; while in England and in Scotland, in the Netherlands, in Scandinavia,
                    in Italy and in Spain, the <pb break="no"

                    was decided by circumstances of time and ¡)lace of so different a kind, that its
                    essential features often become merged and almost lost in their combination with
                    other and altogether extraneous elements, e Nor are the considerations arising
                    out of diversities of race, divergencies of political interests, and varied
                    issues the only difficulties which attach to any attempt to treat the movement
                    as a whole. We must also bear in mind the very different conceptions of the end
                    to be attained which at successive stages of its history have modified its
                    teaching and its organization, and eventually in a great measure determined its
                    geographical limits. These conceptions may be distinguished as those involving
                    (1) a reform of discipline, (2) a reform of doctrine, (3) a modification of the
                    current dogmatic teaching. Of these three distinct conceptions the first, taking
                    its rise in the generally admitted corrupt practice of the Roman Church, aimed
                    at little more than a restoration of discipline,—a reform of morals, that is to
                    say, among the clergy and the monastic orders, and the abolition of those
                    various abuses which had grown up under the lax administration and baneful
                    examples of successive popes and of the Curia; the second, although demanding a
                    reform of doctrine as well as of discipline, sought simply to restore what was
                    believed to be the teaching of the primitive as opposed to the mediaeval church;
                    while the third, guided in the first instance rather by an only half-conscious
                    instinct than by any avowed standard of belief, sought eventually to establish
                    the right of private judgment, to the almost entire repudiation of authority,
                    whether as expressed in the decrees of councils, in the confessions of the
                    Reformed churches, or in the creed of Trent. And it is from this last point of
                    view that the Reformation has gradually come to be regarded as a new
                    commencement rather than as a restoration of belief,—as a point of departure
                    towards a higher and more enlightened faith rather than as a return to an
                    ancient, imperfectly ascertained, and possibly obsolete standard.</p>
                <p>But, by whichever of these aims the movement in favour of reformation was guided,
                    the dominant conception has not unfrequently operated quite independently of the
                    other two. Demands for reform of discipline not unfrequently resulted in
                    disunion w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> here disagreement with respect to
                    doctrine did not exist. The further definition of already accepted doctrine,
                    again, even when made in connexion with some minor article of belief and
                    involving but an almost imperceptible divergence of interpretation, often proved
                    productive of a serious schism where in questions of discipline there was
                    perfect unanimity. The right of private judgment, when urged in contravention of
                    any of the newly formulated standards of discipline or belief, involved an
                    equally decisive rupture with those who recognized only the traditional sources
                    of doctrine. It is evident, therefore, that the Reformation, when regarded from
                    a fairly comprehensive point of view, must appear as a highly complex movement
                    carrying in itself the elements of further controversy and conflict. Even the
                    theory which would seem to afford the most satisfactory solution of its varied
                    phenomena—that which teaches us to look upon it as a Teutonic revolt,
                    intellectual no less than religious, against the traditions which the Latin
                    Church in the course of centuries had invented and imposed on the faith and
                    habits of thought of Western Christendom— often fails us as a clue to its widely
                    different manifestations, and other disturbing causes seem to forbid the effort
                    to refer them to any general principle. The character and policy of the reigning
                    Roman pontiff, the jealousies and divergent interests of the several European
                    states and the special aims of their several rulers, the spell winch imperial
                    institutions and traditions long continued to exercise over the minds of all but
                    the most advanced and independent thinkers, are all important factors in the
                    movement. If, however, w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> e endeavour to assign the
                    causes which prevented the Reformation from being carried even to but partial
                    success long prior to the 16th century, we can have no difficulty in deciding
                    that foremost among them must be placed the manner in which the mediaeval mind
                    was fettered by a servile regard for precedent. To the men of the Middle Ages,
                    whether educated or uneducated, no measure of reform seemed defensible which
                    appeared in the light of an innovation. Precedent was the standard whereby every
                    authority, lay or clerical, was held to be bound; and to this rule the only
                    exceptions were a general council and the supreme pontiff. Even Gregory IX. or
                    Clement V., when he assumed to promulgate additions to the existing code of the
                    Universal Church, was understood to do so simply in his capacity of infallible
                    expounder of essential and unalterable doctrine; while no reform, how-ever
                    seemingly expedient or however recommended by its abstract merits, was held to
                    be justifiable if it could be shown to be in conflict with ancient and
                    authoritative tradition. The Reformers themselves always maintained that the
                    doctrines which they enforced rested on Scriptural precedent and primitive
                    example. Their assertion w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as frequently
                    challenged by their antagonists; and it may reasonably be doubted whether even
                    Luther or Calvin could have commanded any considerable following had not their
                    doctrinal teaching been combined with a demand for a reformation of discipline
                    which rested on undeniable precedent, and to <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> which
                    the circumstances of the time imparted new and irresistible force,—a force,
                    however, which had been long accumulating and had been derived in no small
                    measure from the blind obstinacy of the Roman see in times long antecedent.</p>
                <p>The existence long before the 16th century of a strong] desire to bring about a
                    reformation of discipline within thechurch itself is attested by evidence which
                    it will suffice j to pass by with little more than an allusion. Among the j most
                    notable instances are those afforded by the rise of the Dominican and Franciscan
                    orders in the 13th century and of the Brethren of St Jerome (or the Brethren of
                    the Common Life) in the 14th century,—efforts based upon general conviction,
                    which resulted in spontaneous combinations. Similar in origin, though more
                    strictly ecclesiastical in character, were the designs of the great councils
                    which successively assembled at Pisa (1409), at Constance (1414), and at Basel
                    (1431). Among those who were distinguished in these assemblies by their
                    strenuous advocacy of reform, Pierre d’Ailly and his pupil Jean Charlier de
                    Gerson, both successively chancellor of the university of Paris, and Nicholas de
                    CRmenges, archdeacon of Bayeux, were especially conspicuous. Each alike upheld
                    in the plainest language the superiority of a general council to the pope, and
                    the obligation that rested on such a body to address itself to the task of
                    church reform whenever the necessity might arise, and the supreme pontiff
                    himself be found either incapable of such a labour or unwilling to initiate it.
                    Of the widespread necessity for such reform, as shown by the condition of the
                    clergy and the monasteries, the remarkable treatise by Nicholas de Clemenges,

                <p>Clemenges deplores in the strongest terms the state of the church in his day,—a
                    condition of appalling degeneracy, which he ascribes mainly to the increase in
                    wealth and luxury that had followed upon the development of a worldly spirit in
                    its midst. His strictures leave no order or degree of either the ecclesiastical
                    or the monastic life untouched,—the overwhelming ostentation of the Curia; the
                    pride and rapacity of the cardinals, their immorality and addiction to simony;
                    the prevalence of the same vices among the episcopal order, filled with
                    beardless youths, who, scarcely liberated from the dread of the schoolmaster’s
                    ferule, hastened to assume the pastoral office; the lower clergy in general so
                    sunk in vice and sloth that scarcely one in a thousand (“vix inter mille unus ”)
                    was to be found living a godly and sober life; the nunneries, which he declares
                    were brothels rather than sanctuaries (“non dico Dei sanctuaria, sed Veneris
                    execranda prostibula ”). We can feel no surprise at finding that in the 16th
                    century Clement VII. thought it necessary to place this burning diatribe by a
                    great doctor of the church in the <hi rend="italic">Index Expurgatorius.</hi> A
                    few years later we find the evils to which Clemenges called attention emphasized
                    by one of the most eminent ecclesiastics of the age, — the cardinal Julian
                    Cesarini, when he was endeavouring to dissuade Pope Eugenius IV. from his design
                    of dissolving the council of Basel (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Popedom,</hi> vol.
                    xix. p. 502). In this letter he affirms that so strongly is popular feeling
                    stirred against the clergy by their neglect of their duties and scandalously
                    immoral lives that there is reason to fear that, if some remedy be pot devised,
                    the whole fabric of the Roman Church may be overturned. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Dissolutio cleri Alemanniae, ex qua laici

                <p>The complete failure of these successive efforts to bring about any comprehensive
                    measure of church reform is a familiar fact in European history. And not only
                    were the evils which it was sought to abolish suffered to continue with but
                    little abatement, but dissent even from the recognized discipline of the church
                    was placed under a ban, and made, in common with dissent from doctrine, an
                    offence punishable with the severest penalties. The mediaeval theory of the
                    Roman hierarchy had indeed been reaffirmed by Eugenius IV. and his successors
                    with a success which seemed almost to preclude the possibility of its ever being
                    again challenged. But the main point here to be noted is that in none of these
                    several efforts in the direction of reform, whether resulting from conciliar or
                    popular action, was the doctrine of the church once called in question. The fate
                    that overtook John Huss and Jerome of Prague appears to have been very generally
                    regarded as a necessary example of just rigour in the suppression of heresy. We
                    find, accordingly, that, when in the following century it was sought to
                    associate the efforts of the reformers in the direction of doctrinal change with
                    the efforts of a party within the church itself in the direction of disciplinary
                    reform, the defenders of the traditional Catholic faith challenged the assumed
                    precedent and altogether denied the parallel. “It is,” wrote Bossuet in the 17th
                    century, “an obvious illusion; for among all the passages which they adduce
                    there is not one in which those teachers have ever dreamed of changing the
                    belief of the church, of amending its worship, which consisted chiefly in the
                    sacrifice of the mass, or of overthrowing the authority of her prelates and
                    especially that of the pope, all which was the primary design of this new
                    reformation of which Luther was the architect.” <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Oeuvres</hi> (1865), ii.
                    303. </p></note> It is not easy to gainsay the reasonableness of Bossuet’s
                    criticism. It was the fundamental theory of ' the Reformation that it involved
                    the setting aside of the development given in mediaeval times to the doctrines
                    and teaching of the early church, and proposed to substitute for these a totally
                    different interpretation, which rejected the successive decisions of councils
                    and popes as arbitrary and erroneous. Such a theory, however, necessarily
                    imposed on the Reformers the task of proving the validity of their own position,
                    by showing that their repudiation of a practice and of precedents which had been
                    accepted for so many centuries was justified by an appeal to yet more ancient
                    and unquestionable authority. If indeed they failed in so doing, they must look
                    forward to sinking in the estimation of Christendom to the level of heretics,
                    and be prepared to stand before posterity in the same category as the Arians,
                    the Albigenses, the Lollards, and the Hussites, and those other sects which, by
                    their unwarranted assertion of the right of private interpretation, had provoked
                    and incurred the formal condemnation of the church. It is not within the scope
                    of this article to attempt to estimate the justice of the theological arguments
                    by which the Reformers sought to vindicate their position; but there is good
                    reason for concluding that the argumentative powers and personal influence of
                    Luther and Calvin would have failed, just as the efforts of preceding reformers
                    had failed, in effecting the desired result, had not the conditions and
                    circumstances of the age been such as to lend new force to the arguments which
                    they urged in favour of a fundamental change in the standpoint of religious
                    faith.</p>
                <p>The most notable feature in connexion with traditional belief which challenges
                    our attention at the commencement of the 16th century is the manner in which the
                    popedom was becoming less and less in harmony with the spirit of the age, and
                    with those new forces which were now developing in the midst of Teutonism. The
                    intolerance of the church in the repression of heresy had become more pronounced
                    and was pressing with increasing rigour on free thought, when, owing to the
                    influences of the New Learning, that thought was everywhere on the point of
                    seeking to break through the traditional trammels; the corruption of the Curia
                    and of both the regular and the secular clergy, the extension of the temporal
                    power of the pontiffs in Italy, and the extortion of their emissaries in other
                    countries had reached a climax just as, owing to the more independent spirit
                    generated by the consolidation of the nationalities, the ruler and the people in
                    each kingdom or principality were becoming increasingly impatient of the
                    existence of such abuses. A brief consideration of these several features
                    becomes, accordingly, quite indispensable, if we wish rightly to comprehend the
                    forces at work in Europe at the time when the Reformers arose to combine them
                    and give them more definite direction.</p>
                <p>Not a few, and some very memorable, efforts had been made before the 16th century
                    to bring about a reformation of doctrine, but these had almost invariably been
                    promptly visited with the censure of the church. Long after the “heresies” of
                    the 4th century had died away and after the controversies of the turbulent 9th
                    century—such as those on the Eucharist between Paschasius Radbertus and
                    Ratramnus, and on predestination between John Scotus Erigena and Gottschalk—had
                    been silenced by the decisions of the pontiffs, we find movements arising,
                    which, however much they differ in other characteristics, all attest the
                    existence of a widespread desire among large sections of the community to revert
                    to a simpler form of i־eligious belief and practice. The Paulicians (or
                    Manichaeans of the East), the Albigenses (or Manichaeans of the West), the
                    Waldenses, the Cathari, and the Leonists (or Poor Men of Lyons)—sects which made
                    their appearance mainly in the 12th and 13th centuries, and for the most part in
                    Switzerland, Languedoc, and northern France—the <pb break="no"

                    may be looked upon as the ancestors in faith of the Huguenots and the Puritans
                    of after-times, and were all more or less characterized by an aversion to the
                    Roman ritual, to splendid churches, to crosses and crucifixes, combined with a
                    more definite denial of such doctrines as that of baptismal regeneration, of
                    transubstantiation, of masses for the dead, and of the obligation to observe
                    Lent. The ultimate fate of these different sects was singularly similar. Of
                    their earlier history, indeed, we have but few memorials, for their records, if
                    any existed, have mostly perished; and, as with their prototypes in the earlier
                    Christian centuries, it became almost necessarily their policy to avoid all
                    external demonstrations which would be likely to arrest the attention of the
                    world. An inquisitor of the 13th century, when describing the Leonists (c.
                    1250), whom he speaks of as both the most ancient and the most widely spread of
                    the sects then existing, represents them as by no means guilty, to all external
                    appearance, of practices which could fairly be stigmatized as blasphemous, but
                    as wearing a great semblance of piety, as being of good repute among their
                    neighbours, and chiefly blamable as given to speaking against the Roman Church
                    and its clergy and thus gaining, only too easily, the ears of the laity at
                    large. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    such characteristics, however, the Albi-genses in the 12th century had presented
                    a remarkable exception. At the commencement of the pontificate of Innocent III.
                    (1198) his legates had found nearly the whole of the rich and prosperous
                    territory extending from Carcassonne to Bordeaux dominated by this powerful
                    heresy,—a form of doctrine associated, moreover, not with austerity but with
                    voluptuousness of life, with a profound contempt for the priestly profession,
                    and with a warm admiration for the conceptions of chivalry and the poetry of the
                    troubadour,—a heresy enriched by the devotion of its adherents to an extent
                    which made it far wealthier than the church itself in those regions, and before
                    which the representatives of the Roman orthodoxy seemed threatened almost with
                    extinction. The suppression of this heresy by Simon de Montfort is a well-known
                    episode, and would seem to have formed the point of departure for a new and more
                    rigorous policy on the part of the church in its dealings Avith like
                    manifestations of disobedience. In the year 1229 the statutes of the council of
                    Toulouse formulated, as it were, the code of persecution, and, aided by the
                    Inquisition, which probably took its rise about the same time, supplied a new
                    machinery for the detection and suppression of heresy. To the terrorism thus
                    established, after the sword of De Montfort had done its work, we may fairly
                    refer the changed characteristics of the adherents of the heresies in France, as
                    above described, in the middle of the 13th century.</p>
                <p>! But, the suspicions of the church having once been thoroughly roused and the
                    secular power incited and guided to its task, external conformity and
                    inoffensive life, the mountain hamlet and the secluded valley, proved alike
                    unavailing to avert the cruelty of the persecutor. The Cathari in Italy did not
                    long survive the fall of the Holien-staufens, from whom they had received
                    effective protection and support; and it added not a little to the offence of
                    the doctrines proclaimed by the Spiritual Franciscans, whose tenets were
                    condemned by the council of Vienne in 1311, that, while the order had taken its
                    rise in a spirit of protest against the corruptions of the Curia, its members
                    were known to be ready to favour and aid by all the means in their power the
                    restoration of the imperial ascendency in Italy. The Spiritual Franciscans were
                    the forerunners of the Apostolic Brethren, one of the most widely spread of the
                    new sects, and must also be looked upon as the precursors of the Lollards. The
                    intimate connexion between theological doctrine and political opinion that
                    existed among the latter sect is Avell known. We find, accordingly, that heresy,
                    long before Reformation times, was regarded by the papal power as associated
                    with hostile political interests, and that a new incentive to its rigorous
                    suppression was thus supplied.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the popedom itself, during the long sojourn of the pontiffs at
                    Avignon (1309-78), became involved in a political alliance, whereby it alienated
                    the sympathies of Europe at large to an extent which it was never afterwards
                    able to regain. During that long and humiliating episode in its history the
                    office was filled almost exclusively by Frenchmen, whose policy was conceived in
                    complete subservience to that of the reigning French monarch; and the pontiff at
                    Avignon thus came to be regarded both by the empire and in England as the pliant
                    ally of a hostile pqwer. During the following century it recovered much of its
                    influence in Germany, where its pretensions were sometimes regarded not
                    unfavourably by the electors as an equipoise to the too despotic sway of the
                    emperor. Somewhat later we find it receiving the most efficient support from
                    Spain. But it could never again command the same universal deference in Western
                    Christendom; and the apparently genuine devotion to its interests which may from
                    time to time be discerned manifesting itself, now in one nation and now in
                    another, was largely inspired by political considerations, and often dearly
                    purchased at the expense of a corresponding hostility provoked among another
                    people.</p>
                <p>To the manner in which theological tenets, often purely speculative in their
                    origin and innocuous in their bearing upon practice, thus came to be regarded as
                    identified with secular questions of grave import and pressing for an immediate
                    solution, we must partly attribute the jealousy with which the first symptoms of
                    heresy were now watched for by Rome. Early in the 14th century the Fraticelli
                    and the Apostolic Brethren, with other heretical sects, were anathematized. In
                    the year 1324 Pope John XXII. demanded of the emperor the suppression of the
                    Waldenses, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>They were

                    others. The name by which they were known among themselves was that of “The
                    Brethren.” See Ludwig Keller, <hi rend="italic">Die R/’fonnution und die alteren

                    and, ably as Marsilius of Padua assailed the pretensions of the papacy, his
                    protest seemed ineffectual amid the supreme humiliation of his patron, Louis of
                    Bavaria. Driven alike from Italy and from France, the persecuted sect took
                    refuge in Savoy and in Switzerland, and in the year 1489 the papal legate
                    reported that their numbers were not less than 50,000. Lollardism was suppressed
                    with unsparing hand in England; and John Sawtrey, the first of Wikliffe’s
                    followers to suffer martyrdom, was burnt to death in 1401, for refusing to
                    worship the cross and for denial of the doctrine of transubstantiation. Fifteen
                    years later John Huss and Jerome of Prague suffered the same fate at Constance,
                    and the indignation excited among their fellow-countrymen, intensified as this
                    feeling was by differences of race, gave rise to a memorable resistance, which
                    eventually won religious freedom for the land. At the diet of Kutna Hora
                    (Kuttenberg) in 1485 a truce was made between the Utraquists and the Catholics
                    for thirty-two years, and the complete religious equality then established was
                    made permanent at the diet of 1512. In England, on the other hand, the Lollard
                    movement was almost completely extinguished. The political doctrines with which
                    it had become associated made it the object of suspicion alike to the
                    ecclesiastical and to the civil power; and Sir John <pb break="no"

                    martyrdom, altogether failed to win the popularity or the reverence which waited
                    on the memories of the two Hussite leaders. The religious tenets of his
                    followers were not, indeed, altogether suppressed, and continued to command a
                    certain following down to the 16th century. As a tradition, however, they would
                    seem to have survived in connexion with the early English Puritanism rather than
                    with the Reformation; while between the Hussite movement and the Reformation the
                    connexion is unquestionable and was recognized by Luther himself.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">r</hi> During the very time that the Roman pontiffs were</p>
                <p>׳· wielding thus effectually the weapons of bigotry and persecution against all
                    manifestations of independent religious thought, their influence and patronage
                    were largely given to the fostering of other influences, which ultimately proved
                    highly favourable to that very freedom of judgment and of philosophic
                    speculation which the Roman see has invariably sought to suppress. The relations
                    in which the “New Learning,” as it was then called, is to be found successively
                    standing to the representatives of orthodox belief constitute an interesting and
                    instructive study. At one time Greek had been held in reverence as the official
                    language of the Roman Church; but, from the period when the popes were first
                    enabled to shake off the yoke of the Eastern emperor in Italy, the use of the
                    Greek language had been discontinued, its literature placed under a ban, and the
                    study of both systematically discouraged in Western Christendom. Then came the
                    Renaissance; and under the patronage of pontiffs like Nicholas Y. (1447-1455),
                    and cardinals like Julian and Bessarion, Greek became as much in favour at the
                    Curia as it had before been discredited. At first it seemed not improbable that
                    this literary revolution might prove a powerful aid not only in promoting
                    Christian culture but in diffusing a more genuinely Christian and catholic
                    spirit. While eminent ecclesiastics sought to bring about the reconciliation of
                    the churches of the East and West, original thinkers like Pius II. and Maffeus
                    Vegius put forth views on the whole subject of education which involved a
                    decisive rupture with the traditions of mediaevalism. It is unnecessary to
                    describe the manner in which this promising future became overclouded; how
                    learning in Italy became associated at once with scepticism and immorality; and
                    how men of letters like Politian and Poggio and Bembo and Beccadelli, under the
                    favour of pontiffs like Leo X., at once scandalized the devout and amused the
                    fancy of the polite scholar. “This fable of Christ has been to us a source of
                    great gain,” a cardinal at the Vatican was overheard to observe. Such a tone of
                    feeling, however, was not consonant with the spirit of the persecutor, and if
                    the religions spirit was shocked by profanity it was less disgraced by bigotry.
                    Earnestness of conviction was derided and disbelieved in; and the prevalent
                    sentiments at the Curia at the outbreak of the Reformation were those of idle
                    and careless security. Signs, however, were not wanting to provo to a later
                    generation how little that false security was justifiable. Foremost among those
                    who advocated reform and a policy of reconciliation in the first half of the
                    15th century was Nicolas de Cusa, who, though German by birth, embraced with
                    ardour the schemes projected for the regeneration of Italy and of the church at
                    large. Neither Pius II. nor Nicholas V., who alike promoted him a,nd honoured
                    him, appears to have discerned the dangerous element that lurked in his bold
                    spirit of inquiry. From Cusa, however, Laurentius Valla derived the guidance
                    which led him on to his memorable attack on the fiction of the Donation of
                    Constantine, and to that more general investigation of the claims of the popedom
                    which marks the commencement of the historical scepticism which now began to
                    develop with such startling results. To Valla succeeded Gregory of Heimburg, who
                    exposed the papal pretensions with equal vigour, and made it for the first time
                    apparent how formidable a weapon the New Learning might prove in the defence of
                    those imperial and popular rights in Germany which Rome at that time
                    contemptuously ignored. The conflict between Heimburg and Eugenius IV.
                    foreshadowed, indeed, the greater contest between the Teutonic and the Latin
                    power, and Heimburg has more than once been designated the prototype of Ulrich
                    von Hutten.</p>
                <p>In the whole history of the Reformation, and of the period by which it was
                    immediately preceded, the political relations of the popedom to the other
                    European powers and more especially to Germany, constitute, in fact, elements of
                    primary importance. In the latter part of the 15th century those relations were
                    still further embittered by the personal character and aims of the reigning
                    pontiffs. At the very time when the existence of the popedom as a temporal power
                    was menaced by the rising spirit of innovation, the reverence and sympathy of
                    Europe were still further alienated by the spectacle of the career of Alexander
                    VI. and of his end,—the result, it was commonly reported, of the poison which he
                    had designed for the destruction of another. The character of his successor,
                    Julius II. (1503-1513), might well seem virtuous by comparison; but at no period
                    in the history of the pontificate does its religious character seem more
                    completely lost sight of in purely secular interests. It had long before (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Popedom)</hi> been the aim of each more ambitious pope to
                    become a great territorial prince and thus to lay the foundation of the private
                    fortunes of his house. But Julius aimed at something more than this,—at the
                    assertion of political supremacy throughout Italy and of the right to rank with
                    the great powers of Europe as wielding at once material resources but little
                    inferior to theirs, and as commanding a widespread organization to the like of
                    which not one of them could aspire. Such were the objects to which his untiring
                    energies were systematically directed. Within four years of his accession he had
                    added Perugia and Bologna to the possessions of the church, and from Piacenza to
                    Terracina his sway extended over all the great strongholds and the most fertile
                    territory; even the great powers of France and Spain, notwithstanding their
                    newly consolidated strength, could not but regard with jealousy and apprehension
                    his genius and his policy. “Before,” wrote Machiavelli, “there was no baron so
                    petty as not to look with contempt on that popedom which now even a king of
                    France regards with respect.” The means by which this remarkable change was
                    effected involved, however, a recourse to fiscal expedients which eventually
                    proved eminently detrimental to the Roman see; <note anchored="true"

                    the great powers in relation to Rome almost entirely determined by purely
                    political considerations and Italy itself becoming the arena of their contending
                    ambitions. In the year 1494 Charles VIII. of France effected his memorable
                    passage of the Alps to grasp the crown of Naples. It was currently believed that
                    he had been incited to the enterprise by Alexander VI. himself,—a circumstance
                    which alone suffices to explain the failure which attended that pontiff’s
                    efforts when he subsequently sought to prevail upon the invader to submit his
                    claims to the arbitration of the holy see. In the year 1508 the invasion <pb

                    object of re-establishing the imperial supremacy in Italy,—an expedition which
                    was in some respects the counterpart of that of Charles, and to which Julius II.
                    opposed a vacillating policy not unlike that of his predecessor. To the
                    expedition of Maximilian succeeded the league of Cambray, designed to humble the
                    republic of Venice, and warmly supported by Julius II. as a means whereby to
                    gratify his resentment at the resistance offered by that powerful state to the
                    encroachments of the popedom. No sooner was Venice sufficiently humiliated than
                    Julius proceeded to concert measures for carrying out the great object of his
                    ambition,—the expulsion of the foreigner from Italy. Never before had the aims
                    of the papacy seemed so completely in conflict with those of every European
                    power.</p>
                <p>In France, Louis XII., on appealing to the representatives of the Gallican Church
                    (council of Tours, September 1510), soon found that national feeling entirely
                    prevailed over Ultramontane sympathies, and that he might count on their
                    effectual support. Notwithstanding, therefore, the remonstrances of his devout
                    consort, Anne of Brittany, he resolved upon a vigorous anti-papal policy. In
                    concert with the emperor Maximilian, he revived the long-dormant demand for a
                    general council; and a mimic assembly, consisting of four cardinals, twenty
                    Gallican prelates, certain abbots and other dignitaries, was actually convened
                    at Pisa in 1511. In this extremity Julius exhibited his usual fertility of
                    resource by organizing the Holy League, and thus inducing Ferdinand of Aragon
                    and the Venetians to combine with him in opposing the designs of schismatic
                    France. The council, transferred to Milan, issued from thence in April 1512 an
                    edict suspending Julius from all pontifical functions as a “notorious disturber
                    of the council, the author of schism, contumacious, incorrigible, hardened”
                    (Raynaldus, <hi rend="italic">sub ann.).</hi> The pontiff thereupon
                    excommunicated Louis XII., who rejoined by a formal protest and by causing coins
                    to be struck and circulated bearing the arms of France and the ominous
                    inscription <hi rend="italic">Perdam Babylonis nomen.</hi> In the meantime the
                    fifth Lateran council, the rival council convened by Julius, commenced its
                    sittings (May 1512), and forthwith declared the acts of the assembly held at
                    Milan to be those of a schismatical body, while it proceeded to confirm the
                    papal censure on the king of France. The expulsion of the French from Italy,
                    after the fall of their heroic leader, Gaston de Foix, seemed to threaten only a
                    further widening of the schism, when the death of Julius in 1513 opened the door
                    for negotiation—an opportunity of which Louis eagerly availed himself—while the
                    pliant disposition of the new pontiff, Leo X. (1513-1521), afforded additional
                    facilities for arriving at an agreement. The French monarch now disavowed the
                    proceedings of the council which he had before supported, and acknowledged the
                    validity of the acts of the council at the Lateran. Other points were still
                    under discussion when Louis died and was succeeded by Francis I., January
                    1515.</p>
                <p>In the following year the Catholic king Ferdinand of Aragon died. The relations
                    of Spain to the papacy during . his reign and before that time had been very far
                    from representing a policy of complete subserviency. By a concordat made in the
                    year 1482 Pope Sixtus IV. had conceded to the sovereigns of Castile and Aragon
                    the right of nominating to the higher ecclesiastical offices, although he had
                    reserved to himself a corresponding power in connexion with the inferior
                    benefices,—a privilege which soon resulted in the customary abuses and rendered
                    the papal supremacy for a time scarcely more popular in Spain than in Germany.
                    At nearly the same time the institution of the Inquisition in the former country
                    is generally supposed to have first taken place (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Inquisition),</hi> —an event which must not, however, be construed into a proof
                    of the ascendency of papal influence. In its earlier stage the Inquisition was
                    quite as much a civil as an ecclesiastical tribunal, being especially directed
                    against the exclusive privileges and immunities claimed by the hereditary
                    nobility; and, although under Cardinal Ximenes the repression of heresy became
                    one of its chief functions, it was long regarded with no friendly feelings by
                    Rome. The Roman doctrine and discipline were rigorously imposed on the Spanish
                    population, but Ferdinand himself showed little disposition to submit to the
                    dictation of the Roman pontiff. In the year 1508 he sharply rebuked his viceroy,
                    the count of Rivarzoga, for allowing a papal bull to be promulgated in the
                    provinces without having previously obtained his sanction, and declared that if
                    the bull were not forthwith withdrawn he would withdraw the two crowns from the
                    obedience of the holy see. Five years later Cardinal Xinienes, in a like spirit,
                    openly denounced the abuses that accompanied the traffic in indulgences.</p>
                <p>The tone that Germany at this period w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as able to!
                    assume was very different. The several states and princi- * palities, feebly
                    protected by the imperial authority, which <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> could
                    no longer be asserted as of yore, yielded an easy prey to the extortion of the
                    papal emissaries. The national clergy, perhaps more corrupt than in any other
                    Teutonic country, showed themselves completely subservient to the worst
                    malpractices of Rome. It was from the laity at large that the first warning came
                    that either reform or revolution must before long ensue. In the year 1511 a
                    notable document, purporting to emanate from the German people at large, was
                    laid before the emperor. Drawn up in the form of a petition, it enumerated and
                    described the various abuses associated with the prevailing ecclesiastical
                    practice and suggested the remedies. Foremost among the specified grievances it
                    placed the utter want of good faith shown by successive pontiffs in the manner
                    in which they were accustomed altogether to disregard (often at the instance of
                    most unworthy favourites) the privileges and immunities solemnly granted by
                    their predecessors. It complained of the frequent nullifying of the elections of
                    prelates canonically elected by their respective chapters, of a like disregard
                    for such elections even in cases where large sums had been paid to the Curia by
                    the chapters in order to secure the ratification of their choice, of the manner
                    in which all the richest benefices were reserved for cardinals and
                    proto-notaries, of the frequent anticipation of reversions <hi rend="italic"
                    >(expectativse gratise</hi> ) and of the concentration of numerous benefices in
                    the hands of single individuals, of the incessant lawsuits generated by these
                    malpractices and the consequent waste of considerable sums both on the lawsuits
                    themselves and on the obtaining of bulls which eventually proved inoperative,
                    —“so that,” said the petitioners, “it has become a common saying that, on
                    obtaining a reversion from Rome, one ought to lay by one or two hundred gold
                    pieces wherewith to defend the actions to which the maintenance of one’s rights
                    will infallibly give rise.” Other matters of complaint were the frequency with
                    which annates were demanded; the bestowal of livings on those utterly
                    incompetent for the discharge of their duties,—“fitter,” in fact, “to be
                    muleteers than to be the instructors of their fellow-men”; the frequent issuing
                    of new indulgences and revocation of the old, notwithstanding the repeated
                    remonstrances of the laity; the levying of tenths under pretext of an expedition
                    against the Turks when no such expedition was designed; and the petition closed
                    with the complaint, which had been rife almost ever since the days of Hilary of
                    Arles, of the continual summoning of suits <pb break="no"

                    more promptly decided before the national tribunals. <note anchored="true"

                    grievances and their nonredress may serve partly to explain the obduracy with

                    in Germany was being thus effectually alienated from the papal see, the learning
                    of Germany was also pursuing that ominous track, first delineated by Gregory of
                    Heimburg, which marks its complete divergence from the Italian humanism. The
                    names of Johann von Goch (d. 1475), Johann Wessel (d. 1489), Johann Reuchlin (d.
                    1522), and Erasmus stand associated, although in different ways, with a great
                    movement which, by attacking at once the doctrine and the discipline of the
                    church, opened up the way for Luther. Goch and Wessel were among the first to
                    give systematic form to the opposition to the existing ecclesiastical system,
                    and their criticism included both popes and councils as ultimate authorities in
                    matters of faith. They inveighed with especial force against the doctrines of
                    indulgences, veneration of saints, and purgatory, and they denied that
                    confession, the Lord’s Supper, and extreme unction were to be regarded as
                    sacraments of divine institution. During the years 1511 to 1516 Reuchlin carried
                    on a memorable struggle against the monks of Cologne in defence of the New
                    Learning and of improved canons of textual criticism. In the year 1516 Erasmus
                    put forth the first edition of his <hi rend="italic">Novum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Instrumentum.</hi> Side by side with these more elaborate efforts there was
                    going on another literary movement which in its influence on the popular mind
                    was not less considerable. Ever since the days of the early Lollards satire had
                    been found a not altogether ineffectual weapon in assailing those abuses in the
                    church which argument and remonstrance seemed powerless to reform. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Praise of Folly,</hi> from the pen of Erasmus, which appeared in
                    1511, seconded the graver efforts of Reuchlin, and successfully held up to
                    ridicule those monastic orders of whose greed and dull obstructive activity
                    Germany was already so weary. But even this brilliant effort paled in its
                    effects when compared with the <hi rend="italic">Epistoloe Obscurorum
                    Virorum,</hi> which appeared in 1515-16. These letters, of which Ulrich von
                    Hutten and his friend Crotus Rubianus were the principal authors, were a series
                    of broadly humorous fabrications, purporting to be written by members of the
                    obscurantist party themselves. A more skilful mode of exposing the ignorance and
                    imbecility of thought which characterized the average intelligence of the monks
                    of those days could hardly have been devised; and the success of the artifice
                    appeared complete when it became known that certain stolid monks had been led to
                    approve the volume and even aid in its circulation as a genuine and valid
                    defence of the views which they upheld.</p>
                <p>These effective demonstrations, it is to be noted, were not merely the outcome of
                    that widespread discontent above described, but resemble rather a series of
                    sparks elicited by immediate contact between the German mind and Rome; and it is
                    of no little interest to mark the effect produced on three of the most eminent
                    representatives of the new movement by their visit, within a few years of each
                    other, to the capital and by the contemplation of the splendour of the Curia and
                    the moral degrada-&gt; tion of its members. Of these three observers the first
                    <hi rend="superscript">)f</hi> was Erasmus, who visited the capital in 1506. His
                    lively <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> ’sense of the incongruous was not a little
                    excited by the spectacle of the warlike pontiff, Julius II., whom, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Praise of Folly</hi> , written a few years later, he describes as
                    subverting alike the laws, peace, and religion. But Erasmus himself does not
                    appear to have been greatly scandalized. He affects, indeed, to be somewhat
                    uncertain whether it is Germany that has copied Rome or whether Rome has not
                    rather copied a certain class of German prelates, who seem to look upon the
                    battlefield as the fitting place where to render up their souls to God. Somewhat
                    later, writing in a graver mood, he declares that nothing will ever efface his
                    more pleasing recollections of the great city,—its freedom of discourse, its
                    intellectual illumination, its works of art, its libraries, and its scholars.
                    Four years after Erasmus came an Augustinian monk from Erfurt, full of reverence
                    for the traditions, the grandeur, and the sanctity of Rome. Martin Luther
                    appears to have been less struck than was Erasmus by the unpriestly character of
                    Julius II., who, as he admits, maintained order and watched over the sanitary
                    condition of the Sacred City. But he was shocked beyond measure by the
                    corruption, the profanity, and the immoral lives of the Roman clergy. The fond
                    illusion of his monastic life was at an end; and he returned to Germany not only
                    prepared to counsel resistance to papal extortion but shaken in his whole
                    allegiance to the holy see. A few months after Luther came Ulrich von Hutten. It
                    ־would be difficult to select a better representative of the temper and feeling
                    of the higher classes in Germany at that time. To pride of birth and devotion to
                    the New Learning he united a love of adventure which no physical suffering or
                    misfortune seemed able to subdue, and a chivalrous spirit which could but
                    impatiently brook the assertion of even legitimate authority. Already burning
                    with resentment at the systematic extortion to which his countrymen were
                    subjected, his feelings were still further intensified as he listened to the
                    contemptuous language and observed the supercilious demeanour which marked the
                    Roman estimate of those who bore the German name. He heard from an eye-witness a
                    description of Julius II. as that pontiff had presented himself to the world at
                    the siege of Mirandola, with “wild eye, brazen front, and threatening mien.” On
                    his return to his fatherland Hutten condensed into epigrammatic Latin verse,
                    beside the suppressed fury of which the polished satire of Erasmus seems to
                    pale, a description of what he had seen and heard, and denounced with terrible
                    effect the wdiole system of bulls, indulgences, and other devices whereby an
                    avaricious prelate was wringing dishonest gains from a long-suffering nation.
                    Few literary assailants have ever possessed a greater power of irritating an
                    antagonist than did Ulrich von Hutten, and considerations of generosity or
                    expediency rarely deterred him. It was generally expected when Leo X. ascended
                    the pontifical throne that he would be anxious to sheathe the sword which his
                    predecessor had wielded so vigorously, and his countrymen already hailed him as
                    the “restorer of peace.” By that epithet Hutten too vouchsafed to address him,
                    but it was in a dedication to the pontiff of p, reprint of Laurentius Valla’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Donation of Constantine,</hi> and the seeming
                    act of homage was thus artfully appended to pages exceptionally calculated to
                    wound the papal susceptibilities.</p>
                <p>It must, however, be admitted that the character of the German episcopate at this
                    time was such that it scarcely appeared to advantage even when compared with
                    that of the ecclesiastics of the Roman Curia. Its members were generally scions
                    of princely houses, caring little for the spiritual interests of their dioceses,
                    but delighting in field sports and martial exercises, given to building palaces
                    for their ow <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> n residence rather than to the
                    erection of churches, and often without the slightest tincture of learning.

                    little but pleasure and display. On the great prelates the extortion of Rome
                    sometimes fell not less heavily than on the laity; and the archbishop, before he
                    could receive his pallium, was called upon to pay the sum of 30,000 gulden into
                    the papal exchequer. Leo X. was at that time intent on carrying out the great
                    design of his predecessor, the rebuilding of St Peter’s. It has been observed by
                    Palla-vicino that the millions devoted to the erection of the material church
                    were acquired at the cost of many more millions to the spiritual church. Leo
                    proclaimed a fresh issue of indulgences, and the archbishop Albert was appointed
                    his commissioner to carry out the sale in a large portion of Germany. He seized
                    the occasion to prevail upon the pope to allow him to appropriate one half of
                    the money collected for the indulgences in order to pay for his pallium. As his
                    chief agent in the sale he imprudently selected one Tetzel, a Dominican friar,
                    whose unscrupulousness in such work was so notorious that the papal collector at
                    Mainz refused to employ him. In the course of his progress Tetzel came to
                    Jiiterbogk, near Wittenberg, and his superstitious traffic and the impudent
                    devices which he employed to cajole the people were thus brought directly under
                    the notice of Luther. The young professor seized the opportunity of directing
                    the attention of the university, where he was already highly popular, to the
                    abuses associated with the sale of indulgences. He did not as yet impugn the
                    doctrine of indulgences itself, and he expressed his conviction that their good
                    father the pope must be altogether unaware of the extent to which such abuses
                    were allowed to prevail. His celebrated theses were forwarded by himself to the
                    archbishop, as well as to the elector of Saxony, his patron, and also the
                    munificent founder of the university. The elector, who had seen with no slight
                    dissatisfaction the manner in which his provinces were being plundered in order
                    to pay for the extravagance of a neighbouring prelate, extended his protection
                    to the courageous polemic, and Luther thus gained the all-precious interval of
                    freedom from molestation which enabled him to compose the memorable treatises
                    whereby he produced such an immense effect on the minds and consciences of his
                    countrymen. The nailing of his theses to the door of the church at Wittenberg,
                    it is to be noted, was a very common method of procedure on the part of a
                    university disputant; and nearly a year passed away before the events which so
                    deeply agitated Wittenberg were recognized in their full importance by the world
                    at large. Luther himself, indeed, in his notable letter to Leo X., written in
                    1518, tells us <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Werke,</hi> ed. 1883, i. 528. </p></note> that, <hi rend="italic"
                    >contrary to his wishes</hi> , his theses were translated into German, and
                    circulated throughout the nation, and that his antagonists declared that he had
                    set the world in flames. But.in this language there is evidently something of
                    exaggeration. Some two months after the appearance of Luther’s theses Tetzel, by
                    way of rejoinder, published at the university of Frankfort-on־the-Oder a hundred
                    and six anti-theses, and these were subsequently burnt by the students of
                    Wittenberg in the market-place. To Leo, however, the vague reports that reached
                    Rome conveyed only the impression of a dispute between the two monastic orders
                    of which Luther and Tetzel were respectively the representatives. He declared
                    that Luther was a man of genius, and refused to interfere. Even Ulrich von
                    Hutten, at that time residing not far from Wittenberg, seems to have shared in
                    this misapprehension, and, writing to his patron, he expresses the hope that the
                    two contending parties may eventually tear each other to pieces.</p>
                <p>But in the course of a few months the importance of the struggle began to be more
                    clearly apprehended. John Eck of Ingoldstadt drew attention to the resemblance
                    between Lu the doctrines put forth in the theses and those of the <hi
                    rend="superscript">rel</hi> Hussites, and at the mention of that undoubted
                    heresy not " a few of Luther’s supporters recoiled. His conduct was * <hi
                    rend="superscript">J</hi> certainly not wanting in astuteness, however genuine
                    his enthusiasm. In 1518 he republished his theses, with additions and
                    explanations, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Solutions.</hi> Like Hutten,
                    he selected the supreme pontiff himself as the person to whom he dedicated the
                    treatise. In the letter of dedication (the letter above referred to) he
                    professes to make his unqualified submission to him whom he addresses, and at
                    the same time endeavours to exculpate himself for thus republishing the theses.
                    Notwithstanding the popular form, the vernacular language, in which they had
                    already appeared, they were still so encumbered with the technicalities of the
                    schools that he could not conceive how they could be intelligible to the laity
                    at large (“sic editae ut mihi incredibile sit eas ab omnibus intelligi ”). He
                    was therefore anxious, with the pontiff’s sanction and approval, to republish
                    them in a form less liable to misinterpretation. If, however, that sanction were
                    withheld, he could only bow to Leo’s decision as to that of God’s vicegerent on
                    earth (“vocem tuam vocem Christ! in te praesidentis et loquentis agnoscam ”).
                    While Luther was thus labouring under misapprehension, affected or real, with
                    respect to the kind of doctrinal teaching that was likely to find favour in
                    Rome, it would seem that Leo himself was very imperfectly informed regarding the
                    state of feeling in Germany. The conditions which moulded his political action
                    and his personal sympathies alike tended to distract his attention from the
                    events which had recently been occurring in Saxony. The representative of a
                    princely house, well versed in European affairs and in questions of statecraft,
                    gifted with more than an ordinary share of Italian subtlety and powers of
                    dissimulation, he was well qualified to cope with the difficulties by which he
                    found himself surrounded. But his aims, chief among which was his desire to
                    establish his brother Julian on the throne of Naples, were directed more to
                    family aggrandizement than to national unity. They ran strongly counter to the
                    growth of Spanish influence, while with that stern policy which guided the rule
                    of Ximenes, dictated by the desire to restore mediaeval doctrine and discipline
                    and to suppress heresy, he had no sympathy. The ecclesiastic was almost lost in
                    the patron of the arts, the urbane and polished scholar and voluptuary, the
                    admirer of wit and epigram. In politics it was his main purpose to trim the
                    balance between France and Spain; in church matters it was chiefly to stifle
                    controversy. So indifferent was he to German affairs, and so little cognizant of
                    the state of feeling among the people, that at the very moment when irritation
                    at the extortion of his emissaries was at its height, and the fraudulent nature
                    of that extortion had been thus ably exposed by Luther, he conceived it to be a
                    suitable time for levying a contribution throughout the empire under pretext of
                    an expedition against the Turks. The proposal roused a spirit of opposition even
                    among the clergy themselves; and one of their number, a prebendary at Würzburg,
                    issued a manifesto, in the form of a pamphlet, in which he roundly declared that
                    the true Turks were to be found in Italy. This pamphlet fell into Luther’s
                    hands, and with the instinct of genius he recognized the opportunity afforded by
                    such a state of feeling for an appeal to a wider audience than he had hitherto
                    addressed. He now took his stand as the denouncer both of abuses in the matter
                    of discipline and of the extortion and oppression under which his countrymen
                    laboured. And from that day to the day of his death he filled a ¡)lace in their
                    affection and esteem to which no other of their leaders could make pretence. The
                    turning-point in his public career is marked by his appearance at <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0344-0327"/>which he formally intimated his repudiation of the
                    decrees and canons of the church. Such a measure necessarily roused the
                    opposition of those learned bodies by whom the canon law was taught and
                    elaborated, and on 21st April 1521 the university of Paris condemned as
                    “heretical, schismatical, impious, and blasphemous” more than a hundred
                    propositions extracted from Luther’s writings; while, skilfully following up the
                    line of attack · indicated by the supreme pontiff, they enlarged upon the view
                    that Lutheranism was little more than a specious reproduction of errors long ago
                    proscribed and exploded. The university at the same time decreed that Luther’s
                    writings should be burnt; and the sentence was subsequently carried into effect
                    in most of the capitals of Europe. In London the ceremony was performed at
                    Paul’s Cross on the 12th May, and Bishop Fisher in his sermon on the occasion
                    declared that Luther by burning the decretals had made it clear that he would
                    not have hesitated to burn the pope himself had the latter been in his
                    power.</p>
                <p>The Reformation in England had, however, already commenced, and its origin must
                    be looked upon as in a great measure independent of the Lutheran movement; as in
                    Germany, it had been preceded by a kindred movement, an endeavour to bring about
                    a reform of discipline. The nation was not compelled, as in Italy, to witness
                    the corruptions of the papal court, nor were the laity equally oppressed with
                    the people of Germany by imposts and exactions of every kind. But the unsparing
                    extortion practised by Wolsey’s agents after his appointment as <hi
                    rend="italic">legatus a latere</hi> was severely resented, and appeared all the
                    more grievous when contrasted with that immunity from arbitrary taxation which
                    it was the Englishman’s special boast to inherit as his birthright; and the
                    arbitrary procedure of the ecclesiastical courts and the licentious lives of the
                    clergy were the subjects of loud and continual complaint. In the year 1514 the
                    notable case of Richard Hunne roused popular indignation to the highest pitch.
                    He had been so bold as to resist what he regarded as an unjust exaction of
                    mortuary fees, by pleading in the ecclesiastical court that the action brought
                    against him was unlawful by the Statute of Praemunire,—a plea which virtually
                    raised the whole question of benefit of clergy. Hunne was committed to the
                    Lollards’ Tower and was shortly after found dead,—murdered, as it was popularly
                    believed, by the contrivance of the chancellor of the bishop of London. The case
                    gave rise to a fierce legal controversy, in which the authority of an Act of
                    Parliament was opposed by the precedents established by a decretal of the
                    church. It was followed by the memorable trial of Dr Standish (1515), by which
                    the question of the royal supremacy was distinctly raised, and Henry himself not
                    improbably led to conceive that theory of his legitimate authority in matters
                    ecclesiastical which was afterwards attended with such important results. The
                    state of discipline among the clergy at large was but little, if any, better
                    than in Germany, and their addiction to secular pursuits and pleasures, their
                    covetousness, ambition, and licentiousness are attested not only by satirists
                    like Roy and Skelton, but by grave and temperate censors such as Dean Colet,
                    Archbishop Warham, Bishop Fisher, and Sir Thomas More, and form the subject of
                    their earnest remonstrance and appeals for reform. Wolsey himself, than whom no
                    statesman more clearly discerned the tendencies of the age, was especially
                    anxious to raise the reputation of the whole body for learning and exemplary
                    lives, and it was with this view that he founded Cardinal College (afterwards
                    Christ Church) at Oxford, and invited some of the most promising young scholars
                    at Cambridge to become instructors within its walls.</p>
                <p>It is also in connexion with the two universities that</p>

                    In the disputation at Leipsic he could go so far as to repudiate the divine
                    institution of the papacy and even pronounce against the infallibility of
                    councils. He was still further confirmed in his doctrinal divergence by the
                    influence of Melanchthon, who now began to call in question the doctrine of
                    transubstantiation; and Valla’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Donation of
                    Constantine</hi> , with which he first became acquainted in February 1520, would
                    seem to have dispelled the last vestige of doubt in his mind with respect to the
                    essential falsity of the claims of the papacy to temporal power. The contrast
                    now presented by the tone and language of his writings to that of his letter to
                    Leo, written two years before, is startling. In the month of April 1520 appeared
                    his discourse <hi rend="italic">De Libertóte Christiana,</hi> inveighing against
                    the abuses of the Curia and referring to Leo himself in terms of open irony. To
                    this succeeded in the following August his appeal, written in the vernacular
                    German, “To the Christian nobility of the German nation,” wherein he frankly
                    confesses that his reliance is upon none of the ecclesiastical orders, but upon
                    the newly-elected young emperor and the nobles; and he reiterates his demand for
                    a general council,—one that shall be really free, bound by no arbitrary canons,
                    and holding its deliberations free from papal control. This again was succeeded
                    in the ensuing October by his treatise on <hi rend="italic">The Babylonian
                    Captivity of the Church,</hi> wherein he examines, and for the most part
                    repudiates, the sacramental theories of the mediaeval church. The cause which he
                    advocated now began to assume genuinely European proportions. From Nuremberg
                    came an effective tribute from the youthful meistersánger Hans Sachs to the
                    “Wittenberg Nightingale,” one of the earliest efforts of his genius. Ulrich von
                    Hutten, at length perceiving the true character of the contest, followed up the
                    address to the German nobility by translating into the vernacular his own
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">To Germans of every Class,</hi> and owing to his
                    persuasions the powerful and chivalrous free knight Franz von Sickingen hastened
                    to declare himself an uncompromising supporter of the Lutheran movement.
                    Together they already discussed plans which included nothing less than the
                    establishment of a national church altogether independent of Rome, with the
                    archbishop of Mainz as its primate. The danger that menaced the Roman see could
                    now no longer be disguised; and in June 1520 Leo fulminated his bull of
                    excommunication against Luther. On the 8th of the following July he addressed a
                    letter to Frederick of Saxony in which he deplores that he can no longer speak
                    of Luther as a son. He feels certain that the elector will prove loyal to the
                    church, although he does not disguise the fact that he has heard of his
                    friendship for the heretical leader and that the latter relies on his support.
                    He has ordered the bull to be circulated among the nobility of Saxony, and he
                    feels equally assured that he may reckon on their assistance in extinguishing
                    this “incendiary conflagration.” As for Luther himself, he denounces him as one
                    who is seeking to revive the heresies of the Waldenses, the Hussites, and the
                    Bohemians, and who, by the manner in which he has condemned the burning of
                    heretics, has clearly shown that he sympathizes with the Turks and aims at the
                    destruction of the true church. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The bull of excommunication, along with numerous volumes of the decretals, was

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0345-0328"/>we meet with the first indications of a
                    reformation of doctrine. During the years 1511-14 Erasmus had filled the post of
                    Lady Margaret professor of divinity at Cambridge, and the publication of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Novum Instrumentum</hi> in 1516 was directly the outcome of his
                    labours during that period. Thomas Bilney, the martyr, a member of Trinity Hall
                    and one of the most eminent of the Reformers, expressly attributes his
                    conversion to the influence of Erasmus’s <hi rend="italic">New Testament.</hi>
                    Around Bilney there gathered a little band of Cambridge scholars,—Shaxton,
                    Crome, Skip, Rogers, Lambert, Heynes, Taverner, Parker, and others. It was their
                    custom to meet together at an inn known by the sign of the “White Horse.” In the
                    first instance, their attention was chiefly given to the Scriptures themselves,
                    but subsequently to the writings of Luther. The inn then began to be styled
                    “Germany” by their enemies; and such would appear to be the first commencement
                    of the Reformation in England. That commencement was illustrated by an incident
                    which not a little resembles the better-known incident associated with the
                    career of Luther. On the appearance of the papal proclamation of indulgences in
                    1517 a copy had been affixed to the gate of the common schools in the
                    university. The same night a young Norman student, of the name of Peter de
                    Valence, wrote over the proclamation a few Latin words denouncing the theory of
                    indulgences as a superstition. He was forthwith summoned to appear before the
                    vice-chancellor in order to account for his conduct, and on failing to do so was
                    formally excommunicated.</p>
                <p>In the month of January 1519 the emperor Maximilian I. died, and the imperial
                    dignity, declined by Frederick of Saxony, descended to Charles V. Of the three
                    monarchs who had aspired to this supreme honour Henry VIII. was now in his
                    twenty-ninth year, Francis I. in his twenty-sixth, and Charles V. in his
                    nineteenth. The English monarch, at this time both zealous and devout, was eager
                    to give some proof of his loyalty to the Catholic Church, and had he occupied
                    the place of Charles the career of Luther would probably have been soon
                    arrested. The great Reformer owed his safety at this critical period mainly to
                    the armed chivalry of Germany, which rallied ominously to his support. On no
                    occasion was its presence more sensibly felt than at the diet of Worms (May
                    1521). The memorable edict (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Luther),</hi> signed on the
                    same day as that on which the pope and the young emperor concluded their compact
                    for the reconquest of Milan from the French, marks the crowning triumph of the
                    policy of Leo and Alexander. But Charles, who looked upon Luther as a means of
                    bringing pressure to bear upon the pontiff which might prove useful in a future
                    emergency, was determined not to surrender the bold professor, for the present,
                    to his enemies. To Henry, who was influenced by no such secular considerations,
                    Luther’s contumacy appeared to call for authoritative rebuke in every land; and
                    in July 1521 he produced, in reply to the treatise on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Babylonian Captivity,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Defence of the Sacraments.</hi>
                    The book passed rapidly through several editions, was translated into German,
                    and, to quote the expression of Cochlseus, “filled the whole Christian world
                    with joy and admiration.” Such an effort from such a quarter called for
                    distinguished recognition. Francis was already styled the eldest son of the
                    church. The imperial dignity presupposed a not less conspicuous fidelity. The
                    titles of “Most Christian” or “Most Catholic” could not accordingly be
                    vouchsafed to the English monarch. He was therefore rewarded with the
                    newly-coined title of “Defender of the Faith.” Sir Thomas More and Bishop Fisher
                    both imitated their royal master’s example by also compiling a tractate in reply
                    to Luther; but the Reformer, in his rejoinder to the royal polemic, called its
                    author a fool and designated him the “Pharaoh of England.”</p>
                <p>The death of Leo X. in 1521 was coincident with an im- ] portant crisis in
                    Italian history. Milan had been wrested <hi rend="italic">]</hi> from the French
                    by the allied papal and imperial forces, ־ and the realization of that scheme of
                    national unity and independence for which he and his predecessor had laboured
                    seemed no longer a dream of the future. In the midst of his exultation—partly,
                    it is said, as the result of it—Leo died, and seldom in the annals of the
                    pa!&gt;acy had an election to the office been attended with equal interest and
                    excitement. Wolsey eventually was out-manoeuvred by the imperial party, and the
                    emperor’s former preceptor, the irreproachable, austere, and rigidly devout
                    Adrian (VI.) of Utrecht (1522-1523) succeeded to the papal chair. After a few
                    months’ tenure of the office he too gave place to another, and the house of
                    Medici was again represented in the person of Clement VII. (1523-1534). In this
                    election Wolsey was again a candidate, and a second time he had reason to
                    believe that he owed his defeat to the emperor, an injury which he never
                    forghve. In not a few respects Clement was admirably qualified to cope with the
                    difficulties by which he found himself surrounded. He had been at once the most
                    trusted and the ablest of Leo’s advisers; his attainments and experience were
                    such as in every way corresponded to the requirements of his office, for, while
                    well versed in philosophy and theology, he had also mastered the political and
                    ecclesiastical questions of the day, and his clear perception enabled him to
                    grasp the essential features of his policy with remarkable skill and
                    promptitude. His position, however, was one of extreme perplexity, alike in its
                    diplomatic and its theological relations. To no power had he and his house
                    rendered greater services than to Spain; ever since, indeed, the pontificate of
                    Alexander VI., the papacy had, often without designing it, been the instrument
                    of imperial aggrandizement. With the accession of Clement, however, these
                    relations are to be seen assuming a new phase. The election of Charles V. as
                    emperor awoke in the proud representative of the great house of the Medici the
                    sense of a new danger; and the prospect of Milan, Naples, and the empire being
                    concentrated in a single hand was one which no Italian potentate could be
                    expected to contemplate with equanimity. The retreat of Bourbon from Italy, on
                    the other hand, had caused the Curia to look with altered sentiments on the
                    policy of France; and if Clement’s advice and good wishes could have availed
                    aught the great disaster at Pavia would have been averted. The emperor ־was far
                    from unaware how little he had throughout been indebted to Clement’s good
                    offices, and before he led his army into Italy had been heard to avow his
                    intention of avenging himself “on that poltroon the pope.” “Some day or other,”
                    he added, “perhaps Martin Luther may become a man of worth.” The battle of Pavia
                    (February 1525) followed, and its results seemed to threaten the overthrow of
                    that balance of power which it was the aim of the chief leaders of the new
                    nationalities to maintain; both Wolsey and Clement VII. alike now regarded with
                    dismay the proportions which the power of Spain was assuming. “It is no trivial
                    question, no single state, that is concerned in the coming contest,” exclaimed
                    Clement’s minister; “this war will decide the freedom or the eternal slavery of
                    Italy.” In July 1526 the papal troops had already entered Lombardy.</p>
                <p>Such were the circumstances under which the Clementine League (22d May 1526) was
                    formed, with the general assent of the Italian states, but with the usual
                    disregard of the state of opinion north of the Alps. But it was hardly
                    reasonable to expect that Ferdinand of Austria would be solicitous to uphold the
                    papal interests in Germany when the imperial interests were being thus
                    vigorously assailed in Italy. Three months before, the sanction of the <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0346-0329"/>emperor hacl been given to the publication of
                    certain “provisions” in matters of faith which had filled the Lutheran party
                    with alarm. At Gotha and again at Torgau the Protestant leaders began to concert
                    measures for actively repelling the policy of coercion which they anticipated
                    would shortly be commenced. When, however, the diet assembled at Spires in June
                    they found their apprehensions dispelled in an unexpected manner by the
                    newly-aroused animosity towards the Roman pontiff and his policy. Never had the
                    electors shown themselves more unanimous in counsel or submitted with better
                    grace to the contributions imposed upon them. It was even proposed that the
                    recently issued provisions should be publicly burnt and the Bible adopted as the
                    only rule of faith. However, it was finally resolved that the respective states
                    should be declared to be at full liberty, in relation to all questions of belief
                    raised by the edict of Worms (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Luther),</hi> “to conduct
                    themselves as each should hereafter be ready to answer for towards God and the
                    emperor,” —terms which virtually implied permission to proceed according to
                    their own discretion. “Such an enactment,” observes Ranke, “containing as it
                    does no mention whatever of the supreme pontiff, may be looked upon as the
                    commencement of the Reformation properly so called, involving, in fact, the
                    institution of a new church in Germany.”</p>
                <p>The effects of the concurrent action of religious and national sentiment thus
                    brought about were soon to receive <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> a memorable
                    illustration in Italy. The soldiers who made their way under the leadership of
                    Frondsberg, Ferdinand’s lieutenant, across the Alps, in the snows of November
                    1526, into the plains of Lombardy, and afterwards mingled with the Spanish
                    forces which Bourbon led on to the assault on Rome, were almost entirely avowed
                    supporters of Luther’s cause and full of fierce hatred of popery. Frondsberg
                    himself loudly declared that as soon as he had taken Rome he would hang the
                    pope. The Spaniards, notwithstanding their unshaken devotion to Catholicism,
                    entered the city burning with the spirit of national antipathy, and eager to
                    revenge the long series of wrongs and exactions which their countrymen had
                    suffered at the hands of Italian ecclesiastics. Among the horrors which followed
                    upon the capture of the capital (May 1527) nothing more completely shocked the
                    sense of Latin Christendom than the savage contempt manifested by the German
                    soldiery for everything that symbolized the Roman faith, their wanton
                    destruction of relics and images, mock religious services, and especial
                    brutality in the treatment of priests. Even their Spanish confederates, though
                    equally merciless in their excesses, looked on with indignation as they saw them
                    disguising themselves as cardinals and holding a mock consistory under the
                    windows of St Angelo for the purpose of electing Luther as pope. But even the
                    impressions thus produced were evanescent when compared with the constantly
                    renewed and unavailing regret which filled the breast of the scholar and the
                    churchman in after years, as he realized the irreparable losses inflicted upon
                    art and learning, the destruction of unique manuscripts and ancient records. Nor
                    can it be a matter of surprise that a sentiment of deep revenge should have
                    arisen in Rome against the Lutheran destroyer, and that even the Swabian and the
                    Spanish invader alike should have afterwards been solicitous in a manner to
                    disguise their own responsibility, by professing to look upon the blow thus
                    struck at the sanctity and inviolability of the sacred city as a direct judgment
                    of God. For a time, though only for a few months, it was believed, even by
                    politicians so shrewd and well informed as Wolsey, that the emperor himself was
                    designing to aid the Reformation. The approach of the Turks, who had overrun
                    Hungary, and the hostility of France demonstrated the urgent necessity of
                    maintaining concord among his subjects in the empire; and it is possible that he
                    may really have contemplated placing himself at the head of the Lutheran
                    movement and keeping Clement VII. permanently a prisoner at Gaeta. But his
                    Spanish blood, his education under Adrian of Utrecht, and the traditions of the
                    imperial dignity proved too powerful a counterpoise, and Charles eventually not
                    only deigned to lay before the courts of Europe a partial explanation and
                    apology for the tragedy at Rome, but in a treaty (26th November 1527) with the
                    pontiff he entered upon an agreement for the adoption of a distinct
                    anti-Reformation policy. It has been asserted that Clement also undertook on
                    this occasion not to declare the marriage of Henry VIII. and Catherine illegal,
                    but no such stipulation appears in the existing treaty.</p>
                <p>In pursuance of his anti-imperial policy Wolsey did not fail to seek to turn to
                    the best account the sensation caused by the triumph of the imperial arms. He
                    enjoined the observance of a three days’ fast and the offering up of prayers in
                    every church in England for the captive pontiff’s deliverance. He could not,
                    however, but be conscious that his policy was regarded with but little favour by
                    the nation at large. The young emperor was highly popular among the citizens of
                    London, and the ancient amicable relations with the house of Burgundy and the
                    actual important commercial relations with Flanders combined to render Spain in
                    the eyes of Englishmen their natural ally, while France they still regarded as
                    their hereditary foe. An expedient to which he had recourse about this time only
                    served still further to fan this feeling. He had sought to render France,
                    instead of the Low Countries, the main channel of the commerce between England
                    and the Continent by making Calais the chief port for merchandise. The merchants
                    of the Hanse towns took alarm; and, as it was in their vessels that Luther’s
                    writings, which were now eagerly purchased in England, even at exorbitant
                    prices, chiefly found their way across the Channel, the preachers of the
                    Reformation found no difficulty in representing to their countrymen that an
                    Anglo-French alliance could not fail to prove inimical to the gospel. On the
                    other hand, the Catholic party both in England and in Germany, as soon as the
                    project of the divorce became noised abroad, could not but recognize in
                    Catherine the representative of the interests of the true church, while they
                    looked upon the emperor as her champion, and upon Wolsey as a traitor to the
                    cause of truth and justice. During the last five years the cardinal’s efforts to
                    reform the clergy and repress the Reformation in England had been strenuous and
                    constant. In the year 1521 he had enjoined all the bishops “to take order that
                    any books, written or printed, of Martin Luther’s heresies and errors should be
                    brought in to the bishop of each diocese.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Cambridge continued, however, to progress, and in 1523 some of the bishops
                    suggested the appointment of a visitation to the university “for trying who were
                    the fautors of heresy there.” This proposition was not acted upon by Wolsey, who
                    probably in his heart sympathized with the genuine spirit of learning developing
                    in the university, and the matter was subsequently made the ground of an
                    accusation against him by his enemies. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    We find, accordingly, George Stafford, a member of Pembroke Hall, venturing in
                    the following year to adopt the example set by Luther, of taking the Scriptures
                    themselves, instead of the <hi rend="italic">Sentences</hi> of Peter Lombard
                    (the theological textbook of the universities), as the basis of a course of
                    divinity lectures. In the following year William Tyndal published at Antwerp the
                    first edition of his translation <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n347/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0347-0330"/>of the New Testament, and in 1526 we hear of its
                    introduction into Oxford by Thomas Garret, and of the volume being burnt at
                    Paul’s Cross. On 27th November 1527 Bilney and Arthur were examined at the
                    Chapter House at Westminster before Wolsey and other ecclesiastics, as to
                    whether they had preached or taught to the people the opinions of Luther or any
                    others condemned by the church. Owing to the proximity of Cambridge to the
                    seaports and commercial towns of the eastern counties, such as Yarmouth,
                    Harwich, and Norwich, the university would appear to have become familiarized
                    with the Lutheran doctrines much sooner than Oxford. From 3d July to 20th
                    September 1527 Wolsey was in France, intent on bringing about the marriage of
                    Princess Mary with the duke of Orleans, and on gaining the support of Francis in
                    the matter of the royal divorce.</p>
                <p>Henry himself had at this time fully resolved to carry the latter project into
                    effect, and the doubts raised with respect to the validity of his marriage and
                    the legitimacy of Mary cannot be regarded as anything more than official
                    formalities, designed to give a veil of decency to his real purpose. While in
                    France Wolsey learned from Flanders that the emperor had become apprised of
                    Henry’s real intentions, and he himself now proceeded (to quote his own words)
                    to employ “all possible ways and practices for the obtaining of the pope’s
                    consent.” Unfortunately for the success of his efforts, Henry at this juncture
                    conceived the design of sending another agent to Home, to act altogether
                    independently of Wolsey, and charged to procure, not only the appointment of a
                    commission empowered to dissolve the marriage with Catherine, but also a
                    dispensation removing all obstacles to the king’s second marriage with Anne
                    Boleyn. Clement was still a prisoner in the castle of St Angelo, but on the
                    evening of the 9th December 1527, disguised in a blouse and carrying a basket
                    and an empty sack on his back, he effected his escape, and with the assistance
                    of a guide arrived the next morning at Orvieto. From that day his resolve was
                    probably definitively taken, and, notwithstanding his previous promises and his
                    subsequent apparent concessions, he would seem to have been firmly resolved not
                    to grant his consent to a measure deeply humiliating to himself and certain to
                    expose him to the full brunt of the emperor’s resentment. But at Orvieto Henry’s
                    delegate, Knight, although untrained and ill qualified for the task of a
                    diplomatist, obtained both a commission and a dispensation, which, however, on
                    his reaching England, were both found to be worthless, owing to designed
                    non-observance of the necessary technicalities. In the following year Foxe and
                    Gardiner were despatched on a like errand. The latter was far better suited for
                    the work than Knight; and he did not scruple to threaten the trembling pontiff
                    with the complete withdrawal of Henry’s support, and to predict as the
                    inevitable consequence the collapse of the already tottering apostolic see,—a
                    result which, he declared, “would be attended by the applause and satisfaction
                    of the whole world.” By such menaces Clement was eventually induced again to
                    grant a commission and a dispensation. A decretal bull, formally annulling
                    Henry’s first marriage, was handed to Campeggio, which he was instructed to show
                    to the king and then to destroy. But in the meantime the celebrated brief
                    executed by Julius IL, in which the dispensation for Henry’s first marriage was
                    re-enacted in more precise and unqualified terms, was discovered in the Spanish
                    archives. It was sought to show that the brief was a forgery, but to this view
                    of the matter Clement altogether refused to assent. At length, however, in May
                    1529 the legate proceeded to open his court at Westminster. The courageous
                    conduct of Catherine put honourable men to shame; and no slight impression was
                    produced by Bishop Fisher’s heroic declaration of his willingness to stake his
                    life that her marriage with the king was perfectly valid. Campeggio, under
                    various pretexts, still hesitated and delayed. In July the news of the peace of
                    Cambray arrived, and it was known that the influence of the emperor would
                    henceforth be paramount in Italy, while it was believed that the projected
                    marriage between the French monarch and the sister of the emperor augured a
                    durable peace between the empire and France. Then the legate adjourned the court
                    and the pontiff revoked the cause to Borne. All around Wolsey saw the plans
                    which he had laid with so much toil and skill breaking up, and on him the royal
                    displeasure vented itself. He died 30tli November 1530, a victim to the wanton
                    caprice of one whom he had served only too faithfully, and with him the ablest
                    supporter of papal influence and the most formidable opponent of Beformation
                    principles in England disappeared.</p>
                <p>Henry would not condescend׳ to appear before a Boman court, and as a last
                    expedient it was proposed that the question of the legality of his first
                    marriage should be submitted to the learned bodies, the universities and eminent
                    canonists of Europe. This scheme had already been recommended by the episcopal
                    bench, but to Cranmer’s ingenuity is attributed the further suggestion that the
                    opinion thus obtained should be carried into effect by a court convened in
                    England. Commissioners, among whom Bichard Croke appears as the most conspicuous
                    and indefatigable, were accordingly despatched on the proposed errand. The means
                    to which they had recourse in order to obtain opinions such as their royal
                    employer desired are plainly described by a contemporary writer, who says that
                    “there was inestimable sums of money given to the famous clerks to choke them,
                    and in especial to such as had the governance and custody of their universities’
                    seals.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cavendish, <hi

                    </p></note> The unpopularity of the divorce among the nation at large was
                    especially shown at the two universities, where the junior members made
                    demonstrations of the greatest dissatisfaction, while their seniors were mostly
                    bribed or intimidated into acquiescence by the royal agents; nor could the
                    authorities at either Oxford or Cambridge disguise the fact that they found
                    themselves at variance with the feeling of the country at large.</p>
                <p>It is at this juncture that Cranmer assumes a foremost C place as a leader of the
                    English Beformation. He had written in defence of the divorce, and had taken a
                    part in embassies sent by Henry to treat on the question with the emperor and
                    the pope; and Clement had shown his sense of the value of his influence by
                    appointing him to the lucrative post of grand penitentiary for England, in the
                    hope of winning him over to the papal interests. Cranmer’s whole policy,
                    however, had been directly opposed to that of Wolsey. He had used his best
                    efforts to confirm the commercial relations with the Netherlands, and had
                    superintended the negotiation of a commercial treaty between that country and
                    England. He had resided for some months in Germany, and while there had married
                    Margaret, the daughter of Andrew Osiander, a distinguished preacher and leader
                    of the Lutheran party at Nuremberg. From Germany he was now summoned back to
                    England to become the successor of Warham, the primate, who had died in August
                    1532. As there had as yet been no formal rupture with the see of Borne, it
                    became necessary for him to apply to Clement for the customary bull of
                    consecration, and also for his pallium as metro<pb break="no"

                    requisite that he should take the oaths of canonical obedience and subjection to
                    the Roman pontiff. His conduct in this dilemma has been generally regarded as
                    indefensible. In order to show that he disclaimed the right of the pontiff to
                    nominate to ecclesiastical offices in England, he surrendered the several bulls,
                    eleven in number, into Henry’s hands; and, having done this, he took the usual
                    oath of obedience to the see of Rome. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It should, however, be noted that Cranmer’s oath as
                    metropolitan contained the clause “salvo ordine meo,” and this clause might
                    probably, in the judgment of canonists, render his subsequent reservation more
                    defensible. See <hi rend="italic">Sarum Pontifical</hi> in Camb. Univ. Lib. (Mm.

                    doing so, however, he made a protestation to the effect that he did not intend
                    thereby to bind himself to do anything contrary to the laws of God, the king’s
                    prerogative, or the commonwealth and statutes of the kingdom. On 23d May 1533 he
                    proceeded, as archbishop and legate of the apostolic see, to pronounce the
                    king’s marriage with Catherine of Aragon null and void <hi rend="italic">ab
                    initio,</hi> as contrary to the divine law; and five days later he gave judicial
                    confirmation to the royal marriage with Anne Boleyn. In the following year (23d
                    March 1534) Clement rejoined by a manifesto declaring the validity of the first
                    marriage, and calling upon Henry to take back his first wife and to observe “a
                    perpetual silence” in relation to the question for the future. <note

                    the Reformation,</hi> ii. 532. </p></note> This decisive step was mainly the
                    result of the parliamentary action that had in the meantime been going on. The
                    parliament of 1529 had in various ways limited the privileges of the clergy, and
                    by the Act 21 Hen. VIII. c. 13 had deprived them of the power of holding
                    pluralities by virtue of licences obtained from Rome for money. Fisher, from his
                    place in the House of Lords, vainly sought to combat these reforms by declaring
                    that Lutheranism ·was spreading in the nation and by reminding his audience of
                    Germany and Bohemia and the miseries that had already befallen those countries.
                    The allusion to the Lutheran movement appears to have been, indeed, singularly
                    injudicious, and there can be no doubt that at this period it was the aim not
                    only of the king but of the bishops to dissociate the Reformation movement in
                    England from the movement that was in progress in Germany. As yet the
                    repudiation of the papal supremacy and a reform in matters of discipline were
                    all that was contemplated either by the crown or the parliament. In 1531
                    appeared a proclamation making it penal to introduce bulls from Rome, and this
                    was shortly followed by an Act visiting with severe penalties all who should be
                    found going about the country for the purpose of carrying on the sale of
                    indulgences; while under the famous Statute of Praemunire the whole body of the
                    clergy were convicted of having recognized the validity of Wolsey’s acts as
                    papal legate, and thereby placed both their liberties and their possessions at
                    the mercy of the king. In April 1533 there followed the Act providing that all
                    causes should henceforth be tried in the courts of the kingdom, and forbidding
                    appeals to Rome under any circumstances whatever,—the body “now being usually
                    called the English Church” being held “sufficient and meet of itself to declare
                    and determine all such doubts and duties as to their rooms <hi rend="italic"
                    >\i.e.,</hi> offices] spiritual doth appertain.” These successive enactments had
                    already paved the way for Henry’s final rejoinder to Clement’s demands,—the Act
                    of Supremacy (November 1534), whereby the king was not only declared to be
                    supreme head of the Church of England, but was at the same time invested with
                    full power “to repress and amend all such errors and heresies as, by any manner
                    of spiritual jurisdiction, might and ought to be lawfully reformed.”</p>
                <p>While such was the progress of events in England and in Germany there had been
                    going on in Switzerland a corresponding movement, second only in importance to
                    that, initiated by Luther. The political relations of the Swiss ' confederation
                    at this period exercised a very appreciable influence over the whole course of
                    the Reformation. With the commencement of the century the cantons had already
                    reached the number of thirteen; and the confederates, in combination with the
                    Leaguers, represented Italian as well as German interests. In great crises they
                    were not incapable of presenting a combined front to the common foe; but more
                    generally they were divided by political jealousies and differences, while the
                    majority of the men in each canton were mere military adventurers, ready to
                    serve under the banner of the empire, France, the pope, or the duke of Milan,
                    according as the one or the other power seemed likely best to reward their
                    services. An important change in the ecclesiastical relations of the cantons had
                    recently brought them into closer connexion with Rome. The six bishoprics into
                    which Switzerland was divided—Lausanne, Sion (Sitten), Como, Basel, Chur, and
                    Constance—had formerly been severally subject to the metropolitan jurisdiction
                    of Mainz, Besançon, and Milan. But this jurisdiction had been superseded by the
                    creation of the nunciatures, whereby each bishopric was brought into direct
                    connexion with the papal see. The nuncios often exercised a potent influence on
                    the political relations of the confederates. They negotiated with large bodies
                    of Switzers the conditions of military service under the pope; they directed the
                    traffic in indulgences; and they watched with especial jealousy the first
                    appearance of schism. The experience, however, of those of the confederates who
                    accepted military service in Italy did not serve to increase their reverence for
                    the Curia and its aims. They carried back with them to their homes a contempt
                    for the whole administration of the Roman see and its dependencies which
                    communicated itself to their countrymen, and at no centres were opinions adverse
                    to Catholicism now spreading more rapidly than at Zurich, Bern, and Basel.</p>
                <p>Born in the same year as his brother Reformer, Ulrich Zwingli was scarcely less
                    distinguished by commanding powers, devotion to study, and a yet more notable
                    devotion to truth; but in the enlightened tolerance which marked his whole
                    career we recognize the contrast between his early associations and those which
                    nurtured the somewhat narrow though fervid patriotism of Luther. The latter, in
                    the retirement of his monastic cell, had pondered over the profound speculations
                    of Augustine, the imaginative subtleties of De Lyra, and the mysticism of
                    Tauler. The other, at the universities of Vienna and Basel, had become
                    familiarized with classic models, and his genius had gained a brighter
                    inspiration from converse with the masterpieces of antiquity. It was in
                    connexion with the church at Glarus that Zwingli first assumed the discharge of
                    pastoral duties. It was characteristic of his true and discerning patriotic
                    feeling that he strongly disapproved of the acceptance of mercenary service by
                    his countrymen, and more especially of the service of France, and his outspoken
                    sentiments on the subject eventually rendered it necessary for him to quit
                    Glarus for Einsiedeln. Here he was for a short time in receipt of a pension from
                    the pope and was generally regarded as a supporter of Catholic institutions. In
                    conjunction with the abbot of Einsiedeln he aimed, however, at the development
                    of a less superstitious spirit among both the clergy and the laity, who resorted
                    in great numbers to the monastery (a noted centre for pilgrimages). It was here
                    that he formed the acquaintance of one of the most eminent of the Reformers,
                    Oswald Geisshàusler (better known as Myconius),</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n349/mode/1up"

                <p>and through his friend’s influence received in 1518 an invitation to settle in
                    Zurich as the parish priest of the cathedral in that city. Here he at once began
                    to discard the traditional mode of exposition which limited the preacher to
                    certain prescribed sections of the Bible, and commenced instead a connected
                    series of lectures on the New Testament. In the course of four years he thus
                    completed a course of sermons on the whole of that portion of the Bible. This
                    innovation, peculiar to the Reformed Church, was never adopted by Luther,
                    although followed by most of the theologians of Switzerland and the upper
                    Rhineland. It was in the year 1519 that Zwingli first became acquainted with
                    Luther’s early treatises; but his own views appear to have been formed quite
                    independently of these. Shortly after his arrival in Zurich the Franciscan
                    Bernardin Samson visited the city on a like mission to that of Tetzel and
                    encountered in Zwingli another Luther. The grossness of the system of
                    indulgences was so ably exposed by Zwingli that he carried nearly all who heard
                    him with him, and Samson was obliged to return to Italy before his mission ·was
                    fully accomplished. Even Faber, afterwards the opponent of Zwingli, could not
                    but express to the latter his satisfaction at the result. Gradually the voice of
                    the Reformer was heard uplifted against other mediaeval superstitions and
                    especially against Mari-olatry; his fame as a preacher rapidly spread, and he
                    became known as one of the chief leaders of opinion in Zurich. The state of
                    morality in the city was, however, exceedingly low, and he not only had to
                    encounter considerable opposition but was repeatedly exposed to charges of
                    heresy. Nevertheless the conviction which he produced among the more influential
                    citizens of the truth of the tenets which he advocated was such that in the year
                    1520 an order was issued by the city council to the effect that all ministers
                    should in future ground their discourses on the New Testament, “and prove their
                    doctrine from the Bible alone, discarding all innovations and human inventions.”
                    While meeting with opposition in one direction, he was compelled himself to
                    oppose the zeal of fanaticism in another. As at Wittenberg, an iconoclastic
                    spirit had begun to manifest itself, and the question of the lawfulness of
                    images in churches was warmly debated. In the months of January and October 1523
                    two conferences of the clergy and laity assembled in Zurich, in the course of
                    which Zwingli put forth sixty-seven propositions, involving conclusions adverse
                    to the teaching and practice of the mediaeval church. Among those who took part
                    in the discussions were Faber, Meyer of Bern, Hofmeister, and Conrad Schmidt of
                    Kiissnacht, Knight Commander of the Order of St John, a man of eminent character
                    and ability. Schmidt endeavoured, although in a temperate and rational manner,
                    to defend the custom of placing images in the churches, but after a warm
                    discussion Zwingli ultimately decided for their abolition. In the yet more
                    important discussion that followed, with respect to the true nature and
                    significance of the mass, whether it was to be regarded as of the nature of a
                    sacrifice or simply as a commemorative ordinance, he expressed himself in favour
                    of the latter interpretation. The issues raised by the sixty-seven propositions
                    extended considerably in their scope beyond all that Luther had as yet advanced;
                    and, as at Leipsic, it was soon discovered that the two contending parties were
                    divided by an insuperable difference with respect to the authority which they
                    were disposed to accept as final,—the one party grounding their arguments solely
                    on the Scriptures, the other on the councils and the fathers. It may be noted,
                    as an illustration of the extremely low status of the inferior clergy of the
                    country at this period, that, in replying to Zwingli’s demand for an intelligent
                    and systematic study of the Scriptures by all pastors, it was urged as an
                    objection that many pastors might be unable to afford to pui’chase a copy of the
                    Bible for their own use! Another notable theory supported by Zwingli was that
                    known at a later period as Erastianism, according to which the authorities of
                    the church were to be held to be ultimately amenable to the jurisdiction of the
                    civil power. At his instance the church at Zurich next proceeded to repudiate
                    the control both of the bishop of Constance and of the papal nuncio,
                    constituting itself (1524) a separate ecclesiastical body, the supreme authority
                    over which was vested in the magistrates of the city. In the public services the
                    Latin liturgy and the Gregorian chant were set aside for a German prayer-book
                    and German singing. The rite of baptism was made more simple,—the ceremony of
                    exorcism on which the Lutheran Church continued long after to insist being
                    altogether discarded. In the year 1525 Zwingli published a more systematic
                    exposition of his tenets in his best-known work, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentary on True and, False Religion</hi> , which he dedicated to Francis I.
                    His conception of the sacraments and of original sin as here unfolded separates
                    him still further from the doctrine of the mediaeval church, while in his
                    remarkable catholicity of belief in regard to salvation he much resembles some
                    of the early Greek fathers. Like Clement and Origen, he believed in the final
                    happiness of the good and wise, including the good and wise of pagan antiquity;
                    nor did he hesitate to express his conviction that Socrates was a better and
                    wiser man than any Dominican or Franciscan of his own day. On the other hand, he
                    upheld the doctrine of predestination in its most rigid form, that afterwards
                    known as “supralapsarian” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Predestination).</hi></p>
                <p>In no country was the Reformation so closely associated with political feeling as
                    in Switzerland; and its upholders, ’ amid surrounding despotisms, were advocates
                    of republican institutions. Zwingli and his followers looked on with shame and
                    sorrow as they saw their countrymen hastening to cross the Alps to become the
                    mercenaries of the pope. With no less sense of humiliation did they regard the
                    venal spirit of their public officials stooping to become the pensioners of the
                    French court. The progress of these new opinions ־was, as is usually the case,
                    much more rapid in the large towns than in the more rural and mountainous
                    regions. At Bern they were ably upheld by Anslielm, the historiographer of the
                    city, and by Sebastian Meyer, and Haller; in the free city of Basel he had for
                    his followers GScolampadius and William Farel; and already in 1527 Conrad
                    Pellicanus, afterwards his zealous follower, had conceived that admiration of
                    his character and tenets which was attended by such important results.
                    Wyttenbach, Zwingli’s former preceptor, sustained his teaching in Biel, Joachim
                    von Watt in St Gall, Biirgli, Blasius, and Dorfmann among the Grisons. In the
                    cantons of Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, Lucerne, and Zug, on the other hand, the
                    new doctrines found strenuous opposition; and the simple mountaineers listened
                    with unfeigned sorrow and indignation when they heard that it was proposed to
                    abolish pilgrimages, such as those to the field of Morgarten and the chapel of
                    Tell, and to dispense with those priestly virtues of celibacy and fasting which
                    so greatly enhanced their filial reverence for their village pastor. Another and
                    yet more serious obstacle, which ׳ threatened to place the wJiole movement in
                    peril, was that presented by the differences of belief which now began to' rise
                    among the Protestants themselves. Foremost among these points of difference was
                    that respecting the Eucharist, —the theory which Zwingli maintained being
                    assailed with peculiar acrimony and vehemence by Luther. Political feeling added
                    not a little to the animosity of that attack. Difficult as it may seem to
                    associate the efforts of one who did so much for intellectual freedom with
                    tyranny and <pb break="no"

                    after the year 1523 was not favourable to the political liberties of his
                    countrymen. In that year both Sickingen and Hutten were removed by death, the
                    victims of a policy to which Luther was always strenuously opposed,—the
                    endeavour to enforce the redress of political and ecclesiastical grievances by
                    recourse to arms. The iconoclastic ardour of Karlstadt and the fanaticism of
                    Miinzer alarmed him beyond measure, and he regarded with the most genuine
                    distrust the spread of their influence among the peasantry. The sequel justified
                    his alarm. Ground between the exactions of the agents of the church on the one
                    hand and the oppression of the nobles on the other, the peasants rose at last in
                    fierce rebellion. No such insurrection, so widespread, so sanguinary, and so
                    ruthless in its vengeance, had ever before disquieted Germany as that which
                    marked the close of the year 1524. The part played by Luther in relation to that
                    gloomy episode will always be a matter for dispute among critics of different
                    schools. To some he appears as lending his great influence to crush the efforts
                    of down-trodden classes driven to desperation by intolerable oppression, to
                    others as the champion of law and order against lawless miscreants intent on
                    revolutionizing both church and state. Luther himself considered that loyalty to
                    the emperor and to the civil authority was a primary duty, and that questions of
                    religious reform should never be suffered to affect the citizen’s fidelity to
                    his political obligations. He probably held that his views were justified by the
                    sequel; but they were not shared by Ulrich von Hutten nor by Zwingli, who both
                    maintained that the popedom and the empire were too closely associated to make
                    it possible to attack the one without also attacking the other. <note

                    >Deutsche Geschichte,</hi> iv. 107. </p></note> The sacramental controversy runs
                    parallel with the history of the Peasants’ War, and it unfortunately happened
                    that the theory of the Eucharist maintained by Zwingli was the same as that
                    upheld by Karlstadt, whose iconoclastic successes at Wittenberg had made him an
                    object of especial dislike to Luther. It was in vain, therefore, that
                    CEcolampadius and Martin Bucer sought to mediate between the two parties.
                    Luther, to whose view the republican doctrines and the sacramental theory
                    advocated by Zwingli appeared closely associated, believed he saw in the latter
                    only a second Karlstadt; and he was thus led to assail him and his followers
                    with an amount of coarse ridicule altogether unbecoming both the subject and the
                    occasion. Zwingli replied in much more temperate fashion, but he did not
                    hesitate to assert that the doctrine which Luther maintained was identical with
                    that taught by the Church of Home. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >Bekenntniss vom Abendmahl Christi(</hi> 1528). This pamphlet warfare only
                    served, however, to embitter the relations of the two parties; and, although the
                    reactionary sentiments evinced by several of the princes at the second diet of
                    Spires (15th March 1529) gave significant warning of the necessity for union and
                    concord among the whole body of the Reformers, it was distinctly foreseen that
                    the conference convened at Marburg a month later was not likely to lead to any
                    healing of the schism <hi rend="smallcaps">(Luther).</hi> The excellent
                    intentions of the landgrave of Hesse in convening the conference were altogether
                    frustrated. The moral effect was, however, distinctly favourable to Zwingli. His
                    demeanour towards his opponent had throughout been conciliatory and fraternal,
                    while that of Luther had been of a different character. Although fourteen
                    articles, embracing the most important tenets of the Christian faith, had been
                    agreed upon almost without discussion, he could not regard as a brother the man
                    who differed from him on the obscure and doubtful doctrine embodied in the
                    fifteenth article. This intolerance, a sinister omen for the future of the
                    Reformation movement, produced an unfavourable impression on the minds of not a
                    few with respect to Luther’s moderation, and caused them subsequently to
                    espouse. the side of Zwingli, among their number being the landgrave Philip and
                    Francis Lambert. The former, indeed, did not altogether despair of yet bringing
                    about an alliance between the two parties, and was especially desirous of
                    prevailing upon the Evangelical party (as the Lutherans now began to be called)
                    to admit the congregations at Ulm and Strasburg into their communion. With this
                    design he caused the congress of Schmalkald to be convened on the 29th of
                    November, an earlier date than that originally intended. His friendly purpose
                    was, however, again frustrated; and it soon became evident that the elements of
                    difference between Luther and Zwingli— the reluctance of the former to engage in
                    any line of action which might involve an appeal to arms, and the patriotic
                    spirit of the other, which led him to look upon the assertion of political
                    freedom as itself a Christian duty which it would be moral cowardice to
                    evade—were such as it was hopeless to compose.</p>
                <p>Such were the circumstances under which the emperor, temporarily freed from
                    graver political anxieties by the treaty of Cambray, convened the diet of
                    Augsburg; and on the 25tli June 1530 the able and generally temperate exposition
                    of the Protestant faith drawn up by Melanchthon, known as the Confession of
                    Augsburg, was read before the assembly and the people. The Catholic reply,
                    composed by Eck and other theologians, was then presented, and finally the
                    Reformers were called upon to renounce their distinctive tenets and return to
                    their ancient faith. They were at the same time required to arrive at a formal
                    decision within a stated period; and on the 13th of August the Evangelical
                    princes notified to the emperor their inability to comply with his command. On
                    the 29th of the following March, at a third congress, convened at Schmalkald,
                    they formed themselves into the memorable League, whereby each party to the
                    compact pledged himself to the following agreement: “As soon as any one of them
                    should be attacked for the gospel’s sake, or on account of any matter resulting
                    from adherence to the gospel, all should at once proceed to the rescue of the
                    party thus assailed, and aid him to the utmost of their ability.” It was
                    likewise resolved steadfastly to oppose the assembling of any council which was
                    not summoned independently of the pope or was not in its composition fairly
                    representative of the whole church. In the meantime the efforts made further to
                    define doctrine had been attended with the usual, it might be said the
                    inevitable, results. The tenth article of the Augsburg Confession had been
                    rigorously formulated so as not merely to exclude the Zwinglian theory of the
                    Lord’s Supper but also to involve in censure any interpretation that deviated,
                    however slightly, from that laid down by Luther himself. A certain section of
                    the Evangelicals declined, accordingly, to sign the Confession, and the four
                    cities of Strasburg, Constance, Mem-mingen, and Lindau shortly after drew up and
                    submitted to the diet another confession, known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessio Tetrapolitana</hi> ,—the composition mainly of Bucer and Hedio. In
                    this the influence of the Zwinglian party so far prevailed that the adoration of
                    images, a point on which the Augsburg Confession had been silent, was
                    specifically condemned. The four cities were, however, admitted to the League of
                    Schmalkald in 1531. Other circumstances temporarily strengthened the hands of
                    the Leaguers. The emperor had formed the design of raising his brother

                    Protestant League. Treaties were about the same time made with France and
                    Denmark, and it was evident that the new confederation would be able to oppose a
                    resistance which even the resources of the empire might not be able to overcome.
                    At this juncture another circumstance formed an appreciable element in the
                    imperial calculations. All attempts at arriving at an understanding with the
                    Turks had proved without result, and Solyman’s invasion of Hungary was imminent.
                    At the advice of his brother, Charles accordingly condescended to treat with the
                    members of the League, and in July 1532 the religious peace of Nuremberg
                    afforded a temporary compromise, which it was provided should remain in force
                    until a general council, of the character demanded by the Lutherans, was
                    convened, or until the assembling of a new diet of the states of the empire. In
                    the meantime the Lutherans were to be free from molestation and to be permitted
                    to preach and publish the doctrines of the Confession of Augsburg. They were
                    also to be left in possession of such church property as they still retained,
                    and the jurisdiction of the courts of the empire in ecclesiastical questions was
                    to be suspended. In return for these concessions the Leaguers pledged themselves
                    to be loyal to the emperor, and to render aid both with money and men in the
                    event of an invasion by the Turks. They likewise undertook not to afford
                    protection either to the Anabaptists or to the followers of Zwingli.</p>
                <p>t The great leader of the Reformation in Switzerland was *־׳ at this time no
                    more. In the year 1531 the feud between ' the Catholic and Protestant cantons
                    had reached a climax; in the former the more bigoted section, aided by Ferdinand
                    of Austria, had commenced an active persecution, and some of the Protestant
                    preachers had been put to death,. In order to repel these aggressions a league
                    was formed between Zurich, Strasburg, and the landgrave of Hesse, and Zwingli
                    strongly advised that a combined attack should forthwith be made on their
                    opponents in Lucerne and Schwyz, and freedom of conscience obtained by an armed
                    demonstration. Divided counsels, however, prevailed; and eventually Zurich was
                    left to bear the brunt of the contest almost entirely alone. At the battle of
                    Cappel (11th October 1531) Zwingli fell, and his followers sustained a defeat
                    which, although they carried on a war of fierce retaliation, they were unable to
                    retrieve, and a decided reaction in favour of Catholicism now set in. The death
                    of (Ecolampadius took place soon after the battle of Cappel, and was followed in
                    1535 by that of Francis Kolb, the Bernese Reformer. The heroic end of Zwingli
                    was a matter of exultation not only to his Catholic antagonists but even to
                    Luther, who was ungenerous enough to class his brother Reformer with lawless
                    fanatics like Miinzer, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    in the following year even went so far as to warn Duke Albert of Prussia not to
                    tolerate the followers of Zwingli within his territories. <note anchored="true"

                    the other hand, the Reformation con-'־ tinued to progress. In 1533 Philip of
                    Hesse, w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ho was subsidized by France, inflicted a
                    severe defeat on Ferdinand, and was able shortly after to reinstate Ulrich, duke
                    of Wiirtemberg, in his dominions. The emperor at the peace of Kadan (29th June
                    1534) undertook to abstain from further interference in the ecclesiastical
                    affairs of the duchy, and the understanding arrived at on that occasion is
                    regarded by Ranke as marking the second important stage in the history of the
                    Reformation in Germany. The Reformed faith was forthwith established throughout
                    Wiirt-emberg, and soon after was introduced into Holstein, Pomerania, the Mark
                    of Brandenburg, Upper Saxony,</p>
                <p>Brunswick, and the Palatinate. The League of Schmal-kald was thus strengthened by
                    numerous and powerful accessions; among the number was King Francis himself,
                    who, although he was repressing the Reformation movement with severity in his
                    own dominions, saw liis advantage in siding with the Protestant princes against
                    his chief enemy, the emperor. Henry VIII. declared himself also a supporter of
                    the League. The city of Basel had already in 1534 put forth, independently, a
                    new confession of faith, and this was followed in 1536 by a second, which
                    received the approval of Luther and became known as the “first Helvetic
                    confession.” In order, however, still further to unite the Protestant party,
                    with a view to a general council, Luther, in conjunction with other theologians
                    from Saxony, Sw <hi rend="superscript">T</hi> abia, and Hesse, drew up and
                    transmitted to the Lutheran representatives at Schmalkald in February 1537
                    another confession. In this the doctrines contained in the Confession of
                    Augsburg were reiterated, but in a far more uncompromising form. Luther
                    denounced the pope as Antichrist and the mass as an abomination. Melanchthon
                    declared himself unable to concur in this language, and in an additional article
                    expressed his readiness to yield submission to the bishop of Rome as the highest
                    dignitary in the church so soon as the latter should sanction really scriptural
                    teaching.</p>
                <p>As elsewhere, the history of the Reformation in France is that of a twofold
                    struggle,—an endeavour to bring about a reform of discipline, and a contest
                    which pointed in the direction of doctrinal change. The abuses that prevailed in
                    the Gallican Church at this period were scarcely less glaring than those in
                    Germany. The appointments to the higher benefices were dictated solely by the
                    most sordid motives,—political ambition, court favouritism, and family interest.
                    Pluralism largely prevailed; and both bishoprics and abbeys were granted <hi
                    rend="italic">in commendam</hi> to such an extent that residence was almost
                    unknown. Preferments were often bestowed upon laymen, and even upon females and
                    children. Pierre de l’Estoile, writing of the middle of the 16th century, states
                    that the majority of the benefices in France were then held by persons who were
                    by the canon law disqualified for their office. But in no country was the
                    movement, that aimed at the correction of abuses such as these, more completely
                    dissociated from the religious revolution contemplated by the Protestant
                    leaders. In the first instance, the doctrines of Luther were favourably regarded
                    by many of the nobility and of the episcopal order. The leader of the party
                    which represented those doctrines was Lefèvre d’Étaples, whose translation of
                    the New Testament into French appeared in the year 1522. In the year 1521,
                    having been singled out by the Sorbonne for special attack as a teacher of the
                    tenets which the university had just so emphatically condemned, he deemed it
                    prudent, notwithstanding the encouragement he received from Francis, to retire
                    to Meaux. Here, under the protection of Briçonnet, the eminent bishop of that
                    diocese, he became the guiding genius of a movement which at one time seemed
                    likely to transform Meaux into a second Wittenberg. This activity, however, was
                    very early checked by the terrors of a commission. Lefèvre and his disciple
                    Farel fled to Strasburg, the latter subsequently to Geneva, where his efforts
                    founded the famous school of theology associated with the name of Calvin (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Calvin);</hi> Briçonnet, alarmed at the prospect of a
                    schism which threatened to prove permanent, reverted to Catholicism, and even
                    acquiesced in a policy of persecution in his own diocese. Both Francis I. and
                    his sister;Margaret, queen of Navarre, were at this time disposed to support the
                    Reformation. When the Sorbonne condemned the <hi rend="italic">Colloquies</hi>
                    of Erasmus (May 1526) Francis gave orders that 24,000 copies should be printed
                    and circulated throughout <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n352/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0352-0335"/>the country; he accepted with expressions of
                    favour the dedication to himself by Zwingli of the latter’s treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">On True and False Religion.</hi> His sister corresponded with
                    Melanchthon and was openly assailed by the Sorbonne as a favourer of heresy,
                    while, as the mother of Jeanne d’Albret, her memory was always cherished with
                    peculiar regard by the great Huguenot party. But the loss of prestige which
                    Francis incurred by his defeat at Pavia and his subsequent captivity inspired
                    the Ultramontane party with greater confidence, and, in spite of his efforts,
                    Louis de Berquin, a leader of the Reformers and one of the most eminent scholars
                    in France, perished at the stake in 1529. The policy of Francis was indeed
                    mainly dictated by one dominant motive—that of personal hostility to the
                    emperor—and the apparent caprice with which he treated the Reformers was the
                    result to no small extent of this feeling. It now became his aim to conciliate
                    Pope Clement as an ally against his great rival, and with this view he took
                    advantage of certain excesses committed by a few fanatics, after the example of
                    Miinzer, to light the fires of persecution. At the same time, therefore, that he
                    was supporting the League of Schmalkald he was burning heretics in his own
                    dominions. On the death of Clement (September 1534), when he found the hopes
                    which he had founded on an alliance with the Medici extinguished, since Paul
                    III. proved less amenable to his plans, he again changed his tactics: he invited
                    Melanchthon to come and take up his residence in France, and he set at liberty
                    those who had been imprisoned for holding the Reformed doctrines. At the peace
                    of Crespy (1544), again, he once more changed his policy, and sought to arrive
                    at an agreement with Charles for the suppression of heresy and the restoration
                    of discipline in the church.</p>
                <p>At the period at which we have now arrived the main influences which guided the
                    later history of the Reformation may be discerned in full activity. Largely
                    political almost from the commencement of the movement, they continued more and
                    more to partake of that character or became mingled with elements not less
                    secular. Foremost among these latter must be placed the appeal made to baser
                    motives both in Germany and in England, by the manner in which the nobility of
                    both countries were bribed to acquiesce in the suppression of the religious
                    orders, by being allowed to become large sharers in the property and revenues of
                    the monastic and conventual foundations. Among the lower classes, on the other
                    hand, who were often painfully reminded of the loss they had sustained in the
                    withdrawal of that charity which, amid all the degeneracy of the monasteries,
                    had still been one of their recognized functions, a certain genuine sympathy
                    with Catholicism and traditional regard for its institutions long continued to
                    survive. But even among these classes men could not but be conscious that a
                    higher standard of belief and practice had been introduced by the Reformation,
                    while the superior ability shown by those who preached its doctrines, in
                    adapting their discourse to the comprehension and spiritual needs of the pool’,
                    invested them with a highly effective influence.</p>
                <p>it In Germany the policy of the emperor, nearly always ambiguous, became
                    complicated with new difficulties. Charles himself, from political motives,
                    appears at this time to have been really desirous of bringing about a
                    termination of the prevailing religious controversies, but his vice-chancellor,
                    Held, on whom it devolved to carry out his intentions, pursued a singularly
                    infelicitous line of action, which ultimately led to the formation of the League
                    of Nuremberg (10th June 1538), whereby Ferdinand, the duke of Bavaria, Henry of
                    Brunswick, Albert of Brandenburg, and George of Saxony entered into a
                    combination for the purpose of opposing the League of Schmalkald.</p>
                <p>Dissatisfied with such a result, Charles next endeavoure( to bring about an
                    understanding by a series of conferences and Paul III. was induced to send his
                    legate to attend <hi rend="italic">i</hi> diet in Ratisbon (29th July 1541),
                    where a project fo: reunion, know׳n as the Ratisbon Interim, w׳as brought unde:
                    formal discussion. “It resulted,” says Gieseler, “as befori at Augsburg: they
                    quickly came together on merely specu lative formulas; but as soon as they
                    touched upon the ex ternal constitution and ordinances relating to the authority
                    of the church the division remained.” It was the last perhaps the only occasion,
                    on wdiich an influential sectior on both sides (the party that followed Paul
                    III. and tin party that followed Melanchthon) w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as
                    animated by a genu ine desire for reconciliation. Their design was defeatet by
                    the ignoble political aims of Francis on the one hand and by the theological
                    illiberality of Luther and the electoi of Saxony on the other. In the meantime
                    Protestantisn continued to advance: Hermann von Wied, elector o: Cologne, became
                    a supporter of its doctrines; and Pomer ania, Anhalt, Mecklenburg, and the
                    imperial cities wen added to the territories in which it became the dominanl
                    faith. It w׳as at this juncture, when the Reformation ir Germany may be
                    considered to have advanced to its high est point, that Paul III. brought
                    fonvard a proposal foi assembling a general council,—a proposition to which il
                    was decided by the Protestant party at the diet of Worms (March 1545) not to
                    accede, inasmuch as it would be £ council convened by the pope. In the following
                    December, however, the council (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trent, Council of)</hi>
                    assembled, —th. publication, in the meantime, of Luther’s pamphlel <hi
                    rend="italic">Against the Popedom at Rome</hi> , <hi rend="italic">founded by
                    the Devil</hi> , having further contributed to foster theological rancour. The
                    deliberations of this famous assembly resulted, as is w־el known, in the
                    enactment of a series of canons condemnatory of Protestant doctrine <hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and in this manner the hopes which down to this time had
                    been cherished oi bringing about a compromise with respect to those articles of
                    faith on which agreement had before seemed not unattainable were finally
                    extinguished.</p>
                <p>Two months after the first assembling of the council oi Trent Luther died. His
                    latter days had been embittered by the defection (as he regarded it) of
                    Melanchthon to a hostile camp, in the espousal by the latter of the tenets
                    maintained by (Ecolampadius and Bucer. The doctrine of the church having now
                    been once more defined by the Tridentine decisions, the emperor, in the
                    confident belief that theological divergence might be expected soon to cease,
                    next turned his attention to the removal of those abuses in matters of
                    discipline which he held to be the chief obstacle to the return of Protestants
                    to the church. With this view he brought about the acceptance of the Augsburg
                    Interim (15th May 1548) by the diet, a compromise which, while it roused the
                    susceptibilities of the pope, altogether failed to meet the conscientious
                    scruples of the Protestant party. In its place Melanchthon and Duke Maurice of
                    Saxony put forth the Leipsic Interim, a singular admixture of Lutheran doctrine
                    and Roman ritual, which subsequently gave rise to the controversy with the
                    Adiaphorists. The imperial design, of thus bringing about the extinction of
                    Protestantism either by coercion or by conciliatory measures, may be held to
                    have been finally defeated at the diet of Augsburg (1555), when it was decided
                    not only that every ruler of a separate state should henceforth be at liberty to
                    adopt either the Augsburg Confession (see <hi rend="italic">supra)</hi> or the
                    Catholic faith as his personal creed, but that his subjects should also be
                    called upon to conform to the profession of their temporal head. The effects of
                    this arrangement cannot be held to have been beneficial. Wherever, as was not
                    seldom the case, the ruler of one principality embraced a different doctrine <pb

                    feelings of aversion and enmity between their respective subjects, while its
                    complete failure as a means of bringing about unanimity is shown in the rise of
                    those numerous controversies which afterwards enabled the adherents of Romanism
                    to launch so effective a taunt against the principles of Protestantism. Among
                    these controversies were those of the Majorists (1551-1562), whose founder,
                    Georg Major of Wittenberg, maintained the doctrine of the necessity of good
                    works to salvation; of the Synergists (1555-1567), who held that men could not
                    be saved unless the operations of the divine grace were seconded by the
                    spiritual efforts of the individual soul; of the followers of Osiander
                    (1549-1567), who supported a modified theory of the doctrine of justification;
                    of the Crypto-Calvinists (1552-1574), who, led by Peucerus, the son-in-law of
                    Melanchthon, maintained against Flacius Illyricus a theory of predestination
                    differing from the Lutheran doctrine. In this last instance the feelings of
                    enmity engendered by the controversy rose to such a pitch that the elector of
                    Saxony was induced to send the leading Philippists to prison, while Flacius and
                    his party celebrated the victory which they held to be theirs by a solemn
                    service of thanksgiving and a commemorative medal. In the year 1580 an endeavour
                    was made to bring about a reconciliation of the various contending parties by
                    drawing up the celebrated Formula of Concord, but the design was attended with
                    but little success. In the midst of this theological ferment, however, the
                    divines of the university of Helmstadt, in the earlier part of the 17th century,
                    were honourably distinguished by their systematic endeavours to allay the
                    strife; and the career of Georg Calixtus, while affording a remarkable
                    illustration of a gloomy chapter in the history of Protestantism, may be cited
                    as a proof that a faithful adherence to the principles of the Reformation was
                    not incompatible with a regard for the right of private judgment and
                    intellectual freedom, iIn the Scandinavian kingdoms the Reformation was
                    materially assisted by political motives; the introduction of Lutheranism into
                    Denmark by King Christian II. in 1520 was to a great extent the result of his
                    desire to raise the lower classes with a view to the corresponding depression of
                    the nobility and the more powerful ecclesiastics of the realm. He sanctioned the
                    marriage of the clergy and caused the New Testament to be translated into
                    Danish. These measures, however, owing in no slight degree to the motives by
                    which they were held to be inspired, involved him in a struggle with his
                    subjects which eventually led to his deposition and to his passing the rest of
                    his life in exile. But the new doctrines continued to be effectively preached by
                    John Tausen, who had been among Luther’s pupils at Wittenberg; and the
                    principles of the Reformation spread rapidly in Schleswig and Holstein. On the
                    accession of Christian’s successor, Christian III. (his cousin), the movement
                    acquired fresh strength. The new monarch had been a witness of Luther’s heroic
                    conduct at Worms and had conceived the warmest admiration for the character of
                    the great Reformer, and through his efforts the tenets of the Reformation were
                    adopted in 1536, at a diet held at Copenhagen, as the religion of the state. In
                    the following year the movement extended to Norway and shortly after that to
                    Iceland. In Sweden the Reformation was established concurrently with the
                    political revolution which placed Gustavus Vasa on the throne. It was, however,
                    only too apparent that the patriot king was largely influenced by the
                    expectation of replenishing his exhausted exchequer from the revenues of the
                    church, and, as in Germany and in England, the assent of the nobility was gained
                    by their admission to a considerable share in the confiscated property. Among
                    the powerful cities which represented the great Hanseatic confederacy, again,
                    the acceptance of Lutheran doctrine turned largely on the keen commercial
                    rivalry that then existed between that confederacy and Holland, and on the
                    contests between the privileged and the unprivileged classes in the towns. In
                    the prosecution of the former struggle the burghers of Lübeck appealed for
                    assistance to Denmark, and, failing to gain the aid they sought, proceeded to
                    organize an alliance with the object of restoring Christian II. to his throne;
                    at the same time, with the view of outbidding their opponents in popularity,
                    they unwisely proclaimed revolutionary principles scarcely less subversive than
                    those of Münzer. In the civil war that ensued Christian III. ultimately
                    triumphed over his enemies, and Wullenwever, the leader of the fanatical party,
                    suffered death upon the scaffold. The Reformation was now firmly established,
                    but in, conjunction with the monarchy reinforced by the power of the nobility,
                    while the ecclesiastical constitution was remodelled; and in the year 1539, at
                    the diet of Odense, the new faith was proclaimed as the religion of the
                    land.</p>
                <p>In Bohemia the Hussite movement (see Huss and] <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hussites)</hi> must be held to have become almost absorbed in the broader
                    current of Lutheranism, although the Calix-tines (or moderate Utraquists) and
                    the Taborites (or extreme party) long continued to differ on questions of
                    discipline. In the earlier part of the 17 th century, however, the trained
                    activity and energy of the Jesuits led to the almost entire expulsion of both
                    parties, and Protestantism as a professed creed nearly ceased to survive.</p>
                <p>In Poland Protestantism prevailed before the first quarter of the 16th century
                    closed. In Dantzic, Elbing, and Thorn it was established by overwhelming
                    majorities. By the <hi rend="italic">Pax Dissidentium,</hi> however, with a view
                    to averting contests such as those that disturbed the peace of other lands, the
                    principle of universal toleration was enunciated; and the duke of Anjou
                    (afterwards Henry III. of France), on being elected to the vacant throne of
                    Poland in 1573, notwithstanding his own attachment to Catholicism, found himself
                    compelled to swear that he would strictly protect the adherents of the opposed
                    faith from persecution and aggression. But here again the influence of the
                    Jesuits ultimately proved victorious. The nobles were gained over by their arts,
                    and Catholicism reasserted its ascendency.</p>
                <p>In the Netherlands, where the free spirit of the great mercantile communities was
                    in singular harmony with the movement, the progress was still more rapid. The
                    details of the heroic struggle waged against Charles Y. and Philip II. must be
                    regarded as belonging rather to secular than to theological history; but it is
                    to be noted, alike to the honour of the people and of the house of Orange, that
                    the enactment of the principle of religious toleration followed upon the fierce
                    and intolerant persecution to which the country had so long been exposed.
                    Although the majority of the inhabitants professed the tenets of Calvinism, the
                    Arminian party succeeded in bringing about a union of church and state, which,
                    however, left the other communions almost entirely unrestricted in their
                    religious freedom. The followers of Gomarus, indeed, early in the 17th century,
                    seemed at one time likely to place this freedom in danger, not only by their
                    assertion of more rigid Calvinistic doctrine, but also by their demand that the
                    church should be constituted independent of the state. But eventually (see
                    Motley, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of the United Netherlands</hi> , c. lii.) the
                    party that favoured religious toleration triumphed; and the Dutch republic long
                    continued to be an asylum for those whom the ascendency of the contrary
                    principle in other lands drove into exile. The church organization was modelled
                    on the political organization of the provinces, each province <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0354-0337"/>being subdivided into classes, while the mode of
                    government was nearly identical with that known as Presbyterian.</p>
                <p>In England the reformation of doctrine made but little progress during the reign
                    of Henry VIII., for, although by the Ten Articles (1536) the royal assent was
                    given to the adoption of the doctrine of justification by faith and to the
                    recognition of the Bible and the three ancient creeds as the standard of belief,
                    a marked reaction in favour of Catholic doctrine took place in the enactment of
                    the Six Articles in 1539. For a brief period heresy became a statutable offence
                    and death was inflicted under the new provisions. The anomalous position of the
                    English Church became a scandal to Europe; for, while some men were burnt for
                    denying the doctrine of transubstantiation or for refusing to admit the royal
                    supremacy, others, as Barnes and Gerard, suffered at the stake for their
                    profession of Lutheran opinions, and even Cromwell must be regarded as in some
                    measure a victim of his attachment to German Protestantism. During the reign of
                    Edward VI. Somerset in conjunction with Cranmer pressed on the work of the
                    Reformation apace. Chantries and hospitals were everywhere suppressed and their
                    endowments confiscated. The bishops were compelled to acknowledge their direct
                    subordination to the crown by being required to take out licences for the
                    exercise of their jurisdiction. In 1549 the first Book of Common Prayer was
                    published, and the Act of Uniformity prescribed its use, while that of all other
                    forms of devotion was forbidden under heavy penalties. The canon law was revised
                    by a body of commissioners specially appointed for the purpose, and the new code
                    was completed for future use, although it never received the young king’s
                    signature. By these and other similar reforms, carried out in a great measure
                    under Cranmer’s direction, it was sought to make the Reformation in England a
                    complete rejoinder to the proceedings of the council assembled at Trent.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the Reformation assumed a different character from that of the
                    movement in England. It was inspired directly and solely by Germany, and may be
                    regarded as commencing from the martyrdom of Patrick Hamilton in the year 1528,
                    there being no evidence of any prior spontaneous efforts in the direction of
                    doctrinal reform on the part of the people. Hamilton’s designs were looked upon
                    with the greatest disfavour by the clergy at large; and, as James Y. was
                    especially anxious to secure the support of that body in his conflict with his
                    insubordinate nobility, he was altogether opposed to the adoption of the
                    Lutheran tenets. He even aspired to succeed to the title, which Henry had
                    forfeited, of “Defender of the Faith,” and was encouraged to hope that he might
                    succeed to the English crown. After his death (1542), however, under the regency
                    of the earl of Arran, the Reformed doctrines began to be regarded with greater
                    favour at court, while the merciless policy of Cardinal Beaton and the cruel
                    fate of Wishart gave rise to an outburst of popular indignation against the
                    bishops to which Beaton himself fell a victim (1546). The country was now
                    divided into two parties,—the bishops, the clergy at large, and the powerful
                    influence of France (as represented by the Guises) being on the side of
                    Catholicism, while many of the chief nobles and the laity at large were inclined
                    to favour Protestantism. The English influence, which, wisely exerted, might
                    have operated powerfully on the same side, was, however, sacrificed by the
                    injudicious policy of Somerset, who by his endeavour to enforce the marriage of
                    Mary Stuart with the youthful Edward roused the national spirit. The sense of
                    humiliation and resentment which followed upon the battle of Pinkie (1547),
                    where the English were greeted by the Scottish soldiery with the cry of
                    “heretics,” produced a reaction in favour of Catholicism which was not arrested
                    until the return of John Knox in 1555 from the Continent (see Knox).</p>
                <p>In Ireland the circumstances which favoured the introduction of Protestantism in
                    England were altogether wanting. The Roman ritual was in harmony with the genius
                    of the people, whereas the aversion naturally inspired by a creed imposed at the
                    dictation of the conqueror was in itself a formidable obstacle. The harsh and
                    essentially un-Christian policy pursued by the constituted ecclesiastical
                    authorities presented further difficulties. The Bible was not translated into
                    the vernacular, and that idiom was equally ignored in the church services, where
                    the choice lay between the Latin, hallowed in the minds of the people by
                    immemorial usage, and the language of the oppressor. Notwithstanding, if the
                    native population failed to attend the English Church services they were fined.
                    Other abuses similar to those which had contributed so powerfully to render
                    Germany Protestant,—non-residence on the part of the clergy, the bestowal of
                    benefices on needy aliens, often altogether wanting in religious earnestness,
                    and sometimes indifferent to the observance of ordinary morality,—still further
                    intensified the feeling of alienation. Protestantism became odious in the eyes
                    of the Irish people; and, when, after long years of oppression and neglect, it
                    was sought to inaugurate a juster policy and to render the established church in
                    some degree really national, the obstacles thus created could not be
                    overcome.</p>
