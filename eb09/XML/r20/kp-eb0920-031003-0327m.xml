                    England constitute four great classes. The first class consists of independent
                    documents relating to various subjects, persons, and places, but making
                    altogether one whole, such as, for instance, Domesday Book, or the Valor
                    Ecclesiasticus of Henry VIII. The second class consists of the series of
                    enrolments, including within one roll great varieties of distinct and separate
                    entries classed according to their formal character, as, for instance, the close
                    rolls and patent rolls, or classed according to their subject-matter, as are the
                    Liberate and the Norman rolls. The third class embraces those records which
                    contain entries of judicial proceedings and those where each subject has a
                    distinct roll; whilst the last class comprises all separate documents, such as
                    letters, inquisitions, privy seals, commissions, and other various descriptions
                    of formal instruments. Sir Edward Coke has given in his signification of the
                    term “record” a briefer and less involved definition; but according to his
                    rendering many important documents would have to be excluded from the list of
                    the national archives. Hence it was decreed, on the passing of the Public
                    Records Act (1 and 2 Vict. c. 94), which created the master of the rolls the
                    keeper of the archives, that the word “records” should be taken to mean “all
                    rolls, records, writs, books, proceedings, decrees, bills, warrants, accounts,
                    papers, and documents whatsoever, of a public nature belonging to Her
                    Majesty.”</p>
                <p>The documents of the once styled Courts of Chancery, Queen’s Bench, Exchequer,
                    and Common Pleas contain the very essence of England’s antiquarian wealth: they
                    constitute most of its bulk, much of its legal importance, and nearly all its
                    historical interest. “The custom of recording documents on rolls of parchment,”
                    writes Sir Thomas Hardy, the late deputy-keeper of the public records, “though
                    of very ancient date, commenced nevertheless at a period subsequent to the
                    Conquest; for no vestige can be traced of such a system during the Anglo-Saxon
                    dynasty.</p>
                <p>‘ Apud Anglo-Saxones/ says Hickes, ‘ etiam mos erat leges regum latas in
                    codicibus monasteriorum tanquam in tabulas publicas referendi.’ It may be
                    assumed that, had such a })Ian been then in operation, the same would have been
                    adopted by the Conqueror to perpetuate the survey of the kingdom which he caused
                    to be made, and for the preservation of which he evinced so much zeal and
                    anxiety.” As to the precise time when the use of rolls for the entry of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0328-0311"/>matters of business first began there is still
                    considerable doubt. That no rolls of a date antecedent to that of the 31st Henry
                    I. are now in existence is certain. It may therefore be presumed that the
                    practice of enrolling commenced shortly after the Conquest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Court of Chancery</hi> .— Owing to the vast quantity of
                    documents of this court, only the salient points of the principal series of
                    rolls can be dealt with. Among the most important enrolments belonging to this
                    court is the extensive series of documents known as the close rolls or Rotuli
                    Litterarum Clausarum. Upon their well-preserved parchment membranes the
                    historian scans entries relating —to the privileges of peers and commoners in
                    times gone by; to measures employed for the raising of armies and the equipment
                    of fleets; to orders for the observance of treaties, and for the fortification
                    of castles; and to laws innumerable touching the power of the bench, the
                    authority of the church, the extent of the civil jurisdiction, and the
                    prerogatives of the crown. By the help of these rolls the lawyer and antiquary
                    can learn how the coinage of the realm was regulated, how aids and imposts,
                    toll-ages and subsidies, were raised, how riots and tumults were suppressed, how
                    state prisoners were pardoned, how the writs ran for the summoning of
                    parliaments, what deeds w׳ere enrolled between party and party, what facts were
                    deemed worthy of record upon the birth, marriage, and death of royal and noble
                    families; in short, there is little that concerns the naval and military, the
                    civil and ecclesiastical, the legal and diplomatic affairs of the kingdom, which
                    is not to be found upon the yards and yards of parchment which constitute the
                    collection of the close rolls. The origin of the name “close” is due to the fact
                    that the documents composing the series, being of a private nature, were
                    despatched closed or sealed up, and were addressed to one or two persons only.
                    The close rolls begin with the reign of John and continue without interruption
                    to the present time. Since the days of Henry VIII. the entries on these rolls
                    are mostly confined to the enrolments of deeds of bargain and sale, wills of
                    papists, recognizances, specifications of new׳ inventions, and other instruments
                    enrolled for safe custody by warrant from the lord chancellor or master of the
                    rolls. Next in importance, and scarcely second in historical interest, is the
                    series of muniments, dating also from King John to the !?resent day, called the
                    patent rolls. Not a subject connected with the history and government of the
                    country but receives illustration from this magnificent collection. Is a castle
                    besieged by the king, a papal interdict removed by royal supplication, a
                    safe-conduct granted to an unpopular prelate, credence allowed to some court
                    witness, grace shown to a rebellious subject, church lands bestow׳ed on begging
                    clergy, negotiations entered into with foreign princes, powers of ambassadors
                    regulated, lands, offices, and wardships granted to public bodies or private
                    persons, titles of nobility created, charters confirmed, proclamations drawn up,
                    licences to hold, sell, and marry, commands to do fealty and homage,—all,
                    whether relating to political, social, ecclesiastical, or commercial life, are
                    to be found recorded on the membranes of the “litterae patentes.” With the
                    exception of a few gaps in the reigns of John and Henry III. the letters-patent
                    extend without break or flaw from the year 1200 to our own day. Unlike the close
                    rolls, they are unsealed and exposed to view, hence their name. The third great
                    class of records belonging to the Court of Chancery consists of the <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> parliament rolls ”; these, however, are far from being a
                    perfect collection, as many of the documents containing the proceedings of
                    various parliaments are hopelessly lost. The series begins with the 6th Edw׳ard
                    I. and extends, though v׳itli frequent breaks, to Henry YIII. As the journals of
                    the</p>
                <p>House of Lords do not commence till the reign of Henry VIII., it is only from the
                    parliament rolls that proof can be obtained of a peer having sat in parliament
                    previous to that period; such proof is always requisite in claims to an ancient
                    barony by writ. When complete these rolls contain entries of the various
                    transactions which took place from the opening to the close of each parliament.
                    Unfortunately many of the lost rolls belong to those parliaments which are of
                    the greatest importance for the history of the constitution. The enrolments of
                    Acts of Parliament, however, are of considerable help in the investigation of
                    English parliamentary history and constitute a most important supplement to the
                    parliament rolls. They begin with Richard III. and continue to 1849, when
                    enrolments ceased and Acts printed on vellum were substituted. Space forbids us
                    to enter into details respecting the other important collections belonging to
                    the Chancery records. We only allude briefly to the charter rolls, which consist
                    of grants of privileges to religious houses and bodies corporate, and which
                    extend from John to Henry VIII., in which reign grants from the crown were
                    entered on the patent rolls; the coronation rolls, which contain the commissions
                    and proceedings of the commissioners appointed to hear and determine claims of
                    service to be performed at coronations, as well as the oaths taken by the king
                    or queen when crowned,—this collection, with the exception of the coronation
                    rolls of Charles I. and George III., which are wanting, is perfect from James I.
                    to Victoria; the fine rolls, consisting of accounts of fines paid to the king
                    for licences to alienate lands, for freedom from knight service, for pardons,
                    wardships, and the like, which also begin with John and go down to Charles I.;
                    the French and Norman rolls, which relate to transactions in France whilst the
                    English held part of that country; the oblata rolls, consisting of accounts of
                    the offerings and free gifts to the sovereign from his subjects; and the
                    valuable inquisitions post-mortem, frequently but erroneously referred to as
                    escheat rolls, taken on the death of every tenant of the crown. Then in addition
                    to these there are tire hundred rolls, the decree rolls, the royal letters, the
                    carta? antiquae, the privy seals and signet bills, the subsidy rolls, the Irish,
                    Scotch, and Welsh rolls, the Almain rolls, and numerous other classes of
                    document which it is impossible to catalogue or describe within the limits of a
                    general review of the English archives. Suffice it to say that every class of
                    records is carefully arranged for public inspection and that full and clear
                    indices render research a matter of little difficulty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Court of Queeris Bench</hi> .—As this court takes cognizance of
                    both civil and criminal causes, the former on the crown side and the latter on
                    the plea side of the court, the records are arranged in the two sections, crown
                    side and plea side. Of these records the most important are the judgment or plea
                    rolls. From the time of Richard I. to the year 1702 they were united with the
                    crown rolls, but at that date they were separated. The plea rolls contain the
                    general proceedings in causes, but the modern rolls are very defective owing to
                    the neglect of attorneys in bringing the records in. The crowm rolls are
                    composed of indictments, informations, and other similar proceedings to which
                    parties have pleaded. Another division of the judgment rolls contains the
                    controlment rolls, which comprise minutes of all the principal proceedings in
                    crown causes, with numerical references to the judgment rolls, where the
                    proceedings are entered at length. Apart from the plea rolls the remaining
                    records of this court are of little general interest. Among their number we may
                    notice the attorney’s oath roll, containing the oaths required to be subscribed
                    by attorneys on their admission, the “baga de secretis,” containing proceedings
                    on attainders</p>

                <p>(of great interest to the historian), the contents of which have been admirably
                    reported upon by Sir Francis Palgrave, the enrolment of bails, proceedings in
                    outlawry, the jail delivery rolls, and a mass of indictments, recognizances, and
                    other similar documents. The prayer book known as the sealed copy of the “Book
                    of Common Prayer” pursuant to statute 14 Charles II. is also among the records
                    of the Court of Queen’s Bench.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Court of Common Pleas.</hi> —This court contains a far richer
                    collection than the Court of Queen’s Bench, and from the nature of its
                    jurisdiction the documents possess great interest for the genealogist and
                    topographer. Foremost among them is the valuable collection of “feet of fines or
                    final concords,” which date from Henry II. to the year 1834, when fines and
                    recoveries were abolished and “more simple modes of assurance substituted.” “The
                    utility of these records,” says the <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> of the House
                    of Commons’ committee on the state of the public records, “to all persons
                    desirous of tracing property and pedigree is unquestionable.” Fines contain the
                    proceedings which have been adopted to convey estates and to free them from
                    their entail to issue and from the dower of wives. Thus we are able to learn the
                    name of the freeholder levying the fine, and if he was married the name of his
                    wife and often of his children, the position and value of his estate, and not
                    unfrequently something about his ancestors. Yet perhaps the chief value of this
                    class of records is that they prove marriages and their issue at a time when
                    parochial registers were not in existence. Few documents show so unbroken a
                    succession from so early a date as these “pedes finium.” The king’s Silver
                    Office books are the chief indexes to the fines, but they suffered greatly from
                    the fire at the king’s Silver Office in the Temple in March 1838. The recovery
                    rolls (since 1834 continued under the name of “disentailing assurances” on the
                    close rolls) also constitute another important supplement to the study of the
                    pedes finium. Next to the collection of fines may be classed the judgment rolls
                    of this court, or, as they are more commonly designated, the “de banco” rolls.
                    They formerly consisted of two parts, the “communia placita” or personal plea
                    rolls, and the “placita terras” or pleas of lands and deeds enrolled; but after
                    the reign of Elizabeth the latter became distinct rolls, containing the king’s
                    silver and fines, assizes, deeds enrolled, and all real actions. The judgment
                    rolls pass through three stages—first, they are plea rolls; then, when the
                    parties join issue, issue rolls; and lastly, when judgments are entered upon
                    them, judgment rolls. The recording of the judgments has, however, been very
                    much neglected, for many of the judgments, instead of being entered on the plea
                    or issue rolls, have been entered on separate pieces of parchment, and thus have
                    given rise to certain distinct bundles called “riders,” in which such entries
                    are contained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Court of Exchequer</hi> .—This collection contains next to that
                    of the Court of Chancery the most interesting and valuable series of documents
                    among the English public records. The most important and most prominent series
                    is that of the great rolls of the Exchequer, otherwise called the pipe rolls.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>la 1883 was founded the
                    Pipe Roll Society, which has for its object the printing of the entire series of
                    pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II. </p></note> As with the close and patent
                    rolls, so with the rolls of the pipe, it is difficult to state what is and what
                    is not entered upon their membranes. Everything which in former times went to
                    swell the revenues of the crown— rents of various kinds, fines, amercements,
                    profits of lands and tenements, and the like—is to be found enrolled upon them.
                    The accounts of the ancient revenue of the crown, digested under the heads of
                    the several counties and annually written out in order to the charging and
                    discharging of the sheriffs and other accountants, are also to be seen upon
                    their membranes. If a great man was outlawed, his goods seized, his daughter
                    married or made a ward, the account thereof can be read in the pipe rolls. To
                    the pedigree-hunter these records are particularly useful, since they contain
                    the names of most men of property; while to the county historian they are
                    invaluable. Few of the English national archives boast a more uninterrupted
                    suepession than the great rolls of the Exchequer. Beginning in the second year
                    of Henry II., they continue to the present time with but two gaps—the rolls of
                    the first year of Henry III. and of the seventh year of Henry IV. Of the latter
                    of these missing rolls the antigraph or roll made by the chancellor’s scribe is
                    still in existence and supplies the place of the lost roll. At the beginning of
                    this series there is a roll which w׳as long looked upon as that of the first
                    year of Henry II., or by some antiquaries as belonging to the fifth year of
                    Stephen; but recent criticism seems to establish <hi rend="italic">thp</hi> fact
                    that it is a roll of the 31st year of Henry I.,—the earliest national document,
                    save Domesday, of any extent that now exists. Another important class of
                    documents belonging to the Court of Exchequer and stored with a variety of
                    information upon secular and religious matters is the memoranda rolls, which
                    extend from Henry III. to the middle of the present century. These rolls contain
                    enrolments of all the weighty business done in the offices of the queen’s and
                    lord treasurer’s remembrancer. Upon their membranes the inquirer will read how
                    writs ran for the recovery of debts due to the crown, how commissions were
                    appointed to seize estates attainted or forfeited to the crown, how goods were
                    seized in the various ports of England for the nonpayment of customs, how the
                    accounts of sheriffs and escheators were settled with the Exchequer, how cities
                    and boroughs made claim to special privileges, and how the numerous proceedings
                    in equity on English informations and bills were conducted. The “brevia regia”
                    endorsed on the memoranda rolls are the most ancient writs of that description
                    in the kingdom; in the earlier periods they assume the shape of letters and
                    contain various wishes of the sovereigns. To the antiquary and historian the
                    collection of archives called “originalia rolls,” which extend from Henry III.
                    to William IV., is of great service. They not only throw considerable light upon
                    the manners and customs in vogue in the 13th and 14tli centuries, but also
                    record the descent of lands, questions relating to crown revenues and feudal
                    tenures, the appointment of various commissions for different purposes of
                    investigation, and other similar entries. The importance of the originalia rolls
                    is also increased from the fact that they contain numerous extracts from early
                    rolls now no longer in existence.</p>
                <p>Among the documents of the ancient Exchequer there is much to interest the purely
                    ecclesiastical historian in the collection of ministers’ accounts of the issues
                    and profits of monastic lands in the hands of the crowm; in the pensions granted
                    to abbots and others upon the dissolution of the monasteries, now enrolled among
                    the records of the Augmentation Office; in the accounts of monasteries contained
                    in the chartularies, the account books of first-fruits and tenths; in the
                    taxation rolls which regulated the taxes as well to the kings as to the popes
                    until the survey of Henry VIII.; in the Valor Ecclesiasticus of Henry VIII.,
                    which contains surveys of archbishoprics, bishoprics, abbeys, monasteries, and
                    the like throughout the kingdom; in the visitations of religious houses; and in
                    the Wolsey books. To the antiquary pure and simple the collection in the
                    Exchequer which records the history of knights’ service is perhaps the most
                    interesting. The number of knights’ fees throughout the kingdom was 60,215, of
                    which the clergy had 28,015; but, as in process <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n330/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0330-0313"/>of time it became a doubtful question whether
                    lands were held by knight’s service or by some other tenure, inquisitions were
                    held and each baron had to return to the king an account of what he held. Such
                    accounts comprise the early history of landed property, with the names of the
                    owners and the extent of the estates. For information on this subject the three
                    great authorities are the Black and Red Books of the Exchequer, the scutage
                    rolls, and the subsidy rolls; the Liber Niger Scaccarii, or Liber Niger Parvus
                    as it is sometimes called, compiled by Gervase of Tilbury, nephew to Henry II.,
                    in the twenty-second year of that king’s reign, is the most ancient of these. It
                    contains a list of knights’ fees of the time of Henry II., and in many of the
                    returns there appear family names and particulars of the parents, children,
                    wives, and occupiers of the land as well as of tenants <hi rend="italic">in
                    capite.</hi> In this book there are also various treaties of the same king, four
                    bulls of Pope Alexander III., and the constitution of the royal household during
                    the reign of Henry II. The Red Book is somewhat similar to the Liber Niger, and
                    contains among other entries the oaths of the different officers of the Court of
                    Exchequer; the <hi rend="italic">Dialogus de Scaccario</hi> (formerly ascribed
                    to Gervase of Tilbury, but clearly proved by Madox to have been written by
                    Richard FitzNigel, at one time treasurer of the Exchequer, who held the see of
                    London from 1189 to 1198); numerous short memoranda, &amp;c., for the
                    instruction and use of the officials; and collections of knights’ fees and
                    serjeanties of the reigns of Henry II., Richard I., John, and Henry III. Many of
                    its entries are also in the Black Book. The scutage rolls, which begin in the
                    reign of Edward I., contain the pecuniary satisfaction paid by each knight in
                    lieu of the personal attendance upon his sovereign that was required of him.
                    This satisfaction was called “scutagium” or “servitium scuti” (service of the
                    shield), and in Norman-French “escuage,” from <hi rend="italic">ecu,</hi> a
                    shield. The assessment was, however, so arbitrary that it was decreed by Magna
                    Charta that no scutage should be imposed without consent of parliament. The
                    subsidy rolls record the fifteenths and tenths, &lt;fcc., granted by parliament
                    to the crown. In addition to the above are the marshals’ rolls, which contain an
                    account of the military service due from great tenants to the king on the eve of
                    a war, the “testa de Nevil,” and the solitary roll called the constable’s roll.
                    Among the more important documents belonging to the ancient Exchequer
                    collection, concerning which space forbids us to particularize, are the records
                    of the Augmentation Court, full of valuable matter to the church historian, the
                    court rolls of manors possessed by the crown, the voluminous series of bills and
                    answers, the collection of special commissions, the golden bull of Clement VII.
                    conferring the title of “Defender of the Faith” upon Henry VIII., hearth-money
                    accounts, the Jews’ rolls, the vast collection of crown leases, the recusant
                    rolls, and the very curious wardrobe accounts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Obsolete Courts</hi> .—In addition to the various records which
                    have been alluded to belonging to the Courts of Chancery, Queen’s Bench, Common
                    Pleas, and Exchequer, there is a large class of documents which appertain to
                    obsolete courts, and many of wdiich are of great historical value. The most
                    important of this class are the archives belonging to the Star Chamber, the
                    Court of Chivalry, the Court of Requests, the Court of Wards and Liveries, and
                    the Marshals Court. The muniments of the duchy of Lancaster and also those of
                    the abolished courts of the palatinate of Durham are now among the archives of
                    the Record Office. An account of Domesday Book has already been given (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Domesday Book).</hi> The amalgamation of the State Paper Office
                    in 1854 with the Record Office has been the means of rendering the series of the
                    English national archives an almost complete collection.</p>
                <p>With the exception of certain manuscripts in the British Museum and in a few
                    public libraries, most of the public muniments of the realm are now placed in
                    one repository and under the supervision of the master of the rolls.</p>
                <p>Upon the subject of the public records Sir Francis Palgrave, under whose auspices
                    as deputy keeper the public muniments were brought together under one roof,
                    writes as follows :—</p>
                <p>“Whether we consider them in relation to antiquity, to continuity, to variety, to
                    extent, or to amplitude of facts and details they have no equals in the
                    civilized world. For the archives of France, the most perfect and complete in
                    Continental Europe, do not ascend higher than the reign of St Louis, and
                    compared with ours are stinted and jejune; whereas in England, taking up our
                    title (so to speak) from Domesday, the documents placed under the custody of the
                    master of the rolls contain the whole of the materials for the history of this
                    country in every branch and under every aspect, civil, religious, political,
                    social, moral, or material from the Norman Conquest to the present day.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History</hi> .—In consequence of the neglect and indifference
                    from which the national archives suffered before being housed in their present
                    quarters, it is as much a matter for wonder as for congratulation that any of
                    them are still in existence. In the earlier periods the records of the courts
                    were preserved in the palace of the king; but, when the law courts became
                    stationary and were held within the precincts of the royal palace, instead of
                    following the sovereign from place to place, all legal documents remained in the
                    custody of their respective courts. On the business of the country increasing,
                    the records began to assume such vast proportions that further accommodation had
                    to be obtained. Gradually three warehouses for the custody of public documents
                    came into existence. The records of the King’s Bench and Common Pleas were
                    removed to the palace at Westminster, to the old chapter-house, and to the
                    cloister of the abbey of Westminster, and thus laid the foundation of the
                    well-known “chapter-house repository.” Towards the end of the reign of Richard
                    I., the Court of Chancery becoming separated from that of the Exchequer, the
                    wardrobe in the Tower of London was used as the chief place of deposit for all
                    Chancery documents, and thus the Record Office in the Tower sprang up. It had
                    been the custom of the earlier masters of the rolls to keep the records of their
                    courts in their private houses; but after the reign of Edward IV. these
                    documents were lodged in what is now styled the “chapel of the rolls,” but which
                    was then known as the “domus conversorum Judseorum,” or the house for converted
                    Jews and infidels, which had been annexed to the office of the master of the
                    rolls in the reign of Edward III.; an office was subsequently attached to the
                    chapel, and thus arose the record depository known as the “rolls chapel office.”
                    For many years these three places of deposit—the chapter-house, the Tower, and
                    the rolls chapel office—constituted the chief repositories for public records;
                    but, as the accommodation that these buildings offered was limited, rooms in
                    private houses, vacant vaults, and even stables had to be taken by the ministers
                    of the day for the storing of the ever-increasing archives. Little care was,
                    however, paid to the preservation of the parchments. They were put into houses
                    and forgotten; their various removals were most carelessly superintended; and
                    they were often left a prey to the pilfer-ings of the curious. Now and again a
                    sovereign or a secretary of state turned his attention to the disgraceful
                    condition in which the muniments of the kingdom were preserved and a sweeping
                    reform was announced; but more important matters always appear to have shelved
                    the subject. In 1567 Queen Elizabeth was informed of the confused and perilous
                    state of the records, of her parliament and her chancery, and orders were given
                    for rooms to be prepared in the Tower for the reception of these parchments, Her
                    Majesty declaring that ‘ ‘ it was not meet that the records of her chancery,
                    which were accounted as a principal measure of the treasure belonging to herself
                    and to her crown and realm, should remain in private houses and places for doubt
                    of such danger and spoil as theretofore had happened to the like records in the
                    time of Richard II. and Henry VI.” This order was, however, never executed. On
                    the accession of Charles II., William Prynne, then keeper of the records in the
                    Tower, implored the king “to preserve these ancient records not only from fire
                    and sword, but water, moths, canker, dust, cobwebs, for your own and your
                    kingdom’s honour and service, they being such sacred reliques, such peerless
                    jewels that your noble ancestors have estimated no places so fit to preserve
                    them in as consecrated chapels or royal treasuries and wardrobes where they lay
                    up their sacred crowns, jewels, robes; and that upon very good grounds, they
                    being the principal evidences by which they held, supported, defended their
                    crowns, kingdoms, revenues, prerogatives, and their subjects, their respective
                    lands, lives, liberties, properties, franchises, rights, laws.” This earnest
                    appeal was not urged before it was required. On his appointment to office Prynne
                    made an inspection of the records under his custody. He found them</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n331/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0331-0314"/>
                <p>“buried together in one confused chaos, dust, and filth in the dark corners of
                    Ciesar’s chapel in the White Towel־.” He employed soldiers and women to remove
                    and cleanse them, “who soon growing weary of this noisome work left them as
                    foul, dusty, and nasty as they found them.” He then begged the aid of the clerks
                    of his department, but these officials, <hi rend="italic">“</hi> being unwilling
                    to touch the records for fear of fouling their fingers, spoiling their clothes,
                    endangering their eyesight and healths by their cankerous dust and evil scent,”
                    declined the task. To the energetic Prynne the labour of methodizing the papers
                    in his charge seemed hopeless; he saw them in confused heaps hidden here and
                    scattered there and destitute of anything approaching to an index. He lamented
                    that it would require “Briareus his hundred hands, Argus his hundred eyes, and
                    Nestor’s centuries of years to marshal them into distinct files and make exact
                    alphabetical tables of the several things, names, places, comprised in them.”
                    Still nothing was done to remedy the evils complained of. Addresses were
                    presented to parliament upon the subject; reports were drawn up and committees
                    frequently sat; but it was not until the beginning of this century that a
                    complete and satisfactory investigation of the public records was entered into.
                    In the summer of 1800 a very able report upon the state of the archives was
                    drawn up; and a commission was appointed “to methodize, regulate, and digest the
                    records.” But the commission directed its attention exclusively to the printing
                    of antiquarian matter, and nothing was attempted for the better preservation of
                    the archives. Dissatisfaction arose, and a select committee of the House of
                    Commons was appointed to inquire into the working of the Record Commission. The
                    result of its sittings was the passing of a special Act of Parliament, which
                    placed the public records in the custody and under the superintendence of the
                    master of the rolls for the time being, and directed the treasury forthwith to
                    provide a suitable building. In 1851 the foundations of the present Record
                    Repository were laid, and seven years afterwards the public records were removed
                    from their different places of deposit and housed in their new quarters, where
                    they are now most carefully preserved.</p>
                <p>The history of the custody of the state papers which run from Henry VIII. to the
                    present time is but a repetition of the neglect and ill-treatment which the
                    public records had to endure. When they first began to be preserved they were
                    locked up in chests, then confined in the larder of the privy seal, then lodged
                    in the tower over the gateway of Whitehall Palace, then transferred to the upper
                    floor of the lord chamberlain’s lodgings, then despatched to an old house in
                    Scotland Yard; and it was not till 1833 that the State Paper Office in St
                    James’s Park was specially erected for their accommodation. Twenty years later
                    it was deemed advisable by the Government of the day to amalgamate the state
                    papers with the public records; the State Paper Office was therefore pulled down
                    and its contents transferred to the repository in Fetter Lane. On making a
                    careful examination of the state of the documents, it was found that many of
                    them had “greatly suffered from vermin and wet,” and that the list of those
                    which had been stolen or had strayed from the collection was no small one. Theft
                    and destruction for private ends appear to have been the two chief agents of
                    mischief. During the reign of Henry VIII. many of the despatches were
                    appropriated by Lord St Albans and Lord Cherbury, to whom they were entrusted.
                    In the reign of Queen Elizabeth most of the private business papers of Her
                    Majesty, especially her letters on matters of secret importance, came into the
                    hands of the earl of Leicester and finally into the possession of his secretary
                    and his descendants; and, “though they were ultimately recovered, a great part
                    had perished by time and the distraction of the wars, &amp;c.; being left in
                    England during the Rebellion, many had been abused to the meanest purposes.”
                    Upon the outbreak of the Civil War the king’s papers from the time he was in the
                    north till the surrender of Oxford were designedly burned; whilst “a fair
                    cabinet of the king’s, full of papers of a very secret nature, which had been
                    left by the king upon his retirement to the Scots, amongst which were thought to
                    be all the queen’s letters to the king and things of a very mysterious nature,”
                    was also destroyed. In the turbulent days of the Commonwealth Bradshaw, in his
                    capacity as president of the council, managed to obtain possession “of divers
                    books, treaties, papers, and records of state,” some of which, in spite of all
                    the efforts of Charles II., were not regained. At the Restoration “all the
                    papers of state during the time of the usurpation remained in Thurloe’s hands,
                    and Sir Samuel Morland advised a great minister to have them seized, being then
                    privately in four great deal desks; but for reasons left to be judged, that
                    minister delayed to order it, and Thurloe had time to burn them that would have
                    hanged a great many, and he certainly did burn them except some principal ones
                    culled out by himself.” During the reign of Charles II. various papers were sent
                    out of the country to The Hague and Sweden for the convenience of ambassadors,
                    many of which were never returned. Indeed so carelessly did ministers watch
                    their own documents that a treaty concluded with Holland in 1654 was bought at
                    an auction, and the original treaty with Portugal in the same year was found on
                    a stall in the street. Within almost a comparatively recent date there were
                    instances of documents sent out of the State Taper Office which were never
                    returned,—a fact which may account for many of the purely official papers to be
                    found in the manuscript collections of private individuals.</p>
                <p>In spite, however, of past thefts and negligence, the state papers, like the
                    public records, are a most wealthy and valuable collection. Their contents were
                    considered so important that at one time it was a matter of the greatest
                    difficulty for any outsider to obtain access to them. The keeper of the state
                    papers was bound by oath “to let no man see anything in the office of His
                    Majesty’s papers without a warrant from the king.” He was also “tied by a strict
                    oath and by His Majesty’s commands to deliver nothing out of the office unless
                    to the lords and others of the council.” During the whole history of the State
                    Paper Office the keeper never had power to grant on his own authority leave to
                    consult the papers; such permission could only be obtained from the secretary of
                    state, to whose office the documents belonged. Among the persons fortunate
                    enough to have this favour accorded them, we find that in 1670 Evelyn was lent
                    several documents which related to Holland; that in 1679 Dr Gilbert Burnet was
                    permitted by warrant “from time to time to have the sight and use of such papers
                    and books as he shall think may give him information and help in finishing his
                    history of the Reformation of the Church of England”; and that in the same year
                    Prince Rupert made a personal request to the king on behalf of Roger L’Estrange,
                    who was writing a history of the Civil War in England. In later times permission
                    was more freely given, though the “library of MSS.” was still most vigilantly
                    guarded, and applications were more often refused than granted. As an instance
                    of the strictness with which the state papers were preserved, we find that as
                    late as 1775 Lord North, though he was then prime minister, had to beg the
                    king’s permission to have free access to all correspondence in the Paper Office;
                    and that in 1780 it was necessary for the Ordnance Office to have permission to
                    search the Paper Office for any documents that regarded their department. These
                    restrictions have now been entirely removed, thanks to the late Lord Romilly;
                    when he was master of the rolls, the public records were thrown open to the
                    public free of all the charges that were formerly demanded for investigation,
                    whilst the same liberal course has been pursued with regard to the state papers
                    down to the year 1760. After that date special permission has to be obtained.
                    Calendars and indexes of the public records are annually published in the
                    appendices to the reports of the deputy-keeper of the public records. Large
                    volumes—entitled <hi rend="italic">Calendars of State Papers</hi> —consisting of
