                    (1787-1832), an eminent scholar and philologist, was born at Brändekilde in the
                    Island of Fünen or Fyen in Denmark in 1787. He studied at the university of
                    Copenhagen, and early distinguished himself by singular talent for the
                    acquisition of languages. In the year 1808 he was appointed assistant keeper of
                    the university library, and some years after wards made professor of literary
                    history. In 1811 he published, in Danish, his <hi rend="italic">Introduction to
                    the Grammar of the Icelandic and other Ancient Northern Languages,</hi> from
                    printed and MS. materials which had been accumulated by his predecessors in the
                    same field of research. The reputation which Rask thus acquired recommended him
                    to the Arna-Magnaean Institution, by which he was employed as editor of the
                    Icelandic <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi> (1814) of Björn Haldor-son, which had
                    long remained in manuscript. About the same time Rask paid a visit to Iceland,
                    where he remained from 1813 to 18Î5, and made himself completely master of the
                    language and familiarized himself with the literature, manners, and customs of
                    the natives. To the interest with which they inspired him may probably be
                    attributed the establishment at Copenhagen, early in 1816, of the Icelandic
                    Literary Society, which was mainly instituted by his exertions, and of which he
                    was the first president.</p>
                <p>In October 1816 Rask left Denmark on a literary expedition, at the cost of the
                    king, to prosecute inquiries into the languages of the East, and collect
                    manuscripts for the university library at Copenhagen. He proceeded first to
                    Sweden, where he remained two years, in the course of which he made an excursion
                    into Finland, for the purpose of studying the language of that country. Here he
                    published, in Swedish, his <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon Grammar</hi> in 1817.
                    In 1818 there appeared at Copenhagen, in Danish, an <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    the Origin of the Ancient Scandinavian or Icelandic Tongue,</hi> in which he
                    traced the affinity of that idiom to the other European languages, particularly
                    to the Latin and the Greek. In the same year he brought out the first complete
                    editions of Snorro’s <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi> and Saemund’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edda,</hi> in the original text, along with Swedish translations of both <hi
                    rend="italic">Eddas,</hi> the originals and the versions occupying each two
                    volumes. From Stockholm he went in 1819 to St Petersburg, where he wrote, in
                    German, a paper on “The Languages and Literature of Norway, Iceland, Sweden, and
                    Finland,” which was published in the sixth number of the Vienna <hi
                    rend="italic">Jahrbücher.</hi> From Russia he proceeded through Tartary into
                    Persia, and resided for some time at Tabriz, Teheran, Persepolis, and Shiraz. In
                    about six weeks he made himself sufficiently master of the Persian to be able to
                    converse freely in that language with the natives. In 1820 he embarked at
                    Bushire for Bombay; and during his residence in the latter city he wrote, in
                    English, “A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the Zend Language” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trans. Lit. Soc. of Bombay,</hi> vol. iii., reprinted with
                    corrections and additions in <hi rend="italic">Trans. R.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >As</hi> . <hi rend="italic">Soc.</hi> ) From Bombay he proceeded through India
                    to Ceylon, where he arrived in 1822, and soon afterwards wrote, in English, “A
                    Dissertation respecting the best Method of expressing the Sounds of the Indian
                    Languages in European Characters,” which was printed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the Literary and Agricultural Society of Colombo.</hi> Rask
                    returned to Copenhagen in May 1823, bringing with him a considerable number of
                    Oriental manuscripts, Persian, Zend, Pali, Singalese, and others, which now
                    enrich the collections of the Danish capital. He died at Copenhagen on 14th
                    November 1832.</p>
                <p>During the period between his return from the East and his death Rask published
                    in his native language a <hi rend="italic">Spanish Grammar</hi> (1824), a <hi
                    rend="italic">Frisic Grammar</hi> (1825), an <hi rend="italic">Essay on Danish
                    Orthography</hi> (1826), a <hi rend="italic">Treatise respecting the Ancient
                    Egyptian Chronology</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">Italian Grammar</hi> (1827),
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Ancient Jewish Chronology previous to Moses</hi>
                    (1828). He likewise edited an edition of Schneider’s <hi rend="italic">Danish
                    Grammar for the use of Englishmen</hi> (1830), and superintended the English
                    translation of his valuable <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon Grammar</hi> by Thorpe
                    (1830). Rask’s services to comparative philology were very great. He was the
                    first to point out the connexion between the ancient Northern and Gothic on the
                    one hand, and of the Lithuanian, Sclavonic, Greek, and Latin on the other, and
                    he also has the credit of being the real discoverer of the so-called “Grimm’s
                    Law” for the transmutation of consonants in the transition from the old
                    Indo-European languages to Teutonic, although he only compared Teutonic and
                    Greek, Sanskrit being at the time unknown to him. Rask’s facility in the
                    acquisition of languages was extraordinary; in 1822 he was master of no less
                    than twenty-five languages and dialects, and is stated to have studied twice as
                    many. His numerous philological manuscripts were transferred to the king’s
                    library at Copenhagen. Rask’s <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon, Danish,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Icelandic Grammars</hi> have been given to the English public
                    by Thorpe, Repp, and Dasent respectively.</p>
