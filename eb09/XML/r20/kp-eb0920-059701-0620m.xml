                    earnest study of art. For the next few years his time was divided between work
                    as a house-painter and as a scene-painter, and he even appeared occasionally on
                    the boards as an actor in pantomimes. In 1820 he formed the acquaintance of
                    Clarkson Stanfield, then painting at the Pantheon, Edinburgh, by whose advice
                    and example he greatly profited and at whose suggestion he began his career as
                    an exhibitor, sending three pictures in 1822 to the “Exhibition of Works by
                    Living Artists,” held in Edinburgh. In the same year he removed to London, where
                    he worked for the Coburg Theatre, and was afterwards employed, along with
                    Stanfield, at Drury Lane. In 1824 he exhibited at the British Institution a view
                    of Dryburgh Abbey, and sent two works to the first exhibition of the Society of
                    British Artists, which he had joined, and of which he was elected president in
                    1831. In the same autumn he visited Normandy, and the works which were the
                    results of this excursion began to lay the foundation of the artist’s
                    reputation,—one of them, a view of Rouen Cathedral, being sold for eighty
                    guineas. By his scenes for an opera entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Seraglio,</hi> executed two years later, he won much contemporary praise, and
                    these, along with the scenery for a pantomime dealing with the naval victory of
                    Navarino, and two panoramas executed jointly by him and Stanfield, were among
                    his last work for the theatres. In 1829 he exhibited his imposing subject the
                    Departure of the Israelites from Egypt, a commission from Lord North wick, in
                    which the style of the painter first becomes clearly apparent; and three years
                    afterwards he travelled in Spain, and passed over to Tangiers, returning in the
                    end of 1833 with a supply of effective sketches, which were speedily elaborated
                    into attractive and popular paintings. His Interior of Seville Cathedral was
                    exhibited in the British Institution in 1834, and sold for £300; and he executed
                    a fine series of Spanish illustrations for the <hi rend="italic">Landscape
                    Annual</hi> of 1836, a publication to which he contributed for four years; while
                    in 1837 a selection of his <hi rend="italic">Picturesque Sketches in Spain</hi>
                    was reproduced by lithography, many of the subjects being carefully retouched
                    on. the stone by the artist’s own hand.</p>
                <p>In 1838 Roberts made a long tour in the East, sailing up the Nile, visiting Luxor
                    and Karnak, and afterwards making his way to the Holy Land. He thus accumulated
                    a vast collection of sketches of a class of scenery which had hitherto been
                    hardly touched by British artists, and which appealed to the public with all the
                    charm of novelty. The next ten years of his life were mainly spent in
                    elaborating these materials. Many Eastern subjects were painted, and an
                    extensive series of drawings was lithographed by Louis Haghe in the superb work,
                    <hi rend="italic">Sketches in the Holy</hi><hi rend="italic">Land and
                    Syria,</hi> 1842-49. In 1851, and again in 1853, Roberts visited Italy, painting
                    the Ducal Palace, Venice, bought by Lord Londesborough, the interior of the
                    Basilica of St Peter’s, Rome, Christmas Day, 1853, and Rome from the Convent of
                    St Onofrio, presented to the Royal Scottish Academy. His last volume of
                    illustrations, <hi rend="italic">Italy, Classical, Historical, and
                    Picturesque,</hi> was published in 1859. He also executed, by command of the
                    queen, a picture of the opening of the Great Exhibition of 1851,— a laborious
                    and rather uncongenial task. In 1839 he was elected an associate, and in 1841 a
                    full member of the Royal Academy; and in 1858 he was presented with the freedom
                    of the city of Edinburgh. The last years of his life were occupied with a series
                    of views of London from the Thames. He had executed six of these and was at work
                    upon a picture of St Paul’s Cathedral, when on 25th November 1864 he was seized
                    with an attack of apoplexy and expired the same evening.</p>
                <p>The quality of Roberts’s work is exceedingly equal and uniform during his whole
                    career. The architecture, which is so prominent a feature in his paintings, is
                    introduced with great picturesqueness and an easy command of its salient points,
                    but with little care for the minutiae of detail. His art was conventional,
                    essentially scenic and spectacular in character, showing effective composition
                    and an unerring instinct for broad general effect, but destitute of that close
                    adherence to nature, that delicacy and truth of tone and colour, which are
                    becoming increasingly characteristic of the productions of the English school.
                    Something of the scene-painter appears in all his works, and his certainty and
                    speed of execution were undoubtedly founded upon his early practice for the
                    stage.</p>
