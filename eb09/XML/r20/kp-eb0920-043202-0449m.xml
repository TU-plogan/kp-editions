                <p>ANTELINAeAN writers comprised the animals which popularly are known as Tortoises
                    and Turtles, Crocodiles, Lizards and Snakes, Frogs and Toads, Newts and
                    Salamanders, under the name of Oviparous Quadrupeds or four-limbed animals which
                    lay eggs. Linnaeus, desirous of giving expression to the extraordinary fact that
                    many of these animals pass part of their life in the water and part on land,
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“*Polymorpha in liis
                    amphibiis natura duplicem vitam plerisque coneessit.” </p></note> substituted
                    the name of Amphibia for the ancient term. Subsequent French naturalists
                    (Lyonnet <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Théologie des Insectes de Lesser</hi> (Paris, 1745), i. 91, note

                    considered that the creeping mode of locomotion was a more general
                    characteristic of the class than their amphibious habits, and consequently
                    proposed the scarcely more appropriate name of Reptiles.</p>
                <p>As naturalists gradually comprehended the wide gap existing between Frogs, Toads,
                    ¿c., on the one hand, and the other Oviparous Quadrupeds on the other, they
                    either adopted the name of <hi rend="italic">Batrachia</hi> for the former and
                    that of <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> for the latter, or they restricted the
                    term <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> to Batrachians, calling the remainder of
                    these creatures Reptiles. Thus the term <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> , as
                    used by various authors, may apply (1) to all the various animals mentioned, or
                    (2) to Batrachians only—and thus it has been used in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amphibia</hi> in the present work. The term Reptiles is used
                    (1) by some for all the animals mentioned above, and (2) by others, as in the
                    present article, for the same assemblage of animals after the exclusion of
                    Batrachians. Other terms more or less synonymous with Amphibians and Reptiles in
                    their different senses have been used by the various systematists, as we shall
                    see hereafter.</p>
                <p>Equally varying are the limits of the term “Saurians,” which occurs so frequently
                    in every herpetological treatise. At first it comprised living Crocodiles and
                    Lizards only, with which a number of fossil forms were gradually associated. As
                    the characters and affinities of the latter became better known, some of them
                    were withdrawn from the Saurians, and at present it is best to abandon the term
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>History and Literature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a. The General Subject.</hi></p>
                <p>By some feature of their organization or some peculiarity in their economy
                    Reptiles have always forced themselves upon the observation of man or excited
                    his imagination, so that certain kinds are mentioned in the earliest written
                    records or have found a place among the fragments of the oldest relics of human
                    art. Such evidences of a popular knowledge of Reptiles, however, form no part of
                    a succinct review of the literature of the subject such as it is proposed to
                    give here. We distinguish in it five periods :—(1) the Aristotelian; (2) the
                    Linnaean (formation of a class <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> , in which
                    Reptiles and Batrachians are mixed); (3) the period of the elimination of
                    Batrachians as one of the Reptilian orders (Brongniart); (4) that of the
                    separation of Reptiles and Batrachians as distinct subclasses; (5) that of the
                    recognition of a class <hi rend="italic">Reptilia</hi> as part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> (Huxley).</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Aristotelian Period.</hi> —As in other branches of Ar
                    zoology, we have to start with <hi rend="smallcaps">Aristotle,</hi> who was the
                    first to deal with the Reptiles known to him as members of a distinct portion of
                    the animal kingdom, and to point out the characteristics by which they resemble
                    each other and differ from other vertebrate and invertebrate animals. As the
                    plan of his work, however, was rather that of a comparative treatise of the
                    anatomical and physiological characters of animals than their systematic
                    arrangement and definition, his ideas about the various groups of Reptiles are
                    not distinctly expressed, but must be gleaned from the terms which lie employs.
                    And even when we make due allowance for the fact that we are in possession of
                    only a part of his writings, we cannot but perceive that he paid less attention
                    to the study of Reptiles than to that of other classes; this is probably due to
                    the limited number of kinds with which he could be acquainted from the fauna of
                    his own country, and to which only very few extra-European forms, like the
                    Crocodile, were added from other sources. And, whilst we find in some respects a
                    most remarkable accuracy of knowledge, there is sufficient evidence that lie
                    neglected every-day opportunities of information, as if Reptiles had not been a
                    favourite study. Thus, lie has not a single word about the metamorphoses of
                    Batrachians, which he treats of in connexion with Reptiles.</p>
                <p>Aristotle makes a clear distinction between the scute or scale of a Reptile,
                    which he describes as &lt;£oXts, and that of a Fish, which lie designates as <hi
                    rend="italic">Xen-is.</hi> He mentions Reptiles (1) as oviparous quadrupeds with
                    scutes, viz., Saurians and Chelonians; (2) as oviparous apodals, viz., Snakes;
                    (3) as oviparous quadrupeds without scutes, viz., Batrachians. He considered the
                    first and second of these three groups as much more nearly related to each other
                    than to the third. He says: —</p>
                <p>“The genus of Snakes resembles that of Lizards, nearly all the characters being
                    common to both, if the Lizard be conceived of as prolonged and without legs.
                    They possess scutes, and are similar to Lizards above and below, but they lack
                    testicles; and, like Fishes, they possess two excretory ducts which coalesce,
                    and the uterus is large and bipartite. In other respects their internal parts
                    are like those of Lizards, save that all the intestines are long and narrow. The
                    tongue is narrow, long, black, and very exsertile. It is a peculiarity of Snakes
                    and Lizards that they possess a bifid tongue; but the points of the tongue of
                    Snakes are fine like hairs. All Snakes are “carcharodont” (have acute teeth);
                    they have as many ribs as there are days in the month, viz., 30. Some say that
                    Snakes recover the loss of an eye; the tail is reproduced in Lizards and Snakes
                    when cut off,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Thus accurate statements and descriptions are sadly mixed with errors and stories
                    of, to our eyes, the most absurd and fabulous kind. The most complete accounts
                    are those of the Crocodile (chiefly borrowed from Herodotus) and of the
                    Chameleon, which Aristotle evidently knew from personal observation, and which
                    he had dis<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n450/mode/1up"

                    are the common Lizards ( <hi rend="italic">σαύρα</hi> ), the common Seps <hi
                    rend="italic">(χαλκίς</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ζιγνίς),</hi> and the Gecko
                    (άσ־καλ <hi rend="italic">αβωτης</hi> or <hi rend="italic">κορΒνλος).</hi> Of
                    Snakes (of which he generally speaks as <hi rend="italic">οφίζ)</hi> he knew the
                    Yipers («fyi9 or <hi rend="italic">εχιδνα),</hi> the common Snake ( <hi
                    rend="italic">v8po</hi> &lt;;), and the Blindworm <hi rend="italic">(τνφλίνης
                    οφις),</hi> which he regards as a Snake; he further mentions the Egyptian Cobra
                    and Dragons (δράκων)—North-African Serpents of fabulous size. Of Chelonians he
                    describes in a perfectly recognizable manner Land Tortoises <hi rend="italic"
                    >(χελώνη),</hi> Freshwater Turtles <hi rend="italic">(έμνς),</hi> and Marine
                    Turtles <hi rend="italic">(χελώνη η θαλαττία).</hi></p>
                <p>Passing over eighteen centuries we find the knowledge of Reptiles to have
                    remained as stationary as other branches of natural history, perhaps even more
                    so. The Reptile fauna of Europe was not extensive enough to attract the energy
                    of a Belon or Rondelet; popular prejudice and the difficulty of preserving these
                    animals deterred from their study; nor was the mind of man sufficiently educated
                    not to give implicit credence to the fabulous tales with which every account of
                    Reptiles in the 15th and 16th centuries was replete. The art of healing,
                    however, was developing into a science based upon rational principles, and
                    consequently not only those Reptiles which formed part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >materia medica</hi> but also the venomous Snakes became objects of study to the
                    physician. Snakes, and especially the Viper, were treated of in distinct
                    divisions of general works, or in separate monographs. It is true that these
                    treatises were written less with the view of elucidating the natural history of
                    the animals than with that of describing their poisonous nature and indicating
                    the manner in which they should be used as medicaments, the majority of the
                    writers being ignorant of the structure of the venom-apparatus, and of the
                    distinction between non-venomous and venomous Snakes.</p>
                <p>Nothing can show more clearly the small advance made by herpetology in this long
                    post-Aristotelian period than a glance at the celebrated work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Differentiis Animalium Libri decern</hi> (Paris, 1552), by <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edward Wotton</hi> (1492-1555). Wotton treats of the Reptiles
                    which he designates as <hi rend="italic">Quadrupedes oviparx et Serpentes</hi>
                    in the sixth book of his work. They form the second division of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Quadrupedes qux sanguinem habent,</hi> and are subdivided in the
                    following “genera” :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crocodilus etscincus</hi> (cap. cv.); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Testudinum genera</hi> (cvi.); <hi rend="italic">Ran-arum genera</hi> (cvii.);
                    <hi rend="italic">Lacertx</hi> (cviii.); <hi rend="italic">Salamandra et seps
                    quad-rupee</hi> (cix.); <hi rend="italic">Stellio</hi> (cx.); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chamxleo</hi> (cxi.); <hi rend="italic">Serpentes</hi> (cxii.), a general
                    account, the following being different kinds of Serpents: <hi rend="italic"
                    >—Hydrus et alii quidam serpentes aquatiles</hi> (cxiii.); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Serpentes terrestres et primo aspidum genera</hi> (cxiv.); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vipera, dipsas, cerastes, et hammodytes</hi> (cxv. <hi rend="italic">);
                    Hxmorrlius, sepedon, seps, cenchris, et cenchrites</hi> (cxvi.); <hi
                    rend="italic">Basiliscus et alii quidam serpentes quorum venenum remedio
                    caret</hi> (cxvii.); <hi rend="italic">Draco, amphishxna, et alii quidam
                    serpentes quorum morsus minus affert periculi</hi> (cxviii.).</p>
                <p>As regards the treatment of the subject, Wotton’s work might with propriety be
                    termed “Aristoteles redivivus.” The plan is the same, and the observations of
                    the Greek naturalist are faithfully, sometimes literally, reproduced. It is
                    surprising that even the Reptiles of his native country were most imperfectly
                    known to the author.</p>
                <p>A new impetus for the cultivation of the study of natural history was given
                    through the observations and writings of travellers in India, Africa, and
                    America. With the enlargement of geographical knowledge that of Reptiles was
                    also advanced, as is sufficiently apparent from the large encyclopaedic works of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Gesner, Aldrovandi,</hi> and J <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ohnston.</hi> The last-named author especially, who published the various
                    portions of his natural history in the middle of the 17th century, was able to
                    embody in his compilations notices of numerous Reptiles observed by Francisco
                    Hernandez in Mexico and by Marcgrave and Piso in Brazil. As the author had no
                    definite idea of the Ray-Linnsean term “species,” it is not possible to give the
                    exact number of Reptiles mentioned in his work. But it may be estimated at about
                    fifty, not including some marine fishes and fabulous creatures. He figures (or
                    rather reproduces the figures of) about forty,—some species being represented by
                    several figures.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Linnxan Period: Formation of a Class Amphibia</hi> .— Within
                    the century which succeeded these compilatory works (1650-1750) fall the labours
                    which prepared the w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ay for and exerted the
                    greatest influence on Ray and Linnaeus. Although original researches in the
                    field ol herpetology were limited in extent and in number, the authors had freed
                    themselves from the purely literary oi scholastic tendency. Men were no longer
                    satisfied wit! reproducing and commenting on the writings of their predecessors;
                    the pen was superseded by the eye, the micro scope, and the knife, and
                    statements were tested by experiment. This spirit of the age manifested itself,

                    the fabulous descriptions of tin ancient dragons; but, with the discovery of
                    alcohol as <hi rend="italic">i</hi> means of preserving animals, Reptiles entire
                    or dissectec were exhibited for study; and no opportunity was lost o obtaining
                    them from travellers or residents in foreigr countries. Fossils also were now
                    acknowledged to be re mains of animals which had lived before the flood, anc
                    some of them were recognized as those of Reptiles.</p>
                <p>The contributions to a positive knowledge of the anima kingdom became so numerous
                    as to render the need of £ methodical arrangement of the abundance of new facts
                    more and more pressing. Of the two principal systematic attempts made in this
                    period the first ranks as one of the most remarkable steps of the progress of
                    natural history whilst the second can only be designated as a signal failure,
                    which ought to have been a warning to all those who in aftei years classified
                    animals in what is called an “artificial system.” As the latter attempt,
                    originating with <hi rend="smallcaps">Klein</hi> (1685-1759), did not exercise
                    any further influence on herpetology, it will be sufficient to have merely
                    mentioned it. <hi rend="smallcaps">John Ray</hi> (1628-1705) had recognized the
                    necessity of introducing exact definitions for the several categories into which
                    the animals had to be divided, and he maintained that these categories ought to
                    be characterized by the structure of animals, and that all zoological knowledge
                    had to start from the <hi rend="italic">“</hi> species” as its basis. His
                    definition of Reptiles as “animalia sanguinea pulmofie respirantia cor unico
                    tantum ventriculo instructum habentia ovipara” fixed the class in a manner which
                    was adopted by the naturalists of the succeeding hundred and fifty years.
                    Nevertheless, Ray was not a herpetologist; he never made these animals his
                    special study, as is evident from the way in which he subdivides the class, as
                    well as from his imperfect treatment of the species. His knowledge of Reptiles
                    is chiefly derived from the researches of others, from whose accounts, however,
                    everything not based upon reliable demonstration is critically excluded. He
                    begins with a chapter treating of Frogs <hi rend="italic">(Dana,</hi> with two

                <p>Except in so far as he made known and briefly characterized a number of Reptiles,
                    our knowledge of this class was not advanced by <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    themselves and to the other vertebrates were the same as those of Ray, and the
                    progress made by herpetology in the various editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema Nature¿</hi> is therefore of a merely formal character. That Linnaeus
                    associated in the 12th edition cartilaginous and other Fishes with the Reptiles
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Amphibia Nantes</hi> was the result of some
                    misunderstanding of an observation by Garden, and is not to be taken as a
                    premonitory token of the recent discoveries of the relation between Batrachians
                    and Fishes. Linnaeus places Reptiles, which he calls <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia</hi> , as the third class of the animal kingdom; he divides the genera
                    thus :—</p>

                <p>None of the naturalists who under the direction or influence of Linnaeus visited
                    foreign countries possessed any special knowledge of or predilection for the
                    study of Reptiles; all, however, contributed to our acquaintance with tropical
                    forms, or transmitted well-preserved specimens to the collections at home, so
                    that <hi rend="smallcaps">Gmelin,</hi> in the 13th edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Systema Natures,</hi> was able to enumerate three hundred and
                    seventy-one species.</p>
                <p>The man who, with the advantage of the Linnaean method, first treated of Reptiles
                    monograpliically, was <hi rend="smallcaps">Laurenti.</hi> In a small book <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Specimen
                    medicum exhibens Synopsin Reptilium emendatam cum experimentis circa venena et
                    antidota Reptilium Austriacorum,</hi> Vienna, 1768 (8vo, pp. 214, with 5
                    plates). </p></note> he proposed a new division of these animals, of which some
                    ideas and terms have survived into our times, characterizing the orders, genera,
                    and species in a much more precise manner than Linnaeus, giving, for his time,
                    excellent descriptions and figures of the species of his native country.
                    Laurenti might have become for herpetology what Artedi was for ichthyology, but
                    his resources were extremely limited. He himself complains that he had no
                    literary intercourse with foreign naturalists, and access to but a few works (he
                    especially mentions Seba’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus)</hi> and one collection
                    only,</p>
                <p>The circumstance that Chelonians are entirely omitted from his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Synopsis</hi> seems due rather to the main object with which he engaged in the
                    study of herpetology, viz., that of examining and distinguishing Reptiles
                    reputed to be poisonous, and to want of material, than to his conviction that
                    Tortoises should be relegated to another class. He divides then the class into
                    three orders :—</p>
                <p>T. Salientia, with the genera Pipa, Bufo, Rana, Hyla, and one species of
                    “Proteus,” viz., the larva of Pseudisparadoxa.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gradientia,</hi> the three first genera of which are Tailed
                    Batrachians, viz., two species of <hi rend="italic">Proteus</hi> (one being the
                    <hi rend="italic">P. anguinus), Triton,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salamandra</hi>; followed by true Saurians— <hi rend="italic">Caudiverbera,
                    Gecko, Cha.mselco, Iguana, Basiliscus, Draco, Cordylus, Crocodilus, Scincus,
                    Stellio, Seps.</hi></p>

                    rend="italic">Amphisbsena, Csecilia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anguis,</hi> but
                    the large Linnaean genus <hi rend="italic">Coluber</hi> is divided into twelve,
                    chiefly from the scutellation of the head and form of the body.</p>
                <p>The work concludes with an account of the experiments made by Laurenti to prove
                    the poisonous or innocuous nature of those Reptiles of which he could obtain
                    living specimens.</p>
                <p>The next general work on Reptiles is by <hi rend="smallcaps">Lacépède.</hi> It
                    appeared in the years 1788 and 1790 under the title <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    Naturelle des Quadrupèdes Ovipares et des Serpens</hi> (Paris, 2 vols. 4to).
                    Although as regards treatment of details and amount of information this work far
                    surpasses the modest attempt of Laurenti, it show's no advance towards a more
                    natural division and arrangement of the genera. The author depends entirely on
                    conspicuous external characters, and classifies the Reptiles into (1) oviparous
                    quadrupeds with a tail, (2) oviparous quadrupeds without a tail, (3) oviparous
                    bipeds ( <hi rend="italic">Chirotes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pseudopus),</hi>
                    (4) Serpents,—an arrangement in which the old confusion of Batrachians and
                    Reptiles and the imperfect definition of Lizards and Snakes are continued, and
                    which it is worthy of remark we find also adopted in Cuvier’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tableau Élémentaire de l’Histoire Naturelle des Animaux</hi> (1798), and nearly
                    so by <hi rend="smallcaps">Latreille</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    Naturelle des Reptiles</hi> (Paris, 1801, 4 vols. 12mo). Lacépède’s monograph,
                    however, remained for many years deservedly the standard work on Reptiles, on
                    account of the ability with which the author collected all reliable information
                    on the various species, and on account of the facilities which it afforded for
                    determining them. The numerous plates with which the work is illustrated are,
                    for the time, well drawn, and the majority readily recognizable.</p>

                    Batrachians differ from the other Reptiles, and by which they form a natural
                    passage to the class of Fishes. <hi rend="italic">Csecilia</hi> (as also <hi
                    rend="italic">Langaha</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acrochordus)</hi> is left by
                    Brongniart with hesitation in the order of Snakes, but Newts and Salamanders
                    henceforth are no more classed with Lizards. He leaves the Batrachians, however,
                    in the class of Reptiles as the fourth order. The first order comprises the
                    Chelonians, the second the Saurians (including Crocodiles and Lizards), the
                    third the Ophidians—terms which have been adopted by all succeeding naturalists.
                    Here, however, Brongniart’s merit on the classification of Reptiles ends, the
                    definition and disposition of the genera remaining much the same as in the works
                    of his predecessors.</p>
                <p>The activity in France in the field of natural science I was at this period, in
                    spite of the political disturbances, so great that only a few years after
                    Lacépède’s work another, almost identical in scope and of the same extent,
                    appeared, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle Générale et
                    Particulière des Reptiles</hi> of F. <hi rend="smallcaps">M. Daudin</hi> (Paris,
                    1802-3, 8 vols. 8vo). Written and illustrated with less care than that by
                    Lacépède, it is of greater importance to the herpetologists of the present day,
                    as it contains a considerable number of generic and specific forms described for
                    the first time. Indeed, at the end of the work, the author states that he has
                    examined more than eleven hundred specimens, belonging to five hundred and
                    seventeen species, all of which he has described from nature. The system adopted
                    is that of Brongniart, giving to the work a character by which the modern
                    herpetologist is most favourably impressed. The genera are well defined, but ill
                    arranged; it is, however, noteworthy that <hi rend="italic">Csecilia</hi> takes
                    now its place at the end of the Ophidians, and nearest to the succeeding order
                    of Batrachians.</p>
                <p>The next step in the development of the herpeto-logical system was the natural
                    arrangement of the genera. This involved a stupendous amount of labour; by a
                    careful thorough examination of all the types of Reptiles then known, reliable
                    characters had to bo discovered, and by means of the principle of the
                    subordination of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n452/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0452-0435"/>characters the genera had to be grouped into
                    families within Brongniart’s orders. Although many isolated contributions were
                    made by various workers, this task could be successfully undertaken and
                    completed in the Paris Museum only, in which, besides Seba’s and Lacepede’s
                    collections, many other herpetological treasures from other museums had been
                    deposited by the victorious generals of the empire, and to which through
                    Cuvier’s reputation objects from every part of the world were attracted in a
                    more peaceful and voluntary manner. The men who , devoted themselves to this
                    task were A. M. C. <hi rend="smallcaps">Dumeril, Oppel,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cuvier</hi> himself. It is the duty of the biographer rather
                    than the historian to ascertain what share of the merit in building up the new
                    system should be allotted to each of these three. Oppel was a German who, during
                    his visit to Paris (1807-8), attended the lectures of Dumeril and Cuvier, and at
                    the same time studied the materials to which access was given to him by the
                    latter in the most liberal manner. Dumeril <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Erpet. gener.,</hi> i. p. 259. </p></note>
                    maintains that Oppel’s ideas and information were entirely derived from his
                    lectures, and that Oppel himself avows this to be the case. The passage, <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Wäre es nicht die
                    Ermunterung . . . dieser Freunde gewesen, so würde ich überzeugt von den

                    (preface, p. viii). A few lines further on he emphatically declares that the
                    Classification is based upon his own researches. </p></note> however, to which
                    he refers is somewhat ambiguous; and it is certain that there is the greatest
                    possible difference between the arrangement published by Dumeril in 1806 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Zoologie Analytique,</hi> Paris, 8vo) and that proposed by Oppel
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Ordnun-gen, Familien, und Gattungen der Reptilien</hi>
                    (Munich, 1811, 4to). There is no doubt that Oppel profited largely by the
                    teaching of Dumeril; but, on the other hand, there is sufficient internal
                    evidence in the works of both authors, not only that Oppel worked independently,
                    but also that Dumeril and Cuvier owed much to their younger fellow-labourer, as
                    Cuvier himself indeed acknowledges more than once.</p>

                <p>In this classification we notice three points, which indicate a decided progress
                    towards a natural system. (1) The four orders proposed by Brongniart are no more
                    considered cosubordinate in the class, but the Saurians and Ophidians are
                    associated as sections of the same order, a view held by Aristotle but abandoned
                    by all following naturalists. The distinction between Lizards and Snakes is
                    carried out in so precise a manner that one genus only, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphisbsena,</hi> is wrongly placed. (2) The true Reptiles have now been
                    entirely divested of all heterogeneous elements by relegating positively <hi
                    rend="italic">Caecilia</hi> to the Batrachians, a view for which Oppel had been
                    fully prepared by Duméril, who pointed out in 1807 that “les cécilies se
                    rapprochent considérablement des batraciens auxquels elles semblent lier l’ordre
                    entier des serpens.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Mémoires de Zoologie et d’Anatomie Comparée,</hi> Paris,
                    1807, 8vo, p. 45. </p></note> (3) An attempt is made at arranging the genera
                    into families, some of which are still retained at the present day.</p>
                <p>In thus giving a well-merited prominence to Oppel’s labours, we are far from
                    wishing to detract from the influence exercised by the master spirit of this
                    period, Cuvier. Without his guidance Oppel probably never would have found a
                    place among the promoters of herpetological science. But Cuvier’s principal
                    researches on Reptiles were incidental or formed part of some more general plan;
                    Oppel concentrated his on this class only. The latter acquired a more correct
                    view as regards the higher divisions, while Cuvier was enabled by a more
                    detailed study of the genera to define certain families more precisely and
                    arrange them in a more natural manner, and to add not a few to the generic
                    forms. Cuvier adopts the four orders of Reptiles proposed by Brongniart as
                    equivalent elements of the class, and restores the Blind-worms and allied
                    Lizards, and, what is worse, also the Csecilias, to the Ophidians. The
                    Chamaeleons and Geckos are placed in separate groups, and the mode of dividing
                    the latter has been retained to the present day. Also a natural division of the
                    Snakes, although the foreign elements mentioned are admitted into the order, is
                    sufficiently indicated by his arrangement of the “vrais serpens proprement dits”
                    as (1) non-venomous Snakes, (2) venomous Snakes with several maxillary teeth,
                    and (3) venomous Snakes with isolated poison-fangs. Without entering into those
                    long descriptions of the species which continue to be the bane of modern
                    zoology, he distinguishes the species of Reptiles with a precision not attained
                    in any previous work, critically examining the literature and adding the
                    principal references.</p>
                <p>Cuvier’s researches into the osteology of Reptiles had not only the object of
                    forming the basis for their arrangement, but also of discovering the means of
                    understanding the fossil remains which now claimed the attention of French,
                    English, and German naturalists. Extinct Chelo-nian and Crocodilian remains, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pterodactylus, Ilosasaurus, Iguanodon, Ichthyosaurus,
                    Teleosaurus,</hi> became the subjects of Cuvier’s classical treatises which form
                    the contents of. the 5 th volume (part 2) of his <hi rend="italic">Recherches

                <p>All the succeeding herpetologists adopted either Oppel’s or Cuvier’s view as to
                    the number of orders of Reptiles, or as to the position Batrachians ought to'

                    is all the more significant as he designates the Reptiles <hi rend="italic"

                    clear indications of the relations which exist to the class of Birds on the one
                    hand, and to that of Fishes on the other; they are signs which cast their shadow
                    before them, but, unfortunately, Blainville himself did not follow <pb

                    the terms in a later edition of liis systematic tables.</p>
                <p>The direct or indirect influence of the work of French anatomists manifested
                    itself in the systems of the other herpetologists of this period. The
                    Crocodiles, especially, which hitherto (strange to say, even in Cuvier’s
                    classification) had been placed as one of the families of Saurians, now commence
                    to be separated from them. <hi rend="smallcaps">Merrem</hi> ( <hi rend="italic"
                    >Verstick eines Systems der Amphibien,</hi> Marburg, 1820, 8vo) distinguishes
                    two classes of “Amphibians,” <hi rend="italic">Pho-lidota</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Batrachia.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pholidota</hi> (or Reptiles) are divided into three orders,
                    distinguished chiefly by osteological and splanchnological characters:—</p>
                <p>1. Testudinata;</p>
                <p>2. Louicata (= Crocodiles);</p>
                <p>3. Squamata ( = Oppel’s Squamata, excluding Crocodiles).</p>
                <p>Merrem’s subdivision of the Squamata into (1) Gradientia</p>
                <p>( = limbed Lacertilia), (2) Repentia (=limbless Lacertilia), (3) Serpcntia
                    (־־Snakes and Amphisbsena), (4) Incedentia (= Chirotes), and (5) Predentia ( ־־
                    Chamseleons) was based chiefly on the modifications of the limbs, and not
                    adopted by his successors. The greater part of his work is occupied with a
                    synopsis of all the species of Reptiles known, each being shortly characterized
                    by a diagnosis; but, as only a small proportion (about one hundred and seventy)
                    were known to him from autopsy, this synopsis has all the faults of a
                    compilation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Latreille,</hi> who commenced the study of. Reptiles as
                    early as 1801, had kept pace with the progress of science when he published, in
                    1825, his <hi rend="italic">Families Nciturelles du Regne, Animal</hi> (Paris,
                    1825, 8vo). He separated the Batrachians as a <hi rend="italic">class</hi> from
                    the Reptiles, and the latter he divides into two sections only, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cataphracta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Squamosa</hi> ,— in the
                    former Crocodiles being associated with the Che-lonians. He bases this view on
                    the development of a carapace in both, on the structure of the feet, on the
                    fixed quadrate bone, on the single organ of copulation. None of the succeeding
                    herpetologists adopted a combination founded on such important characters except
                    J. E. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gray,</hi> who, however, destroyed Latreille’s idea
                    of <hi rend="italic">Cataphracta</hi> by adding the Amphisbaenians <note

                    museums. Among others, Spix had brought from his travels in Brazil a rich spoil

                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">System.</hi></p></note> who, endowed with
                    an ardent imagination, only too frequently misinterpreted the evidence of facts,
                    or forced it into the service of preconceived ideas. Cuvier had drawn attention
                    to certain resemblances in some parts of the osseous structure of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pterodactylus</hi> to
                    Dolphins, Birds, Crocodiles, «fee. Wagler, seizing upon such analogical
                    resemblances, separated those extinct Saurians from the class of Reptiles, and
                    formed of them and the Monotremes a distinct class of Vertebrates, intermediate
                    between Mammals and Birds, which he called <hi rend="italic">Gryphi.</hi> When
                    we consider that the discovery of the mode of propagation of the Monotremes is
                    probably reserved for the present decennium, and that the propagation of those
                    extinct Reptiles may remain an unsolved mystery, we must admit that Wagler has
                    made free use of his imagination by defining his class of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gryphi</hi> as “vertebrates with lungs lying free in the pectoral cavity;
                    oviparous; development of the embryo (within or) without the parent; the young
                    fed (or suckled!) by the parents.” By the last character this Waglerian class is
                    distinguished from the Reptiles.</p>
                <p>Reptiles (in which Wagler includes Batrachians) are divided into eight orders :—
                    <hi rend="italic">Testudines, Crocodili, Lacertse, Serpentes, Angues, Csecilioe,
                    Ranse,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ichthyodi.</hi> He has great merit in having
                    employed, for the subdivision of the families of Lizards, the structure of the
                    tongue and the mode of insertion of the teeth in the jaws. On the other hand,
                    however well the genera of Snakes are defined by him—and their number has been
                    increased to ninety-six— Wagler has entirely failed in arranging them in natural
                    families, venomous and non-venomous types being mixed in the majority of his
                    groups.</p>
                <p>L. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fitzinger</hi> was Wagler’s contemporary; his first work
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Neue
                    Classification der Reptilien nach ihren natürlichen Verwandtschaften,</hi>
                    Vienna, 1826, 4to. </p></note> preceded Wagler’s system by four years. As he
                    says in the preface, his object was to arrange the Reptiles in “a natural
                    system, a system in which the objects are arranged in accordance with their
                    greatest similarity, with their natural affinities. Such a system is a faithful
                    image of the gradual progress of nature, expressed in words.” Unfortunately, in
                    order to attain this object, Fitzinger paid regard to the most superficial
                    points of resemblance; and in the <hi rend="italic">tabula affinitatum
                    generum</hi> which he constructed to demonstrate “the progress of nature” he has
                    been much more successful in placing closely allied generic forms in contiguity
                    than in tracing the relationships of the higher groups. That table is prepared
                    in the form of a genealogical tree, but Fitzinger wished to express thereby
                    merely the amount of morphological resemblance, and there is no evidence
                    whatever in the text that he had a clear idea of genetic affinity. The
                    Batrachians are placed at the bottom of the scheme, leading through <hi
                    rend="italic">llyla</hi> to the Geckos (clearly on account of the digital
                    dilatations) and through <hi rend="italic">Gsecilia</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphisbsena.</hi> At the top <hi rend="italic">Draco</hi> leads through <hi
                    rend="italic">Pterodactylus</hi> to the Bats <hi rend="italic">(Pieropus),
                    Ichthyosaurus</hi> to the Cetaceans ( <hi rend="italic">Delphinus</hi> ), <hi
                    rend="italic">Ernys</hi> to the Monotremes, <hi rend="italic">Testudo</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">Manis</hi> , and the Marine Turtles to the Divers and
                    Penguins.</p>
                <p>In Fitzinger’s system the higher groups are, in fact, identical with those
                    proposed by Merrem, while greater originality is shown in the subdivision of the
                    orders. He differed also widely from Wagler in his views as to the relations of
                    the extinct forms. The order of <hi rend="italic">Loricata</hi> consists of two
                    families, the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosauroidea</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crocodiloidea,</hi> the former comprising <hi rend="italic">Iguanodon,
                    Plesiosaurus, Saurocephalus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus.</hi> In
                    the order <hi rend="italic">Squamata</hi> Lacer-tilians and Ophidians are
                    combined and divided into twenty-two families, almost all based on the most
                    conspicuous external characters: the first two, viz., the Geckos and
                    Chamseleons, are natural enough, but in the three following Iguanoids and
                    Agamoids are sadly mixed, Pterodactyles and <hi rend="italic">Draco</hi> forming
                    one family; <hi rend="italic">Mcgalosaums, Mosasaurus, Varanus, Tcjus, he.,</hi>
                    are associated in another named <hi rend="italic">Ameivoidea;</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphisbsenidse</hi> are correctly defined; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colubroidea</hi> are a heterogenous assemblage of thirty genera; but with his
                    family of <hi rend="italic">Bungaroidea</hi> Fitzinger makes an attempt to
                    separate at least a part of the venomous Colubrine Snakes from the Viperines,
                    which again are differentiated from the last family, that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crotaloidea.</hi></p>
                <p>There is sufficient evidence in this early publication that Fitzinger had at that
                    time a good eye for seizing upon those characters by which the creation of small
                    groups, such as genera, is regulated, and if this little work had been his only
                    performance in the field of herpetology his name would have been honourably
                    mentioned among his fellow-workers. But the promise of his early labours was not
                    justified by his later work, and if we take notice of the latter here it is only
                    because his name has become attached to many a Reptile through the pedantic
                    rules of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n454/mode/1up"

                    Müller, Duméril, and Bibron exercised no influence on him, and when he commenced
                    to publish a new system of Reptiles in 1843, <note anchored="true"

                    appeared, he exhibited a classification in which morphological facts are
                    entirely superseded by fanciful ideas of the vaguest kind of physiosophy, each
                    class of vertebrates being divided into five “sense” series, and each series
                    into three orders, one comprising forms of superior, the second of medium, and
                    the third of inferior development. In the generic arrangement of the species, to
                    which Fitzinger devoted himself especially in this work, he equally failed to
                    advance science. From a superficial study of such species as were accessible to
                    him, but chiefly from the descriptions of other authors, he selected any
                    characters for the establishment of genera, and, abandoning entirely the value
                    of a genus as a systematic category, he introduced a number of names, under the
                    cloak of which he hid the superficiality of his work; many were adopted by his
                    successors, who, however, had to substantiate their validity by a deeper study
                    of the taxonomic characters.</p>
                <p>We have now arrived at a period distinguished by the appearance of a work which,
                    by the ability of its authors, by the comprehensiveness of its scope, by the
                    treatment of the general subject as well as of the details, superseded all its
                    predecessors, which formed the basis for the labours of many succeeding years,
                    and which will always remain one of the classical monuments of descriptive
                    zoology, — the <hi rend="italic">Erpétologie Générale ou Histoire Naturelle
                    complète des Reptiles</hi> of A. M. C. <hi rend="smallcaps">Duméril</hi> and G.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Bibron</hi> (Paris, 8vo). The first volume appeared in
                    1834, and the ninth and last in 1854. No naturalist of that time could have been
                    better qualified for the tremendous undertaking than C. Duméril, who almost from
                    the first year of half a century’s connexion with the then largest collection of
                    <hi rend="italic">Reptilia</hi> had chiefly devoted himself to their study. The
                    task would have been too great for the energy of a single man; it was,
                    therefore, fortunate for Duméril that he found a most devoted fellow-labourer in
                    one of his assistants, G. Bibron, whose abilities equalled those of the master,
                    but who, to the great loss of science, died (in 1848) before the completion of
                    the work. Duméril had the full benefit of Bibron’s knowledge for the volumes
                    containing the Snakes, but the last volume, which treats of the Tailed
                    Batrachians, had to be prepared by Duméril alone.</p>
                <p>The work is the first which gives a comprehensive scientific account of Reptiles
                    generally, their structure, physiology, and literature. Nearly the whole of the
                    first volume is devoted to these chapters. And again each of the four orders
                    admitted by the authors is introduced by a similar general account. In the body
                    of the work 121 Chelonians, 468 Saurians, 586 Ophidians, and 218 Batra-chians
                    are described in detail and with the greatest precision, On the principles of
                    arrangement of the various orders we shall have to speak subsequently, and we
                    mention here only that, singularly enough, the authors revert to Brongniart’s
                    arrangement, in which the Batrachians are co-ordinate with the other three
                    orders of Reptiles. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    adopted for these historical notes, we had to refer in their proper places to
                    two herpetologists, Blainville and Latreille, who advocated a deeper than merely
                    ordinal separation of Reptiles from Batrachians, and who were followed by F. S.
                    Leuckart. But this view only now began to find more general acceptance. J. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Müller</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Stannius</hi> were guided
                    in their classification entirely by anatomical characters, and consequently
                    recognized the wide gap which separates the Batrachians from the Reptiles; yet
                    they considered them merely as subclasses of the class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia.</hi> The former directed his attention particularly to those forms
                    which seemed to occupy an intermediate position between Lacertilians and
                    Ophidians, and definitely relegated <hi rend="italic">Anguis, Pseudopus</hi> ,

                    that the weight of facts demanded such a class separation, but that the Reptiles
                    hold the same relation to Birds as the Batrachians to Fishes. In his Hunterian
                    Lectures (1863) he divided the vertebrates into Mammals, Sauroids, and
                    Ichthyoids, subsequently substituting for the last two the terms <hi

                    osteological characters on which Huxley based his division, yet admitted into
                    his consideration those taken from the organs of circulation and respiration,
                    and reverted to Latreille’s division of warm-and cold-blooded (haematothermal
                    and haematocryal) vertebrates, thus approximating the Batrachians to Reptiles,
                    and separating them from Birds. He says <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Vertebrates,</hi> London, 1866,
                    8vo, vol. i. p. 6. </p></note> —</p>
                <p>“Although the Arcs and Mammalia agree as hot-blooded vertebrates in their higher
                    cerebral development and in the more complex heart and lungs, Birds, by genetic
                    and developmental characters as well as by the general plan of their
                    organization, are more intimately and naturally allied to the Oviparous Saurian
                    s than to the Viviparous Mammals. In their generation and development modern
                    Batrachians differ from other cold-blooded air-breathers, and agree with Fishes.
                    Present knowledge of extinct forms more clearly exposes the artificial nature of
                    the primary groups of the oviparous vertebrates. An important link, the
                    Ptcrosauria, or Flying Reptiles, with wings and air-sacs, more closely
                    connecting Birds with the actual remnant of the Reptilian class, has passed
                    away. Other extinct orders (Ganoeephala and Labyrintliodontia) have demonstrated
                    the artificial nature of the distinction between Fishes and Reptiles, and the
                    close transitions that connect together ail the cold-blooded Vertebrates.”</p>

                <p>As this ordinal arrangement deals in a uniform measure with extinct as well as
                    living Reptiles, it is more complete than, and marks as great a progress in the
                    history of herpetology as, any of the classifications recorded hitherto.</p>
                <p>The study of fossil Reptiles had been continued after Cuvier by many workers, as
                    Goldfuss, E. Geoffroy St Hilaire, Harlan, Mantell, G. F. Jäger, Phillips, Leidy,
                    Falconer, Cautley, Alton, Bronn, Kaup, Quenstedt, and especially H. von Meyer,
                    who devoted the whole of his extra-official time to drawing with his own hand
                    numerous treasures preserved in Continental collections. But none contributed
                    more to the knowledge of fossil Reptiles than Owen himself. Indefatigable in
                    collecting materials, and able to bring to bear upon the subject an unsurpassed
                    knowledge ranging over the whole field of comparative anatomy, he was unrivalled
                    in elucidating the affinities of fossil remains as well as in the production of
                    graphic descriptions. He showed that the number of living Reptilian types bears
                    but a small proportion to that of extinct forms, and, therefore, that a
                    systematic arrangement of the entire class must be chiefly based upon dental and
                    osteological characters.</p>
                <p>In this he was followed by <hi rend="smallcaps">Huxley</hi> and CorE who,
                    however, have restricted still more the selection of classi-ficatory characters
                    by relying for the purposes of arrangement on a few parts of the skeleton only.
                    This is a matter of necessity in dealing with fossil remains, but a tendency has
                    thereby been fostered in our times of applying the same principles in the
                    subdivision of living Reptiles to the greater or less exclusion of the
                    consideration of other parts of their organization.</p>
                <p>Huxley and Cope attempted a further grouping of the orders which in Owen’s system
                    were merely serially enumerated as cosubordinate groups. Huxley used for 1 this
                    purpose almost exclusively the position and character of the rib-articulations
                    to the vertebral centre, the orders themselves being the same as in Owen’s
                    system :—</p>

                <p>After having followed the general history of herpetology to the present period,
                    we have to mention the works by which our knowledge of certain orders or of the
                    various Reptilian faunas has been specially advanced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crocodilia and Lacertilia.</hi> —We have already shown that the
                    animals of these two orders were by the earlier authors thrown together in one
                    group, of which a natural subdivision into families was attempted by Oppel and
                    Cuvier, that Merrem (1820) was the first to recognize in the Crocodiles a
                    separate group for which he proposed the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Loricata,</hi> being followed therein by Blainville, who named the group <hi
                    rend="italic">Emydo-sauriens,</hi> and that Latreille actually recognized their
                    affinities to the Chelonians, uniting them under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cataphracta.</hi> In Wagler’s and Fitzinger’s systems a distinct advance is
                    manifested by the employment of the tongue and also of the dentition as
                    important characters. These, combined with the scutellation, the form of the
                    toes, and the entire habitus, were also the characters on which the subsequent
                    classifications by Wiegmann, Dumeril and Bibron, Gray, and Stannius were based,
                    the classifications varying according to the manner in which those characters
                    are subordinated to one another. But, while the German and English
                    herpetologists assign to the Amphisbsenians, Chamoeleons, and Crocodiles a rank
                    more or less above, and distant from, the Lacertilian families, Dumeril and
                    Bibron take a singularly retrograde step in dividing Lizards into eight
                    equivalent families, of which the first comprises the Crocodiles, and the second
                    the Chanrue-leons, the Amphisbsenians forming part of the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Chalcididae.</hi> Gray was the last who dared to place the
                    narrow-mouthed Snakes such as <hi rend="italic">Typhlops</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhinophis</hi> among Lizai’ds.</p>
                <p>In the two most recent classifications of the families of Lizards osteological
                    (or rather craniological) characters supersede almost entirely those previously
                    employed. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cope,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In a short sketch like the present it would be impossible to refer even to a

                    of Lizards has been advanced within the last forty years, either by adding to
                    that of species previously imperfectly known, or by describing new generic and
                    specific forms. But an idea of this increase may be formed by a comparison of
                    Gray’s and Boulenger’s catalogues; whilst the former enumerated 186 species out
                    of the families <hi rend="italic">Geckonidx</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    Neither C. Duméril nor Merrem, Fitzinger nor Wagler, indicated the way towards a
                    more natural arrangement; it seemed almost as if with the increase of the number
                    of distinct genera their arrangement became more and more hopeless. In the
                    meantime the Rijks Museum of Leyden had enriched itself under the able direction
                    of Temminck, through the efforts of traveller-naturalists like Reinwardt, Kuhl,

                    arrange them in a natural or logical system. All the more remarkable, therefore,
                    is the production by H. Schlegel of an <hi rend="italic">Essai surla Physionomie
                    des Serpens</hi> (Leyden, 1837; 2 vols. 8vo, with atlas in fol.). In this
                    classical work the whole of the subject is treated throughout in a scientific
                    manner; the species are described with a clear discernment of really distinctive
                    characters, the description being generally accompanied with a faithful outline
                    figure of the head, and with a critical examination of the literature. Schlegel,
                    besides, has the merit of having recognized the great importance of exactness
                    with regard to localities, and of giving a general account of the geographical
                    distribution of Snakes. The principle of classification adopted by Schlegel,
                    indeed, is not one which will be recognized as final or even as legitimate at
                    the present time, but it is one which is preferable to that employed by Müller,
                    Duméril, and Bibron, which led, as we shall see presently, to the most
                    artificial grouping of species. He divided the Snakes into families according to
                    their “physiognomy,” that is “l'impression totale que fait sur nous l’ensemble
                    d’un être quelconque, impression que l'on peut sentir, mais qu’il est impossible
                    de rendre au moyen de paroles; elle est le résultat de l’harmonie de toutes les
                    parties isolées, dont on embrasse la confirmation d’un coup d’oeil, et dans
                    leurs rapports mutuels.” Schlegel had no training in, or knowledge of, anatomy;
                    he, therefore, ignored Müller’s researches which appeared a few years before his
                    work; yet it is noteworthy that his classification stands in the main, and has
                    not yet been superseded. He divides Snakes as follows :—</p>
                <p>I. Non-venomous Snakes.</p>

                <p>Fam. 6. Boas.</p>
                <p>Gen. Boa, Python, Acrochordus.</p>
                <p>II. Venomous Snakes.</p>
                <p>Fam. 7. Colubriform.</p>
                <p>Gen. Εlaps, Bungamis, Naja.</p>
                <p>Fam. 8. Marine.</p>
                <p>Gen. Hydrophis.</p>
                <p>Fam. 9. Venomous Snakes proper.</p>
                <p>Gen. Trigonocephalus, Crotalus, Vipera.</p>
                <p>Already in 1832 J. Müller had proposed “a natural classification of Snakes on
                    anatomical principles,” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the hitherto dubious forms of Ophidians, but in the end based his arrangement
                    entirely on the structure of the jaws and on the dentition. As he did not extend
                    his examination into other parts of the organization of the various genera, it
                    may suffice here to state that he divided all Snakes into two sections, the
                    first of which <hi rend="italic"> (Ophidia microstomata)</hi> comprised the four
                    families <hi rend="italic"> Amphisbaenoidea, Typhlopina, Uropeltacea,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic"> Tortricina,</hi> and the second <hi rend="italic">(Ophidia
                    macrostomata)</hi> all the other Snakes, which he referred to seven
                    families.</p>
                <p>The direction thus indicated by Müller was followed by Dumeril and Bibron, who,
                    however, by their much more detailed knowledge of Snakes, were enabled to
                    subdivide the unwieldy categories formed by Müller; also the genera which in
                    Schlegel's system comprised Snakes with very different dentition had to be
                    subdivided, and were defined with greater precision than had been done by any
                    previous herpetologist. They divide Snakes into five equivalent sections <note

                    nomenclature. </p></note> :—</p>

                <p>2. Aglyphodontes. Teeth in both jaws, none grooved: 12 families and 86
                    genera.</p>
                <p>3. Opisthoglyphes. Posterior maxillary teeth grooved: 6 families and 37
                    genera.</p>

                <p>5. Solénoglyphes. Anterior maxillary teeth perforated and iso lated: 2 families
                    and 13 genera.</p>
                <p>The progress made in ophiology from the time of the appearance of this work down
                    to the present period consists rather in the increase of our knowledge of the
                    great variety of species and genera than in the further development of the
                    system. Gray, Reinhardt, Peters, Günther, Cope, Bocage, Jan, Krefft, and others
                    described a large number of forms, so that the number of those known to Duméril
                    and Bibron has now been perhaps trebled or quadrupled. Unfortunately, no general
                    work corresponding to the present state of science exists. But two works
                    published subsequently to the <hi rend="italic">Erpétologie générale</hi> are
                    indispensable to the student.</p>
                <p>The first is the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Specimens of Snakes in the
                    Collection of the British Museum,</hi> of which the first part, containing the
                    Viperine Snakes, Water-Snakes, and Boas, by J. E. Gray, appeared in 1849, and
                    the second, containing the Colubrines, by A. Günther in 1858. The
                    classification, which was much behind its time, was fixed by the former of the
                    two authors, so that the latter had to accommodate the arrangement of his part
                    to that of his predecessor. However, he strongly opposed the application of the
                    character of grooved posterior teeth to the formation of large sections, and
                    generally adopted the principle advocated by Schlegel, whose generic groups were
                    raised into families. A great number of Snakes unknown to Duméril are described
                    in these catalogues, whilst others which happened not to be represented in the
                    British Museum are omitted.</p>

                    the families created by Günther, but institutes under each two divisions, <hi

                    great merit is the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Iconographie générale

                    Museum or lent to him by other institutions, and which thus forms an invaluable
                    aid in the determination of species. The author died during the progress of the
                    work, but it was continued by his artist, Sordelli. No descriptive letter-press
                    worthy of the name accompanies this work.</p>

                <p>Reptiles are vertebrate animals, the skin of which is covered with horny or bony
                    plates (scales or scutes). The heart has two auricles, but with the ventricular
                    chamber generally incompletely divided; two arterial trunks emerge from the
                    right portion of the ventricle; the blood of the arterial and venous systems
                    mixes either in the heart or at the origin of the aortic arches. Respiration
                    takes place by lungs, never by bronchiae; portions of the lungs are simple
                    without minute subdivision of the cavity; and the respira-</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0459-0442"/>tory movements are slow and irregular. In
                    consequence, Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. Their blood-corpuscles are red
                    and nucleated. The thoracic and abdominal viscera are never separated by a
                    complete diaphragm. The intestinal tract and the urogenital organs open into a
                    common cloaca; the oviducts are developed from the Müllerian ducts, and dilated
                    in their lower course for the reception of the ova; all Reptiles are oviparous
                    or ovoviviparous.</p>
                <p>The vertebral column articulates with the skull almost invariably by means of a
                    single convex occipital condyle. The mandible consists of several distinct
                    pieces, of which the articular bone articulates with a quadrate bone, interposed
                    between skull and mandible. When the appendicular parts of the skeleton are
                    present, the sternum is never replaced by membrane bone, and the posterior
                    sternal ribs are attached to a median prolongation of the sternum. The ilia are
                    prolonged farther behind the acetabulum than in front of it; the pubic bones
                    directed downward and forward, and, like the ischia, forming a median symphysis.
                    The metatarsal bones are not anchylosed among themselves or with the distal
                    tarsal bones.</p>
                <p>As in Birds and Mammals, the foetus of Reptiles is enclosed in an amnion and
                    allantois <hi rend="italic">(Amniota),</hi> and nourished from the vitellus of
                    the egg.</p>
                <p>In some of the most important characters mentioned above Reptiles agree with
                    Birds, as in the presence of a single occipital condyle, a complex lower jaw
                    articulated to the skull by a quadrate bone, and nucleated blood-corpuscles. The
                    majority of naturalists, therefore, consider the two classes to constitute one
                    of the main divisions of Vertebrates, the <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida.</hi> At
                    the present epoch, indeed, Birds are strikingly differentiated from Reptiles,
                    but the discoveries within recent years of a number of extinct Birds with
                    Reptilian characters offer ample evidence that Birds are the descendants of some
                    branch or branches of the Reptilian type, in which the power of flight was
                    developed, and with it other anatomical peculiarities by which Birds are now
                    distinguished from living Reptiles.</p>

                    scapulae; a pair of broad not overlapping coracoids form the posterior part of
                    the pectoral arch. A sternum is replaced by a series of abdominal splints.</p>

                    which are Lacertilian in most of their characters. Vertebrae biconcave, four or
                    five of them anchylosed together and forming a sacrum. The tubercular and
                    capitular articulations are separated, the former and longer being on the
                    diapophysis, the latter and shorter on the centrum; ribs movable, the anterior
                    with a bifurcate head. Os quadratum suturally connected with the skull. A
                    foramen parietale is present. Jaws Chelonian and probably cased in horny

                <p>Of the various modifications that have been proposed in the classification of
                    Reptiles the more important are mentioned in the historical part of this
                    article. We adopt here a serial arrangement of those orders which seem to be
                    well established, having already referred to the attempts that have been made to
                    arrange these orders into higher groups.</p>
                <p>Order 1. Ichtiiyopterygia (extinct). Marine Reptiles with a Cetacean-like naked
                    body and with four limbs formed into paddles, the parts of which after the
                    humerus are not differentiated as to form or function. Tail long. Vertebrce
                    numerous, biconcave; no sacrum. Dorsal vertebrae with double tubercles; ribs
                    movable, the anterior with bifurcate heads. Head large, with long powerful
                    snout, joined to the trunk without neck. Quadrate bone immovably articulated to
                    squamosal. A foramen parietale is present. Orbits very large with a circle of
                    sclerotic edentulous or each maxillary bone was armed with a long evergrowing
                    tusk, which sometimes was accompanied by other smaller teeth. The pectoral arch
                    consisted of scapula and coracoid, but a clavicle seems to have been absent.
                    Pelvis very strong, with continuous ischio-pubic symphysis.</p>
                <p>Genera: <hi rend="italic">Dicynodon, Galesaurus.</hi></p>
                <p>Order 3. Dinosauria (extinct). This comprises Reptiles of a great diversity of
                    form and size, some adapted for a terrestrial, others for an aquatic life, some
                    carnivorous, the majority herbivorous, but all distinguished by characters
                    leading more or less closely from the Reptilian up to the Avian type. The
                    majority of trunk vertebrae have fiat or slightly concave articular ends,
                    sometimes a few of the anterior are convex in front; cervical vertebrae
                    numerous; a sacrum is formed by more than two coalesced vertebrae. Neural arches
                    united to the centra by sutures. Thoracic ribs movable, with a bifurcate head;
                    cervical ribs united to the vertebrae either by suture or anchylosed.</p>

                <p>Os quadratum suturally connected with the skull. The premaxillary bones are
                    separate, and the rami of the lower jaw united in front by cartilage only. Form
                    of the teeth variable; they are not anchylosed to the bone. Two pairs of limbs
                    are present, of which the hinder pair is the longer and larger, and generally
                    ambulatory. The structure of the pelvis and hind limbs partly Ornithic; the
                    pelvic bones are not coalesced with each other or with the sacrum; the pubis
                    enters into the formation of the acetabulum, and the ilium is prolonged forwards
                    in front of the acetabulum; ischia united in a median ventral symphysis. The
                    head of the femur is placed at a right angle to the condyles; tibia with a
                    procnemial crest, and a ridge for the fibula, which is complete. The proximal
                    row of tarsals is formed by the astragalus and calcanéum only, and the former
                    sometimes anchylosed with the tibia, thus forming the upper portion of the
                    ankle-joint. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the

                <p>All the Dinosaurian remains known at present belong to the Mesozoic age; they
                    appear first in the Triassic, but the majority from these formations are so
                    fragmentary that their classification is subject to much uncertainty. Some at
                    least of the celebrated three-toed footprints which were discovered some fifty
                    years ago in the United States, and about the origin of which much uncertainty
                    existed, are evidently those of Dinosaurs. In the Jurassic these Reptiles
                    attained their greatest development, Marsh distinguishing among the fossils of
                    this period four orders with numerous families. The largest exceeded auy other

                <p>The disproportion in length and strength between the fore and hind limbs clearly

                    Reptiles, and was bipedal at least in some of the genera. In assuming an erect
                    position, their long tail assisted them in balancing the body. Some possessed a
                    dermal armour, the scutes being sometimes produced into enormous spines; others
                    were provided with defensive weapons in the shape of spines attached to the
                    fore-feet. The teeth vary exceedingly: in some of the carnivorous genera they
                    are sharp, pointed, serrated, and recurved, in others flat, in others broad and
                    molar-like; in some the preniaxillae are toothed, in others toothless and

                    appear first in the Triassic, but the majority from these formations are so
                    fragmentary that their classification is subject to much uncertainty. Some at
                    least of the celebrated three-toed footprints which were discovered some fifty
                    years ago in the United States, and about the origin of which much uncertainty
                    existed, are evidently those of Dinosaurs. In the Jurassic these Reptiles
                    attained their greatest development, Marsh distinguishing among the fossils of
                    this period four orders with numerous families. The largest exceeded atιy other
                    land animal in size, and measured from 50 to 80 feet. Dinosaurs continued to the

                <p>Order C. Sauropterygia (extinct). Marine Reptiles with long neck, small head,
                    long tail, natatory limbs, and a naked skin. Hind and fore limbs identical in
                    structure and form, transformed into Cetacean-like paddles with five digits,
                    which were composed of numerous phalanges and enclosed in a common skin. Teeth
                    in a single row in both jaws, implanted in distinct sockets. Vertebrae
                    amphicoel-ous, with the neuro-central suture persistent; singleheaded ribs are
                    attached to the long diapophyses of the dorsal vertebrae. Sacral vertebrae two.
                    Quadrate bone Suturally united with the skull. A parietal foramen. No sclerotic
                    ring. Neither sternal ribs nor sternum are and Lower Eocene by Champsosaurus, in

                    rudimentary transverse processes; sacral vertebrae not exceeding two; ribs
                    single-headed. Os quadratum articulated with the skull. Parts of the ali-and
                    orbito-sphenoid regions fibro-cartilaginous. Temporal region without, or with
                    only one, osseous bar. Limbs four, two, or absent; when they are present, a
                    sternum with sternal ribs and a pelvis are developed. Copulatory organs paired;
                    urinary bladder present. Integuments with horny or sometimes bony scutes.</p>
                <p>For the numerous recent genera see Lizards. Distinguidiable representatives of
                    the order appear first in Jurassic formations and thence downward to our period:
                    Acrosaums, Ardeosaunis, Pleuro-saurus, Saphdosaurus, Atoposaunis, and
                    Homoeosaurus from the Oolite; Nuthetes, Saurillus, Macellodon from the Wealden;
                    Dolicho-saurus, Acteosaurus, Coniosaurus, Rhaphiosaunis from the Chalk. From
                    Tertiary formations in Europe numerous small remains are known, whilst those
                    described from Australia belonged to much larger forms, showing more or less
                    affinities to the Lizards of the present Australian fauna.</p>
                <p>A distinct division of this order includes the extinct Mosasaurians, which arc,
                    in fact, the Pinnipedes among Lacertilians. Their limbs, of which they had two
                    pairs, are transformed into paddles; by their long Snake-like <pb break="no"

                    nearest approach in nature to the modern creature of imagination, the
                    “Sea-Snake.” There is no question that they deviate more from the Lacertilian
                    type than any of the other fossil forms mentioned above, especially in some of
                    their cranial characters, which are more Ophidian. Hence Cope placed them into a
                    distinct order of Reptiles, <hi rend="italic"> Pythonomorpha.</hi> Their body
                    was covered with osseous scutes.</p>
                <p>Besides Mosasaurus, remains of which have been known and described since the year
                    1766, a number of other genera from Cretaceous rocks of Europe and North America
                    have been distinguished by Owen, Cope, Marsh, and Dollo: Liodon, Clidastes (fig.
                    2), Sironectes, Platecarpus, Baptosaurus, Diplotomodon, Edestosmmis, Holosaums,

                <p>Order 9. Ophidia. Snakes. Vertebrae procoelous, extremely numerous; no sacrum;
                    ribs single-headed. No chevron bones on any of the vertebrae. Not only the
                    quadrate bone is movably articulated to the skull, but also the Suspensorium and
                    the bones of the palatal maxillary apparatus are movable; brain capsule entirely
                    osseous. No quadrato-jugal arch. No foramen parietale. Rami of the mandible
                    united by ligament. No trace of anterior extremities, and posterior only
                    sometimes rudi-mentally indicated. Copulatory organs paired; urinary bladder
                    absent. Integuments folded into regularly arranged scales.</p>
                <p>For the numerous recent genera see Snakes. Fossil forms are scarce, and do not
                    appear before the Eocene (Laophis, Ralaeophis, Raleryx).</p>
                <p>Order 10. Chelonia. Tortoises and Turtles. Cervical and dorsal vertebrae not
                    numerous. The dorsal vertebrae and expanded ribs (with the exception of <hi
                    rend="italic"> Sphargis)</hi> are united into a carapace, the elements of which
                    are immovable, and which is completed ventrally by a number of dermal bones, a
                    true sternum being absent and replaced by a plastron. All the bones of the skull
                    are suturally united, with the exception of the mandible and hyoid; the dentary
                    portion of the mandible consists of one bone only. Pectoral arch consisting of
                    the scapula, with which the precoracoid is united, and the coracoid. Clavicles
                    are represented by the anterior elements of the plastron. The pelvis consists of
                    the usual bones, but is not attached to a sacrum. Two pairs of limbs. No teeth,
                    these being replaced by horny sheaths of the jaws. Copulatory organ single.
                    Integuments consisting of horny scutes covering the carapace, and of scales and
                    tubercles on the soft parts.</p>
                <p>For the numerous living genera see Tortoises. Remains of extinct Tortoises are
                    found from the Trias downwards, but they do not show any approximation to some
                    other Reptilian type, or indicate a successive development. The most generalized
                    type, Sphargis, is not older (according to present evidence) than some of the
                    more specialized genera, its earliest representative being the remarkable
                    Rrotostega from North-American Cretacean formations. Some of the Tertiary
                    fossils exceeded in size the largest of living forms, suchasthe Himalayan

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Anatomy of Reptiles.</hi></p>
                <p>As the principal features known of the anatomy of extinct Reptiles have been
                    sufficiently noticed in the several separate articles devoted to them, this
                    chapter will deal almost exclusively with the general structure of living
                    forms.</p>
                <p>Inasmuch as the class of Reptiles is one of the classes which make up that great
                    primary zoological division known as “vertebrate animals,” they of course
                    possess all those structural characters which are common to that division (see
                    Vertebrata). They also possess in common a certain number of structures which
                    they share with</p>
                <p>Birds (see Sauropsida), and which will be indicated in our notice of the
                    different sets, or systems, of organs which compose the bodies of the animals of
                    which this article treats.</p>
                <p>Every Reptile has a body made up of a head, a trunk, and a tail, though, as in
                    some <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia</hi> and many <hi rend="italic">Ophidia,</hi>
                    these regions are not marked off one from another by any constriction or
                    noticeable alteration of diameter. The posterior aperture of the alimentary tube
                    always marks the termination of the trunk and the commencement of the tail. In
                    some kinds of Reptiles—as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the genera <hi
                    rend="italic"> Anguis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amphisbaena</hi> amongst the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia,</hi> and in such forms as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Typhlops</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Uropeltis</hi> amongst the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Ophidia</hi> —the whole body consists of little more than a very
                    elongated trunk with a small head at one end and a short or even quite
                    rudimentary tail at the other. A neck may be interposed between the head and the
                    trunk; this, however, is generally short, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lacertilia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia,</hi> but may be more or much
                    elongated, as in the <hi rend="italic">Chelonia.</hi> It was extraordinarily
                    long in the extinct <hi rend="italic">Sauropterygia—</hi> like that of a
                    Swan.</p>
                <p>The head may be very large, as in the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> and
                    extinct <hi rend="italic">Ichthyopterygia,</hi> or small, as in the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Sauropterygia,</hi> or very small indeed, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    > Typhlops</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Uropeltis.</hi> It always contains the
                    organs of taste, smell, hearing, and sight, but there may be, as in many Lizards
                    and all Snakes, no external indication of an ear, and the eyes are almost hidden
                    by the skin in Snakes such as <hi rend="italic">Typhlops,</hi> and certain
                    Lizards such as Amphisbaenians and some Skinks. The mouth may be very large, as
                    in the Crocodiles, or very small, as in <hi rend="italic"> Typhlops.</hi></p>
                <p>The trunk may be exceedingly elongated, as in the instances just above referred
                    to, or relatively very short and broad, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chelonia.</hi></p>
                <p>The tail may vary in development from its rudimentary condition in <hi
                    rend="italic"> Typhlops</hi> to a length which exceeds that of the body several
                    times, as in not a few <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia.</hi> Its distal end may be
                    prehensile and form an important grasping organ, as in almost all
                    Chamaeleons.</p>
                <p>Besides these regions, there are generally two pairs of limbs,—one pectoral, the
                    other pelvic,—though these may be altogether wanting as far as regards any
                    external manifestation, as in all Ophidians and certain Lacertilians like <hi
                    rend="italic"> Anguis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ophisaurus.</hi> Internal
                    rudiments of limbs may, however, be present when there is no external indication
                    of them, as will be pointed out when describing the appendicular skeleton.</p>
                <p>There may be but one pair of limbs, and these pectoral, as in the Lizard <hi
                    rend="italic"> Chirotes;</hi> or there may be but one pair, which are pelvic, as
                    in the Lizards <hi rend="italic">Pseudopus, Lialis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                    Ophiodes.</hi></p>
                <p>The pectoral and pelvic limbs are, as a rule, pretty equal in development, and
                    they may be very much so, as in Chelonians and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauropterygia.</hi> Both may be exceedingly small, as in many Lizards, such as
                    a number of the <hi rend="italic">Seincidae,</hi> or both may be relatively
                    large, as in Cheloni-ans. In no existing Reptile with four limbs does either
                    pair very greatly exceed the other in length and size, but in extinct <hi
                    rend="italic"> Pinosauria</hi> the pelvic limbs were greatly in excess, while
                    the reverse was the case with the extinct <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithosauria.</hi></p>
                <p>The extremities never terminate in more than five distinct digits, and the number
                    may be reduced to one in front, as in <hi rend="italic">Rhodona,</hi> or one
                    behind, as in <hi rend="italic">Pibamus.</hi> The extremities may end bluntly
                    and be undivided, as in land and marine Chelonians, and as in the extinct <hi
                    rend="italic">Ichthyop-terygia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sauropterygia.</hi>
                    The pectoral and pelvic limbs are generally not very divergent in form and
                    structure, and they may be wonderfully alike, as in the existing Tortoises and
                    in the extinct <hi rend="italic">Ichthyopterygia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauro-</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">pterygia.</hi> They were, on the contrary, extremely divergent
                    in certain <hi rend="italic">Dinosauria,</hi> and still more in the <hi

                <p>Every Reptile has a body composed of organs of nutrition, circulation,
                    respiration, secretion, reproduction, sensation, and motion, supported
                    internally by a solid framework, the internal skeleton or endoskeleton, and
                    enclosed in a firm investment, constituting the external skeleton or
                    exoskeleton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The External Skeleton.</hi></p>
                <p>The external investment of the body consists of two layers. The outer of these,
                    the epidermal layer, or <hi rend="italic">epidermis,</hi> is of an epithelial
                    horny nature and never becomes bony. The deeper or dermal layer, the <hi
                    rend="italic"> dermis,</hi> is a fibrous structure which may become bony.
                    Neither hairs nor feathers are developed.</p>
                <p>The exoskeleton is characterized in this class of animals by being composed of
                    distinct superficial thickenings placed side by side and separated one from
                    another by thinner interspaces. According to the size and form of these
                    thickenings they are known by different names. If they are very small and
                    rounded they are called “tubercles,” and such we see on the body of the
                    Chamseleons and Geckos. If they are large, flat, and not overlapping, they are
                    called shields, and such we see, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> on the head of the
                    true Lizards. If the hinder part of each thickening is more or less prolonged
                    over the anterior part of one or more next behind it, structures of this kind
                    are called scales, such as we find dorsally clothing the bodies of most Lizards
                    and many Serpents. If the median part of each such scale is still more thickened
                    longitudinally, then such a scale is said to be carinate. In most of these cases
                    the epidermis itself is also more or less thickened locally, as well as the
                    subjacent dermis, remaining thin in the folds or interspaces. The dermis may be
                    ossified, forming dense bony plates, or scutes, beneath the epidermal
                    investment. The whole body may be thus clothed, as in the Lizard <hi
                    rend="italic"> Cyclodus</hi> and others, or the bony plates may be confined to
                    parts of the back, as in some Crocodilians. The development of the exoskeleton
                    is carried to the highest degree in Chelonians, when large osseous plates form,
                    in the Land Tortoises and Terrapins, a complete and continuous bony case for the
                    body, invested externally by a rich corneous epidermis, and becoming internally
                    anchylosed with the endoskeleton itself.</p>
                <p>In most Ophidians the body is clothed with scales above and with large
                    transversely elongated shields beneath (single or double beneath the tail),
                    though the body may be entirely invested by small scales except the head, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Typhlops,</hi> or by tubercles, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aerochorclus.</hi></p>
                <p>Sometimes, as in <hi rend="italic">Cerastes</hi> and the River Jack, two horny
                    appendages are erectly developed over the nose and sometimes, as in <hi
                    rend="italic"> Herpeton tentaculatum,</hi> cutaneous appendages project from the
                    snout, or the snout may be exceptionally produced. The skin of the side of the
                    body just behind the head may form a distensible fold, as in <hi rend="italic">
                    Naja,</hi> and there may be, as in <hi rend="italic">Python,</hi> a claw on each
                    side of the vent, which claw is a rudiment of the pelvic limb, as will be
                    explained in describing the appendicular skeleton. A peculiar cutaneous
                    depression exists between the nostril and the eye in <hi rend="italic">
                    Crotalus</hi> and the other Pit-Vipers. For full details on these subjects see
                    the separate articles on the orders.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia</hi> we find a number of different cutaneous
                    conditions which have been already noticed in describing the various groups
                    systematically. It will then suffice here to remind the reader that the
                    Amphis-baenians have quadrate shields over the entire body except the head,

                    >Chaleis</hi> the scales are also verticillate, while in the <hi rend="italic">

                    as in the Monitors, and there are often long sharp spines on the head and body,

                    >Moloch.</hi> The integument may also extend out from the body along the back

                    >Lophura,</hi> or from beneath the throat, as in <hi rend="italic">Iguana,</hi>
                    or largely across the neck, as in <hi rend="italic">Chlamydosaurus,</hi> or on
                    cither side of the tail, as in <hi rend="italic">Ptychozoon,</hi> or from each

                    passed from the elongated hand to the body and leg as in the wing of the
                    existing Bats. It has also been before stated that in certain cases different
                    genera are distinguished by pores, Le., the apertures of small cutaneous sacs
                    placed on the inner side of each thigh or in front of the cloacal aperture.
                    Folds of skin may invest the digits and constitute webbed feet, as in some
                    Geckos, as well as in Crocodiles and Terrapins, or may bind the digits in two
                    opposite bundles, as in each extremity of the Chamaeleons. Normally each digit
                    is terminated by a claw.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Grocodilia</hi> the epidermal thickenings do not overlap as
                    in some Lizards, but form conspicuous prominences in the dorsal region, w <hi

                    bony plates beneath,—which plates may, as in Alligators, exist on the belly as
                    well as the back, and may form continuous rings round the tail, those of each
                    anterior row overlapping those of the row next behind. Not all the digits are
                    provided with claws. The feet are webbed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chelonia</hi> present considerable differences as to the
                    exoskeleton. The Mud Tortoises, <hi rend="italic">Trionyx,</hi> have a soft
                    epidermis, and <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi> has a coriaceous outer layer of
                    integument covering a carapace divided into small sub-hexagonal shields. In the
                    other Chelonians there are large epidermal shields, which may overlap, as in the
                    Tortoiseshell Turtle ( <hi rend="italic">C. imbricata)</hi> and others, or may
                    be conterminous, as in <hi rend="italic">Testudo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emys.</hi> These shields form a mid-dorsal series and two lateral rows on
                    either side, while there are two longitudinal series on the ventral side of the
                    body.</p>
                <p>Beneath the epidermal layer of the integument osseous plates are found, which
                    plates do not coincide either in <pb break="no"

                    which (save in <hi rend="italic"> Trionyx</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sphargis)</hi> cover them. Their condition in <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi>
                    is quite peculiar. In the skin of its back there are imbedded a great number of
                    small plates flexibly united in a mosaic-like pattern. Seven longitudinal rows
                    of these plates (one median, six lateral) differ from the rest by their large
                    size and raised surfaces. On the ventral surface of the body there is one large
                    thin median [)late—the <hi rend="italic">epister-mini,</hi> together with other
                    very slender ossifications forming a very imperfect bony framework. All these
                    latter bony plates, however, are very imperfectly ossified, with numerous
                    vacuities. In the Land Tortoises and Terrapins, on the other hand, we have the
                    exoskeleton in its greatest perfec-tion. On the back there is a series of ten
                    median plates, the first one of which is called nuchal and the last one pygal.
                    On each side of these series and suturally connected therewith is a series of
                    large lateral plates also suturally united together and with the median plates.
                    Finally, a series of marginal plates suturally connected together and with the
                    foregoing complete a bony investment of the back which is complete and
                    continuous, and which is known as the <hi rend="italic">carapace.</hi> On the
                    ventral surface of the body nine other bony plates form another continuous
                    shield termed the <hi rend="italic"> plastron.</hi> The most anterior pair
                    correspond with the bones known as clavicles in Man and many other animals. The
                    azygous plate between and behind them answers to the episternum of many animals.
                    The carapace and plastron are united at the sides of the body, but are separated
                    medianly in front and behind to allow the protrusion and retraction of the head
                    and the four limbs and tail. In <hi rend="italic">Chelonia</hi> similar plates
                    exist, but they are less developed, and merely form an imperfect species of
                    investment, with many vacuities between the plates. The same is the case in <hi
                    rend="italic"> Trionyx,</hi> wherein the marginal plates are also wanting.</p>
                <p>The skin of the neck and limbs is covered with scales. The skin of the neck may
                    develop fimbriated processes and caruncles, as in <hi rend="italic">Chelys,</hi>
                    and the nose may be produced into a short proboscis, as in <hi rend="italic">
                    Trionyx.</hi> True claws may be absent, as in <hi rend="italic"> Sphargis,</hi>
                    or there may be but one on each foot, as in <hi rend="italic">Chelone,</hi> or
                    two, as in <hi rend="italic">Caretta,</hi> or three, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trionyx,</hi> or four or five, as in <hi rend="italic">Testudo</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Emys.</hi> The claws may approximate in form to hoofs in some of
                    the large Land Tortoises. There may be a web between the digits, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Emys,</hi> or the whole extremity may be united into a solid
                    paddle, as in <hi rend="italic">Chelone.</hi></p>
                <p>In all cases the skin of the jaws is found thickened and condensed so as to form
                    a horny beak with a cutting edge.</p>
                <p>In many Chelonians there are two pairs of glands on each side just in front of
                    the junction of the plastron and carapace, while in the Mud Tortoises, <hi
                    rend="italic"> Trionyx,</hi> there is yet another gland on each side in front of
                    the margin of the plastron.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Internal Skeleton.</hi></p>
                <p>The endoskeleton of Reptiles, as of most Vertebrate animals, consists of parts
                    which are divisible into two categories :—(a) those which form the skeleton of
                    the head and trunk, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >axial</hi> skeleton; (6) the parts which form the skeleton of the limbs, <hi
                    rend="italic"> i.e.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">appendi-cular</hi> skeleton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Axial Skeleton.—In describing the axial skeleton it will
                    be well to begin with that part of it which belongs to the trunk, leaving the
                    more complex skeleton of the head, f.e., the skull, for subsequent
                    consideration.</hi><hi rend="italic">Skeleton of the Trunk.—</hi> The backbone,
                    spinal column, or spine consists in all adult Reptiles of a series of ossi-fied
                    vertebrae, many, almost all, of which are separate and not anchylosed one to
                    another. Nevertheless the spinal or vertebral column varies in its structure
                    much more in the class of Reptiles than even in the <hi rend="italic">Mamma,
                    lia,</hi> and very much more than in the class of Birds, with which the Reptiles
                    are so much allied. This variation consists in differences not only as regards
                    the number of regions or vertebral categories and the extent and struc-ture of
                    each region, but also as regards the form of the individual vertebrae and
                    notably the form of the vertebral centra.</p>
                <p>There may or may not be distinct cervical vertebrae with or without movable ribs.
                    The first two vertebrae are differentiated as axis and atlas, and in front of
                    the latter there may be a rudiment of another vertebra, which has been
                    distinguished as the proatlas. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Discovered by Prof. Paul Albrecht. </p></note> There are
                    always dorsal vertebrae, some of the ribs of which may not, but more generally
                    do, join a sternum. These dorsal ribs are generally movable, and may be, as in
                    Serpents, organs of locomotion. They may, on the contrary, be firmly fixed by
                    suture one to another as in Chelonians. There may or may not be lumbar
                    vertebrae, and two or more (in some extinct forms many) vertebrae may unite to
                    form a sacrum. There are always caudal vertebrae, and these generally have
                    chevron bones beneath them. Sometimes vertebrae which are not sacral become
                    anchylosed together, as in the dorsal vertebrae of Chelonians. Articular
                    processes always connect together adjacent vertebrae which are not thus
                    anchylosed, and there may be accessory articular processes peculiar to the
                    class, and which will be shortly described later. As to the form of the
                    vertebral centra, they may bo flat in front and behind, or biconcave
                    (amphicoelous), or biconvex, or with a ball behind and a cup in front
                    (pro-coelous), or with a ball in front and a cup behind (opistho-coelous).</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> all the above-mentioned regions are
                    distinct, there being usually 9 cervical, 11 to 12 dorsal, 2 to 3 sacral, and
                    about 40 caudal vertebrae. In existing species all the vertebrae are procoelous
                    except the atlas, axis, sacral, and first caudal vertebrae. The adjacent
                    sur-faces of the centra of the sacral vertebrae are flat, and the centrum of the
                    first caudal is biconvex. The atlas consists of five pieces, <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In front of it a rudimentary
                    proatlas has been found. </p></note> and the odontoid bone is not anchylosed to
                    the axis. The caudal vertebrae are elongated and com-pressed, and, except the
                    most anterior and posterior, support chevron bones. Ribs are very generally
                    present. Those attached to the atlas and axis are single in origin. Each rib of
                    the other cervical vertebrae bifurcates at its upper end into a tubercular and a
                    capitular process, which respec-tively articulate with the neural arch and
                    centrum of their supporting vertebra, and the interval thus left in the
                    succeeding vertebrae forms a <hi rend="italic">canalis centralis.</hi> The ribs
                    of the middle five cervical vertebrae so expand distally as to impede the
                    lateral flexion of the neck. The neural arches articulate by suture with the
                    vertebral bodies. The dorsal ribs become attached to processes which pass out
                    from each vertebra to the tubercular and capitular processes of the ribs
                    respectively, and their situation with respect to the neuro-central suture
                    changes by degrees, through the vertebral series, till in the twelfth dorsal one
                    long trans-verse process, passing out above the neural central suture, supports
                    both processes. Thence backwards these arti-culating surfaces approximate till
                    at last there is but a single articular surface between each rib and its
                    sup-porting vertebra, as was the case in those of the atlas and axis.</p>
                <p>The dorsal ribs consist of two pieces—the distal piece remaining cartilaginous;
                    and most ribs support an imper-fectly ossified <hi rend="italic">processus
                    uncinatus,</hi> nearly as in Birds, which extends backwards from the distal
                    portion of its ossified <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0465-0448"/>piece (fig 4). From seven to nine of these ribs
                    have ossified sternal ribs which serve to connect them with the sternum. The
                    lumbar vertebrae have only long transverse processes which arise above the
                    neuro-central suture. The sacral vertebrae support very stout transverse
                    processes, each of which includes a rib element and becomes anchylosed to the
                    centra only at a late period of life, as do the comparatively long and slender
                    caudal transverse processes. Inferior processes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hypapo-</hi><hi rend="italic">physes,</hi> which are azygous, descend one from
                    beneath the centrum of each of the more posterior cervical and anterior dorsal
                    vertebrae.</p>
                <p>The sternum consists of an ossified rhomboidal plate, with the hinder side of
                    which two pairs of costal cartilages articulate. A narrower piece extends
                    backwards from this plate (connected with it by ligament), and ends in two
                    diverging processes. With this the other sternal ribs articulate. A long slender
                    bone, the interclavicle, or episternum, lies in a median groove of the sternal
                    plate, and extends forwards beyond it.</p>
                <p>There is a so-called abdominal sternum made up of a series of seven or eight
                    slender bones which lie in the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the
                    abdomen behind the true sternum and in front of the pelvis. It lies at a lower
                    level than the sternum, and has no direct connexion with the vertebral
                    column.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Hatteria,</hi> the only living member of the order <hi
                    rend="italic"> Rhynchocephalia,</hi> as well as in the extinct species, the
                    vertebral bodies have flat or concave surfaces in front and behind. There are 8
                    cervical, 14 dorsal, 3 lumbar, 2 sacral, and 36 caudal vertebrae. There is no
                    persistent neurocentral suture in <hi rend="italic">Hatteria,</hi> though there
                    may be in some extinct forms of the order. Rudiments of the proatlas are
                    sometimes present. The atlas consists but of three pieces, and the odontoid bone
                    is anchylosed with the atlas, and is concave anteriorly. An autogenous
                    hypapophysis is wedged into the inferior interspace between the centrum of the
                    axis and the third vertebrae, and similar parts are developed thence backwards
                    to beneath the seventh and eighth vertebrae. <hi rend="italic">Hatteria</hi> has
                    the faculty of reproducing its tail after mutilation. When the tail is broken
                    the fracture takes place in the middle of one of its centra and not between two
                    adjacent centra. This is owing to the fact that each caudal vertebra is divided
                    into an anterior and a posterior part (fig. 5), and is weakest at this line of
                    junction which passes behind the transverse process.</p>
                <p>The first rib is attached to the fourth vertebra. Those of the ninth and the
                    following vertebrae attain the sternum.</p>
                <p>The more posterior ribs become connected with the abdominal sternum. All the ribs
                    are single at their proximal ends, a bifurcation being scarcely indicated even
                    at the most anterior one. Processus uncinati are fully developed.</p>
                <p>The sternum is a rhomboidal, semi-cartilaginous plate, with a medianly situated
                    long and slender episternum which unites with a pair of clavicles. An abdominal
                    sternum is more fully developed than in any other living Reptile. It consists of
                    about twenty-five transverse rods, each of which is composed of three pieces.
                    These rods are connected and disconnected with the ribs in an alternate manner,
                    every other rod being suspended from a pair of the true ribs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lacertilia.—</hi> In this extensive order of living Reptiles,
                    the vertebrae are procoelous except in the <hi rend="italic">Geckotidae</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Uropeltidae,</hi> where they are biconcave. There may or may
                    not be distinct cervical, lumbar, and sacral regions, and the number of
                    vertebrae, generally considerable, may be very large. The distinctness of the
                    vertebral regions depends on the development of the anterior and posterior
                    limbs. When a cervical region can be distinguished, there are never more than
                    nine such vertebrae. Only in rare instances are there distinct lumbar vertebrae.
                    The sacral vertebrae are never more than two. The neural arch is always
                    anchylosed to the centrum in adults. The atlas consists of three parts, and the
                    axis may or may not have the odontoid bone anchylosed to it and convex in front.
                    Ribs are attached to most of the cervical as well as to the dorsal vertebrae;
                    but the former are not expanded distally as in the Crocodile, and thus the
                    latter do not support uncinate processes. The more anterior ribs show two
                    proximal articular surfaces, but these never diverge into distinct capitular and
                    tubercular processes as in the Crocodiles, nor, as in the latter, do any of the
                    dorsal vertebrae develop double, superimposed transverse processes. The more
                    anterior (usually the first three or four) dorsal ribs are connected with the
                    sternum by sternal cartilages. Those behind may be similarly connected with the
                    diverging backward prolongations of the sternum, or may be directly connected
                    with their fellows of the opposite side, as in the Chamaeleon, a median
                    cartilage being joined on either side by the sternal cartilage continuous with
                    an ossified rib. In <hi rend="italic">Acontias</hi> and other limbless
                    Lacertilians which have but a rudimentary sternum, or none, the corresponding
                    ribs of the right and left sides are connected across the mid-ventral line as
                    they are in <hi rend="italic"> Chamaeleo.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Draco</hi>
                    the more posterior ribs are greatly prolonged, and their distal cartilages are
                    bent backwards. This is to enable them to support the wing-like membrane which
                    extends from either side of the body to serve as a parachute. In those Lizards
                    which have a lumbar region, transverse processes are there developed. The caudal
                    vertebrae (except the most anterior and the small posterior ones) have chevron
                    bones, which are not generally anchylosed to the vertebrae which support
                    them.</p>
                <p>In addition to the ordinary articular processes, there are in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iguana</hi> certain accessory articulating structures such as are commonly
                    found in the vertebrae of Serpents; these will be described in the next
                    section.</p>
                <p>The sternum consists of a rhomboidal semi-ossified or cartilaginous plate, which
                    is sometimes continued backwards into a pair of long diverging processes. There
                    is generally an episternum, which is often T-shaped, but it may be absent, as in
                    Chamaeleons. In the limbless Lizards the sternum is cartilaginous, and there is
                    none whatever in some forms, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic"> Amphisbaena</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Typhline.</hi></p>
                <p>In many Lizards, notably in the commonest English Lizard, the tail if broken off
                    can be reproduced. In them the centra of the caudal vertebrae have a vertical
                    median division similar to that already described in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hatteria.</hi></p>
                <p>In Ophidians the number of vertebrae is generally very large, and may exceed four
                    hundred. They are all procoelous, and the ball behind each is nearly
                    hemispherical. There is no distinction of cervical, lumbar, or sacral vertebrae;
                    but all the vertebrae after the atlas may be considered as either dorsal or
                    caudal. The mode of articulation between the vertebrae is more complex than in
                    almost any Lizards.</p>

                <p>In addition to the ordinary articular processes (or zygapo-physes), which are
                    here broad and flattened, often with an accessory process, there are two
                    noteworthy structures. The first of these is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >zygosphene,</hi> and consists of a wedge-shaped process with two articular
                    surfaces, which projects forward from the anterior surface of each neural arch.
                    The other is called the <hi rend="italic">zyg-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >antrum,</hi> and is a corresponding excavation with two articular sur faces on
                    the hinder side of the neural arch, and receives the zygo-</p>
                <p>Sphene of the vertebra next behind it. It was structures such as these that were
                    referred to in the last paragraph as existing so exception ally amongst
                    Lacertilians in <hi rend="italic">Iguana.</hi></p>
                <p>The atlas and axis have a form similar to that already described as existing in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia.</hi> Long azygous hypapophyses nearly always
                    depend from the centre of the anterior trunk vertebrae, or even from the whole
                    of them, being especially large and numerous in some of the most poisonous
                    Serpents, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Crotalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Naja.</hi>
                    In <hi rend="italic">Dasypeltis scaber</hi> some of these processes in the
                    anterior dorsal region are made to minister to alimentation,—their tips being
                    coated with tooth substance, and penetrating within the alimentary canal, as
                    will be again mentioned further on.</p>
                <p>The ribs assume the function of locomotion, and are therefore very movably
                    articulated to short transverse processes. Each has two proximal articular
                    surfaces, but they are close to gether, there being no diverging articular and
                    tubercular processes.</p>
                <p>Each rib terminates in a short car tilage. The caudal vertebrae may, in rare
                    instances, be very few, and they may be very numerous—from five to two hundred.
                    They do not possess chevron bones, but bifold depending hypapophyses, and they
                    have transverse processes which also are generally bent downwards.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, at the limit between the body and the tail, the transverse process, or
                    the rib, as the case may be, bifurcates or develops an ascending process, as,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g</hi> ., in <hi rend="italic">Boa, Naja,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Echidna.</hi></p>
                <p>No Ophidian has any sternum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chelonia.—</hi> The Tortoises and Turtles present a spinal
                    structure remarkably divergent from that of all other Reptiles, and especially
                    divergent from that of Ophidians. Nevertheless the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chelonia</hi> agree with the <hi rend="italic">Ophidia</hi> in having no
                    sternum, and in having at least a portion of the vertebral column formed for
                    extreme mobility, in spite of the excessive rigidity and immobility of the
                    trunk. Only in <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi> do we find a structure generally
                    resembling that of other Reptiles and diverging from that common to other
                    Chelonians. With the exception of <hi rend="italic">Sphargis,</hi> the structure
                    of the vertebral column of which will be subsequently noticed, the Chelonians
                    present the following characters. The endoskeleton of the dorsal region is
                    intimately united with those ossified exoskeletal plates which have been already
                    described <hi rend="italic">(supra,</hi> p. 447) as investing both dorsally and
                    ventrally the entire trunk. The median series of plates are united with the
                    neural spines and arches, and the lateral plates are similarly united with the
                    ribs, so that the carapace is formed both of endoskeletal and exoskeletal
                    elements intimately united. The constancy of the number of vertebrae is very
                    exceptional, as is also the very small number of those of the body. There are
                    always 8 cervical, 12 dorsal, and 2 sacral vertebrae. The number of caudal
                    vertebrae varies, but is never great. The cervical vertebrae have very small
                    processes, whereby they are better fitted for great mobility. They vary greatly
                    as to the form of their centra, some being opisthocoelous, others procoelous,
                    others biconvex, while one at least is flattened both in front and behind— the
                    arrangement differing even in different species of the same genus. The atlas
                    consists of three pieces, and the os odontoideum is separate. The neuro-central
                    suture persists. The centra of the first ten dorsal vertebrae are amphicoelous,
                    and but loosely connected with twin neural arches, each neural arch being
                    superimposed over the posterior half of one vertebra and the anterior half of
                    the vertebra next behind. The sacral vertebrae have either stout ribs Suturally
                    attached or transverse processes anchy-losed to the vertebrae. The caudal
                    vertebrae are procoelous, and generally have a pair of separate descending
                    processes, which may (as in <hi rend="italic">Ghelydra)</hi> unite distally and
                    form chevron bones.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi> the endoskeleton is quite distinct from the
                    exoskeleton. Its neural arches are very loosely united to the centra, so that
                    they can be separated with the greatest ease. The trans verse processes of the
                    caudal vertebrae also remain unan-</p>
                <p>chylosed to their centra. The dorsal vertebrae pass so gradually into the caudal
                    that the boundary can only be determined by the somewhat in creased thickness of
                    the transverse process of the two sacral vertebrae. The summits of the neural
                    arches are somewhat dilated (as if from superincumbent pressure) or obtusely
                    keeled. The ribs are not much expanded, their heads fitting into a hollow formed
                    by the centra of two vertebrae together with the neural arch superimposed upon
                    the two. They become shorter and narrower behind, that of the tenth dorsal
                    vertebra being even smaller than the sacral ribs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Skull.—</hi> The anterior portion of the axial skeleton, or
                    cranium, differs markedly from that of every other class of Vertebrates, while
                    it presents a much greater diversity of structure than does the cranium of
                    Mammals or of Birds. It differs from the cranium of the lower Vertebrate classes
                    by its more complete Ossificationand by a greater prolongation backwards of the
                    nasal cavity, which causes a greater expanse and density of the palatal
                    structure. The skull, however, is not so much ossified as in Mammals, and the
                    bones do not become anchylosed together so quickly and certainly as in Birds.
                    The occipital region always consists of four occipital elements, and there is an
                    ossified basisphenoid in front of a well-developed basioccipital. The skull
                    almost always articulates with the atlas by a single occipital condyle. The
                    lower jaw is always suspended to the skull by the intervention of a quadrate
                    bone with which the os articulare of the mandible articulates. Besides the
                    last-mentioned bone the mandible consists of as many bones as in Fishes, with
                    the addition of a supra-angular and a complementary bone.</p>

                    conditioned as to allow much mobility to several other parts. In all cases,
                    however, the side wall of the anterior part of the cranial cavity is very
                    imperfectly ossified.</p>
                <p>The skull of the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> is distinguished from that of
                    all other Reptiles by its very extensive bony palate, which exceeds in
                    completeness that of even any Mammal save the Anteaters and Cetaceans, for not
                    only the maxillae and palatines but also the pterygoids—all as expanded bony
                    plates suturally united—concur in its composition in all existing Crocodilians
                    (though not in the extinct <hi rend="italic">Teleosaurus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic"> Belodon),</hi> and the pterygoids surround the posterior nares.
                    The skull forms a solid whole composed of bones united by suture except at the
                    anterolateral and median boundaries of the cranial cavity, where it is
                    cartilaginous or membranous. There is an interorbital septum. The quadrate bone
                    is immovably fixed and of large size, and unites with the pterygoid, but by its
                    upper and inner surface only. The alisphenoid is a large broad bone. The
                    tympanic cavity is completely enclosed by the prootic and opisthotic (the latter
                    being united with the exoccipital), the squamosal, the postfrontal, and the
                    basioc-cipital and basisphenoid. It opens into the mouth by three apertures, one

                    which terminate complex canals having communications among each other. There are
                    two lateral, quasi-zygomatic arches to the skull —an upper one formed by the
                    postfrontal and squamosal, and a lower one by the maxilla, jugal,
                    quadrato-jugal, and quadrate. There is no foramen in the parietal region of the
                    skull, and there is an azygous parietal bone and frontal. On either side of the
                    hinder region of the skull the periotic and exoccipital bones form large parotic
                    processes. There is a distinct perforated lachrymal. There are two vomers, which
                    are generally hidden in the palate by the junction of the extensive inaxillae
                    and palatines. There are a pair of nasal bones. Various cranial bones are
                    pneumatic, including the os articulare of the mandible. The hyoid is very
                    simple, and consists only of a broad cartilaginous or partly osseous basihyal,
                    with two bony cornua, not directly connected with the skull. There is a very
                    small cartilaginous stylohyal on the upper hinder part of the quadrate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hatteria.—</hi> The skull of this living type of an extinct
                    order resembles that of the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> in that there is a
                    lower zygomatic arcade formed by the quadrato-jugal bone interposed between the
                    malar and the quadrate, as well as a superior zygomatic arcade formed by the
                    squamosal and postfrontal, and in that the quadrate bone is immovably fixed
                    between the pterygoid, squamosal, and quadrato-jugal. The palate is pretty
                    complete with wide plate-like ossifications, still it is much less so than in
                    the Crocodiles; but the posterior nares are much more anteriorly situated —very
                    near the anterior end of the palate—and are on each side, being each bounded by
                    the premaxilla in front, the vomer internally, the maxilla externally, and the
                    palatine behind. At the side of the skull we find a bone distinguished as the
                    “columella,” which passes upwards from above the suture between the pterygoid
                    and quadrate to the parietal, to which it is attached by a slip of cartilage. It
                    is a flattened bone, somewhat expanded above and below, and constricted towards
                    its middle. The lateral wall of the skull at the part which in the Crocodile is
                    occupied by the alisphenoid, and in front of that part is not osseous but
                    fibro-cartilaginous. There is an interorbital septum. The postero-lateral region
                    of the skull consists, as in the</p>
                <p>Crocodiles, of two outstanding “parotic processes,” made up of the cxoccipital,
                    prootic, and opisthotic bones,— beneath which is the “columella auris.” The
                    basisphenoid sends down two processes to abut against the pterygoids. The
                    parietal is perforated by a small median fontanelle. The premaxillae are
                    separate, and together form a sort of beak, their large teeth becoming
                    thoroughly anchylosed and united with the bones supporting them. The nasals are
                    double, and each sends forth a process (somewhat as in Birds) from its outer
                    anterior angle.</p>
                <p>The Lacertilian skull is formed mainly upon one of two diverging types of
                    structure—(1) that of ordinary Lizards, and (2) that of Charmeleons. In both the
                    quadrate bone is almost always movable and the inferior zygomatic arcade is
                    wanting, though generally represented by a ligament; the palate is incompletely
                    ossified, and the rather anteriorly situated posterior nares bounded internally
                    by the bifold vomers. In the ordinary Lizard type the skull has the appearance
                    of consisting of a system of osseous bars connecting the solid occipital parts
                    (with its pair of parotic processes) with a flattened cranial roof and the more
                    or less well ossified snout. The skull has an interorbital septum. The lateral
                    walls of the cranium are, as in <hi rend="italic">Hatteria,</hi>
                    fibro-cartilaginous, though they may contain some insignificant ossifications;

                    the pterygoid to the parietal. The last-named bone sends a backward prolongation
                    to the parotic process and squamosal, and is movably united to the occipital;
                    and thus, through the imperfect ossification of the cranial parietes, the facial
                    part of the skull is capable of more or less flexion upon the occipital part <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0468-0451"/>There is generally a superior zygomatic arcade
                    formed by the junction of the postfrontal with the squamosal; and, very
                    generally, the orbit is enclosed posteriorly by a junction of this postfrontal
                    with the malar. The basi-sphenoid sends down (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hatteria)</hi> two processes to abut against the pterygoids, which again join
                    the quadrate bones. An os transversum unites the pterygoid, palatine, and
                    maxilla of either side. The maxilla is thus a fixed bone; the premaxilla is
                    generally single, and sends a median process backwards. The nasals, frontale,
                    and parietals may be single or double. There is generally a parietal
                    fontanelle.</p>
                <p>By very rare exception, as in <hi rend="italic">Monopeltis,</hi> there may be two
                    occipital condyles, that (median) portion which is formed from the basioccipital
                    aborting.</p>
                <p>The hyoid consists of two pairs of cornua, whereof the anterior is generally the
                    longer, attached to a median portion from which azygous a bifold process may
                    proceed both anteriorly and poste riorly.</p>
                <p>In the Amphisbaenians the skull is more solidly and continuously ossified than is
                    usual in Lizards, though there is no columella and though the low ali-and
                    orbito-sphenoidal regions are membranous. The parietal is not movably
                    articulated to the exoccipital, and the facial part is solidly ossified and not
                    movable upon the hinder portion of the skull.</p>
                <p>The orbits are not enclosed behind, and there is no superior zygomatic
                    arcade.</p>
                <p>The skull of <hi rend="italic">Heloderma</hi> is very remarkable in that it has
                    no zygomatic arch whatever, and in that the pre-and postfrontal bones unite and
                    exclude the frontal bone from the margin of the orbit.</p>
                <p>The skull of the Chamaeleons has even more the aspect of an osseous scafffolding
                    than has that of ordinary Lizards in spite of the absence of a columella. This
                    is owing to the presence of a long supraoccipital arcade formed by a long
                    posteriorly and inwardly extending process of the squamosal, which joins the
                    adjacent side of the singularly prolonged and upwardly and backwardly extending
                    process of the parietal, which itself is solid ly united to an up wardly
                    extending process of the supra-</p>
                <p>occipital. Thus the facial part of the skull is not movable upon its occipital
                    portion. The orbits are enclosed by bone, and there is a superior zygomatic
                    arcade, the post frontal joining the squamosal behind and the malar in front.
                    The frontal bone is small and single. There are a pair of narrow nasals, but
                    these do not form the boundary of any part of the anterior nares, but are
                    excluded therefrom by the junction of the prefrontals with the maxilla, and
                    these two bones may be prolonged so as to form great horn-like processes. The
                    pterygoids do not articulate with the quadrates, and there is no interorbital
                    septum. The hyoid has its posterior cornua much the longer, and a bony median
                    basihyal.;</p>
                <p>The Ophidians, like the Lizards, have skulls which are formed on more than one
                    type:—(1) those of the ordinary wide-mouthed Serpents; and (2) those of the
                    Serpents with a very narrow gape, such as we find, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    in <hi rend="italic">Typhlops</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Uropeltis.</hi></p>
                <p>The wide-mouthed Serpents, or <hi rend="italic">Eurystomata,</hi> have a skull
                    which in some respects is much less completely ossified and more movable than in
                    ordinary Lizards, while in other respects it is more ossified and less movable.
                    Thus the lateral walls of the anterior parts of the cranial cavity are well
                    ossified, so that the anterior part-of the skull is no longer movable on the
                    occipital segment, while on the contrary the total absence of both zygomatic
                    arcades, the non-union directly of the palatine with the vomer, the laxity of
                    union of the premaxilla and maxilla, and especially the movable condition not
                    only of the quadrate but also of the squamosal (often an elongated bone) from
                    which it is suspended, all give an excessive mobility to the facial part of the
                    skull. To this it may be added that, at the symphysis, the rami of the mandible
                    are only united by soft, very extensible tissue. There is usually but one
                    premaxilla, and that is edentulous. The palatines are usually connected with the
                    maxilla by transverse bones, while the pterygoids connect them with the quadrate
                    bones. There is no interorbital septum, and <pb break="no"

                    basisphenoid is prolonged forwards into a long bony rostrum, on the upper
                    surface of which the cartilaginous rods (the per sistent <hi rend="italic"
                    >trabecu-</hi><hi rend="italic">lae cranii)</hi> ex tend forwards to blend with
                    the median cartilage of the ethmoi dal region. The supraoccipital is excluded
                    from the margin of the foramen magnum by the exoccipital. The frontal bones
                    descend laterally to the dorsum of this basi-sphenoidal rostrum and then turn
                    inwards to meet together in the median lines on the floor of the cranial cavity.
                    The parietals also descend laterally but unite with the basisphenoid by suture.
                    There are a pair of nasals, and also lachrymals and postfrontals, but there is
                    no jugal or quadrate jugal. The palatines do not bound the posterior nares
                    behind. They are widely separated, and their long axes are longitudinal. The
                    maxillae may be long and may support a number of teeth, as in most non-venomous
                    Snakes, or maybe very short and support a single large fang, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in Vipers.</p>
                <p>The small-mouthed Serpents, or <hi rend="italic">Angiostomata,</hi> have the
                    pterygoids separated from the quadrates. The squamosal is small or absent, the
                    quadrate being attached directly to the cranium. They have no postfrontal and no
                    transverse bone, while the palatine bones have their long axis transverse, and
                    meet, or nearly meet, on the under surface of the skull. The two rami of the
                    mandible are also closely united together. In other details of cranial structure
                    they agree generally with the <hi rend="italic">Eurystomata.</hi></p>
                <p>The hyoid is rudimentary, and only consists of a pair of cartilaginous threads,
                    medianly united and lying side by side beneath the trachea.</p>
                <p>In the Chclonians the skull presents certain resemblances to that of the
                    Crocodil-ians. Thus the quadrate is immovably fixed and its upper part is joined
                    by the pterygoid, and there is a quadrato-jugal bone. The pterygoids and
                    palatines unite by suture and form horizontal plates beneath the <hi
                    rend="italic"> basis cranii.</hi></p>
                <p>Nevertheless these bones differ widely from their homologues in the Crocodiles
                    inasmuch as the posterior nares open in front of the pterygoids and are bounded
                    by the palatines and the azygous vomer. The epiotic bone is generally quite
                    distinct from the exoccipital. There are large parietals, which send down a
                    process that serves the purpose of the absent alisphenoid. In front of this, the
                    sides and front of the cranial cavity are unossified.</p>
                <p>There are a pair of frontals, and in front of them a pair of bones which bound
                    the anterior nares above. There may be one or two premaxillae. Sometimes, as <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in <hi rend="italic"> Chelone,</hi> the parietal,
                    postfrontal, jugal, and squamosal send out plate-like processes which unite and
                    form a sort of false outer skull covering in the temporal fossa, and quite
                    external to the real outer wall of the cranial cavity. Thus the cranium of these
                    Reptiles is, as it were, at the opposite extreme to that of the Serpents as
                    regards massiveness, solidity, and the immovability of its several parts one on

                    Reptiles, like that of Vertebrates generally,</hi> consists of a pair of limb

                    from either girdle. Each such skeletal appendage has also, normally, the typical
                    differentiation into (1) a single upper limb bone, (2) a pair of lower limb
                    bones, (3) a group of small foot-root bones or cartilages (carpus or tarsus),
                    (4) a series of middle foot bones (metacarpus or metatarsus), and (5)</p>
                <p>a group of small bones (phalanges) arranged in series according to the number of
                    digits, but the number in each digit varying in different digits and in

                <p>Every trace of an appendicular skeleton may, however, be wanting, as is the case
                    in most Ophidians.</p>
                <p>There may be a pectoral limb girdle without any rudiment of a fore-limb skeleton,

                    Amphisbaena.</hi> There may be a pelvic girdle without any rudiment of a

                    offered to the limb by such lateral half. From that articular surface one
                    division descends dorsally and does not connect itself with its fellow of the

                    and normally does connect itself, directly or indirectly, with its fellow of the

                    of two parts in serial succession. The ventral division consists normally of two
                    or more parts, which, though diverging, pass ven-trally side by side, or one in

                    its fellow of the opposite side. The ilium, pubis, and ischium form the
                    acetabulum.</p>
                <p>Although it has been elsewhere already described, it may be well again to mention
                    here that in certain extinct Reptiles not only is the ilium greatly expanded
                    above antero-ρosteriorly but the pubis sends back a long slender post-pubis
                    nearly parallel with the ischium and closely resembling the so-called pubis of
                    Birds. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See especially a

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Ophidia</hi> the pelvic girdle is generally entirely
                    absent, and, when a rudiment is present, that rudiment is never united with the
                    axial skeleton. It may consist merely of a pair of subparallel slender pubic
                    spicules or cartilages, as in <hi rend="italic">Typhlops,</hi> or of a
                    rudimentary ilium, pubis, and ischium on each side, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cylindrophis, Ilysia, Stenostoma,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Boa</hi> . A
                    rudimentary pelvis also exists in <hi rend="italic">Python, Eryx,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> Tortrix.</hi></p>
                <p>In Saurians the girdle may also be detached from the axial skeleton and most
                    rudimentary, as in <hi rend="italic">Lepidostenon,</hi> where it consists of no
                    more than in <hi rend="italic">Typh-</hi><hi rend="italic">lops,</hi> and in <hi

                <p>ing to the three nor-</p>
                <p>mal pelvic bones. It may be even more simple and yet attached to the vertebral
                    column, as in <hi rend="italic"> Acontias, Pseudopus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophisaurus.</hi></p>
                <p>In all Saurians with ordinary hind limbs the pelvic girdle is fully
                    developed.</p>
                <p>The Chelonians have long ilia nearly vertical in position and with a
                    cartilaginous margin. The pubis and ischium form an acute angle, and are only
                    connected with their fellows of the opposite side by ligament. There is no os
                    cloacae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hatteria</hi> has a la-certilian pelvis. The pubis has a small
                    forwardly extending process, and the ischium a much more prominent backwardly
                    extending one.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> the acetabulum is formed by the ilium
                    and ischium only, and is imperfectly ossified internally. The two ischia are
                    united by synchondrosis, and each develops a forwardly extending process
                    contributing to close the acetabulum, from which the pubic bone extends
                    forwards, downwards, and inwards. The two pubic bones are only united together
                    by membrane.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chelonia</hi> have the pelvic girdle, like the pectoral
                    one, enclosed between the carapace and plastron. In most forms it is not united
                    with either shield, the ilium being merely attached to the transverse processes
                    of the sacral vertebrae. In some forms, however, as in <hi rend="italic">Chelys,
                    Chelodina, Pelomedusa,</hi> and others, the ilia firmly unite with the posterior
                    plates of the carapace, while the ischia and pubes unite with the plastron. The
                    three bones concur to form the acetabulum, and the two pubes and the two ischia
                    respectively unite in ventral symphyses. The space between the pubis and ischium
                    of either side, the obturator foramen, is in <hi rend="italic"> Chelone</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi> separated from that of the other side by a
                    ligament only, which proceeds from the ischiatic symphysis forwards to the pubic
                    symphysis. In the Land Tortoises, however, the pubes and ischia so expand
                    entrally that the obturator foramen is (on each side) enclosed by the junction
                    of the pubis and ischium of either side at their distal ends. Each pubis has
                    ordinarily a downwardly bent spinous process at its anterior margin, and the
                    ischium often has a process projecting from its hinder margin. The pubes are
                    generally widely expanded bones, very much larger than either the ischia or the
                    ilia.</p>

                    and normal differentiation resembles in its main features that of Mammals; it

                    Vertebrate class, and this according to two modes of simplification. Thus it may
                    be a relatively minute member ending in what is (at least practically) but a

                    /> It may, on the contrary, be simplified by being made up of parts all so
                    exceedingly similar that the typical differentiation of the limb can be with
                    difficulty traced, while the digital elements seem to indicate more than
                    pentadactylism, as in the extinct <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosauri.</hi></p>
                <p>A peculiar complexity and extreme differentiation of this limb, however, exists,
                    as is well known, in another extinct group, the Pterodactyles, wherein the
                    outermost or ulnar digit is enormously elongated so as to support the wing
                    membrane as do the four digits of existing Bats.</p>
                <p>The following are the main conditions of the limb met with in the existing
                    Reptilian orders. In most <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia</hi> there is an
                    elongated humerus, the proximal end of which is compressed and furnished with
                    two tuberosities. Of the <pb break="no"

                    radius, and its olecranon forms a short projection. The carpus consists of nine
                    bones, one at the end of each lower limb, one at the base of each metacarpal,
                    one—the os centrale—between these five and the two at the end of the midlimb
                    bones, and one—the pisiforme—outside these latter two. There are five
                    metacarpals and five digits, the latter composed of phalanges, which for the
                    most part number two for the innermost digit or pollex, three for the next or
                    index, four for the third digit, five for the fourth (generally the longest)
                    digit, and three for the outermost or ulnar digit. In the Chamaeleons the five
                    proximal carpals coalesce with the metacarpals, and the phalanges are 2, 3, 4,
                    4, and 3 respectively; the digits, moreover, are very exceptionally disposed,
                    the three inner or radial digits being opposed to the two outer or ulnar ones.
                    The digits may be but four in number, as in <hi rend="italic">Saurophis,
                    Gymnophthalmus, Tetradactylus,</hi> and others; or but three, as in <hi

                    in <hi rend="italic">Rhodona,</hi> &amp;c., as we have already seen. The limb
                    may be entirely wanting, as in <hi rend="italic">Pygopus, Delma, Lialis, Anguis,
                    Acontias,</hi> and others.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Ophidiα</hi> the pectoral limb is entirely absent, not
                    even a rudiment of it being found.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Hatteria</hi> the limb is Lacertilian in form but has ten
                    carpals.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> have the long limb bones well developed.
                    The carpus has two large long ossicles articulated with the radius and ulna
                    respectively, and a pisiforme; and an oblong bone and disk of cartilage lie
                    between the large carpals and the five metacarpals. The third digit is the
                    longest, and the number of phalanges of the digit from within outwards (as
                    before) is 2, 3, 4, 4, 3.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Chelonia</hi> the humerus may be nearly straight, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Chelone,</hi> or very much curved, as in <hi rend="italic">
                    Testudo.</hi> The radius and ulna, which, though susceptible of very little
                    motion, are generally distinct, may become anchylosed together towards their
                    distal ends, as in <hi rend="italic">Chelone.</hi> The carpus has generally nine
                    ossicles. The pisiforme may be very large, as in <hi rend="italic">
                    Chelone.</hi> There are always five digits, which —both their metacarpals and
                    phalanges—may be very long, as in <hi rend="italic">Chelone,</hi> or exceedingly
                    short, as in <hi rend="italic">Testudo.</hi> The number of the phalanges may be
                    but two to each digit, as in <hi rend="italic"> Testudo,</hi> but generally it
                    is 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, from pollex to the ulnar digit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Pelvic Limb.—</hi> The skeleton of this limb, like that of
                    the pectoral one, is in its main features normally conditioned as is that of
                    Mammals, save as to the mobility of the tarsus, as will be shortly explained. It
                    may, however, be simplified in two ways like the pectoral limb—namely, by the
                    great similarity and want of differentiation of its numerous parts, as in <hi
                    rend="italic"> Ichthyosaurus,</hi> or by excessive reduction in the number of
                    its parts, as in certain Ophidians, and in Saurians such as <hi rend="italic">
                    Pseudopus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lialis.</hi></p>
                <p>Its resemblance to the pectoral limb, which, as we have seen, is so exceedingly
                    close in <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plesiosaurus,</hi> may be, in other conditions, hardly less complete in some
                    Chelonians, such, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chelydra.</hi> When all four limbs are fairly developed, the pelvic ones are in
                    no existing forms so inferior in size to the pelvic ones as in the extinct <hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithosauria,</hi> or so superior in size to the latter as in
                    some of the extinct <hi rend="italic">Dinosauria,</hi> as, <hi rend="italic">
                    e.g</hi> ., in <hi rend="italic">Compsognathus.</hi></p>
                <p>Amongst existing Reptiles the Lacertilians present us with very varied
                    conditions. Generally there is an elongated femur furnished proximally with a
                    trochanter on its inner side. Of the lower limb bones the tibia is larger than
                    the fibula. A knee-pan bone, or patella, is placed in front of the junction of
                    the upper and lower limb bones. The tarsus consists of a proximal segment made
                    up of two large ossicles more or less firmly and immovably united by fibrous
                    tissue to the tibia and fibula and of a distal segment, which consists of a
                    cuboid bone and which is capable of motion upon the proximal segment, while it
                    is firmly connected with the five metatarsals. Thus the flexion of the foot upon
                    the leg takes place, not as in Mammals between the whole tarsus and the
                    leg-bone, but between the distal and proximal segments of the tarsus itself. The
                    outermost or peroneal metatarsal is more or less bent toward its proximal end.
                    The fourth digit is the longest, and the number of the phalanges of the digits,
                    from within outwards, is 2, 3, 4, 5, 4. In the Chamaeleons the distal tarsals
                    coalesce with the metatarsals, and two inner or tibial digits are opposed to the
                    three outer or peroneal ones. The foot may have but four digits, as in <hi
                    rend="italic"> Cαmp&gt;sodactylus, Tekrαdαctylus,</hi> and others; or but three
                    digits, as in <hi rend="italic">Sep&gt;s, Heteromeles,</hi> and others; or only
                    two, as in <hi rend="italic">Chelomeles, Rhodona,</hi> and others; or but a
                    single one, as in <hi rend="italic">Chalcis.</hi> There may be but a very small
                    and slender femur, to which a still smaller tibia unites a rudiment of a tarsal
                    ossicle at its distal end, as in or but a rudiment of a femur and tibia only, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-pus∙,</hi> or the limb may be entirely wanting, as
                    in <hi rend="italic"> Anguis, Acontias, Chirotes, Amphisbaena,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> Lepidosternon.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Op&gt;hidia</hi> the limb is generally wanting, and
                    there is never any rudiment of the tarsus or digits, but there may be a rudiment
                    of a femur, as in <hi rend="italic">Stenostoma,</hi> or of a tibia as well as a
                    femur, the tibia ending in a hooked process, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cylindrophis, Ilysiα,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Boa.</hi></p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Hatteria</hi> the limb is as it normally is in
                    Lacertilians.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> there is a well-developed femur, and
                    also a tibia and a fibula. The tarsus has two proximal bones (less closely
                    united than in Lizards), whereof that adjoining the fibula has a large calcaneal
                    process. The distal segment of the tarsus consists of two rounded ossicles on
                    the peroneal side and a thin plate of cartilage on the tibial side. There are
                    four long tibial metatarsals supporting digits and a rudimentary fifth one to
                    which no rudiment of a digit is attached. Of the four digits the third is
                    generally the longest, and, like the fourth digit, has four phalanges. The
                    second digit has three, and the innermost, or hallux, but two.</p>
                <p>In Chelonians the femur has a strong, rounded articular head, which forms a
                    marked angle with the body of the bone. Sometimes, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emys</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trionyx,</hi> there are two trochanters
                    separated by a groove. The lower limb bones are always distinct. They are
                    longest in the Land Tortoises, and shortest in the Marine Turtles. There is no
                    patella. The tarsal bones vary by coalescence from eight to six in number. They
                    are exceptionally flattened in <hi rend="italic">Chelone.</hi> In <hi
                    rend="italic"> Testudo</hi> the metatarsals are short, but are longer than are
                    the metacarpals, whereas the reverse is the case in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chelone.</hi> There are always five digits, except in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Testudo,</hi> where the fifth is only represented by a rudimentary metatarsal.
                    The metatarsals are shortest,in <hi rend="italic">Tcsiudo</hi> and its allies,
                    though they are not so short as are the digits of the hand. They are longest in
                    the aquatic forms, though they are not so long in <hi rend="italic">Chelone</hi>
                    as are the digits of its hand. The number of phalanges, counting from within
                    outwards, may be 2, 2, 2, 2, as in <hi rend="italic">Testτιdo,</hi> or 2, 3 3 3,
                    2, as in <hi rend="italic">Trwnyx,</hi> or 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, as in <hi

                <p>The muscles of four-footed Reptiles other than the Chelonians are arranged in a
                    general way on the same fundamental plan as in the Mammals, though the
                    determination of the true homology of many of them is more or less difficult if
                    not impossible now to determine. The muscular masses are thus arranged in a

                    ventral region, while for a greater or less extent longitudinal bundles of
                    fibres underlie the vertebral bodies in different parts of the neck and trunk,
                    and prolongations backwards of the dorsal and ventral muscles clothe the
                    skeleton of the caudal region. Muscles like the temporal, masseter, pterygoid,
                    and digastric of Mammals help to open and shut the jaws of Reptiles. Others
                    descend from the dorsal region of the spine to the pectoral and pelvic girdles
                    and to the limb bones, which latter are furnished with flexors and extensors,
                    abductors and adductors, in essentially the same way as are the limbs of
                    birds.</p>
                <p>There are two special deviations from this more normal type of structure. We find
                    one of these in the Serpents, which, being limbless and without a neck, and
                    requiring an extraordinary mobility in the parts of the axial skeleton, have the
                    muscles which clothe the trunk raised to their highest degree of multiplication
                    and differentiation. The other exceptional type is furnished us by the
                    Chelonians, which, having a perfectly rigid body and long neck and limbs
                    singularly situated, have the muscles of the trunk atrophied to an extreme
                    degree, the neck richly supplied with muscles, and also the limbs, while the
                    limb muscles are so strangely different, in either origin or insertion, from
                    those of other animals that their true nature and correct designations do not
                    seem as yet to admit of precise and accurate determination.</p>
                <p>The Muscles of the Trunk and Tail.—In Saurians the caudal muscles often take the
                    form of a series of hollow cones successively enclosed one within the other,
                    while their continuations forward in the trunk become the longissimus dorsi,
                    sacro-lumbalis, spinalis, levatores costarum, and the other muscles familiar to
                    anatomists. Subvertebral continuations form muscles which proceed from the
                    vertebral bodies to the inner surfaces of the ribs, which they tend to pull
                    back—retrahentes costarum—and further forwards, such muscles as answer to the
                    longus colli, rectus capitis, &amp;e., of Mammals. Ventral muscles take the form
                    of the two obliques and transversalis, but the differentiation may be greater
                    than in Mammals, as e.g., in Iguana, where the obliquus externus consists of
                    three distinct layers. Tendinous or harder structures may produce a segmentation
                    in the abdominal muscles, which, under special names, are prolonged to the
                    hyoidian cornua and mandible.</p>
                <p>In Serpents the dorsal muscles are essentially the same as in Lizards, but are
                    more developed, while small superficial muscles run from the ribs to the inside
                    of the abdominal shields which are agents of locomotion. The limbless Serpent is
                    practically somewhat like a Centipede, and moves by the successive protrusion
                    and retraction of each pair of ribs, which serve as two feet. For each pair is
                    attached to a ventral shield the edge of which is applied to and removed from
                    the ground by the ribs attached to it, according as these are protruded or
                    retracted—the shields thus serving as a number of small levers to propel the
                    body along. The subvertebral muscle may also be very largely developed, as in
                    Naja and Crotalus, the long hypapophyses of which have been already noted, and
                    which serve for the attachment of such muscles. By their contraction the force
                    of the downward flow of the poison fangs is greatly increased. That subvertebral
                    series already mentioned as the retrahentes costarum is very extensively
                    developed in the Ophidia.</p>
                <p>In the Crocodilia arrangement is substantially as in Saurians, but the so-called
                    abdominal ribs induce certain differences. Some muscles lie above, some below,
                    and some between these “ribs.” Subvertebral muscles extend beneath the cervical
                    and anterior dorsal vertebrae, and farther back there are retrahentes
                    costarum.</p>
                <p>Hatteria has special muscles inserted into the distal expansions of its ribs,
                    which may sometimes aid its motions in a very subordinate degree, as those of
                    Serpents are so helped in the highest degree. <note anchored="true"

                    </p></note></p>
                <p>In the Chelonians the dorsal muscles are well developed in the neck and tail.
                    Bifold muscles pass from within the hindmost lateral plates of the carapace to
                    the dorsum of the caudal vertebrae. Other muscles extend between the articular
                    and transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae. Dorsal muscles are entirely
                    wanting in the thorax of Testudo, butin Emys and Chelydra a longitudinal muscle
                    lies upon the transverse processes of the trunk vertebrae. In the neck there are
                    a number of muscles extending with various degrees of complexity between the
                    transverse and articular processes. The neck is retracted partly by a muscle
                    passing from it to the procoracoid and partly by a long muscle passing to the
                    head and neck from a greater or less number of the spines and neural arches of
                    the more posterior trunk vertebrae. Pyramidal muscles pass from the pelvis to
                    the plastron, and oblique muscles arise from inside the costal marginal plates
                    of the carapace and pass to the pelvis and plastron, and a transversalis extends
                    from within the costal plates and also passes to the plastron. Λ diaphragm
                    springs from the bodies of certain dorsal vertebrae and one or more ribs, and
                    invests the surface of the lungs.</p>
                <p>The Muscles of the Head.—In ordinary Saurians, the temporal muscle is embraced by
                    the upper (in them the only) zygomatic arch, and descends from the side of the
                    head to the coronoid process of the mandible. The masseter takes origin from the
                    quadrate and columella. Of the two pterygoid muscles one arises from the upper
                    surface of the pterygoid bone and the other from the os transversum. The
                    digastric descends from the hinder part of the cranium to the posterior end of
                    the mandible.</p>
                <p>In the Ophidia the muscular apparatus is much more complex, as might be predicted
                    from the great mobility of their jaws. There are on each side three elevators
                    and several depressors of the lower jaw, and sometimes, as, e.g., in
                    Trigonoeephahis, a muscular belly connected with one of the elevators is so
                    arranged as to be able to compress the poison gland. In poisonous Serpents also
                    a tendon goes from the external pterygoid to the short maxilla, so that the
                    latter can be erected by its intervention. The Suspensorium is drawn upwards and
                    backwards by a muscle arising from the neural spines of the anterior trunk
                    vertebrae, and downwards and forwards by another arising from the basisphenoid.
                    Four other muscles on either side of the head are devoted to moving the palatine
                    apparatus.</p>
                <p>The Crocodilia have a temporalis, an internal and external pterygoid, and a
                    digastric. There are also a pair of sternomandi-bular muscles, and of
                    hyomandibulars (from the cornua of the hyoid), a pair of genioglossi, and a
                    superficial mylohyoid.</p>
                <p>The Chelonia have only an internal pterygoid, besides the temporal and digastric.
                    But they have also a geniohyoid and genioglossus as well as a mylohyoid.</p>
                <p>The Muscles of the Pectoral Girdle and Limb.—In ordinary Saurians and in
                    Crocodiles the scapula is drawn forwards and upwards by a trapezius and levator,
                    and there are also a serratus magnus and a sternoscapular muscle, a
                    cleidomastoid or sterno-mastoid, and generally an omohyoid. In the Chelonia the
                    shoulder-girdle muscles are very reduced and peculiar, and no muscle draws it
                    towards the skull, but a muscle arises from the sides of the cervical vertebrae
                    and is inserted into the scapula. Another (smaller) passes from the second
                    dorsal transverse process and the part of the carapace therewith connected to
                    the scapula, which it draws backwards. Another muscle goes from the coracoid to
                    the hyoid, and yet another—a sort of sternomastoid— from the plastron to the
                    skull.</p>
                <p>Lacertilians have an ordinary pectoralis and generally a subjacent small muscle
                    passing from the coracoid to the great tuberosity ol the humerus. There is a
                    latissimus dorsi going to the lesser tuberosity and a large subscapularis. A
                    triceps ends by a tendon inserted into the olecranon, often containing an
                    ossicle analogous to a patella. There is also a biceps, coracobrachial is and
                    brachialis, anticus, with other Mammalian muscles, flexors, and extensors of the
                    digits, with even lumbrieal muscles, but not with that perfect arrangement of
                    perforating and perforated tendons which characterizes the highest class.</p>
                <p>The muscles of the pectoral limb of Crocodiles, though showing many minor
                    differences from those of Saurians, yet present a fundamental general
                    resemblance to the latter.</p>
                <p>It is otherwise with Chelonians. In them the pectoralis major is represented by
                    two muscles, one a muscle extending from the median plastron plate and external
                    border of the carapace to the inner of the two tuberosities of the humerus, and
                    another muscle inserted beside the former and taking rise from the most anterior
                    plate of the plastron. There is also a superior pectoralis, which arises from
                    the coracoid and coracoacromial ligaments, and which is partly inserted into the
                    same tuberosity and partly extends beyond it. There are also a coracobrachialis
                    and a deltoid, but no suprascapular. All the muscles which arise from the
                    scapula are inserted into the external tuberosity of the humerus. There is a
                    muscle which represents the latissimus dorsi. It arises beneath the most
                    anterior plate of the carapace, and is inserted into the external tuberosity.
                    The muscles of the forearm and extremity are less exceptional.</p>
                <p>Muscles of the Pelvic Girdle and Limb.—In Lacertilians there are several
                    hind-limb muscles which have a subcaudal origin; some of these end at the thigh,
                    while others extend to the feet. There are numerous flexors of the leg. A
                    powerful muscle arises beneath the tail, and is inserted hy a broad tendon into
                    the femur. From the inferior margin of that tendon another slender tendon
                    arises, sometimes ending (as, e.g., in Iguana) in the interarticular cartilage
                    of the knee-joint. The muscles of the thigh, leg, and foot have a general
                    similarity to those of Mammals generally, as have those of the arm and hand, but
                    those which represent the ham-string muscles have generally much complexity and
                    intricacy of arrangement of <pb break="no"

                    muscles in the popliteal space.</p>
                <p>The Crocodilia have an adductor femoris, which arises from beneath the transverse
                    processes of the lumbar region and is inserted by a broad tendon into the femur.
                    An iliacus arises from the inner side of the ilium and ischium, and goes to the
                    inner side of the femur. Several adductors proceed to the femur from the
                    ischium. A long muscle arises from the chevron bones and transverse processes of
                    the anterior third of the tail, and is inserted by a strong tendon into the
                    trochanter; thence descends another tendon along the flexor side of the femur to
                    join the tendon of origin of the gastrocnemius, which springs from the external
                    condyle.</p>
                <p>The Chelοnia possess an abductor femoris, which passes from beneath the
                    transverse processes of the thoracic vertebra, and also a sort of psoas
                    extending from their transverse processes to the ilium. Another muscle goes from
                    the hindmost thoracic transverse processes to the femur. A muscle, attrahens
                    pelvim, arises from within the plastron and goes to the outer process of the
                    pubis. Another muscle which antagonizes this, the retrahens pelvim, springs from
                    the hindermost part of the plastron and goes to the pubis. Other retractors pass
                    from the caudal chevron bones to the front border of the obturator foramen, and
                    another muscle with a similar origin is inserted into the ischial symphysis. The
                    muscles of the more distal part of the limb are less peculiar, and need not be
                    described here.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Alimentary System.</hi></p>
                <p>All Reptiles agree in having an alimentary tract which begins with jaws armed
                    mostly with teeth, rarely with horny sheaths, but never in existing Reptiles
                    with both, though (as has been elsewhere described) such a combination is found
                    in some fossil forms. Moreover, teeth are mostly found not only at the margins
                    of the jaws but also on the palate.</p>
                <p>Almost always there is a tongue, and glandular structures around the mouth pour
                    their secretion into that cavity, which communicates, by tubular prolongation,
                    with the ears, the eyes, and the nostrils. The mouth opens posteriorly into the
                    commencement of a more or less prolonged alimentary canal, the anterior part of
                    which is not, while the greater and less posterior part is, embraced by the
                    peritoneum. At its hinder end this canal opens into a chamber called the cloaca,
                    into which the urinary and generative ducts also open, and which itself opens
                    beneath the hinder part of the trunk by a roundish longitudinal or transversely
                    extended aperture. Two accessory glands aid digestion by the products they pour
                    into the canal. These are the pancreas and the liver, and the latter is always
                    provided with a gall-bladder. A spleen is also always found in the vicinity of
                    the stomach or specially digestive dilatation of the alimentary canal towards
                    its anterior end and separated from the mouth only by the oesophagus.</p>
                <p>The several main groups of existing Reptiles present the following characters
                    :—</p>
                <p>The Ophidia all possess teeth, mostly well developed and anchylosed to the bones
                    which support them. By rare exception, as in Dasyρeltis scaber, the teeth may be
                    quite minute,—the hypapophyses of the anterior trunk vertebra penetrating the
                    dorsal wall of the alimentary canal and being tipped with tooth substance, and
                    taking the place of teeth, as already mentioned in describing the axial
                    skeleton. Teeth generally exist on the palatines and pterygoids as well as on
                    the maxillae and mandible, and in Python and Tortrix in the premaxilla. They may
                    be absent from the palate, as in Uropeltis. But the various conditions as to the
                    disposition of the teeth have already been given in the systematic part of this
                    article.</p>
                <p>In the majority of Serpents the teeth are solid or have but their pulp cavity,
                    but in some harmless ones one or more of the hindmost teeth which are set on the
                    maxilla are longitudinally grooved along their convex side. In poisonous
                    Serpents each maxilla supports a poison fang or tooth so deeply grooved that the
                    margins of the groove meet and so convert the grooved tract into a canal, down
                    which the duct of a poison gland passes. This fang may be the only functional
                    maxillary tooth, as in Crotalus and Vipern, or there may be other teeth behind
                    it, also grooved, as in Naja, or entire, as in Bwιgarus. Almost all Ophidians
                    have a row of small labial salivary glands along either margin of each jaw,
                    their secretion escaping into the mouth by numerous small apertures. In addition
                    to this, some apparently innocuous snakes with grooved teeth have an additional
                    glandular mass connected with the upper labial gland and pouring its secretion
                    by a duct into the dental groove. The truly poisonous Serpents possess a gland
                    placed above the maxilla and os transversum and beneath and behind the ball of
                    the eye, and of different size and extent in different genera. In Naja it may
                    extend for about one-sixth the length of the body, but in Callophis <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See A. B. Meyer, Monatsb. der
                    Αkad. d. Wissen, z. Berlin, 1869. </p></note> it may be yet greater and extend
                    throughout nearly half the length of the entire body of the animal. The poison
                    gland has a fibrous investment, which is often contractile from the presence in
                    it of muscular fibres, and often jaw muscles are so arranged (as already
                    mentioned) as to exert pressure on the gland by their contraction. A nasal gland
                    and a lachrymal gland also convey their secretion into the mouth.</p>
                <p>The tongue is long, bifurcated anteriorly, and extremely mobile, being capable of
                    protrusion from and retraction into a membranous sheath, placed on the floor of
                    the mouth beneath the ventral wall of the larynx.</p>
                <p>The oesophagus is long. The stomach begins by a well-defined limit beside the
                    liver, and may or may not form a curve, but is always simple. A valve at its
                    pyloric end marks the commencement of the duodenum. The small intestine varies
                    much as to the number of its convolutions, which are connected by bands of
                    fibrous tissue and are not followed by foldings of the mesentery. A circular
                    protuberance generally marks its junction with the shorter large intestine, and
                    sometimes there is a caecum, as in Tyρhloρs, Tortrix, Python, and others. The
                    large intestine may be simple, and its internal cavity may be augmented by
                    valves or partial partitions. The cloaca opens externally by a transverse
                    aperture. The liver is not subdivided into conspicuous lobes. The gall-bladder
                    lies separate from the liver and posterior to it. The ductus choledochus passes
                    through the pancreas, which lies behind the pylorus at the right side of the
                    duodenum and is pyramidal (or rounded), or compact, or in separate parts, as in
                    Hydrophis. The spleen lies immediately behind the pancreas. It is rounded,
                    small, and generally entire, not lobed.</p>
                <p>The Lacertilia all possess teeth along the margins of the jaws and very often in
                    the palatines also; but it is only by rare exception, as, e.g., in Iguana, that
                    the pterygoids bear teeth. In the C’hamaeleons the teeth are very rudimentary,
                    little more than an enamelled dentated ridge on the margin of either jaw. The
                    teeth of most Saurians are either acrodont, i.e., anchylosed to the free margins
                    of the jaws (as, e.g., in Psammosaurus), or pleuro-dont, i.e., anchylosed to the
                    inner side of the jaws, their crowns projecting above the margin (as, e.g., in
                    Iguana). Generally more or less conical, the teeth may be acutely pointed, or
                    extremely obtuse, as the hinder teeth of Cyclodus. Sometimes, as, e.g., in
                    Iguana, the teeth may be compressed with a median external vertical ridge and a
                    serrated margin. By rare exception, as, e.g., in Chlamydosaurus, the teeth of
                    either jaw may be much differentiated. Here we have a simulation, or
                    anticipation, of that division of the teeth into incisors, canines, and molars
                    λvhich is so general in the class Mammalia. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    independent origin of similar structures. </p></note> In the genus Hcloderma the
                    teeth are vertically grooved so as to remind us of their structure in Serpents.
                    The teeth indeed are more grooved than in them, for one vertical groove passes
                    down on the antero-inner side and another on the postero-outer side of each
                    tooth. Labial salivary glands generally exist, but are small. In Hcloderma,
                    however, and in no other known Lizard, there is a very large salivary gland on
                    either side of the lower jaw. The quality of its saliva is distinctly poisonous,
                    small animals bitten by Heloderma in our zoological gardens dying as if bitten
                    by a venomous Serpent. No other such case is known to exist amongst the
                    Lacertilia.</p>
                <p>The tongue presents a number of variations of form which have been already
                    referred to as diagnostic characters in the systematic part of this article. It
                    will suffice here to remind the reader that it may be broad and flat without any
                    sheath, and with a pair of anterior and of posterior processes, as in
                    Amphisbaena; or short, broad, and slightly notched in front, as in Gecko; or
                    short with a slight bifurcation in front and two long processes behind, as in
                    Chalcis; or with a sheath, and much like that of Serpents, as in Psammosaurus;
                    or cylindrical and wonderfully extensile, as in Chamaeleo.</p>
                <p>The oesophagus passes into a stomach, which is generally elongated and curved.
                    The small intestine may be hardly at all convoluted (as in Amphisbaena) or very
                    much so, but if so the mesentery here follows its folds. Similarly the large
                    intestine may be short and straight, or long and with internal folds. There may
                    be a caecum, as, e.g., in Amphisbaena and some Chamaeleons. The cloaca opens
                    externally by a transverse aperture.</p>
                <p>The liver is but little lobed, and its gall-bladder lies in a fissure on its left
                    side. The pancreas and spleen usually lie between the folds of the mesentery at
                    the junction of the small intestine with the stomach. There is generally a pair
                    of anal glands.</p>

                    in front of the toothed parts of their jaws, may but have carried out further
                    and more completely that process of tooth reduction which wo find to be effected
                    with age in Hatteria.</p>
                <p>The liver consists of two lateral lobes.</p>

                    are implanted in distinct alveoli. The tongue is so flat and closely attached to
                    the floor of the mouth that it can hardly be con sidered as having a distinct
                    existence. A</p>
                <p>transverse fold of membrane extends along its hinder border and another similar
                    fold descends in front of the posterior nares.</p>
                <p>There are no salivary glands.</p>
                <p>The oesophagus is wide, and the stomach nearly circular and gizzard-like, having
                    thick muscular walls formed of fibres radiating from central tendons. The small
                    intestine consists of two parts,—an anterior part much convoluted, thin-walled,
                    and lined with villi, which is succeeded by a thicker-walled part with internal
                    zig-zag folds. There is no caecum, but a circular prominence marks the
                    commencement of the large intestine, which is short and wide with a smooth
                    lining. It is funnel-shaped, and opens by a very narrow aperture into a very
                    elongated cloaca, the external opening of which is rather longitudinal.</p>
                <p>The liver, like that of Hatteria, is in two lobes, and the gallbladder is beside
                    the right lobe. The spleen lies behind the pancreas between the folds of the
                    duodenum. The various viscera of the abdominal cavity lie, as in Birds, in
                    separate serous sacs. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In the Chelonia there are horny sheaths to the jaws but no teeth, though numerous
                    rudiments of teeth have been found in the embryo of Triοηyx. <note

                    </p></note> The tongue is not extensible, but is differently conditioned in
                    different genera. There appears to be only a sublingual salivary gland, though
                    the palate of the Land Tortoise exhibits the apertures of numerous cutaneous
                    follicles.</p>
                <p>The oesophagus leads to the left part of the transversely placed stomach. The
                    extent of both the small and the large intestine varies; the latter is at its
                    shortest in Trionyx. The cloaca opens externally by a somewhat rounded
                    aperture.</p>
                <p>The liver is mostly large, and in two lobes connected by one or more transverse
                    bands of its substance. The gall-bladder lies on its right and may be sunk
                    within its substance. The pancreas has often several excretory ducts, and the
                    spleen is generally of large size.</p>

                <p>All the <hi rend="italic">Reptilia</hi> breathe air from the first moment of
                    their separate existence, and are never furnished with anything in the shape of
                    gills. The apparatus by which their respiration is effected is always a pair of
                    sacs or lungs —whereof one sometimes aborts—into and from which air is
                    introduced and removed by the intervention of an azygous tube, the trachea,
                    which, passing forwards ventrally to the oesophagus, or beside it, opens in the
                    floor of the mouth behind the tongue. The more or less dilated most anterior
                    portion of the azygous tube is the larynx, which may become a vocal organ.</p>
                <p>In the Laeertilia the external opening of the larynx may, by rare exception, as
                    in Phryηosoma, be placed in front of the hind-most margin of the tongue, so that
                    the larynx seems to perforate that organ, but is in fact merely enclosed by the
                    posterior, exterior, and median junction of two lingual processes. A membranous
                    or cartilaginous epiglottis may protect the entrance to the larynx as in
                    Mammals. The larynx may be composed of one cartilage, which is produced
                    anteriorly into two arytenoid processes, but generally these latter are distinct
                    cartilages. Folds of membrane or vocal cords may exist, as in the Geckos and
                    Chamaeleons, and the latter have also a wide membranous sac connected with the
                    larynx. The trachea is generally short, but may be long, as in Amphisbaena and
                    Lepidosternon. It is never convoluted, and its cartilages may or may not form
                    complete rings. It ends posteriorly by dividing into two bronchi, which are
                    usually very short, but may be of moderate length, as in Psamrnosaurιιs. The
                    lungs are generally of about equal size, but in the Snake-like Lizards the right
                    lung is the longer, and sometimes, as in Typhline and Acοntias, the left lung
                    may be quite rudimentary. The lungs may be simple bags or may give out lateral
                    processes or pouches of varying extent. In the Chamaeleons their hinder halves
                    are prolonged into narrow tubular processes. Each lung is enclosed in a fold of
                    peritoneum.</p>
                <p>The Ophidia have the opening of the larynx behind the tongue rather prominent,
                    with only a rudimentary epiglottis. The nature of their prey and their mode of
                    eating do not readily expose them to the danger of small particles of food
                    finding their way into the trachea. The cartilaginous framework of the larynx is
                    very elongated. The trachea has its more anterior cartilages in the form of
                    complete rings. The lungs are unsymmetrical in all the genera, but much more so
                    in some than in others—one lung entirely aborting in Typhlops, Aeroelwrdus, and
                    Viρera amongst others. The two lungs are both of tolerable size in Python, Boa,
                    and Eryx, which have the bronchi leading from the trachea to the two pulmonary
                    sacs. These sacs may or may not be divided into subordinate cells towards the
                    hinder end of each. Sometimes part of the trachea itself may be dilated dorsally
                    into cellular prominences like an accessory lung, as in Hydroplds, or ventrally,
                    as in Aerochordus. A pulmonary sac may extend not only far backwards but also
                    forwards to the hyoidean region, as in Heterodon.</p>
                <p>In the Chelonia the opening of the larynx or glottis is longitudinal. It may be
                    furnished with a membranous epiglottis, or may have none, as in Testudo. There
                    may be cricoid and arytenoid cartilages in addition to main cartilages, but the
                    details of structure differ in different genera. There are no vocal cords. The
                    trachea and bronchi vary in length, the former being long in most forms, the
                    latter in Testudo. In Cinixys the trachea and bronchi arc contorted. The lungs
                    arc invested anteriorly and on their ventral side by peritoneum, and also by the
                    diaphragm as they lie between it and the carapace, and therefore they do not
                    project freely into the abdominal cavity.</p>

                <p>The Crocodilia have no epiglottis, but the larynx is attached by tendinous fibres
                    to the front part of the shield-like basihyal. The larynx consists of a
                    ring-shaped principal cartilage and arytenoid cartilages. There are folds which
                    serve for vocal cords. The trachea is long, with two short bronchi. The former
                    is generally straight, but may be contorted. The more anterior tracheal
                    cartilages are incomplete dorsally; those of the hinder part and of the bronchi
                    are generally complete. Each lung consists of pouches or cells, the cavities of
                    which open into each other, and communicate with the cavity of the bronchus by
                    the lateral openings just mentioned. The lungs are enclosed in pouches of
                    peritoneum, and lie, freely suspended, in the body cavity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Vascular System.</hi></p>
                <p>The vascular system of Reptiles consists of a sanguineous and a lymphatic system,
                    and the former is further subdivided into an arterial and a venous system, as in
                    the higher Vertebrates, though the latter two are less completely
                    differentiated. In all there is a heart, which consists of at least three
                    distinct cavities, namely, two auricles (which are almost always distinct) and a
                    ventricle, which latter may or may not be completely subdivided into two
                    distinct chambers, a right and a left ventricle. Reptiles differ from the higher
                    Vertebrates in the heart always giving rise to at least two great vessels, which
                    ultimately join to form a single vessel, and from these all the arteries are
                    given off. Most of the blood of the hind limbs and tail passes either through a
                    portal system in the liver, or else in the kidney, on its road to the heart.
                    That which goes to the liver goes to it for the most part through the anterior
                    abdominal veins or vein. The venous blood is conveyed to the right ventricle
                    through a rhythmically contractile sinus venosus. The lymphatic system is well
                    developed, with large reservoirs, and communicates freely with the venous system
                    by a pair of rhythmically contractile so-called “lymphatic hearts.”</p>
                <p>The Heart and Arterial System.—In all the existing Reptiles except the
                    Crocodilia—that is to say, in the Rhynchocephaliα, Laccrtilia, Oqjhidia, and
                    Chclonia—the two auricles are divided by a complete septum (except in some
                    Chelonians), but the ventricle is only imperfectly divided into aright and left
                    chamber. Of these the latter is the narrower, the more dorsal in position, and
                    mostly has thicker walls, and communicates directly with the left auricle. The
                    right chamber of the ventricle is broader, more ventral, and posterior, and
                    mostly with thinner walls, and communicates directly with the right auricle. No
                    arteries proceed from the left chamber, but three proceed from the right
                    chamber, one of which, the pulmonary artery, goes to the lungs, and the other
                    two constitute the trunk roots of the whole systemic set of arteries or the two
                    aortae. Between the mouths of their trunk root and that of the pulmonary artery
                    a muscular ridge or valve extends, which imperfectly divides the right chamber
                    of the ventricle into two cavities, which, during the latter part of the
                    ventricle’s contraction, become completely divided by it so as to shut off’ the
                    contained blood from any further access to the pulmonary artery. These great
                    arterial vessels thus leaving the heart are at first closely connected together
                    and are invested with the pericardium, and sometimes, in Chelonians, their
                    investment has been observed to contain striated muscular fibres, thus reminding
                    us of the “bulbus arteriosus” of Amphibians. Afterwards the great arteries
                    proceed in diverging and opposite directions, one aorta arching over to the
                    right and the other to the left, and then meeting and uniting on the dorsal side
                    of the heart to form by their junction the single great dorsal aorta.</p>
                <p>Amongst the Lαccrtilia, the Monitors are remarkable for the almost complete
                    septum between their ventricular chambers. In many Lizards the great arteries
                    going to the head may be so connected with the two primitive arterial roots as
                    to form two arches called aortic arches on either side, but in 1he Monitors,
                    Cliamaeleons, and Amphisbaena these complications are wanting, there being but a
                    single aortic arch on cither side. Generally the right trunk root, or right
                    fundamental aortic arch, after sup]dying small arteries to the heart itself,
                    gives off’ a common carotid artery, which divides into a right and a left
                    carotid, and these subdivide to supply the head and neck. It also gives off the
                    subclavian arteries for the fore limbs <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> and
                    arteries to the trunk. The left trunk root, or left fundamental aortic arch,
                    gives off arteries to the viscera, and then anastomoses with the right trunk
                    root, the two anastomosing to form the single dorsal aorta, which passes
                    backwards beneath the bodies of the vertebrae, and gives off branches to
                    the'stomach and the viscera, and to the kidneys, sexual glands, hind limbs, and
                    tail.</p>
                <p>In the Op&gt;hidia the heart is elongated and very distant from the head, and
                    there are of course no limb arteries given off from the aortae.</p>
                <p>The heart is also distant from the head in the Chelonia, but it is broad in shape
                    and lies above the coracoids. Striated muscular fibres invest the aortic roots
                    in Emys.</p>
                <p>In the Crocodilia the ventricle is subdivided by a complete septum into two
                    thoroughly distinct chambers, and a trunk root or fundamental aorta proceeds
                    forth from each,—the left aorta and the pulmonary artery proceeding from the
                    right chamber, and the right aorta from the left ventricle. Nevertheless, though
                    there is here no communication between the chambers whence these two aortae
                    arise, there is a communication between these two aortae themselves, and that
                    not only when they anastomose after arching different ways, as in all other
                    Reptiles, but also by a direct communication between them. When they cross one
                    another, as the aorta from the right chamber arches to the left and that from
                    the left chamber arches to the right, a small aperture places their cavities in
                    communication just outside the heart and close to their respective origins.</p>
                <p>The Venous System.—The systemic veins arising in all parts of the body collect
                    together and anastomose till their three finally formed trunks open into a more
                    or less capacious contractile cavity, the sinus venosus, which communicates with
                    the right auricle. The anterior two of these three final trunks are called venae
                    anonymae, and the single posterior one is called the vena cava. The former are
                    formed by the gradual junction of the veins of the head, neck, fore limbs, and
                    vertebral region (jugular veins, subclavian azygous veins, &amp;c.), and the
                    vena cava is formed by the junction of the iliac veins or those of the hind
                    limbs, together with the veins of the rest of the body.</p>
                <p>The veins of the alimentary canal, spleen, and pancreas, and the abdominal veins
                    (running between the peritoneum and the abdominal muscles) or vein—there being
                    one in the Ophidia— commonly collect and unite to enter the liver to form a
                    portal system.</p>
                <p>In the Ophidia the veins of the alimentary canal, generative organs, fatty
                    appendages, pancreas, and spleen thus unite, while the caudal vein with some
                    veins of the generative organs and intestine go to form a subordinate secondary
                    circulation in the kidney or reni-portal system. In the Faeertilia the veins of
                    the hind limbs collect in part to form a reni-portal system, and also
                    communicate with the abdominal veins, which join the ordinary visceral veins to
                    form the true portal system. In the Chelonia the veins of the tail and hind
                    limbs join the abdominal veins above the plastron, and there with others from
                    the bladder and viscera go to form the portal system, while small branches from
                    the abdominal veins join others from the generative organs and vertebral veins
                    to form a reni-portal system. In the Crocodilia the caudal vein divides on
                    entering the trank and joins the posterior limb and body veins, and goes on to
                    form, with the visceral veins, a portal system, giving off in this way veiυs to
                    the kidneys to form the reni-portal system.</p>
                <p>In all Reptiles the veins of the lungs collect together and empty themselves into
                    the left auricle as they do in all other air-breathing Vertebrates.</p>
                <p>The Lymphatic System and Vascular Glands.—In Reptilia generally there is a pair
                    of lymphatic hearts placed over the transverse processes of the vertebrae at the
                    junction of the tail with the trank. Each usually opens with a small vein which
                    communicates with the iliac vein. Besides these bodies, more or less
                    considerable lymphatic canals follow the course of the great arterial tranks in
                    the body and tail, and, when there are limbs, communicate with the iliac veins.
                    Other canals accompany the aortic arches and approach and open into the venae
                    anonymae, and others extend backwards towards these from the head and anterior
                    limbs.</p>
                <p>A pair of bodies which answer to the thymus gland of Mammals lie close to the
                    jugular veins and lymphatics at the anterior part· of the thoracic cavity. They
                    are elongated in Ophidians and roundish in other Reptiles, and they are much
                    larger in young than in old individuals.</p>
                <p>A thyroid exists in front of the pericardium on the ventral side of the great
                    arterial trunks. It is bilobed in the Crocodiles.</p>
                <p>The supra-renal capsules are yellowish bodies which lie more in connexion with
                    the generative glands than the kidneys. They are very elongated in the Ophidia,
                    flattened in the Chelonia, and roundish in the Crocodilia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Nervous System and Organs of Sense.</hi></p>
                <p>Reptiles, in common with other Vertebrates, have a nervous system divisible into
                    an axial portion or neural axis made up of brain and spinal marrow, and a
                    peripheral portion made up of the multitude of nerves which proceed from or are
                    connected with this, and one portion of which is more or less distinctly
                    separable and known as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n477/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0477-0460"/>the sympathetic system. Reptiles also generally
                    possess three distinct organs of sense—(1) ears, (2) eyes, and (3) nasal
                    organs—though one or more of them may be exceptionally rudimentary and
                    defective.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Neural Axis.—</hi> The spinal marrow extends through nearly
                    the whole length of the neural canal of the skeleton in the form of a long
                    nervous cylinder with a small central cavity, with a deep furrow along the
                    middle of its dorsal and a shallow one on the middle of its ventral aspect. It
                    becomes more or less augmented in volume about the region of the shoulders and
                    loins, where the nerves of the limbs are given off from it. Even where most
                    enlarged, however, the tracts on either side of the dorsal furrow do not diverge
                    and leave a space or sinus as they do in the lumbar enlargement of Birds. Where
                    the spinal marrow comes to join the brain it enlarges considerably. At the
                    medulla oblongata it is bent down at a marked angle with the more posterior part
                    of the neural axis. The two halves of its dorsal portion also diverge so as to
                    expose the dorsal surface of the more ventral portion in a space which is known
                    as the fourth ventricle or ventricle of the medulla. This medulla advances
                    forward, expanding and becoming locally differentiated to form the brain, its
                    ventricle being continued on into a more anterior and more completely enclosed
                    cavity known as the third ventricle. The nervous roof of the hinder part of this
                    latter ventricle is produced into two smooth prominences placed side by side and
                    called the optic globes or corpora bigemina (which may themselves contain a
                    cavity), immediately behind which is an azygous nervous structure, the
                    cerebellum, which more or less roofs over the hindmost or fourth ventricle. In
                    front of the optic lobes are the larger rounded smooth neural masses—the
                    cerebral hemispheres, each of which contains a cavity—the lateral or first and
                    second ventricles, which both communicate with the anterior end of the third
                    ventricle through an aperture termed the foramen of Munro. Between the hinder
                    ends of these hemispheres an azygous structure projects upwards—the pineal
                    gland—while from beneath the floor of the third ventricle another azygous
                    structure projects downwards— the pituitary body. In front of the hemispheres
                    are the other rounded and smaller neural masses, the olfactory lobes, which are
                    generally elongated and contain cavities that are continuations forwards of the
                    lateral ventricles. Three transverse bands of nervous tissue connect the
                    structures which bound the third ventricle laterally; the first of these, placed
                    just behind the lamina terminalis or the front boun dary of that ven tricle, is
                    called the anterior com missure, and the nervous masses it joins are the cor
                    pora striata. An other more pos teriorly situated band is called the soft
                    commissure; and the third, a little farther back still, is the posterior
                    commissure. The masses joined by those last two commissures are called the optic
                    thalami. The brain is invested with membranes in the same general way as it is
                    in Mammals.</p>
                <p>In the Larertilia the cerebellum is a thin very small body projecting rather
                    upwards, and may be transversely segmented, as in Platydactylus. In the
                    Chamaeleons the optic lobes and hemispheres are of nearly equal size, and the
                    olfactory lobes are neither separated off nor hollow. In the Ophidia the
                    cerebellum nearly covers the fourth ventricle, the hemispheres are of
                    considerable size, and the olfactory lobes may be immediately annexed to them.
                    In the Chelonia the cerebellum is rather large, but it is only in the Crocodilia
                    that it is marked by transverse grooves, as is the central part of the
                    cerebellum or dermis in Mammals; the hemispheres also are of considerable
                    volume.</p>
                <p>In some extinct Reptilia, e.g., in the Dinosaurian Stegosαιmιs, the brain was
                    exceedingly small, probably weighing but the hundredth part of that of the
                    Alligator compared with the weight of the bodies of the two animals. Moreover,
                    the cerebral hemispheres but little exceeded the optic lobes in size, while the
                    transverse diameter of these lobes only slightly exceeded that of the medulla.
                    The cerebellum also was very small. In the Omithosauria, however, the optic
                    lobes were unlike in their situation those of any existing Reptiles, they being
                    depressed and placed laterally instead of on the dorsum of the brain, thus
                    resembling the optic lobes of Birds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Peripheral System.—</hi> As in the higher Mammals, so also
                    in Reptiles, the neural axis gives off a series of special nerves, which in a
                    general way correspond in number with the vertebrae they pass out between. Each
                    also arises by a superior and inferior root, whereof the former is furnished
                    with a ganglion. After the junction of these two roots the whole nerve thus
                    formed divides into ascending and descending branches—the latter, in the trunk,
                    running between the internal oblique and transverse muscles.</p>
                <p>The cranial nerve which comes forth from the brain nearest the spinal marrow is
                    the hypoglossal. It passes out through a condyloid foramen in the occipital
                    bone, and goes to the tongue, hyoid, and larynx. A more anteriorly placed nerve,
                    called the spinal accessory, exists except in Ophidia. It arises between the
                    superior and inferior roots of the more anterior spinal nerves, and then enters
                    the cranium, which it leaves again in company with that next to be noted. It
                    supplies certain dorsal muscles of the neck or anterior part of the trunk. The
                    next or pneumogastric nerve passes out into the spinal accessory. It is
                    distributed to the lungs, stomach, and heart. To these, next in advance,
                    succeeds the glossopharyngeal for the tongue and pharynx. Very distinct from the
                    foregoing is the facial nerve, which passes out at a distinct foramen and turns
                    rather backwards to supply the sides of the head. Next is to be distinguished
                    the acoustic nerve, which goes to the internal ear, and in front of that again
                    is the trigeminal, which is wont to make its exit at two distinct places, and
                    diverges into three branches, which go respectively to the orbit, the upper jaw,
                    and the lower jaw. Then come three small nerves destined to supply the muscles
                    which move the eyeball; and foremost but one is the optic nerve; this crossing
                    its fellow of the opposite side beneath the brain, the fibres of the tw’o nerves
                    blend at their point of intersection and so form what is called the chiasma.
                    Most anterior of all are the olfactory nerves, which proceed from the olfactory
                    lobes to the nasal organs themselves.</p>
                <p>In the Chelοnia the spinal accessory may take origin as far back as the root of
                    the fourth cervical nerve. The pneumogastric and glosso-pharyngeal pass out from
                    the skull separately as in Saurians, and not through one foramen as in Ophidians
                    and Crocodilians.</p>
                <p>Those spinal nerves which continue to supply the limbs form certain more or less
                    complex unions with each other termed plexuses, and from each plexus the nerves
                    of the fore or hind limbs, as the case may be, proceed. The plexus which
                    supplies the nerves of the fore limb is called the brachial plexus. It is formed
                    by the hlendingof about the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth spinal nerves in
                    the Turtle and Crocodile, and the nerves it gives forth are the axillary, ulnar,
                    radial, musculo-spiral. and median as in Mammals. Certain of the more posterior
                    nerves unite to form a crural plexus and others just behind the former blend to
                    form a sacral plexus, and from these the nerves of the leg and pelvic region
                    proceed. Amongst these nerves are the crural, obturator, and especially tlιe
                    great sciatic nerve, which passes to the back of the thigh and divides into the
                    tibial nerves.</p>
                <p>As to the particular spinal nerves which go to form these plexuses respectively,
                    and as to the mode of their interlacement and mode of giving origin to the limb
                    nerves, there is not only diversity between different genera of the same order
                    and species of the same genus, but also between different individuals of the
                    same genus, and even between the two sides of the same individual Reptile.</p>
                <p>The Sympathetic Nervous System—nerves which copiously supply the viscera—is least
                    marked in the Ophidia, in which this system is not distinct, in the greater part
                    of the body, from the spinal nerves. Essentially the system consists of two
                    antero-posteriorly extending nervous cords, which run on either side of the
                    axial skeleton in its ventral aspect. Each of these two cords is joined by
                    fibres from the spinal and cranial nerves adjacent to it except the nerves of
                    the nose, eye, and ear. At the points of <pb break="no"

                    sympathetic cords there are ganglia, and from these sympathetic nerves proceed
                    to the viscera, the heart, and the various blood-vessels.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Ear.—</hi> The auditory organ may consist of three
                    parts—the external, median, and internal ear. The external ear, however, hardly
                    exists in Reptiles, for there is no external fold of skin representing the
                    external ear of Mammals in any save in the Crocodiles, and in them it is little
                    more than a rudiment.</p>
                <p>The true internal ear always exists, and is composed of two parts—(1) a
                    membranous labyrinth, containing fluid, enclosed in (2) a bony labyrinth, which
                    has also fluid contents. The former consists of three membranous semicircular
                    canals which open into a membranous sac, the vestibule, which is connected with
                    a tubular structure, the membranous cochlea. It is to these parts that the
                    ultimate fibres of the auditory nerve are distributed. The bony labyrinth is
                    formed of the otic bones (prootic, epiotic, and opisthotic), which enclose it
                    completely save at the points where openings are left called the fenestra ovalis
                    and the fenestra rotunda. The latter is entirely surrounded by the opisthotic.
                    The fenestra ovalis is partly enclosed by the prootic and partly by the
                    opisthotic. The prootic specially protects and shelters the anterior vertical
                    semicircular canal of the membranous labyrinth, and correspondingly constitutes
                    that of the bony labyrinth. The posterior vertical semicircular canal is
                    similarly related to the epiotic, and the external horizontal semicircular canal
                    is sheltered by the prootic and opisthotic. The membranous cochlea helps to
                    almost divide the bony chamber in which it lies into two parts called scalae,
                    which communicate at the apex of the cavity.</p>
                <p>Such being the innermost ear of Reptiles and an outermost ear existing only in
                    rudiment in Crocodiles, there is also a median ear which may or may not exist in
                    this class of animals. This median ear is the tympanic cavity or chamber. It is
                    into this cavity when present that the fenestra ovalis looks, while the fenestra
                    rotunda looks into the cochlea. Both fenestrae are closed with membrane, so that
                    the fluid in which the membranous labyrinth is suspended cannot escape through
                    them. The fenestra ovalis has fitted to the outer side of its closing membrane a
                    small ossicle of similar shape to itself, which generally has projecting from
                    its outer side a more or less elongated and slender ossicle, the stapes or
                    columella auris. This rod may be wanting, however, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Typhlops, Rhinophis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tortrix.</hi> When a middle or
                    tympanic cavity exists, the stapes traverses it from the ossicle, closing the
                    fenestra ovalis to become attached to a membrane, the tympanic membrane, which
                    forms part of the external wall of the tympanum. Where there is no tympanic
                    cavity, the stapes simply extends outwards amongst the muscles which lie
                    external to the internal ear. In the <hi rend="italic">Ophidia</hi> and
                    Amphis-baenians and some other Snake-like Lacertilians there is no tympanic
                    cavity, and there is none in <hi rend="italic">Hatteria.</hi> Its presence is
                    sometimes inconstant in those Lizards; thus in the Slow Worm, <hi rend="italic">
                    Anguis fragilis,</hi> it may exist in some individuals and not in others. When
                    it exists, it may not show any external indication of its presence as in the
                    Chamaeleons and some Chelonians, Generally, however, the tympanic membrane is
                    covered by a scale of corresponding size, so that its presence is plainly marked
                    externally.</p>
                <p>The tympanic cavity communicates with the back of the mouth by a wide opening in
                    Lacertilians; but in Chelonians this communication is contracted into a narrow
                    passage, the Eustachian tube, which opens (one from each tympanum) by a separate
                    aperture on the roof of the mouth. In the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi>
                    these passages become further complicated and connected so that, in addition to
                    the aperture on either side of the mouth, there is also a median aperture which
                    is connected with both the Eustachian tubes, that of the right ear and that of
                    the left.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Eye.—</hi> All Reptiles have eyes, although in some forms
                    they are quite rudimentary and hidden beneath the skin, which is not at all or
                    but very slightly modified in structure where it passes over them, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Typhlops</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> Typhline.</hi></p>
                <p>The eye consists of the same parts as in other Vertebrates, namely, of a nervous
                    expansion at the back (the retina) derived from the optic nerve, a coloured
                    lining (the choroid), a transparent medium (the vitreous humour) separated from
                    one more anterior (the aqueous humour) by a sort of diaphragm (the iris), and a
                    solid, transparent body (the crystalline lens), whilst the whole structure is
                    enclosed by a fibrous membrane, the sclerotic, to form the “ball of the eye,” a
                    superficial part of the sclerotic being transparent and distinguished as the
                    cornea.</p>
                <p>The ball may have the skin which invests it externally separated in front of it
                    into two folds, the eyelids. When the skin is not so separated, then a closed
                    sac of delicate transparent membrane, the conjunctiva, lies over the cornea
                    between it and the skin, and when the skin is divided into folds or eyelids then
                    the conjunctiva is divided also, one layer lying as before next to the cornea,
                    and the other layer being reflected from the outer margin of the cornea into the
                    inside of the eyelids which it lines. There is often a third eyelid, which can
                    be drawn obliquely over the eye, and is called the nictitating membrane. A
                    glandular structure, the lacrymal gland, lies on the outer side of the front of
                    the eyeball, its secretion passing into the mouth by the lacrymal canal; another
                    gland, the Harderian gland, may lie on the inner side of the eyeball. The
                    sclerotic may be strengthened by bony plates being formed within it. A vascular
                    coloured membrane, the pecten, may project into the vitreous humour from near
                    the entrance of the optic nerve. The ball of the eye is moved by four straight
                    and two oblique muscles, and may also be suspended by a funnel-shaped muscular
                    sheath, the choanoid muscle. There are also special muscles of the eyelids.</p>
                <p>In the Οphidia the eye is generally rather large, but very small in the
                    Typhlopidae and Uropeltidae. In no Ophidians is the skin over the eyes divided
                    into eyelids, so that the sac of the conjunctiva beneath it is never subdivided.
                    In the Eurystomatous Ophidians, however, the skin, when it passes over the
                    eyeball, is transparent. The outer (or epidermal) layer of the skin is cast with
                    the rest of the skin of the body. The lacrymal canal is wide, but opens into the
                    mouth by a narrow aperture on the inner side of the palatine bone. In some
                    Trigonoeephali the lacrymal gland extends almost all round the eyeball. The
                    sclerotic never develops bony plates in any Serpent.</p>
                <p>Amongst the Lacertilia, many, such as the Amphisbaenians, the Geckos, and many
                    Skinks, have the eyelids undivided, as they are in Ophidians. Most Lizards,
                    however, have an upper and an under eyelid, and also a nictitating membrane, and
                    there may be a cartilaginous or bony disk in the lower eyelid. Many Skinks have
                    the lower eyelid more or less transparent. The eye of the Cliamaeleon is most
                    peculiar. The larger eyelids have but a minute aperture, and the two eyeballs
                    can be rotated independently, so that their axes may be differently directed
                    simultaneously. There is a rudiment of a third eyelid, and there is a bony plate
                    in the lower part of the large eyelid. The Harderian gland is large, but the
                    lacrymal is small. The lacrymal canal opens below in the outer wall of the
                    posterior nares. In most Lacertilians there are overlapping bony plates in the
                    sclerotic, but these are wanting in Chamaeleons and Geckos. There is mostly a
                    pecten. In some species the lacrymal gland appears to be wanting. The
                    nictitating or third eyelid is drawn over the eye by the simultaneous action of
                    two curiously arranged structures. One of these is a muscle which takes origin
                    from the postero-inner orbital wall and ends by forming a fibrous loop. The
                    other is a tendon which passes through the loop to be attached at one end to the
                    nictitating membrane, and at the other to the inner wall of the orbit.</p>
                <p>In Hatteria there are eyelids—the lower with a cartilaginous disk—and a
                    nictitating membrane. The sclerotic contains osseous lamellae, and there is no
                    pecten.</p>
                <p>The Crocodilia have three eyelids, and no bony plate in any part <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n479/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0479-0462"/>of the eye. A muscle arises from the surface of
                    the sclerotic on its inner side and ends in a tendon which passes backwards and
                    downwards over the optic nerve to attach itself to the margin of the nictitating
                    membrane. There is a rudimentary pecten.</p>
                <p>In the Chelonia the sclerotic is furnished with bony plates. The Harderian gland
                    is small, but the lacrymal is considerable. There are three eyelids, and the
                    nictitating one has the muscle which moves it combined with the elevator muscle
                    of the eyelids. Both arise from the inner side of the sclerotic. One arches over
                    the optic nerve and goes to the third eyelid, and the other goes from the outer
                    angle of the eye to the lower eyelid. The fibres of these two muscles are
                    closely interrelated at their origin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Olfactory Organ.—</hi> There are two olfactory organs in
                    every Reptile, consisting of tracts or foldings of mucous membrane richly
                    supplied with nerves and supported and protected by cartilaginous or bony
                    structures. In existing Reptiles they always lie at, and extend near to, the
                    anterior end of the muzzle, though in the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosauri</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Plesiosauri</hi> they opened anteriorly far back and near
                    the orbits. The olfactory membranes are always enclosed or supported by
                    cartilages which proceed out from an azygous septum which divides them one from
                    the other. Each nasal organ has an anterior and posterior opening, though the
                    anterior openings may so meet as to form but one superficial aperture, as in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia,</hi> and the two posterior apertures may open, not
                    directly into the mouth, but into an azygous forwardly-extending diverticulum
                    from it, the posterior opening of which diverticulum forms practically a common
                    posterior termination for both the organs of smell. The nasal passages are short
                    in all existing Reptiles save the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia,</hi> and open
                    posteriorly far forwards—as has been already noticed in describing the skull,
                    when the prolongation backwards of the posterior nares in the Crocodiles was
                    also described. In the <hi rend="italic">Chelonia</hi> the anterior external
                    apertures of the nostrils are distinct though near together. Sometimes, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Chelys</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Trionyx,</hi> they are
                    tubular, and open externally at the end of a short proboscis.</p>
                <p>A structure called the nasal gland exists and is well-developed in the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Ophidia.</hi> It is a peculiar rather soft body, often shaped
                    like a mushroom with a very short stalk. It lies immediately beneath the floor
                    of the nasal capsule, and the membranous wall of the cavity on which it lies is
                    covered and protected by a bone, commonly called the “turbinal,” which extends
                    out from the median nasal septum to the maxilla. These cavities open on the
                    palate by narrow apertures placed in front of the posterior nares.</p>
                <p>In the Chelonians we find a soft, egg-shaped, whitish, azygous body (without any
                    internal cavity), also placed in front of the posterior nares in the skin of the
                    palate, behind the palatine part of the premaxillae. It is supplied with
                    palatine nerves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Urogenital System.</hi></p>
                <p>In Reptiles the urinary and generative systems are distinct, save as regards the
                    approximation of their posterior terminations, thus agreeing with higher
                    Vertebrates and differing from Amphibians, in which the renal and secreting
                    organs generally continue throughout life more or less connected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Urinary System.—</hi> The urinary system of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Rep-tilia</hi> always consists of a pair of renal glands or
                    kidneys, with excretory ducts which pass down to the cloaca. There may or may
                    not be a urinary bladder, also opening into the cloaca. Besides these parts
                    there are also a pair of Wolffian bodies, which are more or less aborted
                    remnants of large organs which are always developed during embryonic life.</p>
                <p>The Kidneys.—The kidneys are more or less symmetrically placed on the dorsal side
                    of the peritoneum, in the hinder half of the trunk. Each consists of a mass of
                    caecal tubules into the distal end of which a tuft of minute vessels projects,
                    thus forming what is called a glomerulus or Malpighian body.</p>
                <p>In the Οphidia the kidneys are least symmetrical, the right one extending the
                    farthest forwards. They are elongated and lobed, and sometimes in such a way as
                    to appear spirally twisted. Each terminates behind considerably in front of the
                    cloaca. The duct of each ureter begins at the anterior end of the kidney and
                    thence proceeds along its inner border, and accessory ducts open into it from
                    the interspaces of the lobes of the kidneys. The two ureters open into the sides
                    of the cloaca. In the males each opens upon a papilla in close proximity to the
                    opening of the male sexual duct or vas deferens. In the females the ureter opens
                    beside the mouth of the female sexual duct or oviduct. There is never any
                    urinary bladder.</p>
                <p>In Lacertilians the kidneys are more posteriorly placed than in Serpents. They
                    lie at the hindmost part of the body cavity above the cloaca, and they generally
                    much approximate together. They are also more symmetrically placed; only in the
                    Amphisbaenians the right kidney extends the more forward, thus resembling
                    Ophidians. There is always a urinary bladder, which is a ventral diverticulum of
                    the cloaca. The kidneys are usually transversely furrowed. The ureters run along
                    the inner side of the kidneys, and open into the sides of the cloaca, not into
                    the bladder.</p>
                <p>In Chelonians the kidneys lie near the cloaca in the cavity of the pelvis. They
                    are rather short and thick, and more or less trihedral. Their surface is marked
                    with many shallow meandering grooves and fewer deeper furrows. The ureters
                    proceed as usual along the inner sides of the kidneys, and several large canals
                    successively open from them into the ureters, which extend backwards, but to a
                    trifling extent, beyond the kidneys. They open rather anteriorly into the cloaca
                    close to the neck of the urinary bladder, which vessel is always present and
                    voluminous, and is often two-horned.</p>
                <p>The Crocodilia also have posteriorly situated pelvic kidneys, but they have no
                    urinary bladder. The kidney is concave dorsally and flatter ventrally. Its
                    surface has meandering convolutions separated by furrows. The ureters for the
                    greater part of their length run deeply sunk in the substance of the kidneys.
                    The ureters leave the hinder ends of the kidneys and run freely for a short
                    distance to the cloaca, which they enter close behind the rectum.</p>
                <p>The Wolffian Bodies.—These bodies lie one on each side on the dorsum of the body
                    cavity, and each consists of a series of caecal tubes with vascular balls or
                    glomeruli like those of the kidney, the various tubes always opening at first
                    into a common excretory duct which leads towards the cloaca. In adults they are
                    but small organs. In a Python 10 feet long they measure but about an inch. In
                    Serpents generally they are slender and lobed bodies which lie close to the
                    veins in front of the kidneys.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Generative Organs.—</hi> Reptiles, like all the higher
                    Vertebrates, have the sexes divided, with two sets of organs which respectively
                    characterize male and female individuals. In both sexes, as in Birds, there is a
                    pair of sexual glands, each furnished with a passage for the exit of its
                    product, together with, almost always, external organs destined to effect and
                    facilitate impregnation. Unlike Mammals, however, all Reptiles have the sexual
                    glands placed within the abdominal cavity, and, also unlike Mammals, the male
                    external organ or agent for copulation may be either azygous or bifold according
                    to the group to which any Reptile may belong. Unlike the more inferior
                    Vertebrates, however, Reptiles, with the solitary exception of <hi rend="italic"
                    > Hatteria,</hi> always possess such a copulating organ, and impregnation is
                    invariably effected internally.</p>
                <p>The male organs consist of a pair of glands, the testes, with their ducts, the
                    vasa deferentia, and the external organs, penis or penes. The female organs
                    consist of a pair of glands, the ovaries, with their ducts, the oviducts,
                    together with rudimentary representatives of the external sexual organs of the
                    males.</p>
                <p>The Testes and Vasa Deferentia.—These are two compact and rather small glands,
                    consisting of a mass of caecal convoluted tubes, lying in the dorsal region of
                    the abdominal cavity and completely invested by peritoneum, and with a dense
                    albugineal coat of their own. From the mass of tubules a certain variable number
                    of efferent tubes, vasa efferentia, come forth and soon unite in the single
                    excretory duct of the gland, the vas deferens.</p>
                <p>In the Ophidia the testes are not symmetrically placed, the right one being
                    somewhat more voluminous and also in front of the other. Consequently the right
                    vas deferens is larger than the left one. Each testis lies in front of the
                    kidney of its own side, and is more or less elongated in form. The vas deferens
                    proceeds along the inner margin of the testicle, and is a convoluted tube which
                    narrows as it proceeds backwards. The opening into the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0480-0463"/>cloaca is somewhat oblique, and is situated in a
                    somewhat funnel-shaped depression beside the opening of the ureter.</p>
                <p>In the Lacertilia the testes are spheroidal and almost symmetrically placed. The
                    vasa efferentia come forth from their inner side and pass into a canal lying in
                    a fold of peritoneum. This canal, the vas deferens, begins caecally much in
                    front of the union of the vasa efferentia with it, and this anterior portion
                    runs along the ventral side of the kidney in a fold of peritoneum and has the
                    appearance of a knot of tubuli or of a body transversely convoluted. The vas
                    deferens passes backwards in numerous close-set convolutions, and often dilates
                    towards its hinder end. It ultimately narrows, and opens on the cloaca, beside
                    the ureter, on a small papilla.</p>
                <p>The Chdonia have testes which lie somewhat external to the kidneys as well as
                    behind them. The vas deferens terminates upon a small papilla in the cloaca, but
                    its proximal end—anterior to the junction with it of the vasa efferentia—is
                    wide, and consists of a very complicated mass of tubes, and it may have (as in
                    Chelodina) five or six short caecal diverticula.</p>
                <p>The testes of the Crocodilia are of an elongated oval form, and lie partly in
                    front of and partly on the inner side of the kidneys. The testis may be divided
                    into two portions connected together dorsally. The vasa efferentia pass from the
                    outer border of the testis to a vas deferens, which has rather thick walls with
                    a marked dilatation towards its hinder end. It lies above the peritoneum, and
                    opens at its distal end into a groove at the base of the penis.</p>
                <p>The Ovaries and Oviducts.—The ovaries are, as in the class Mammals, the glands
                    which correspond with the testes, but which, unlike the latter, are not composed
                    of a mass of tubules, while each does not discharge its product into a tube
                    directly continuous with it (as does the testis into the vas deferens) but into
                    a tube, the oviduct, the distal end of which is open and discontinuous with the
                    ovary save for a broad fold of peritoneum which connects them. The ovaries
                    always lie in the dorsal part of the abdominal cavity enclosed in
                    peritoneum.</p>
                <p>In the Ophidia the ovaries are, like the testes, elongated and placed one in
                    advance of the other. The right ovary is more voluminous, and the right oviduct
                    is, of course, the longer one. The ova are so arranged within them as to form a
                    longitudinal series. The proximal end of each oviduct shows a transversely
                    expanded wide opening. The oviduct passes backwards in convolutions which are
                    often spirally arranged, and it is very extensible, being lined with numerous
                    close-set effaceable folds. The oviducts open into the cloaca by a crescentic
                    fissure behind the opening of the rectum.</p>
                <p>In the Lacertilia, except the Ampliisbaenians and probably some other
                    Serpentiform Lizards, the ovaries have not their contained ova serially
                    arranged. They may or may not be symmetrically disposed. The oviducts are
                    usually broad and spirally disposed. Unstriated muscular fibres often exist in
                    the folds of membrane which support their convolutions.</p>
                <p>The Chdonia have ovaries symmetrically placed, often of a broad and flattened
                    shape. The oviduct varies much in capacity in different parts of its course. The
                    ovaries of the Crocodilia are compact in structure and somewhat more advanced in
                    position than in most Reptiles. The oviduct is more uniform in diameter than in
                    the Chelonia.</p>
                <p>The External Generative Organs. —Λs has been already mentioned, all Reptiles have
                    such external organs with the exception of Hatteria. In the rest of the class we
                    always find such organs connected with the cloaca, and capable of being everted
                    for use or retracted and hidden within or behind that chamber. The whole class
                    is thus divisible into two groups according to the bifold or azygous condition
                    of these parts.</p>
                <p>In the Lacertilia and Ophidia they are bifold, and consist in the males of two
                    hollow, invertible, imperforate, cutaneous cones placed one on each side of the
                    cloaca, containing erectile tissue and capable of being protruded or retracted
                    by appropriate muscles. The lining of each cone is continuous both with the
                    external skin of the adjacent parts and also with the mucous lining of the
                    cloaca.</p>
                <p>A.tortuous groove which begins within the cloaca, at the aperture of the vas
                    deferens, is continued on to the apex of the cone. When erected for use the
                    lining membrane of the cones, with its grooves, becomes the external coat of
                    each copulatory organ. In the females there are rudimentary but quite similar
                    organs, just as in Mammals the clitoris of the female is present as the
                    rudimentary representative of the penis of the male. In the Ophidia these hollow
                    penes may or may not bifurcate distally, and if they bifurcate then the groove
                    bifurcates also. The lining membrane of the cone may be smooth, as in Python, or
                    spiny, as in Trigoηocephαlus and Crotalus, or may have transverse rows of soft
                    lamellae, as in Boa marina. The Lacertilia, like the Ophidia, may have each
                    penis single to its apex or bifurcating distally with various other minor
                    modifications as to relative size, the form of the apex, and the appendages
                    borne upon it. The cones are exceptionally short in the Chamaeleons.</p>
                <p>The male Chelonia and Crocodilia have an azygous penis, and a corresponding
                    rudimentary structure exists in the females. This organ lies at the ventral wall
                    of the cloaca; it is not hollow or evertible, but purely distensible and so
                    erectile. It is therefore its external coat which is continuous with the lining
                    of the cloaca. Muscles proceeding from beneath the hinder trunk vertebra are
                    inserted into it. The penis is imperforate, but two ridges are continued on to
                    it from the wall of the cloaca, and so form a groove, and during erection a
                    temporary canal, which passes along it from root to apex. At its distal end
                    there is a prominence which, though imperforate, may remind us of the “glans” of
                    the Mammalian penis. The whole body of the organ, including this distal
                    prominence, contains erectile tissue. In the Chelonia the penis may divide
                    distally, and if so the groove it bears divides also. In Chelodina it has an
                    undivided distal end and two lateral processes. In Trionyx it subdivides
                    distally into four terminal parts. The penis of the Crocodile has a deep groove
                    which reaches to the extreme end of the penis, a quasi-glans projecting freely
                    beneath it.</p>
                <p>A few Reptiles have secondary sexual characters—notably the Chamaeleons, the
                    males of which alone have the horns and other cephalic appendages,'which
                    characterize certain species. In most Reptiles, however, the two sexes have
                    hardly any distinctive external characters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Embryology.</hi></p>
                <p>Most of the <hi rend="italic">Rep)tiliα</hi> are oviparous, but certain of the
                    Lacertilians and many Ophidians, notably Vipers and Sea-Snakes, hatch their eggs
                    before they are laid; that is, they are ovoviviparous. The oviduct supplies the
                    ovum during its exit with an albuminous investment, the white of the egg, and
                    with a shell, or testa, which may be thin and flexible, as in the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Lacertilia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ophidia,</hi> or hard and
                    calcareous, as in the <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                    Chelonia,</hi> the eggs of which animals much resemble those of Birds.</p>
                <p>, The embryo Reptile closely resembles in its general features the embryo Bird,
                    and, as the process of development of the chick (which can be so conveniently
                    studied) is now comparatively thoroughly well known (see Reproduction), we
                    cannot here make more than a cursory mention of the leading structural changes.
                    Inasmuch as embryonic Reptiles thus resemble embryonic Birds, it of course
                    follows that they present all those features which embryonic Birds share with
                    Vertebrate animals generally, such as the segmentation of the yolk, the
                    resulting formation on its surface of the blastoderm, and its division into the
                    three germinal layers. As in Birds, the yolk segmentation is meroblastic.</p>
                <p>The blastoderm spreads rapidly over the yolk, but before it has half enclosed it
                    a pyriform patch, the embryonic shield, or area pellucida, appears at its
                    centre. The head of the embyro is formed at the broader encl of the pyriform
                    patch. Towards its hinder end a streak of the epiblast is formed, the primitive
                    groove, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Supposed to be
                    an indication of a form of invagination of the germinal layers characteristic of
                    lower forms. </p></note> and then in front of it another longitudinal
                    indentation, the “medullary groove,” the walls of which are the “medullary
                    plates”; and it is this groove and plates with the parts immediately subjacent
                    which lay the foundation of the developing body. The lining of the medullary
                    groove becomes the cerebrospinal axis, while a longitudinal cellular rod which
                    is formed beneath it, and which is called the notochord, lays the foundation of
                    the future axial skeleton as far forward as the hinder margin of the cranial
                    support of the pituitary body of the brain. The anterior end of the medullary

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0481-0464"/>groove shows serial enlargements corresponding
                    with the successive portions of the adult brain, while the medullary plates
                    close over the medullary groove and convert it into a canal which ultimately
                    persists as the central canal of the spinal cord and the ventricles into which
                    that canal opens anteriorly. The eyes arise as outgrowths from the brain aided
                    and modified by ingrowths from the surface of the embryo. The ears and nasal
                    organs arise mainly from superficial ingrowths. From the tissue on either side
                    of the notochord and medullary groove are gradually formed the axial skeleton of
                    the trunk and the muscles and other structures adjacent to it. The sides of the
                    medullary plates bend down on either side and form the ventral laminae which
                    split longitudinally, or they descend—the inner layer joining with its fellow of
                    the opposite side to form the alimentary tube. The two outer layers form the
                    lateral walls of the trunk, the space between the two inner and the two outer
                    layers constituting the first condition of what is subsequently the first
                    peritoneal cavity.</p>
                <p>The limbs first appear as outgrowths from the external layers of the ventral
                    laminae, but no rudiment of the limbs seems ever to be developed in the apodal
                    Ophidians. On each side of that region which subsequently becomes the head and
                    neck a series of perforations successively appear, and for the most part
                    disappear, known as the visceral clefts, while their intervals are known as the
                    visceral arches. The only visceral cleft which ever persists in the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Reptilia</hi> is that which becomes the passage from the inner
                    end of the Eustachian tube to the outer surface of the tympanic cavity. The
                    foundations of the skull are laid in a cartilaginous investment of the anterior
                    end of the notochord and of the incipient membranous labyrinth, whence two
                    columnar prolongations, the tra-beculae, pass forwards on either side of the
                    support of the pituitary body. We have seen the persistent nature of these
                    trabeculae in the cranium of Ophidians. The central part of the facial region of
                    the skull is formed by a cartilaginous ethmoidal process at the anterior end of
                    the trabeculae. Hence and from the side of the auditory cartilage cartilaginous
                    processes go forth which lay the foundation of the jaws, palatine structures,
                    and hyoid apparatus. The circulating system in its earliest condition is very
                    different from that which ultimately exists. At first the heart is not a tubular
                    structure, but it gradually folds and subdivides itself. The arteries proceeding
                    from it (and the veins converging to it) at first follow the general course of
                    the arteries (and veins) of Fishes and aquatic breathing Amphibians. The
                    arteries ascend within the visceral arches to meet in a dorsal aorta, as they
                    must needs do in the animals just mentioned, seeing that in them it is the
                    visceral arches which become the gill-bearing structures wherein alone the blood
                    is aerated.</p>
                <p>The urinary organs are at first represented by Wolffian bodies only, which are
                    formed from beneath the dorsal region of the body cavity, but subsequently, as
                    has been mentioned, they become replaced by the two kidneys. The sexual glands
                    themselves arise in connexion with the Wolffian bodies.</p>
                <p>At a very early stage of development the embryo as it were sinks into the surface
                    of the ovum, while a membrane arises on all sides of it meeting dorsally over
                    it, constituting the embryonic envelope known as the amnion. From the hind part
                    of the abdominal region of the embryo there also grows forth a vesicle which,
                    becoming greatly enlarged and richly supplied with blood-vessels, spreads itself
                    out on all sides just within the egg shell, and serves as the organ of
                    respiration for the embryo. This directly respiratory structure is the
                    allantois. The ventral surface of the embryo remains long open and connected
                    with the ever-diminishing remains of the food yolk. As this ventral surface
                    closes in, the remains of the yolk or vitellus become connected with the
                    alimentary canal, but by a very narrow tube called the vitelline duct. Before
                    the process of development is complete, however, the last remains of the yolk
                    become absorbed and taken up, and the abdominal wall is finally closed.</p>
                <p>Space does not here allow of more than this brief indication of some of the
                    leading facts of bodily development. We cannot attempt to describe the complex
                    processes of ossification by which the first foundations of the skeleton, and
                    especially of the skull, become differentiated into its manifold component
                    bones. For an account of this process, and of all the other details of embryonic
                    development, the reader is referred to the valuable treatises to be found

                <p>The first appearance of Reptiles on the surface of the globe is indicated by very
                    fragmentary remains. Specimens of deeply biconcave vertebrae of Carboniferous
                    age from Nova Scotia are believed to be those of a marine Saurian <hi
                    rend="italic">(Eosaums acadianus);</hi> if this view is correct, this oldest of
                    Reptiles would bear the stamp of one of the most Fish-like of the class.</p>
                <p>Formations of Permian age in North America as well as in Europe contain fossils
                    with undoubtedly Reptilian characters; they are still associated with true
                    Labyrintho-donts, and with remains which are too fragmentary to be assigned with
                    certainty either to Labyrinthodonts or Reptiles. The vertebrae of all are
                    amphicoelous. These Reptiles are Rhynchocephalians,—the oldest and best
                    preserved being <hi rend="italic">Proterosaumιs</hi> from the Copper-Slate of
                    Thuringia, a Reptile about six feet in length, with a comparatively long neck
                    (which, however, was composed of seven or nine vertebrae only), with numerous
                    abdominal splints, a long tail, and well developed and differentiated limbs.</p>
                <p>In the Mesozoic times the Reptilian type appears in such variety and in such a
                    high state of development that this era has been distinguished as the “Reptilian
                    age.” Yet we know chiefly such forms only as possessed bones of a size and
                    solidity sufficient to ensure their preservation. Of small Reptiles, animals
                    under or scarcely exceeding two feet in length, comparatively few have been
                    discovered, although they too must have existed in abundance. In the Trias there
                    appear first of the marine Saurians large Sauropterygians with narrow
                    ossifications between the vacuities of the skull, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simosaurus, Hothοsaurus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pistosaurus</hi> from the
                    German Muschelkalk. The highly interesting genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heusticosaurus,</hi> the smallest of the group, with the four limbs modified
                    into paddles, but with the hind limbs retaining the structure of those of a
                    terrestrial animal, seems to afford evidence of this order having been developed
                    from a terrestrial type. Fragments of true <hi rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> begin to appear in the Rhaetic bone
                    beds of England. Also the Placodonts, the systematic affinities of which are not
                    yet satisfactorily understood, are contemporaries of these early
                    Enalio-saurians. The precursors of our Crocodiles were two genera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Belοdon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Steganolepis,</hi> with dorsal
                    scutes, but with amphicoelian vertebrae and anterior choanae, neither palatines
                    nor pterygoids being dilated into the osseous palate which is characteristic of
                    later Crocodiles. Another order, the <hi rend="italic">Anomοdontia,</hi>
                    flourished and died in this epoch; some fifteen genera have been distinguished,
                    all from the South-African Trias; however, this type is probably also
                    represented in Russian formations of the same age. Rhynchocephalians continue in
                    several genera in European and American strata. But the largest of
                    terrestrial</p>
                <p>Reptiles belonged to the Dinosaurs, whose presence in numerous species belonging
                    to distinct groups, some with three, others with five toes to the hind feet, is
                    testified by their osseous remains as well as by the tracks of their hind feet,
                    which they left during their bipedal progression over stiff mud. These Triassic
                    Dinosaurs were chiefly herbivorous, and already much more numerous in North
                    America than in Europe <hi rend="italic">^Zanclodon).</hi></p>
                <p>This Reptilian fauna continued to flourish in the Jurassic period; the types of
                    the Trias increased in variety; still more gigantic forms were developed; and
                    new orders which were absent in the preceding period were added. Of the marine
                    Saurians alone some fifty species are known from European formations: the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Ichthyosauri</hi> inhabited chiefly the northern seas of the
                    eastern hemisphere, and were replaced in the western by Reptiles of similar
                    structure and size, but without teeth <hi rend="italic">{Sauranodon)</hi>; the
                    Sauropterygians have considerably advanced beyond their Triassic precursors in
                    having more solidly ossified skulls, and are also represented by a greater
                    number of genera in America as well as Europe; of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plesiosaurus</hi> alone some twelve species are known from the Lias and seven
                    from the Oolite. Ptérodactyles make their first appearance. Crocodilians have
                    developed into the “Mesosuchian” type, their palatine bones being prolonged,
                    pushing the choanae backwards to the middle of the under surface of their skull,
                    but their vertebrae are still amphicoelian; they appear in numerous genera <hi
                    rend="italic">CPeleosaumιs)</hi> and species. Terrestrial Reptiles keep pace in
                    development with the marine and freshwater types; the giants of the order of
                    Dinosaurs have left their remains in a more or less perfect condition in the
                    Jurassic strata of both hemispheres <hi rend="italic">(Cetiοsaurus,
                    Atlantosaurus, Iguanodon, Morosaurus, Apatosaurus)</hi>; forms with three toes
                    on the hind feet lived simultaneously with four-or five-toed ones; carnivorous
                    types <hi rend="italic">(Megalosawnts, Creosaurus,</hi> Ac.) represent in habit
                    as well as relative size Mammalian <hi rend="italic"> Carnivora;</hi> they
                    preyed upon the gigantic but weaker members of the order. The Dinosaurian type
                    extended also into the southern hemisphere, as is testified by the
                    West-Australian genus <hi rend="italic">Deuterosaurus.</hi> The Chelonians,
                    which appear first in the Upper Keuper, are in the Lias of highly advanced
                    types, and not essentially different from recent families; they occur in many
                    localities of Europe as Freshwater Turtles, chiefly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chelydidae</hi>; but <hi rend="italic">Emydidae</hi> are also represented,
                    showing, however, a less solid ossification of the carapace than the recent
                    forms. No distinct evidence of the presence of Marine Turtles and <hi
                    rend="italic">Trwηyx</hi> has been found hitherto in Jurassic formations.</p>
                <p>This abundance of Reptilian life not only continues in the Cretaceous period, but
                    is still more increased in variety and reaches its highest point of culmination.
                    Ich-thyopterygians and Sauropterygians reached an enormous size; <hi
                    rend="italic">Discosaurus,</hi> with a neck 22 feet long and composed of sixty
                    vertebrae, must have been the most formidable enemy to the Fishes of the sea.
                    Moreover these large Saurians which survived from the preceding period were now
                    joined by a new type of marine monsters with a Snake-like body and very short
                    extremities, the Mosa-saurians, which attained to a length of from 10 to 80 feet
                    and veritably filled the place of Sea-Serpents. Although their skull exhibits
                    not a few Ophidian characters, their genetic relation to that order is not by
                    any means proved. They were most numerous in the western hemisphere, some forty
                    American species referable to many genera having been described by
                    North-American authors; in Europe they are comparatively scarce. On the other
                    hand no less than fifteen species of Ptérodactyles are known from European
                    formations, all armed with formidable teeth, whilst the gigantic Ptérodactyles
                    of North America are, with one exception, toothless. Together with the sur<pb

                    period Gavial-like forms existed, and genera with posterior choanae and
                    procoelous vertebrae (Eusuchians),—among them a true Crocodile from the
                    Cambridge Upper Greensand. The western hemisphere exceeded the eastern as
                    regards the abundance of Dinosaurians in this period still more than in the
                    preceding, although it should be remembered that of the latter part of the globe
                    in fact only a small portion has been opened up, and that the little we know of
                    the geology of Central Asia and western China points to the probability of vast
                    palaeontological treasures being reserved for the study of future generations.
                    Rhynchoce-phalian genera continue in considerable variety, whilst other
                    small-sized forms are referred to the Lacertilians. The types of Freshwater
                    Turtles which lived in the Jurassic period pass into the Cretaceous. They appear
                    now also in North-American strata: <hi rend="italic">Chelydifilae</hi> first,
                    accompanied or immediately followed by <hi rend="italic"> Ernydidx,</hi> a few

                    life is swept away, and not only every species but almost every Mesozoic genus
                    disappears, a wide gap being left in our knowledge of the succession of
                    Reptilian life between this period and the Tertiary era.</p>
                <p>In the lowermost strata of Tertiary age a few isolated remains remind us still of
                    the extinct Mesozoic fauna; such are one or two genera allied to the
                    Dinosaurians <hi rend="italic">(Agathαu-rnas)</hi> from the Laramie beds of
                    North America. In other respects the Tertiary Reptiles bear already the
                    character of the present fauna; although families or genera which are distinct
                    from the living predominate in the Eocene, from the Miocene Reptiles gradually
                    approach more and more the specific forms of our time. True Crocodiles (of which
                    one species occurred already in the Cretaceous period), Gavials, Alligators have
                    now entirely superseded the “Mesosuchian” type. The remains of Lacertilians are
                    fragmentary and generally indistinct, so as to offer a wide field for generic
                    distinctions. <hi rend="italic">Anguidae</hi> have been distinctly traced back
                    to the Miocene of North America. With a single exception, that of a poisonous

                    been found in Miocene deposits at Sansan (south of France), Snakes do not appear
                    before the Eocene, in England as well as North America; they are mostly large
                    species, with uncertain affinities, but all innocuous <hi rend="italic">

                    even those of the later Tertiary formations show a greater resemblance to genera
                    which are now-a-days locally far removed than to those living in the same
                    geographical district. Chelonian remains are numerous throughout, probably on
                    account of the resistance which their solid carapaces offered to destructive
                    agencies. <hi rend="italic">Chelydidae, Emydddae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trwnycidae</hi> and also Marine Turtles continue to exist in an almost
                    uninterrupted series, and approach so much the modern genera that, for instance,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Trwnyχ,</hi> if specific distinctions existed between
                    Miocene and recent species, they cannot be determined in those parts of their
                    skeleton which have been preserved. A peculiar type intermediate between the
                    Marine Turtles and <hi rend="italic">Emys</hi> existed in the English Eocene <hi
                    rend="italic">(Chelone).</hi> Land Tortoises, the most specialized type of the
                    order, probably did not appear before the Miocene. A number of smaller forms are
                    referable to the genus <hi rend="italic">Testudo,</hi> but gigantic forms
                    existed then as now in isolated localities, and exceeded in size the living,
                    like the <hi rend="italic">Colossoehelys</hi> of the Siwalik Hills, with a
                    carapace computed to be 20 feet long, and the smaller <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macrochelys</hi> from the German Molasse. It is extremely singular that the
                    existence of these colossal Chelonians would seem to coincide with the period of
                    the first appearance of the type of Land Tortoises.</p>
                <p>Of the first appearance of most of the families of the recent fauna, and of their
                    distribution in the Quaternary period, <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> we know
                    next to nothing. With few exceptions the Reptilian type had dwindled to forms of
                    such small size that their remains, if preserved, escape observation or are too
                    indistinct for determination.</p>

                <p>Serious obstacles present themselves at the present time to a satisfactory
                    treatment of the geographical distribution of Reptiles. We have mentioned at the
                    end of the preceding section that the geological record is much too incomplete
                    to permit a comparison to be drawn between their distribution in the present and
                    next preceding periods, and that we are therefore ignorant as to the modes in
                    which their dispersal was brought about, and unable to account otherwise than
                    hypothetically for the numerous instances of apparently anomalous distribution.
                    And, when we limit ourselves merely to the task of describing the facts of their
                    distribution at the present day, it is necessary for such an attempt that the
                    whole class should have previously undergone a thorough rearrangement in
                    accordance with the present state of science, and that the scattered
                    contributions to the various faunae should have been critically examined and
                    treated by the same uniform method. This is unfortunately not the case with the
                    class of <hi rend="italic">Reptilia.</hi> The systems and lists of <hi
                    rend="italic"> Lαcertiliα</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ophidia</hi> which formed
                    the bases for the treatises on the geographical distribution of these orders by
                    Schlegel, Günther, and Wallace are buried under an accumulation of an immense
                    number of additions of very different value, which require a uniform critical
                    revision before they can be used in an inquiry of a general biological scope.

                <p>In the following notes we have been able to include the majority of the genera of
                    Chelonians and Ophidians, with an approximate estimate of the species of each
                    that are known at present. As regards the former Strauch <hi rend="superscript"
                    >3</hi> has done much to clear the way, although the small amount of materials
                    known to him from autopsy interfered much with his critical judgment. Not many
                    additions have been made to this order since the time of the publication of his
                    memoirs. Of the numerous Ophidian genera and species we have eliminated all
                    which are based on trivial distinctions, or are named by authors without special
                    acquaintance with the subject. We have not entered into a full consideration of
                    Lacertilian genera, as this would have been useless at a time when they are
                    undergoing a revision, but have restricted ourselves to the families recently
                    proposed by Boulenger.</p>
                <p>One of the most important results obtained by this inquiry is that the same
                    arrangement of the so-called primary zoological regions is not applicable to all
                    orders of Reptiles, and that the differences in their distribution are so
                    fundamental that they can be accounted for only on the assumption of the various
                    orders and families having appeared and spread over the globe at very distant
                    periods, when land and water were differently distributed over the surface of
                    the globe. At the end of this section we shall show in a short résumé the mutual
                    relations between the various regions with respect to the several orders of
                    Reptiles.</p>

                <p>They are much specialized in their mode of life and propagation, and ill adapted
                    to accommodate themselves to a change of external conditions. As air-breathing
                    coldblooded animals they are unable to withstand prolonged cold; they are
                    therefore entirely absent in the arctic and antarctic zones; and such as escape

                    condition in well-sheltered places are not peculiarly organized forms, but
                    offshoots from those inhabiting warmer climes. The tropical and subtropical
                    zones are the real home of the Reptilian type, which there has reached its
                    greatest development as regards size and variety of forms. In the north

                    forms which pass almost the whole of their life in the sea, and therefore belong
                    to the marine faunae, viz., the Marine Turtles and Sea-Snakes.</p>
                <p>1. The shores of the continents and islands of the equatorial zone are the home
                    of the Marine Turtles. Endowed with a wonderful power of locomotion, the several
                    species are now distributed over the greater part of this zone, occurring in the
                    Atlantic as well as the Indo-Pacifιc; and, although some of them are common in
                    certain districts and scarcer or even absent in others, it is probable that in
                    the course of time their distribution will be still more general and uniform, as
                    far as other conditions (such as access to a suitable locality for the
                    successful propagation of their kind) will permit. Frequently Marine Turtles
                    stray far into the temperate zones, and it thus happens that one and the same
                    species G3phargis coriαxeα) has been found on the south coast of England, near
                    Cape Cod in North America, and on the coast of Chili. In short the geographical
                    distribution of these Reptiles is that of pelagic animals generally, although by
                    their mode of propagation they are compelled to sojourn near land during a
                    certain period of the year.</p>
                <p>2. The Sea-Snakes are restricted to, and highly characteristic of, the fauna of
                    the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean, and more especially of parts between Arabia and
                    North Australia. They prefer the vicinity of laud, but never leave the water,
                    with, perhaps, the single exception of Platums. Their distribution is not
                    erratic; only one species, Pelamys bieolor, a Sea-Snake which more than any
                    other is organized for a marine life, has spread far beyond the original home of
                    its kindred, viz., westwards to the coasts of Madagascar and south-eastern
                    Africa, and eastwards to the furthermost limits of the region, viz., to the
                    coasts of central and northern South America.</p>

                    fact that Oreοcephalus enters the sea habitually and Cher-sydrus frequently does

                    greater part of their life on land, and never leave its close vicinity.

                    scanty representation of Testudo. One species which is common in the Indian
                    peninsula (2 ’ . stellata} is so similar to an African species as to have been
                    considered identical with it; the Burmese Tortoise is also closely allied to it,
                    and the two others extend far into western Central Asia. Thus this type is to be
                    considered rather an immigrant from its present headquarters, Africa, than a
                    survivor of the Indian Tertiary fauna, which comprised the most extraordinary
                    forms of Land Tortoises. Wallace’s line marks the eastern boundary of Trionyx;
                    species of this genus are common in Java and Borneo, and occur likewise in the
                    Philippine Islands, but are not found in Celebes, Amboyna, or any of the other
                    islands east of Wallace’s line. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The statement that specimens of Trionyx had been obtained by

                    informs us that none of the Freshwater Turtles in the Leyden Museum came fron'
                    islands east of Java and Borneo. </p></note></p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">Crocodilidae</hi> true Crocodiles are represented by four,
                    and Gavials by two species. Alligators are absent.</p>
                <p>Although the region is characterized by numerous highly specialized genera of <hi
                    rend="italic">Laceritilia,</hi> not one of the families is peculiar to it.</p>
                <p>Agamidae are exceedingly numerous, and are represented chiefly by arboreal forms;
                    terrestrial forms, like Aganιa and Urαmastix, inhabit the hot and sandy plains
                    in the north-west, and pass uninterruptedly into the fauna of western Central
                    Asia and Africa. The Geekonidae, Scincidae, and Varanûdae are likewise well
                    represented, but without giving a characteristic feature to the region by
                    special modification of the leading forms. The Laeeriidae are represented by one
                    characteristic genus, Tachydromus,—Ophiops and Cabrita being more developed
                    beyond the limits assigned to this region. Finally, the Eublepharidae and
                    Anguidae, families whose living representatives are probably the scattered
                    remains of once widely and more generally distributed types, have retained
                    respectively two species in western India, and one in Khassia (Khasi Hills),
                    whilst the presence of a single species of Chamaeleon in Southern India and
                    Ceylon reminds us again of the relations of this part of the fauna to that of
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>The Indian region excels all the other equatorial regions in the great variety of
                    generic types and number of species of Snakes. The latter amount to no less than
                    four hundred and fifty, which is nearly one-third of the total number of species
                    known. They are referable to about one hundred genera, of which the majority do
                    not range beyond the limits of the region. Of higher groups (termed families for
                    the sake of convenience), the <hi rend="italic">Xenopeltidae, Rhinophulae,
                    Oligodontidae, Xenodermidae, and Acrochordidae</hi> are peculiar to, and
                    characteristic of, this fauna,—but not more so than a number of genera which
                    will be mentioned presently.</p>
                <p>Of Typhlopidae more than twenty species are known.</p>
                <p>Of Tortrieidae, the genus Cylindrophis is spread over several of the
                    subregions.</p>
                <p>The Calamariidae are represented by a whole string of genera, of which thirteen
                    are peculiar to the region. The most characteristic and geographically most
                    important types are Calamaria, with twenty-four species, spread over the
                    archipelago and the eastern parts of the continent, and Aspidura and
                    Haplocercus, with four species, which are limited to Ceylon and southern
                    India.</p>
                <p>Species of those generalized forms which are termed CoronelliJae and Colubridae
                    are likewise numerous (sixty-six species), and referable to seventeen genera, of
                    which ten are limited to this region. In the north-western and northern parts
                    the genus Zamenis, which is one of the most characteristic types of the warmer
                    parts of the Europo-Asiatic fauna, is represented by six species.</p>
                <p>Freshwater Snakes are abundant in genera,-species, and individuals. Of
                    Tropidonοtus alone some forty very distinct species have been described, besides
                    three others which are sufficiently differentiated to deserve generic
                    separation. Of the so-called Homalopswlae all the genera, twelve in number, are
                    peculiar, and the great development of these Snakes is, therefore, one of the
                    most striking features of this region.</p>
                <p>Besides two species of Psammophis allied to African forms, a distinct genus
                    Psammodynastes has a wide range over the eastern parts of the continent and the
                    archipelago.</p>
                <p>Tree Snakes are represented by eight genera and twenty-six species, mostly
                    characteristic forms.</p>

                <p>DipsaAiilae are more numerous (eighteen species) than in the other equatorial
                    regions.</p>
                <p>Elachistod&lt;rn and Hologcrrhιιm may be mentioned as remarkable types not found
                    elsewhere, but with a very local distribution.</p>
                <p>The development of Lycodonts India has in common with Africa; but the genera, six
                    in number, are distinct.</p>
                <p>Also the presence of gigantic Snakes of the genus Python is a feature which India
                    shares with Africa.</p>
                <p>Of Erycidae three species are Indian, Gongylophis and Cursoria being peculiar to
                    the region.</p>
                <p>Poisonous Snakes are numerous, the proportion to innocuous Snakes being as 1 :10.
                    Out of forty-six species, only two belong to the family of true Vipers, and they
                    are restricted to the Indian peninsula with Ceylon, one {Echis} being even
                    specifically identical with the African species, and the other {Dabοia) having
                    its only congener in the Mediterranean district. The remainder of the poisonous
                    Snakes belong to the Elapidae and Crotalidae or Pit Vipers. The former are
                    represented by six genera, of which no less than five are highly characteristic
                    of the region, whilst the Cobras {Naja) are equally distributed over Africa. Of
                    Pit Vipers five genera have been distinguished, the most characteristic being an
                    arboreal form, Trimeresurus, with seventeen species. Also the other five genera
                    are peculiar to India, with the exception of the genus Halys which is
                    Central-Asiatic.</p>
                <p>The relations of the Indian region to the others will be considered as we proceed
                    with the accounts of those faunas. Japan, with regard to its Reptilian fauna as
                    a whole, must be referred to this region. This is clearly shown by the presence
                    of species of Ophites, Calloρhis, Trimeresurns, Tachydromus,—characteristically
                    Indian forms, with which species of Clemmys, Trionyx, Gecko, Halys, and some
                    Colubrines closely allied to Chinese or Central-Asiatic species are associated.
                    The few Reptiles inhabiting the northern part of Japan are probably Palaearctic
                    species.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The African Region.—</hi> Owing to its strictly continental
                    character and diminished variety of physical features, this region is inhabited
                    by a much smaller number of Reptiles than one might be led to expect from the
                    large extent of its geographical area. There are but few small outlying islands,
                    furnishing a small number of interesting additions to this fauna. Madagascar,
                    indeed, would supply a considerable contingent of distinct forms, but it is
                    questionable whether this large island should be united with the African region,
                    as we shall see hereafter.</p>
                <p>The African region is characterized by the development of three of the four
                    principal divisions of terrestrial Chelonians, viz., <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The majority of the genera are peculiar, viz., Chersine, Pyxis, Cinyxis,
                    Dumerilia, Sternothcnιs, Pelomedusa, and Cyeloderma; and no other region shows a
                    similar development of Land Tortoises. This last type has not only diverged into
                    four genera, but is also represented by several of those gigantic forms which
                    survived into geologically recent times. In the African region they inhabited
                    only the neighbouring oceanic islands, viz., the Aldabra group, Mauritius, and
                    Rodriguez; out of the eight species, which have been recognized chiefly from
                    their osseous remains, one only survives at the present day. Also in Madagascar
                    fossil remains of gigantic species, which must have been contemporaries of
                    Aepyornis, have been discovered by Grandidier; but on the continent no trace of
                    these large creatures has been found hitherto. The Chelonians of the eastern and
                    western halves of the continent do not essentially differ from each other, but
                    Trionyx does not extend southwards beyond the tropic.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">Croeodilidae, Crocodilus</hi> is represented by three or
                    four species. Alligators are absent.</p>
                <p>Of the families of Lizards inhabiting Africa the majority occur in the southern
                    portion. <hi rend="italic">Λgamidχ</hi> are numerous, and represented chiefly by
                    terrestrial forms. The <hi rend="italic">Gecko-nidae, Scincidae,
                    Laeertidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Varanidae</hi> are likewise well
                    represented; <hi rend="italic">Eublepharidae</hi> by a single genus and species
                    in West Africa. The presence of several genera of <hi rend="italic">
                    Amphisbaenidae,</hi> some of which are even identical with South-American, is
                    highly suggestive. <hi rend="italic">Gerrhosaumdae, Zonuridae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Anelytropidae</hi> are peculiar to tropical Africa; but the most
                    important feature of this Lacertilian fauna is the almost universal distribution
                    of Chamaeleons in numerous and highly specialized species.</p>
                <p>Leaving aside, for the present, the island of Madagascar, we estimate that the
                    number of species of African Snakes does not exceed two hundred, which are
                    referable to about seventy genera, of which no less than fifty do not range
                    beyond the limits of the region. On the whole the east coast genera are
                    different from those of the west coast, but in the southern parts no such
                    differentiation can be shown. Very little is known as regards the range of the
                    species and genera towards the central districts. As regards higher groups only
                    two families, the <hi rend="italic">Dasypeltidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dinophidae,</hi> are peculiar to Africa; and, although they have a wide range
                    over the region, they consist of very few species only. Other families show a
                    greater variety of genera and species here than in any other part of the globe.
                    The almost entire absence of the genus <hi rend="italic">Tropi-(lonotus</hi> and
                    the scanty representation of Colubers are very noticeable features. Poisonous
                    Snakes are numerous, all the various families being well represented, with the
                    exception of the Pit Vipers; singularly enough innocuous Colubrine Snakes with
                    facial pits occur <hi rend="italic">{Bothrophthalmus, Bothrolycus).</hi></p>
                <p>Of Typhlopidae nearly forty species have been described, and, besides, the
                    Stenostomatidae are represented by seven species.</p>
                <p>Eight out of ten Calamaroid genera are peculiar to this fauna, and remarkable is
                    the frequency with which among them the sub-caudal shields coalesce into a
                    single series.</p>
                <p>The Caronellidae are represented by some twenty species, but no true Coluber
                    occurs, the four species which approach this type most closely belonging to
                    distinct genera {Seaphiophis, Xenurophis, Herpetaethiops).</p>
                <p>Almost entire absence of Tropidonotics is a characteristic feature of this fauna.
                    Also of other Freshwater Snakes only six genera with seven species are
                    known.</p>
                <p>The small family of Psammophidae is well represented by three genera and nine
                    species, of which six belong to Psammophis.</p>
                <p>Of Tree-Snakes there are six genera, of which Ahaetulla (Philo-thamnus) is most
                    generally distributed, in twelve species.</p>
                <p>Of Dipsadidae there are five genera and ten species, four of which belong to
                    Diρsas proper.</p>
                <p>The Lycodonts are as well developed as in India, by seven genera and fourteen
                    species; all the genera are peculiar to Africa, and some of them are modified
                    for an arboreal mode of life.</p>
                <p>Of Pythons three species are distinguishable; but, besides, a member of the Booid
                    family (Pelophilus fordii) occurs on the west coast.</p>
                <p>Two species of Eryx occur.</p>
                <p>Poisonous Snakes are extremely numerous, the proportion to innocuous Snakes being
                    as 1: 5. Of Elapidae four genera occur, among which Naja figures with at least
                    two species; besides this family the Dinophidae are a remarkable and
                    characteristic type, having assumed entirely the appearance and mode of life of
                    Tree Snakes. The Atraetaspididae, with three genera and thirteen species, are
                    likewise almost entirely African, only one other type CDinodipsas) having been
                    recently discovered in Venezuela. Pit Vipers are absent, but the largest forms
                    of Viperidae are developed in this region, this family being represented by four
                    genera and twelve species. The singular genus Atheris is a real Tree Viper with
                    prehensile tail.</p>
                <p>The Reptilian fauna of Madagascar is a most remarkable mixture of types belonging
                    to different regions, which cannot be accounted for in the present state of our
                    knowledge of the geological changes that have taken place whilst the present
                    fauna was already in existence.</p>

                    Chelonians of Madagascar require a thorough critical examination; some of the

                    evidently introduced from the African continent. Others, as also certain species
                    of Snakes, are certainly not natives of Madagascar. </p></note> offer a marked

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0486-0469"/>Africa: no Trionyx occurs in Madagascar. On the
                    other hand species are found of Testudo, Chersine, Sternotherus, and Pelοmedusa,
                    which are spread also over a greater or lesser area of the continent. Two
                    Chelonians, Pyxis and Dumeriliα, are peculiar to Madagascar, the latter nearly
                    allied to the South-American Peltoccphalus. The Madagascar Crocodile is closely
                    allied to the common African species.; and its presence in the island can be
                    easily accounted for.</p>
                <p>Among the Lizards we find a distinctly South-American element in two Iguanoid
                    genera, Hοplurus and Chalarodon, replacing the Old World Agamidae. The absence
                    of Varanidae, Laeertidae, and Amphisbaenidae removes Madagascar from Africa,
                    whilst the extraordinary development of Chamaeleonidae (more than twenty
                    species) and the presence of Gerrhosauridae and Zouuridae are important features
                    common to both. Avery small family (Uroplatidae} is peculiar to Madagascar. No
                    special relation to the Indian region is shown by this Lacertilian fauna.</p>
                <p>With regard to Ophidians, Madagascar has hardly anything in common with Africa.
                    The African fauna is characterized by the great development of Lycodonts,—they
                    are absent in Madagascar; and of the four families of African poisonous Snakes
                    Madagascar does not possess a single one. When we analyse the affinities of the
                    twenty-seven species known at present from Madagascar, we arrive at the
                    following conclusions :—</p>
                <p>1. Snakes without distinct relations to any particular region :— Tyρhlops (six
                    species), Ablabes (one species), Ithyeyphus (one species), Dipsadoboa (one
                    species).</p>
                <p>2. Snakes with affinities to the African fauna :—Mimophis (one species),
                    Pedophilus (one species).</p>
                <p>3. Snakes with affinities to the Indian fauna :—Ptyas (one species), Langaha (one
                    species).</p>
                <p>4. Snakes with affinities to the South-American fauna :—Liophis (one species),
                    Taehymenis (one species), Pseiidoxyrhopus (two species), Heterodon (two
                    species), Dromieus (one species), Herpeto-dryas (one species), Philodryas (one
                    species), Dipsas (two species), Xiphosoma (one species).</p>
                <p>Africa shows affinities to all the three other equatorial regions, but chiefly to
                    the Indian. No sharply defined boundary exists between the two regions, the
                    intervening parts of Asia being inhabited by a desert fauna which penetrates
                    into districts of similar nature in Africa as well as in India. Certain genera
                    and species belonging to this desert fauna are therefore common to both regions.
                    But there are, besides, other points of affinity of deeper significance, such as
                    the development in both of a distinct Trionycoid genus, besides the typical <hi

                    counterbalanced by great differences in other portions of the Reptilian fauna:
                    the Indian Emydoids are replaced by <hi rend="italic"> Chelydidae</hi> in
                    Africa, a type which it has in common with Australia and South America, whereas

                    mentioned above. </p></note> With regard to Ophidians, the number of forms
                    generally is greatly diminished in Africa, but the proportion of poisonous
                    Snakes is doubled. The Pit Vipers of India are wholly absent, and are replaced
                    by true Vipers. In the Indian region arboreal Agamoid Lizards prevail; in Africa
                    the Snakes show a greater tendency towards a modification of the habitus and
                    structure for arboreal life. The Freshwater Snakes and Colubers which are so
                    numerous in India are much reduced in numbers in Africa, <hi rend="italic"

                    hne. In fact, the Chelonian type disappears in the islands between this line and
                    the Australian continent— with two exceptions. A species of <hi rend="italic">
                    Testudo (T. forstenii)</hi> occurs in, and is limited to, the island of Gilolo;
                    and <hi rend="italic">Cuora amboinensis,</hi> the most common Tortoise of
                    Malaya, occurs in many of the eastern islands, but it has probably been imported
                    by man, and by the same means may be still extending its range. On the continent
                    of Australia <hi rend="italic">Chelydidae</hi> only occur, viz., eight species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Chelemys</hi> and five of <hi rend="italic">Chelodina.</hi>
                    In Tasmania, again, Chelonians are absent.</p>
                <p>Besides the common Indian <hi rend="italic">Crοcodilus porosus,</hi> which may be
                    considered an immigrant into this region, one or two other species of the same
                    genus inhabit the fresh waters of the truly tropical parts, and are peculiar to
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the Lacertilian fauna is composed of Skinks, Geckos, Agamoids, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Varanidae,</hi> with the addition of a small family which is
                    peculiar to the region, the <hi rend="italic">Pygo∙ podidae.</hi> A peculiar
                    type, <hi rend="italic">Hibamus,</hi> has been found in New Guinea; and,
                    finally, a single Iguanoid, <hi rend="italic">Brachylophus,</hi> is common in
                    the Fiji Islands; how it came there, or how it survived its severance from the
                    American stock, is a mystery. The Skinks are in this region more highly
                    developed and more specialized than in any other part of the world; they exceed
                    in numbers the Geckos, which generally accompany the Skinks in their range over
                    the smaller islands of the Pacific; in these islands members of these two
                    families represent the whole of the Lacertilian fauna. The Australian Agamoids
                    are chiefly peculiar and partly much differentiated forms, but some have
                    distinct affinities to, or are even identical with, Indian genera. The <hi
                    rend="italic"> Varanidae</hi> are also closely allied to Indian species.</p>
                <p>The total number of Snakes amount to ninety species, of which twelve are <hi

                    number of poisonous Snakes, therefore, exceeds that of innocuous, a proportion
                    quite unparalleled in any other part of the world. The few innocuous Colubrine
                    Snakes belong to Indian genera, and evidently have spread from that region; but
                    all the genera of <hi rend="italic">Elapidae</hi> (twelve), <hi rend="italic">
                    Erycidae</hi> (one), <hi rend="italic">Pythonidae</hi> (five), and <hi

                <p>In Australia we meet, therefore, with the interesting fact that, whilst it is
                    closely allied to South America, but totally distinct from India, by its
                    Chelonians, its Lizards and Colubrine Snakes connect it with this latter region.
                    With regard to the other Ophidians, they, although peculiar genera, have their
                    nearest allies partly in India partly in South America; and the character of the
                    Australian Snake fauna consists chiefly in its peculiar composition, differing
                    thereby more from the other equatorial regions than these do among themselves.
                    Wallace’s line marks the boundary between India and Australia only as far as
                    Chelonians are concerned, but it is quite effaced by the distribution of Lizards
                    and Snakes. Thus in New Guinea Lizards of the Indian region are mixed with <hi
                    rend="italic"> Pygopodidae,</hi> and an island as far east as Timorlaut is
                    inhabited by six Snakes, three of which are peculiarly Indian, whilst the other
                    three are as decidedly Australian. The islands north of New Guinea and of
                    Melanesia are not yet occupied by the Ophidian type, and only species of <hi
                    rend="italic"> Enygrus</hi> have penetrated eastwards as far as the Low
                    Archipelago, whilst the Fiji Islands and the larger islands of Melanesia have
                    sufficiently long been raised above the level of the sea to develop quite
                    peculiar genera of Snakes. Tasmania is tenanted by poisonous Snakes only.</p>

                <p>The Chelydidae thus predominate to the exclusion of the Emydidae. They belong to
                    five distinct genera, of which one, Chxlys, is the most specialized of the
                    family. They do not extend to the western side of the Andes, and cease in the
                    south with the system of the Plate River. Northwards they penetrate to Trinidad,
                    but become scarcer in the degree in which their place is occupied by the
                    Emydidae, which have spread from Central America over the northern parts of this
                    region. One, Emys d ’ orbignii, following the course of the Uruguay, has
                    penetrated southwards to the mouth of the Plate River.</p>
                <p>Land Tortoises (Testudd) are at the present day almost extinct in this region,
                    two species only (Τestudo tabulata or earbonaria and T. argentina) being found
                    on the continent of South America. The six other species belong to the Oceanic

                    group.</p>
                <p>Trionyx is entirely absent.</p>
                <p>The Crocodilian order is more developed in this region than in any other. Besides

                    farther southwards, throughout the system of the Plate River, whilst in North
                    America this genus is represented by a distinct species, <hi rend="italic"> A.

                <p>The Lacertilian fauna connects Central with South America,—all the six families
                    found in the latter area, viz., <hi rend="italic">Geckonidae, Anguidae,
                    Ampldsbaenidae, Tejifilae, Igua-nidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seincidae,</hi> being represented in Central America. But Central America
                    possesses, besides, five other families, small in species and restricted in
                    range (some belonging to the fauna of great elevations), but highly interesting
                    types. These are the <hi rend="italic">Eublepharidae, Xenosauridae, Aniel-lidae,
                    Helodermatidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lepidophymatidae.</hi> Their
                    localization and differentiation can be accounted for on the hypothesis that
                    they are the remains of the fauna of the various islands into which Central
                    America was broken up at a former period.</p>
                <p>By far the larger number of Lizards of the Tropical American region are
                    Iguawidae, a family which in the New World repeats the Old-World Agamidae. They
                    are spread over the whole of the region, having adapted themselves in their mode
                    of life and structure to every variety of ground. One species (Liolaemus
                    magellanicus) ranges to the Straits of Magellan. The largest Iguanoids inhabit
                    the Galapagos Islands, where they live on the rocks of the shore, one species
                    (Oreocephαlus cristatus) entering seawater and feeding on sea-weeds. The next
                    numerous family is the Tejidae, the New-World representatives of the Old-World
                    Laxertidae·, Ceekonidae, Seincidae, Amphisbaeuidae, and Anguidae are less
                    numerous, but have also a wide range over the region. The Lacertilian fauna of
                    the West Indies is wholly South-American; it does not comprise any peculiar
                    family, and only a few characteristic genera, of which Anolis is, perhaps, the
                    most highly specialized and the one which is composed of the greatest number of
                    species; this genus, however, is also well represented on the continent,
                    especially in Central America.</p>
                <p>With regard to Ophidians the Tropical American region approaches the Indian in
                    the number of species, which amounts to about four hundred, but it exhibits a
                    comparatively less variety of generic and peculiar forms; of the eighty genera
                    only about fifty do not range beyond its limits. However, a boundary line which
                    would separate the Ophidian fauna of South America from that of the north does
                    not exist. In Central America and</p>
                <p>Mexico the generic types of the south and north are intermingled, and as the
                    climate, in accordance with latitude and altitude, assumes a more temperate
                    character the specifically tropical Snakes disappear and are in part replaced by
                    those of North America. This mixture of the two faunae and the great variety of
                    physical conditions within a small area account for the relatively very large
                    number of Snakes of Central America. About one hundred and fifty out of the four
                    hundred species attributed to the whole region belong to this district. The
                    West-Indian Ophidians belong to the Tropical American fauna; many continental
                    generic forms of the latter occur in the islands, and such genera as are
                    peculiar to the West Indies do not exhibit a common feature, or are founded on
                    slight characters. The exact limits to which Snakes extend southwards are not
                    known; they seem to be very scarce on the southern confines of the Argentine
                    Republic. Quite recently a Crotaline Snake, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhinocerophis,</hi> has been discovered in eastern Patagonia. <note

                <p>Of families peculiar to or highly characteristic of this fauna we can mention one
                    only, viz., the small family <hi rend="italic">Scytalidae,</hi> which replaces

                    genera eight are Tropical American, and three Australian. The true Boas include
                    the most gigantic of Snakes, and replace the Old-World Pythons.</p>
                <p>In this fauna a peculiar and highly ornamental pattern of coloration, which
                    consists of more or less regularly alternate rings of black, red, and yellow,
                    seems to be the more worthy of notice, as it occurs in very distinct families,
                    viz., the <hi rend="italic">C alamarüdae, Coronellidae, Natrwidae,

                <p>Of Typhlopidae more than twenty species have been described, and, besides, the

                <p>Of Tortricidae one species occurs.</p>
                <p>The Calamariidae are represented by thirteen genera, of which ten are peculiar.
                    The most characteristic and geographically important are Elapomorρhus with ten,
                    Hamalocranium with sixteen, Ninia with four species. The Indian genus Geoph⅛ is
                    represented in Tropical America by twenty-five species.</p>
                <p>Coronellidae are extremely numerous (sixty-six species referable to thirteen
                    genera). Of these Xenodon with twelve species, Liο-phis with sixteen,
                    Erythrοlαmρrus, and Pliocereτιs deserve special mention.</p>
                <p>Of Colubers forms with elongate compressed body, approaching arboreal forms
                    (Sqiilotes), are not scarce.</p>
                <p>Freshwater Snakes are not abundant, but a genus peculiar to the region, Helieops,
                    occurs in eight species. Tropidonotus might be regarded as absent, but for three
                    or four species which occur north of the Isthmus of Panama and in the West
                    Indies; also the allied genus Tretaηοrhinus is confined to Central America and
                    the West Indies.</p>
                <p>Tree Snakes are extremely abundant—some seventy species referable to six genera,
                    of which Dromicus, Philodryas, and Herpetodryas are very characteristic forms.
                    Of Ahaetulla some seventeen species are knoλvn.</p>
                <p>Of Dipsas and allied genera only four species occur, but of tlιe peculiarly
                    South-American Leptognathidae some twenty-five species have been
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>In Central America there occur two extremely singular forms which, however, are
                    imperfectly known and seem tobe restricted to a very limited area. One,
                    Loxoeemus, is considered a representative of the family Pythonidae, and the
                    other, Nοtοpsis, is stated to be the type of a distinct family allied to the
                    Indian Xtmodermidae.</p>
                <p>Of the twenty species of Boidae the West Indian contingent amounts to no less
                    than eight or nine, a fact which clearly demonstrates the pertinence of the West
                    Indies to this region.</p>
                <p>Erycidae are absent.</p>
                <p>Poisonous Snakes are numerous, the proportion to innocuous Snakes being as 1: 8.
                    Besides the singular occurrence in Venezuela of a member of the Atraetaspididae,
                    Dinodipsas, the Colubriform poisonous Snakes are represented by one genus only,
                    Elaρs, which, however, shows numerous varieties or species, and is extremely
                    common and widely spread over the region. Viperidae are absent; but the largest

                    not peculiar to Tropical America, are at least confined to the New World, like
                    Cenchris and Crotakus.</p>
                <p>The Reptilian fauna of tropical America thus shows relations to the other
                    equatorial regions in three of its constituent parts only, viz., in the <hi

                    >Crotalidae.</hi> It has the former type in common with Africa and Australia;
                    but, whilst the presence of <hi rend="italic">Trionyx</hi> on the African
                    continent forms an important distinctive feature, the resemblance of South
                    America to Madagascar is as great as, or even greater than, that to Australia,
                    which lacks <hi rend="italic">Testudo.</hi></p>
                <p>On the other hand the Lacertilian fauna is essentially distinct from that of the
                    Old World, with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Amphisbaenidae</hi> (and of
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Eublepharidae),</hi> whose presence in South
                    America and Africa is a most remarkable fact, and very strong evidence of the
                    former existence of intervening land. The Skinks and Geckos, which are generally

                    only by the development of the family of Pit Vipers,—the presence in both

                <p>It may be seen from this list that no Chelydoid passes northward beyond the
                    Isthmus of Panama; the Chelonians of Central America belong exclusively to the
                    Emydidae, which are represented by some thirty species; the majority do not
                    extend either into South or North America; two of the genera, Dermatemys and
                    Staurotypus are peculiar to it, and Cinosternurn has its headquarters in this
                    section. Neither Trionyx nor Testudo occurs. Proceeding beyond the Mexican
                    boundary, we find still the Emydidae predominating, a few of the species of
                    Central America ranging northwards into the United States; distinct species of
                    Clemmys, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Emys

                    from Europe. </p></note> Cinosternurn, Chelydra, he., appear, with the wonderful
                    genus Maeroclemrnys. An instance of the isolated occurrence of a Testudο ( T.
                    polyphemus) is met with here; and from the lower part of the Mississippi
                    northward one of the most characteristic features of the North-American fauna
                    makes .its appearance, viz., two species of Trionyx, of which one at least
                    follows the ramifications of that river northward and has found its way into
                    Lake Winnipeg (51° N. lat. ). West of the Rocky Mountains Tortoises are scarce
                    and of distinct species.</p>
                <p>In the West Indies the following species have been found :— 1, Testudo tabulata;
                    2, Podocnemis dumeriliana; 3, Emys continua; 4, E. decussata; 5, E. rugosa. Of
                    these the first two are identical with South-American, and the third with a
                    North-American species, and, therefore, may be regarded as strangers which in
                    comparatively recent times have been introduced into the West Indies. On the
                    other hand the last two are species peculiar to the islands, and, as they belong
                    to a North-American generic type, clearly prove the pertinence of this island
                    district to the northern continent, so far as Tortoises are concerned.</p>
                <p>The south-eastern parts of North America are inhabited by an Alligator which is
                    specifically distinct and locally separated from the southern species.</p>
                <p>The tropical Lacertilian and Ophidian faunae gradually merge into that of the
                    temperate north, and any boundary line drawn between the north and south is more
                    or less arbitrary. As a matter of fact so many truly tropical forms advance
                    north of the tropic of Cancer (which by many authors is taken as the boundary
                    line) that we are inclined to restrict the limits of this region to the district
                    about the Rio Grande, whilst, on the other hand, the northern fauna extends to a
                    lower latitude on the plateau of Mexico. Thus restricted, the North-American
                    fauna includes about fifty species of Lizards, belonging to genera which with
                    very few exceptions are already represented in Central America, or even farther
                    southwards. By far the greatest number are <hi rend="italic">Iguanidae;</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Scincwlae, Anguidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tejidae</hi>
                    are represented by several, the <hi rend="italic">Geckonidae</hi> by fewer
                    species, whilst single species occur of the <hi rend="italic">Amphisbaenidae,

                    all Central-American types. In fact, North America does not possess one family
                    of Lizards peculiar to it.</p>
                <p>11 is worthy of notice that Lizards do not extend so far northwards in the
                    western as in the eastern hemisphere; one species (Gerrhonotus coeruleus) ranges
                    into British Columbia, another into Minnesota CEumeces septeηtrioηalis), and a
                    third into Massachusetts CFumeces fasciatτιs).</p>

                    to innocuous Snakes. All the families represented in this fauna occur also in
                    tropical America, and there is a great agreement of the genera with those of the
                    Central-American district, so that less than one-half can be considered as
                    peculiar to this region, viz., Cοnocephalus, Carρlιophis, Contia, Cemophora,
                    Hypsiglena, Chersodramus, Rhiηxchilus, Pituοphis, Ischnognathus, Clιαriηa,
                    Wenona, Lichanura. Calamariidae and a much larger number of “North-American”
                    terrestrial Chelonians is given, viz., forty-three. This is partly due to the
                    southern boundary of “North America” being extended to the tropic of Cancer,
                    partly to the fact that species are admitted in a different sense from those of
                    the herpetologists of the Old World. By adopting these species a very erroneous
                    impression would be created as regards the comparative numbers of the groups in
                    the several regions. That check-list includes three species of Testudο, three of
                    Cistudo, twenty-one of Emys and its subgenera, five of Cinosternurn, two of
                    Αronιοchelys, one each of Mαcroclemrnys and Chelydra, and six of Trionyx.</p>

                <p>Coronellidae are numerous; so are Colubers, of which Pituopbis is the most
                    characteristic. Freshwater Snakes abound, especially of the genus Tropidonotus.
                    Of Tortricidae three genera have been distinguished. No true Vipers occur, but
                    Pit Vipers are represented by three genera, of which two are Rattlesnakes.</p>
                <p>After what has been stated already, the affinities of this to other regions can
                    be summed up in a few words. The Reptilian fauna of North and South America
                    forms, with the exception of the Chelonians, a homogeneous whole by which the
                    Neogean division proposed by Sclater for Passerine Birds is well characterized.
                    On the other hand, the Chelonian fauna of North America is entirely distinct
                    from that of South America, and most closely allied to that of India.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Europa-Asiatic Region.—</hi> Whilst the north of the
                    western hemisphere has at least one order of Reptiles, the Chelonians, by which
                    it is distinguished from the south, the temperate region of the eastern
                    hemisphere possesses no important distinguishing type of Reptile. Its Reptilian
                    fauna is merely an offshoot of those of the two adjoining tropical regions; and,
                    if we were to add the genera most characteristic of the Palaearctic fauna to
                    either Africa or India, the character of neither would be modified or changed.
                    Thus, so far as Reptiles are concerned, a Palaearctic region does not deserve to
                    rank with the other primary regions.</p>
                <p>The Chelonians are represented by nine species only, viz. :—</p>
                <p>Testudo, ....................................................4 species</p>

                <p>—types which are only specifically distinct from those of the two southern
                    tropical regions. The Land Tortoises are confined to the warmer districts of the
                    western portion, penetrating into the centre of the Siberian sub-region, and
                    entirely absent in the northern and eastern parts; of Emys one species CE.

                    the Tortoises the range of which has become much restricted in post-Glacial

                    and Sweden, where it is now completely extinct. </p></note>; and probably some
                    other species will be found in similar latitudes in the little explored Amur
                    country, where also a species of Trionyx ( T. maaekii) occurs. The second
                    species of this latter genus which is referable to this region inhabits the
                    Euphrates and Tigris.</p>
                <p>The recent discovery of an Alligator in central China is a highly interesting
                    fact, but not surprising, when we remember the occurrence in China of not a few
                    North-American types of Batrachians and Freshwater Fishes. The common African
                    Crocodile still lingers in the Mediterranean district,—its presence in Syria
                    having been placed beyond doubt, and its occurrence in Sicily having been
                    asserted on very good authority.</p>
                <p>The Lacertilians include the only family type which this region has not derived
                    from either Africa or India, viz., the Anguidae. Two genera of this family,

                    the former to the South-American Ophiodes, and the latter to the North-American
                    Ophiosaurus. Laeertidae are abundant as in Africa, and Amphisbaenidae and
                    Chamaeleontidae represented at least in the Mediterranean district. Towards the
                    central parts of Asia the terrestrial Agamidae are continued from north-western
                    Africa, partly with but slight modifications, Phrynoeefihalus being a
                    specifically Central-Asiatic genus. In the Manchurian sub-region these African
                    types are replaced by some Indian forms, such as Gecko and Taehydromus. The
                    northern range of Lizards in this region extends as far as Lapland (Lacerta
                    υivipara and Anguis fragilis).</p>
                <p>The most characteristic Ophidian genus of the region is Zamenis, a Colubrine form
                    which is very widely spread, and includes more species (eleven) than any other
                    Palaearctic genus. This genus extends over Arabia, and even into the island of
                    Socotra, without being associated there so far as is known at present with
                    Snakes of an either peculiarly African or Indian type. The total number of
                    Palaearctic Snakes amounts to sixty, of which twelve are poisonous Snakes, viz.,
                    nine Vipérines and three Halys. The majority inhabit the Mediterranean district
                    and western Asia.</p>
                <p>Four Typhlops and a single Stxnοstoma have been found in the Mediterranean

                <p>Colubridae are comparatively numerous, and show less affinity to African than
                    Indian forms. Besides Zamenis, Coluber and Elaphis occur in four species each,
                    and Rhineehis and Acontiophis (Afghanistan) are peculiar genera.</p>
                <p>Three or four species of Tropidcrnotus represent the groups of Freshwater
                    Snakes.</p>

                    Africa, and Australia are not inhabited by a sufficiently differentiated fauna
                    to be separated from the tropical regions of which they are the continuation.
                    None of the small oceanic islands south of 40° or Tierra del Fuego possess any
                    Reptiles. On the other hand New Zealand is by the possession of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hatteria,</hi> the sole living remnant of the extinct order <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhynehoeephalia</hi> (not to mention other scarcely less important
                    parts of its fauna), so much distinguished from the other regions that it cannot
                    be associated with any of them. Although the climate and other physical
                    conditions seem to be well adapted for the existence of the Chelonian and
                    Ophidian types, neither is represented; and of Lizards only representatives of
                    the ubiquitous Skinks and Geckos have reached its shores; but some of the latter
                    must have inhabited New Zealand for a long period, as they belong to a distinct
                    genus, <hi rend="italic">Naultinus,</hi> which is peculiar to this group of
                    islands.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of this section it will be useful first to recapitulate the
                    principal features of the Reptilian faunae for each of the primary regions into
                    which the land of the globe has been divided by zoologists, and which nearly
                    coincide with the geographical divisions, and secondly to arrange the regions
                    according to the natural relations as expressed by this class of animals. A
                    division into zones comprising the corresponding parts of both hemispheres
                    cannot be maintained for Reptiles, since the greater portion of the faunae of
                    the temperate are merely the offshoots of tropical faunae, no peculiar types of
                    a higher than generic rank being developed in them.</p>
                <p>1. The Indian Region is characterized by Trionyeidae and Emydidae, but few
                    Testudinulae. Croeodilidae, with Gavials. Lacertilians and Ophidians very
                    numerous. Agamidae chiefly arboreal (Draco), and Varanidae. Pythonidae and
                    Lyeodontidae. Ground Snakes, Colubers, Tree Snakes, and Freshwater Snakes
                    abundant in genera. Tropidonotus. Poisonous Snakes in the proportion of species
                    as 1: 10, and comprising Crotalidae and Elapidae, but only two Viperidae.</p>
                <p>2. The African Region (exclusive of Madagascar) is characterized by Land
                    Tortoises, Trionyeidae, and Chelydidae. Species of Croeodi∙ lus only.
                    Lacertilians and Ophidians rather numerous. Agamûdae chiefly terrestrial;
                    Laeertidae and Varanidae are well represented. Amphisbaenidae, Gerrhosauridae,
                    and ZonuriAae are peculiar to the region. Chamaeleontidae. Pythonidae and
                    Lyeodontidae. True Colubers and Tropidonotus almost absent. Psammophidae.
                    Poisonous Snakes in the proportion of 1: 5, comprising Viperidae and numerous
                    venomous Colubrines.</p>
                <p>3. The Evroγo-Asiatic Region is composed of a mixture of Indian and African
                    generic and family types; and only a few peculiar genera have their centre of
                    distribution in this part, such as Anguis, Pseudopus, Ρhryηoccphalus, Uromastyx,
                    Stxnοdaetyhιs, Also-phylax, Cerαmodaxtylus, Scineus, Zamenis, Coelopeltis,
                    Taphrοnιeto-pon, Daboia, Eehis, Halys. The majority inhabit the sub-tropical and
                    warmer parts abutting upon the neighbouring tropical regions, and are rapidly
                    reduced in number in the more temperate portion.</p>
                <p>4. The Tropical Pacific Region possesses one of the terrestrial Chelonian types,
                    Chelydidae, and species of Crοeοdilus only.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n490/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0490-0473"/>
                <p>Besides Skinks and Geckos, terrestrial Agamidae and Varanidae are well
                    represented; Pygopodidae. EryeiJlae, Rythonidae, and Boidae are autochthonous,
                    whilst a small number of innocuous Colubriues are immigrants from the East
                    Indies. The poisonous Snakes surpass in number the non-poisonous, and belong to
                    the Elapidae.</p>
                <p>5. Madagascar possesses Chelydidae and Testudinidae without Trionyx, like South
                    America. A species of Crocodile. Chamae-leontidae more differentiated here than
                    in Africa, with which it has also Cerrhosauridae and Zonuridae in common;
                    Agamidae are replaced by the South-American Iguanidae. Snakes chiefly
                    South-American; no poisonous Snake.</p>
                <p>6. The Tropical American Region is characterized by the full development of
                    Testudinidae and Chelydidae and absence of Trionyx; Emydoids are immigrants from
                    the north. Crocodiles and Alligators. Lacertilians numerous in families and
                    species, the majority being Iguanidae; the Old-World Lacertidae replaced by
                    Tejidae. Other families, Angiddae, Amq)hisbaenidoe, Eiiblepharidae,
                    Helodermatidae, &amp;c., well represented. Snakes numerous: Boidae and
                    Scytalidae; Ground Snakes, Colubers, and Tree Snakes abundant, less so
                    Freshwater Snakes; Tropidonotus almost absent. Poisonous Snakes in the
                    proportion of species as 1: 8, and comprising Crotalidae and Elaps.</p>
                <p>7. The North-American Region differs from the Tropical in possessing the Emydidae
                    in their full development and Trionyx; only one Testudo. One Alligator. As
                    regards Lacertilians and Ophidians this region occupies the same relation to
                    tropical South America as the Palaearctic region does to Africa and India.</p>
                <p>8. New Zealand is characterized by the possession of the Rhynchocephalian type,
                    without any other Reptile with the exception of certain Skinks and Geckos.</p>
                <p>Arranging these primary divisions of the globe in accordance with the
                    distribution of the several orders of Reptiles, we find that with regard to
                    Chelonians the regions stand in the following relation to each other :—</p>
                <p>I. Emydidae fully developed.</p>
                <p>A. Trionycidae fully developed.</p>
                <p>1. Testudinidae in small numbers or immigrants: a. Indian-Palaearetic regions,
                    and b. North-American region (including Central America).</p>
                <p>IL Chelydidae fully developed.</p>
                <p>A. Trionycidae fully developed.</p>
                <p>1. Testudinidae fully developed: African region.</p>
                <p>B. Trionycidae absent.</p>
                <p>1. Testudinidae fully developed: α. Tropical American region, and b.
                    Madagascar.</p>
                <p>2. Testudinidae absent: Tropical Pacific region.</p>
                <p>III. Chelonians entirely absent: New Zealand</p>
                <p>The types of Crocodilian and Rhynchocephalian orders are too few in number and
                    either very widely or very locally distributed, so that no general division of
                    the globe’s surface can be based upon them alone.</p>
                <p>The two large Lacertilian families <hi rend="italic">Geckonidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> Scirtcidae</hi> are generally distributed over the warmer parts
                    of the globe, and therefore not well adapted for the distinction of the primary
                    regions. Nevertheless, in a more detailed account many of the genera would have
                    to come into consideration, being confined to more or less limited areas. Both
                    families are represented in great variety in Australia, but scantily in South
                    America. With regard to other families the regions can be arranged thus :—</p>
                <p>I. Agamidae and Varanidae fully developed.</p>
                <p>A. Chamaeleontidae, Lacertidae, and Amphisbaenidae: African region (including as
                    sub-region the Western Palaearctic portion, characterized by Anguidae).</p>
                <p>B. Amphisbaenidae and Chamaeleons (except one species)</p>
                <p>absent; Lacertidae few: Indian region with Manchurian sub-region.</p>
                <p>C. Pygopodidae: Tropical Pacific region.</p>
                <p>IL Iguanidae fully developed.</p>
                <p>A. Chamaeleontidae: Madagascar.</p>
                <p>B. Tejidae, Amphisbaenidae, and Anguidae: Sοutlc-American and North-American
                    regions.</p>
                <p>III. Skinks and Geckos only: New Zealand.</p>
                <p>Of the families of Ophidians the <hi rend="italic">Pythonidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> Boidae,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Crotalidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> Vipemdae,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Lycodontidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Scytalidae</hi> replace each other in their distribution, and are,
                    therefore, best adapted for determining the relations of the zoological regions.
                    Although the first two are so far as we know at present the geologically oldest
                    types, and therefore might be employed in the first instance in the arrangement
                    of the regions, their distribution is limited to the equatorial zone, and fails
                    to show the close relations existing between the temperate and equatorial parts
                    of the Old World on the one hand and those of the New on the other. The
                    relations of Madagascar to Tropical America are in the following scheme less
                    distinctly expressed than they are in nature.</p>
                <p>I. Viperidae fully developed.</p>
                <p>A. Pythonidae and Lycodontidae: African region.</p>
                <p>B. Tropidonoti and true Colubers: western portion of the</p>
                <p>Europo-Asiatic region.</p>
                <p>IL Crotalidae fully developed.</p>
                <p>A. Pythonidae and Lycodontidae in the tropical parts;</p>
                <p>Tropidonoti and true Colubers; none of the Crotalines with rattles: Indian region
                    (including Manchuria).</p>
                <p>B. Tropidonoti and true Colubers; some of the Crotalines with rattles;
                    intermediate between the Manchurian sub-region and tropical America:
                    North-American region.</p>
                <p>C. Boidae and Scytalidae: Trop)ixal-American region</p>
                <p>III. Colubrine venomous Snakes only.</p>
                <p>A. Pythonidae and Boidae: Tropical Pacific region.</p>
                <p>IV. Venomous Snakes entirely absent.</p>
                <p>A. Boidae: Madagascar.</p>
                <p>V. Snakes entirely absent: New Zealand. (A. Ç. G. )</p>
