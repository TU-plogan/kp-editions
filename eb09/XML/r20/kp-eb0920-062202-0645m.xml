                    1734. Members of the Rohan family had filled the office of archbishop of
                    Strasburg from 1704,—an office which made them princes of the empire and the
                    compeers rather of the German prince-bishops than of the French ecclesiastics.
                    For this high office Louis de Rohan was destined from his birth, and soon after
                    taking orders, in 1760, he was nominated coadjutor to his uncle, Constantine de
                    Rohan<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n646/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0646-0623"/>Rochefort, who then held the archbishopric, and he
                    was also consecrated bishop of Canopus. But he preferred the elegant life and
                    the gaiety of Paris to his clerical duties, and had also an ambition to make a
                    figure in politics. He joined the party opposed to the Austrian alliance, which
                    had been cemented by the marriage of the archduchess Marie Antoinette to the
                    dauphin. This party was headed by the due d’Aiguillon, who in 1771 sent Prince
                    Louis on a special embassy to Vienna to find out what was being done there with
                    regard to the partition of Poland. Rohan arrived at Vienna in January 1772, and
                    made a great noise with his lavish fêtes. But the empress Maria Theresa was
                    implacably hostile to him; not only did he attempt to thwart her policy, but he
                    spread scandals about her daughter Marie Antoinette, laughed at herself, and
                    shocked her ideas of propriety by his dissipation and luxury. On the death of
                    Louis XV., in 1774, Rohan was recalled from Vienna, and coldly received at
                    Paris; but the influence of his family was too great for him to be neglected,
                    and in 1777 he was made grand almoner, and in 1778 abbot of St Vaast. In 1778 he
                    was made a cardinal on the nomination of Stanislaus Poniatowski, king of Poland,
                    and in the following year succeeded his uncle as archbishop of Strasburg and
                    became abbot of Noirmoutiers and Chaise-Dieu. His various preferments brought
                    him in an income of two and a half millions of livres; yet the cardinal was
                    restless and unhappy until he should be reinstated in favour at court and had
                    appeased the animosity which Marie Antoinette felt against him. Though a man of
                    some ability, he became infatuated with the notorious charlatan Cagliostro in
                    1780, and lodged him in his palace, and in 1782 he made the acquaintance of
                    Madame de Lamotte-Valois, a descendant of an illegitimate branch of the Valois,
                    but a poor adventuress, and married to an adventurer. These people, having
                    acquired great influence over Rohan, determined to turn his excessive desire to
                    become reconciled to the queen to their own advantage. They persuaded him that
                    Marie Antoinette wished him well, and contrived an interview between him and a
                    girl named Oliva, who greatly resembled the queen, in the gardens of Versailles
                    in August 1784, so skilfully that he believed he had seen the queen herself and
                    that she had given him a rose. The adventuress then persuaded him that the queen
                    would be much gratified by the present of an extremely valuable diamond necklace
                    which she had refused in 1778 and 1781, and on 26th January 1785 the cardinal
                    purchased it for 1,600,000 francs, to be paid in three instalments, and handed
                    it over to a pretended valet of the queen on receipt of a forged letter of
                    thanks signed “Marie Antoinette of France.” The comte de Lamotte-Valois at once
                    started for London, and, after breaking up the necklace, began to sell the
                    diamonds separately. The plot soon came to light, and the king sent the cardinal
                    to the Bastille. This arrest of a great nobleman and an archbishop excited the
                    wrath of both the nobility and the bishops, and the large party opposed to the
                    Austrian alliance regarded him as a martyr. In this feeling the old courtiers
                    and the judges of the parlement of Paris participated, for they hated the queen
                    for her abolition of strict etiquette and for her extravagance and frivolity.
                    The people, who had also been taught by pamphleteers to hate her and to regard
                    her as the cause of all their ills, shared the feeling of their superiors in
                    education; and, when the parlement of Paris solemnly absolved the cardinal of
                    all blame on 31st May 1786, his acquittal was received with universal
                    enthusiasm, and regarded as a victory over the court and the queen. Though
                    acquitted by the parlement of Paris, the cardinal was deprived of his office as
                    grand almoner and exiled to his abbey of Chaise-Dieu. He was soon allowed to
                    return to Strasburg, and his popularity was shown by his election in 1789 to the
                    states-general by the clergy of the bailliages of Haguenau and Weissenburg. He
                    at first declined to sit, but the states-general, when it became the national
                    assembly, insisted on validating his election. But as a prince of the church in
                    January 1791 he refused to take the oath to the constitution, and went to
                    Ettenheim, in the German part of his diocese. In exile his character improved,
                    and he spent what wealth remained to him in providing for the poor clergy of his
                    diocese who had been obliged to leave France; and in 1801 he resigned his
                    nominal rank as archbishop of Strasburg. On 17th February 1803 he died at
                    Ettenheim.</p>
