                    proof of the contrary is precisely this epistle of Paul. It does not contain the
                    remotest reference to either the one fact or the other. And if Paul had written
                    such an epistle to a community founded by Peter he would not only have violated
                    the agreement mentioned in Gal. ii. 9, but would also have gone against his own
                    principle of refraining from intrusion on the mission fields of others (Rom. xv.
                    20; 2 Cor. x. 16). But neither was Paul the founder of the church in Rome. This
                    also is shown by the present epistle, in which he for the first time opens
                    relations with a community already formed. Thus we are thrown upon mere
                    conjecture. In pursuing the investigation we have this fact to start from, that
                    even before the Christian era there already existed in Rome a strong Jewish
                    colony. After the conquest of Jerusalem by Pompey (63 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> numbers of Jewish prisoners of war were brought to Rome and there
                    sold as slaves. Of these many were soon afterwards emancipated by their masters,
                    Jewish slaves being a peculiarly inconvenient kind of property on account of the
                    strictness of their observance of their law, especially in the matter of clean
                    and unclean meats (Philo, <hi rend="italic">Leg. ad Caium,</hi> ii. 568, ed.
                    Mangey). These freedinen became the nucleus of a Jewish community, which
                    ultimately settled in Trastevere and organized itself into an independent
                    religious communion. It rapidly increased and became an important element in the
                    life of the capital. By the time of Herod’s death (4 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> the independent Jews of Rome—that is, besides women and
                    children—already numbered 8000 according to Josephus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Antiq.,</hi> xvii. 11, 1; .5Ae <hi rend="italic">Jud.,</hi> ii. 6, 1). In the
                    reign of Tiberius indeed this large and powerful organization was dissolved at a
                    single stroke, a decree of the senate (19 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> having
                    sent to Sardinia for military service all Jews capable of bearing arms (Tac.,
                    A»»., ii. 85; Suet., <hi rend="italic">Tiber.,</hi> 36; Joseph., <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiq.,</hi> xviii. 3, 5). It is probable, however, that after the
                    death (31 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> of Sejanus, to whom this measure had
                    been mainly due, the Jews were expressly permitted to return to Rome, for we are
                    told by Philo <hi rend="italic">(Leg. ad Caium,</hi> ii. 569, ed. Mangey) that
                    after the death of his favourite Tiberius perceived the Jews to have been
                    unjustly calumniated, and ordered the authorities to refrain from oppressing
                    them. At all events the community must ultimately have come together again, for
                    in the reign of Claudius its existence is again presupposed, the idea of
                    expelling the Jews from the capital having anew been entertained under that
                    emperor. Regarding this proposal, however, accounts vary. According to the Acts
                    of the Apostles (xviii. 2), and also Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Claud.,</hi>
                    25), it was actually carried out; but according to Dio Cassius (lx. 6) the
                    expulsion was only proposed, and, when it was seen to be impracticable without
                    great tumult, all that was done was to withdraw from the Jews their right of
                    meeting. The latter version is doubtless the more correct. The withdrawal of the
                    right of meeting was equivalent to the prohibition of public worship, and
                    sufficiently explains why numbers left the city (Acts xviii. 2). But the main
                    body must have remained and doubtless have again obtained the privilege of
                    assembly, for from the time of Nero onwards we find the Jews in Rome once more
                    flourishing with undiminished vigour.</p>
                <p>From the midst of this Jewish community it was that the Christian congregation
                    doubtless arose. The Jews of the Dispersion, it is well known, kept up an active
                    correspondence with the mother-country in Palestine. Every year they sent their
                    gifts and offerings thither, and every one in a position to do so went in person
                    to the great festivals of the Holy City. As a result of this vigorously
                    maintained intercourse, which was aided also by the interests of trade, tidings
                    of Jesus as the promised Messiah did not fail to reach the capital of the
                    empire. Individual Jews who had become believers came forward in Rome as
                    preachers of the gospel and found acceptance with a section of their countrymen.
                    They found a perhaps still more numerous following among the “God-fearing” or
                    “devout” <hi rend="italic">(creßopevoi, cjioßovfj.evoi, öeov)</hi> heathen, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> within that large circle which consisted of those who
                    had adopted the faith of the Jews, observed certain of the more important
                    precepts of their law, and also attended their public worship, but did not,
                    strictly speaking, belong to the communion, and thus represented a sort of
                    Judaism of the second order. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Many scholars identify these “devout” heathen with the

                    faith in Jesus as the Messiah gained ground within the Jewish community, a
                    separation between the believers and the others would of course become more <pb

                    conditions the separation actually took place is not now known. We may be sure,
                    however, that it was not brought about without violent internal commotions; it
                    is probable even that the edict of Claudius itself may have had its occasion in
                    these. The remark of Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Claud.,</hi> 25) readily
                    admits of being interpreted in such a sense: “Judaeos impulsore Chresto <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The vulgar pronunciation
                    “Chrestus” for “Christas” is borne witness to in other passages (Tert., <hi
                    rend="italic">Apol.,</hi> 3, and <hi rend="italic">Ad Nat.,</hi> i. 3; Lactan.,

                    Roma expulit.” So interpreted, these words contain our first notice of the
                    Christian Church in Rome; its earliest constitution must have taken place
                    precisely then. For, as has already been seen, the edict of banishment was
                    probably never carried out, or at all events did not continue long in force.
                    Unfortunately, we do not know the date of it, but it must have belonged to the
                    later years of Claudius, for in the beginning of his reign the disposition of
                    that emperor towards the Jews was friendly (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Antiq.,</hi>
                    xix. 5). In its context also Acts xviii. 2 implies a late rather than an early
                    date, say about 50-52 a.d.; and there is nothing against this in the
                    circumstance that the edict is mentioned by Dio Cassius towards the beginning of
                    his account of that reign, for in that particular passage the author is
                    characterizing his subject in a general way and not referring to events in their
                    chronological sequence.</p>
                <p>If the foregoing suppositions are correct, Paul’s epistle to the church at Rome
                    was written some six or eight years after its formation. Paul was staying in
                    Corinth at the time, in the last month before the eventful journey to Jerusalem
                    which led to his captivity (58 a.d.). The evidence that the epistle was written
                    during this last sojourn in Greece, which is only briefly alluded to in Acts xx.
                    2, 3, is simple and conclusive. We know from the Epistles to the Corinthians
                    that shortly before this stay the apostle had set on foot throughout the
                    churches of Macedonia and Achaia a collection on behalf of the needy church at
                    Jerusalem (1 Cor. xvi.; 2 Cor. viii.-ix.). This collection it was his wish to
                    carry in person from Corinth (1 Cor. xvi. 3-6; 2 Cor. i. 16; Acts xxiv. 17). But
                    the Epistle to the Romans was written, as we learn from the author himself (Rom.
                    xv. 21-28), when the collection had just been concluded and he was on the point
                    of taking it with him to Jerusalem,—in other words, before his departure from
                    Corinth, but not long before.</p>
                <p>We have now to inquire into the motive which led the apostle precisely at such a
                    juncture to address a communication so full and elaborate as this to the
                    Christian community at Rome, with which he had no personal acquaintance. In
                    general terms we have it from himself at the beginning and end of the epistle
                    (i. 8-15, xv. 14 <hi rend="italic">sq.~).</hi> He had proclaimed the gospel in
                    all the East from Jerusalem to Illyricum (xv. 19). He regarded his work in these
                    quarters as for the present finished, and he felt impelled to preach Christ
                    crucified also in the West. He was already looking towards Spain (Rom. xv. 24,
                    28). He wished first to take the collection to Jerusalem, and, that once
                    accomplished, his labours in the West were to begin forthwith. But there, in
                    Rome, the metropolis of the world, a community already existed which had come
                    into being apart from any effort of his. For his activity in the West it was
                    obviously of the utmost importance to secure the organization for himself and
                    his message. Should its attitude be cold, he would be left without any secure
                    base of operations. The purpose of the present epistle, then, is, to speak
                    generally, this: to secure a connexion with the community at Rome, to gain it
                    for himself and the gospel he carried. But had it hitherto been without that
                    gospelThe community was at any rate already a Christian one.</p>
                <p>And, if perhaps it was in need of fuller teaching, why did he not wait until he
                    arrived in person in Rome in order to give it? Surely he could have done this
                    more effectually by word of mouth than by a written treatise. Why, then, did he
                    send this written message before him? There must have been some perfectly
                    definite circumstances which led him to take this course. The nature of these
                    will become clear to us when we seek to ascertain what at that juncture was the
                    state of the Christian community in Rome.</p>
                <p>Assuming that church to have arisen out of the midst of the Jewish community of
                    the place, the most obvious conjecture is that at the period of the present
                    letter it still continued to consist mainly of Jewish Christians, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that the majority of its members were Jews by birth who
                    even after their conversion to Christ still continued to regard the Mosaic law
                    in its totality as binding on them. This is the view which Baur in particular
                    sought to establish, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the Gentile Christian character of the church in question. Baur’s position was
                    adopted by many subsequent critics, the most careful and elaborate defence of
                    it, though with many modifications in detail, being that of Mangold. <note

                    Rome may possibly have been Jewish Christian in its way of thinking, yet at the

                    as to its Gentile character, and in all essential points this is also defended
                    by Weizsacker, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ueber

                    recognizes in Baur’s hypothesis certain elements of truth by which the older
                    theory must be corrected and supplemented.</p>
                <p>In presence of the facts we are compelled to adopt the view of Weizsacker as on
                    the whole the right one. For the Jewish Christian character of the church Baur
                    and Mangold, besides the argument from its presumable origin, have adduced a
                    number of isolated texts. On the majority of these Mangold no longer lays any
                    stress, since they admit of being otherwise interpreted. Thus when Paul
                    designates Abraham as “our father” (top <hi rend="italic">irpoird.Topa
                    rjpuov,</hi> iv. 1) he indeed includes his readers under the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rjpMV.</hi> But in 1 Corinthians, an epistle certainly addressed to a church of
                    Gentile Christians, the fathers of Israel are also called “our fathers” (1 Cor.
                    x. 1). The Christian Church is in point of fact the true Israel; hence the
                    patriarchs of Israel are its “fathers.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The words <hi rend="italic">Kara. oäpKa,</hi> in Rom. iv. 1
                    are not to be construed with <hi rend="italic">n-poTTCLTopa. ggoiv</hi> but with
                    the verb <hi rend="italic">evpgKivai.</hi> Abraham is thus designated as “our
                    father” only in the spiritual and not in the physical sense. </p></note> In
                    another place (Rom. vii. 1) Paul addresses his readers as persons “who know the
                    law.” But this holds true not of born Jews alone but of Gentile Christians as
                    well, to whom also the Old Testament was a sacred book. Mangold finds an
                    “irrefragable evidence of the Jewish Christian character of the community in
                    Rome” in Rom. vii. 4: “ye also, beloved brethren, have died to the law” (k&lt;xi
                    7/xets <hi rend="italic">edavarud'qTe</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">to po/xo). If
                    they have died to it they must of course have once lived under it: so argues
                    Mangold quite correctly. But the inference that</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n752/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0752-0729"/>
                <p>in such a case they must have been born Jews is nevertheless a rash one. Not the
                    Jews only, who possess the written law, but the whole of pre-Christian mankind
                    are in Paul’s conception ideally under the law,—under its bondage and curse. For
                    all alike redemption is a redemption from the law’s penalty and dominion. Hence
                    Paul can say even to born Gentiles, e^avarw^Te <hi rend="smallcaps">tw
                    vo/xw.</hi> But according to Baur and Mangold the decisive evidence for the
                    Jewish Christian character of the Roman Christians is the whole substance of the
                    present epistle. All its arguments have for their aim to establish and vindicate
                    the free gospel of Paul as against the objections of the Judaizers. They
                    therefore conclude that it can have been designed only for
                    Judaistically-disposed readers whom Paul seeks by these representations to win
                    for his gospel. This line of argument is at bottom sound, and Baur has rendered
                    a real service by showing that the epistle is by no means an outline of the
                    Pauline dogmatic as a whole, but is simply an elucidation of such points in it
                    as were offensive to the Judaically-minded. A brief review of its contents will
                    make this clear.</p>
                <p>The epistle falls into two unequal parts,—a theoretical (i.-xi.) and a hortatory
                    (xii.-xvi.). The latter is almost of the nature of a mere appendix. The proper
                    kernel of the epistle, that for the sake of which it came to be written, is
                    found in the theoretical exposition of the first eleven chapters. These again
                    fall into two sections,—chaps, i.- v. laying the positive foundations of the
                    Pauline gospel as freed from the law, and chaps, vi.-xi. containing the
                    vindication of that gospel against objectors. Having shown directly in chaps,
                    i.-v. that we can attain righteousness and so salvation not along the path of
                    legal observance but only along the path of faith, that is to say, believing
                    apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, he goes on in chap. vi. to refute
                    point by point the positions of the Judaizers. He shows that in the freedom from
                    the law the freedom to sin is by no means involved; on the contrary, it is with
                    the believer an inherent necessity that he should live a new life in his
                    fellowship with Christ (chap, vi.), and precisely by that fellowship is he for
                    the first time truly enabled so to live (chap. viii.). The law cannot give him
                    this power; it only commands, and does not at the same time give strength to
                    obey. Hence, although good in itself, it has for men only a pernicious effect,
                    inasmuch as by its injunctions sinful desire is excited (chap. vii.). A special
                    objection of the Judaizers against the activity of Paul was also this,—that he
                    should have turned to the heathen while still the greater part of Israel
                    remained unconverted. His answer to this is contained in chaps, ix.-xi. On the
                    one hand, it is Israel’s own fault to have rejected its salvation; on the other
                    hand, such has been God’s will. Israel is at present rejected in order that the
                    heathen may step into the gap thus made. Yet the rejection of Israel is only for
                    a time. By the admission of the heathen Israel is to be stirred to jealousy and
                    thus at last to be also converted. Precisely in such intricate paths as these is
                    the wonderful depth of the divine wisdom made manifest.</p>
                <p>Thus all the theoretical disquisitions of the epistle are in reality neither more
                    nor less than a vindication and a polemic against the Jewish Christian point of
                    view. But are we to conclude from this that the readers were themselves Jewisli
                    Christians? Such an inference has against it the fact that Paul, both at the
                    beginning and at the close of his epistle, clearly designates them as Gentile
                    Christians. In i. 5, 6, and i. 13-15, as well as in xv. 15, 16, he appeals to
                    his office as apostle of the Gentiles as justifying him in now writing to the
                    church at Rome and in proposing further labours there. In xi. 13, also, the
                    readers are spoken to as of Gentile birth. The arguments by which Baur and
                    Mangold seek to weaken the force of this passage are very far-fetched. If, then,
                    the Roman Christians were Gentiles by blood, the theory of Beyschlag, that they
                    were Gentile Christians in origin but Jewish Christians by conviction, appears
                    to have most to commend it in view of the contents of the epistle. If the
                    epistle stopped short at the end of chap, xiii., we should indeed be compelled
                    to adopt that theory. But the remaining chapters (xiv., xv.) suggest much rather
                    that the majority were by conviction also Gentile Christians and emancipated
                    from the law. For in the chapters specified Paul deals with a division that has
                    arisen within the community. One section still remained in the bonds of the
                    strictest legal scrupulosity: they regarded a vegetable diet (Ad^ara) as alone
                    permissible, rejecting the use of animal food (xiv. 2), and they also observed
                    certain days (xiv. 5), by which, there can be no doubt, the Jewish sabbaths and
                    festivals must be understood. In fact they were legal Jewish Christians, but
                    Jewish Christians who in their asceticism went beyond the precepts of Mosaism,
                    which indeed prohibits the use of the flesh of unclean animals, but not animal
                    food in general. Over against these Jewish Christian ascetics, called by Paul
                    “the weak in the faith,” stood another section, whom he describes as “the
                    strong.” They rejected these legal observances, taking their stand on the gospel
                    as freed from the law. But the latter must have been in the majority, for they
                    are exhorted by the apostle to have a tender regard for the weakness of their
                    brethren, and not by any harsh terrorism to force them into any courses which
                    might offend their consciences. Such an exhortation, as Weizsacker remarks,
                    would have no meaning if the representatives of the freer view were not in the
                    majority. The majority, then, of the church at Rome was Gentile Christian not
                    only by origin but by conviction.</p>
                <p>Here two problems arise, neither of which received sufficient attention from
                    critics before Baur: (1) How are we to explain the origin, outside the limits of
                    Paul’s activity, of a Christian community thus free from the fetters of the law?
                    and (2) How came it about that Paul should have addressed to such a community a
                    letter like this,—adapted, as it appears to be, for Jewishly-inclined readers?
                    As regards the first question, in the absence of adequate materials for a
                    conclusive solution, our answer can only be conjectural. The problem is a
                    difficult one, because, following Gal. ii., we must start with the assumption
                    that the communities founded under the more direct influence of the original
                    apostles did not reject the Jewish law. In seeking, then, to account for the
                    existence of a community which had so done, we must carry with us the fact that
                    within the wide limits of the Jewish Dispersion very various degrees of
                    strictness in observance of the law were to be found. Even those who were in the
                    truest sense members of the communities of the Dispersion can hardly have
                    observed the law as strictly as did the Pharisees in Palestine. But the demands
                    made on those “God-fearing” Gentiles who were wont to attach themselves, more or
                    less' closely, to the Jewish communities must of course have been still more
                    accommodating. If only they accepted the monotheistic religion and its worship
                    without the use of images, the ceremonial precepts laid upon them were reduced
                    to a bare minimum,— the observance of Sabbaths, and also of some laws regarding
                    meat. Now the community at Rome seems to have chiefly arisen out of the circles
                    of such “God-fearing” Gentiles. As Paul himself gained access for the preaching
                    of the gospel, at Thessalonica, for example, principally among the “God-fearing
                    Greeks” (Acts xvii. 4), so also in Rome do these seem to have been the main
                    element in the church. On this assumption we can understand how <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n753/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0753-0730"/>from the outset the community had not been in the
                    habit of observing the Mosaic law. At most it was observed in isolated details,
                    and as new members continued to be added from the outer heathen world these
                    relics of Jewish custom received less and less prominence, fading away in
                    presence of the faith in Jesus as the Redeemer. It is possible that influences
                    from Pauline circles may also have come into play, but of this we cannot be
                    sure.</p>
                <p>If such were the circumstances in which the majority of the community in Rome had
                    been brought to their attitude of freedom towards the law, that attitude was one
                    of fact rather than of principle. The law was not observed; but there was no
                    clear consciousness that it had no obligatory force. A community thus placed had
                    no firm basis from which to withstand a Judaizing agitation when it should
                    arise. In such an event there was the greatest danger to its very existence. It
                    is here, then, that we must look for the real occasion of the present epistle.
                    Paul was afraid that the Judaizers who had wrought with such effect within the
                    churches founded by himself in Galatia and Corinth might also lay hold on that
                    at Rome. Perhaps they had already arrived there and the apostle knew it. At all
                    events he perceived a threatening danger. He was unwilling to delay till he
                    could visit the church personally, and accordingly sent forthwith an elaborate
                    document in establishment and vindication of the gospel as free from the law, so
                    that the Roman Christians might be confirmed in their free practice and might be
                    strengthened to withstand the agitations of Judaizers. This is the explanation
                    of the fact that a letter addressed to a Gentile Christian church, not in
                    bondage to the law, is yet almost entirely devoted to the refutation of the
                    Judaistic positions.</p>
                <p>The genuineness of the epistle is practically undisputed; not so, however, its
                    integrity. Baur (as had already been done by Marcion in ancient times) disputed
                    the genuineness of the last two chapters (xv., xvi.), chiefly on the ground that
                    in them a spirit of concession towards the weak is urged in a wholly un-Pauline
                    manner. Luclit <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ueber die beiden letzten Kapitel des Römerbriefes,</hi> Berlin,

                    these chapters in a very complicated manner, but substantially on the lines of
                    Baur’s criticism. The most thorough discussion of Baur’s and Lucht’s views is
                    that of Mangold, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Den Römerbrief u. s. gesch. Voraussetz.,</hi> pp. 1-164.
                    </p></note> who has very convincingly shown that there is no real ground for
                    refusing to attribute to the apostle the chapters in question. All the
                    exhortations to concession do not, after all, go beyond the principle acted on
                    by Paul himself (1 Cor. ix. 20),—“to the Jews I became as a Jew that I might win
                    the Jews.” In two points, however, the defence does not hold: (1) the doxology
                    at the close (Rom. xvi. 25-27) appears certainly to be from a later hand; <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mangold, <hi
                    rend="italic">op. eit.,</hi> pp. 44-81. </p></note> (2) ch. xvi. 3-20 seems to
                    be genuinely Pauline indeed, but not to belong to the present epistle. Not only
                    is the large number of salutations in a letter addressed to a community
                    personally unknown to the apostle in itself strange; but salutations also occur
                    addressed to persons whom one would expect to find rather at Ephesus than at
                    Rome (ver. 3, Aquila and Priscilla; ver. 5, Epaenetus) and in districts where
                    the apostle had resided and laboured (xvi. 7, 9, 13). Not without reason,
                    therefore, is it conjectured that here we have a fragment of an epistle to the
                    Ephesians which by mistake has come to be incorporated with that to the Romans.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See especially Mangold,
                    <hi rend="italic">op. eit.,</hi> pp. 147-164. Lightfoot <hi rend="italic">(St
                    Paul's Epistle to the Philippians,</hi> 2d ed., pp. 169-176) has shown that many
                    of the names met with in Rom. xvi. 3-20 are found precisely in Roman
                    inscriptions of the period of the emperors, hut the fact is more striking than
                    convincing. The names in themselves are common. It is not to the names but to
                    the persons characterized that we have to look. But of these it is difficult to
                    believe that they should all have been living in Rome. </p></note></p>
