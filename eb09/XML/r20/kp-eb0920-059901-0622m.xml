                <p><label type="entry">ROBERTSON</label> William (1721 -1793), an eminent Scottish
                    historian, born at Borthwick, Midlothian, on the 19th September 1721, was the
                    eldest son of the Rev. William Robertson and of Eleanor Pitcairn. He received
                    his early education at the school of Dalkeith,—at that time one of the best in
                    Scotland; but at the age of twelve he was removed to the university of
                    Edinburgh, where he soon manifested that sustained ardour in the pursuit of
                    knowledge which he preserved throughout his long life. On his commonplace books,
                    written when he was a mere youth, he always inscribed the motto: <hi
                    rend="italic">Vita sine literis mors est.</hi> He was from the first intended
                    for the ministry; when twenty-two years old he was presented to the living of
                    Gladsmuir in East Lothian, and almost immediately afterwards he lost both his
                    father and his mother, who died within a few hours of each other. The support
                    and education of a younger brother and six sisters then devolved upon him, and,
                    though his income was only £100 a year, he sheltered them all in his house and
                    “continued to educate his sisters under his own roof till they were settled
                    respectably in the world” (Stewart). Robertson’s inclination for study was never
                    allowed to interfere with his duties as a parish minister, which he rather
                    increased than diminished: “it was his custom during the summer months to
                    convene on Sunday morning the youth of the parish of Gladsmuir half an hour
                    before the commencement of the regular service of the church, and to employ that
                    time in explaining to them the doctrines of the Catechism.” His attention to his
                    pastoral duties and his power and distinction as a preacher had made him a local
                    celebrity while still a young man.</p>
                <p>His energy and decision of character were brought out vividly by the rebellion of
                    1745. When Edinburgh seemed in danger of falling into the hands of the rebels he
                    laid aside the pacific habits of his profession and joined the volunteers in the
                    capital. When the city was surrendered he was one of the small band who repaired
                    to Haddington and offered their services to the commander of the royal forces.
                    Such a man could not remain in obscurity, and in the year 1751, when not quite
                    thirty years of age, we find him already taking a prominent part in the business
                    of the General Assembly. On the first occasion when he spoke (in seconding a
                    motion by John Home for the suspension of certain presbyters who had refused to
                    take part in an unpopular settlement) he was listened to with great attention,
                    but his words had so little immediate effect on the assembly that on a division
                    he was left in a minority of eleven against two hundred. A young mart might well
                    have been daunted by such a defeat, but his energy and self reliance refused to
                    yield. His great oratorical power, at once lucid, cogent, and persuasive, had
                    made an impression on men’s minds, and within so short a period as one year,
                    when he again advocated his principles in connexion with what is known as the
                    Inverkeithing case, he carried the house completely with him, and with the
                    deposition of Thomas Gillespie secured a triumph for the policy he had adopted.
                    From that moment his influence in the councils of the Scottish Church as leader
                    of the “moderate party” was for many years nearly supreme (compare
                    Presbyterianism, vol. xix. p. 685). The production of Home’s tragedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Douglas</hi> on the Edinburgh stage (1757) afforded Robertson
                    another occasion for displaying that union of courage and caution which formed a
                    marked feature of his character. Although the influence of moderatism was now
                    visibly in the ascendant, there was still enough of the older spirit of Scottish
                    Puritanism left to take alarm and raise an outcry against a stage play written
                    by a minister and witnessed by many clergymen who were the author’s friends. One
                    of these, the famous Dr Alexander Carlyle, was prosecuted before the synod for
                    having gone to the theatre, and he tells us in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Autobiography</hi> that he purposely contrived to exclude Robertson from the
                    post of moderator because “his speaking would be of more consequence if not in
                    the chair.” This testimony is the more noteworthy as Carlyle shows throughout
                    his memoirs a grudging and unfriendly tone when speaking of Robertson. The
                    latter, indeed, was able to render his incriminated colleague great service on
                    this occasion, not only by his talent as a speaker, but by reason of the
                    detached and unassailable position which his customary prudence had led him to
                    take up. He never went to the play himself, he said, but that was not because he
                    thought it wrong but because he had given a solemn promise to his father never
                    to do so. He could not therefore join in censuring other clergymen who were held
                    by no such vow as he had made: “it was sacred to him, but not obligatory on
                    them.” Carlyle was acquitted and Robertson had the credit—which he perhaps
                    somewhat too constantly aimed at and generally secured—of standing well with all
                    parties, of advocating the claims of culture and liberal sentiment without
                    giving ground to their opponents for attacking his personal conduct and
                    character.</p>
                <p>But during all this period of prominent activity in the public life of Edinburgh
                    Robertson was busy with those historical labours which have given him a
                    permanent place in British literature. He had conceived the plan of his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi> as early as the year 1753; in July 1757
                    he had proceeded as far as the Gowrie conspiracy, and in November of the
                    following year David Hume, then residing in London, was receiving the
                    proof-sheets from Strahan and making friendly but searching criticisms on the
                    work in letters to the author. Till he had finished his book Robertson had never
                    left his native country; but the publication of his history necessitated a
                    journey to London, and he passed the early months of the year 1758 partly in the
                    capital and partly in leisurely rambles in the counties of England. He returned
                    on horseback in company with Alexander Carlyle and other Scotsmen, riding all
                    the way from London to Edinburgh in about eighteen days.</p>
                <p>The success of the <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi> was immediate and
                    splendid, and within a month a second edition was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n623/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0623-0600"/>called for. Before the end of the author’s life
                    the book had reached its fourteenth edition; and in the opinion of some it
                    remains Robertson’s greatest work. It soon brought him other rewards than
                    literary fame. In 1759 he was appointed chaplain of Stirling Castle, in 1761 one
                    of His Majesty’s chaplains in ordinary, and in 1762 he was chosen principal of
                    the university of Edinburgh. Two years later the office of king’s
                    historiographer was revived in his favour with a salary of £200 a year. His
                    income greatly surpassed the revenue of any Presbyterian minister before him and
                    at least equalled that of some of the bishops when Episcopacy was established in
                    Scotland. It is the more surprising therefore that this moment of exceptional
                    prosperity should have been chosen by some of his most valued friends to advise
                    him to forsake the Scottish for the English Church and try for preferment south
                    of the Tweed; and the surprise becomes wonder when we learn that those friends
                    were Sir Gilbert Elliot and David Hume. The imprudence, to say nothing of the
                    questionable morality, of such a step would seem too glaring to allow of its
                    recommendation by any honourable well-wishers. Perhaps no man was more fitted
                    than Robertson to measure and reject such injudicious advice, and he probably
                    never gave the matter a second thought. He remained at home among his own
                    people.</p>
                <p>The rest of Robertson’s life was uneventful to a degree even surpassing the
                    proverbial uneventfulness of the lives of scholars. He was casting about for
                    another historical subject in the very year in which his first w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> ork appeared, and he was wont to consult his friends
                    on the choice of a period with a naïveté which shows how little the arduousness
                    of historical research was then understood. Hume advised him to -write a history
                    of Greece or else lives in the manner of Plutarch. Dr John Blair urged him to
                    write a complete history of England, while Horace Walpole suggested a history of
                    learning. It must be recorded to Robertson’s credit that he showed a preference
                    from the first for the subject which he ultimately selected, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles the Fifth.</hi> He took
                    uncommon pains with the work and devoted to it ten consecutive years of labour.
                    It appeared in three volumes quaιto in 1769. In 1777 he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of America</hi> and in 1791 his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Disquisition concerning the Knowledge which the Ancients had of India,</hi>
                    which concluded his historical labours and appeared only two years before his
                    death, which occurred near Edinburgh on the 11th June 1793. His fame had long
                    been European, and he left no rival in the field of historical composition save
                    Gibbon alone.</p>
                <p>For an adequate appreciation of Robertson’s position in British literature, and
                    more especially of his rank as an historian, we have to consider the country and
                    the age in which he was born and his own personal qualities and limits.</p>
                <p>Considering the small size and poverty of the country, Scotland had made a more
                    than creditable figure in literature in the great age of the Reformation and the
                    Renaissance. Its scholars, civilians, and professors of logic and philosophy
                    were welcomed wherever learning flourished, except, perhaps, in England. All
                    Europe could not show a more brilliant writer and publicist than Buchanan, and
                    “the best romance that ever was written” (the words are Cowper’s) was produced
                    by a Scottish contemporary of Shakespeare, viz., the once famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Argeηis</hi> of John Barclay. But the early triumphs of Scottish
                    genius were all won in a foreign if familiar idiom, the common language of the
                    learned; and when Latin retreated before the growing importance of modern
                    tongues the Scots had no literary vernacular on which to fall back. For a
                    century and a half (1600-1750) a Scottish writer to be read was forced to use a
                    foreign language,—Latin, English, and even occasionally French. As Burton <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist, of
                    Scotland,</hi> vol. viii. p. 544. </p></note> has well remarked, this alone was
                    sufficient to account in a large measure for the literary barrenness of the
                    country. There was unquestionably another cause at work,—the fervent religious
                    zeal with which the principles of the Reformation had been embraced: neither
                    science, literature, nor art could obtain much attention from men who regarded
                    them all as “deceitful vanities,” leading the mind away from the one thing
                    needful. In a small and sparsely peopled country, without wealth, commerce, or
                    even politics in the larger sense, theology became a too absorbing and unique
                    mental stimulus. This was, we may say, proved by the fact that as soon as the
                    union with England opened a wider scope for Scottish energy and enterprise the
                    theological temperature immediately fell,—a change witnessed with natural alarm
                    by the more zealous clergy. “The rise of our too great fondness for trade,”
                    writes the Rev. Robert Wodrow in 1709, “to the neglect of our more valuable
                    interests, I humbly think, will be written on our judgment” (Buckle, vol. ii. p.
                    301). The growth of wealth stimulated the growth of the other great factor of
                    civilization, that of knowledge, and by the middle of the 18th century, just at
                    the time when Robertson was planning his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Scotland,</hi> a wide spirit of inquiry was abroad. Scottish intellect had risen
                    from the tomb in which it had lain entranced for more than a hundred years. The
                    Scottish contribution to British literature in the last half of the century is
                    distinctly superior to that produced in the southern portion of the island. In
                    philosophy and political and economic science the balance is immensely in favour
                    of Scotland. Robertson was therefore no inexplicable prodigy—an “obscure Scotch
                    parson” writing “like a minister of state,” as it pleased Walpole and the London
                    fops to regard him. He lived in a society far more propitious to high literary
                    work than could be found in London or the English universities.</p>
                <p>The connexion between philosophy and history is closer than appears at first
                    sight. The study of man and his faculties, even ontological speculations as to
                    the nature and origin of the universe, lead by a logical sequence to a
                    consideration of human evolution in time, that is, to history. The coincidence
                    of philosophical speculation with historical achievement so repeatedly
                    manifested cannot be accidental. The topic cannot be developed here; but from
                    the days of the Attic historians, who lived in an atmosphere electric with
                    speculation, to the Hegelian historical school of Germany, the higher planes of
                    history are found in near proximity to loftier peaks of philosophy. Hume,
                    wonderful in all things, was perhaps most wonderful in this, that in him the two
                    characters of the philosopher and the historian were completely united. He did
                    not only, like Kant and Hegel, speculate about history; he wrote it. Again, we
                    must admire the peculiar fortune of Robertson: he lived during many years in
                    close contact and intimacy with the greatest philosophic genius of his age,
                    perhaps of modern times.</p>
                <p>Of the three great British historians of the 18th century two were Scotsmen. The
                    exact place of Robertson with regard to his two friends Hume and Gibbon, and to
                    such historians as the rest of Europe had to offer, presents a question of some
                    nicety, because it is complicated by extraneous considerations, so to speak,
                    which should not weigh in an abstract estimate, but cannot be excluded in a
                    concrete and practical one. If we regard only Robertson’s potential historic
                    power, the question is not so much whether he was equal to either of his two
                    friends as whether he was not superior to both. The man who wrote the review of
                    the state of Europe prefixed to the</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n624/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0624-0601"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History of Charles V.,</hi> or even the first book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Scotland,</hi> showed that he had a wider and more
                    synthetic conception of history than either the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decline and Fall</hi> or the author of the <hi rend="italic">History of
                    England.</hi> These two portions of Robertson’s work, with all their
                    shortcomings in the eye of modern criticism, have a distinctive value which time
                    cannot take away. He was one of the first to see the importance of <hi
                    rend="italic">general ideas</hi> in history. He saw that the immediate narrative
                    of events with which he was occupied needed a background of broad and connected
                    generalizations, referring to the social state of which the detailed history
                    formed a part. But he did more than this. In the appendix to the view of Europe
                    called “Proofs and Illustrations” he enters into the difficult and obscure
                    question of land tenure in Frankish times, and of the origin of the feudal
                    system, with a sagacity and knowledge which distinctly advanced the
                    comprehension of this period beyond the point at which it had been left by Du
                    Bos, Montesquieu, and Mably. He was fully acquainted with the original
                    documents,—many of them, we may conjecture, not easy to procure in Scotland. It
                    must have been a genuine aptitude for historical research of a scientific kind
                    which led Robertson to undertake the labour of these austere disquisitions of
                    which there were not many in his day who saw the importance. Gibbon, so superior
                    to him for wide reading and scholarship, has pointedly avoided them. It need
                    hardly be said that many, perhaps the majority, of Robertson’s views on this
                    thorny topic are out of date now. But he deserves the honour of a pioneer in one
                    of the most obscure if also important lines of inquiry connected with European
                    history. On the other hand, it must be admitted that he showed himself only too
                    tame a follower of Voltaire in his general appreciation of the Middle Ages,
                    which he regarded with the mingled ignorance and prejudice common in the l8th
                    century. In this particular he was not at all in advance of his age.</p>
                <p>The neglect and gradual oblivion which are now overtaking the greater part of
                    Robertson’s historical work are owing to no fault of his. He had not and could
                    not have the requisite materials: they were not published or accessible. Justice
                    requires that we should estimate his performance in view of the means at his
                    command, and few critics would hesitate to subscribe to the verdict of Buckle,
                    “that what he effected with his materials was wonderful.” His style, whether of
                    narrative or disquisition, is singularly clear, harmonious, and persuasive. The
                    most serious reproach made against it is that it is correct to a fault and lacks
                    idiomatic vigour, and the charge is not without foundation. But there can be no
                    doubt that, if Robertson’s writings are less read than they formerly were, the
                    fact is to be attributed to no defects of style but to the growth of knowledge
                    and to the immense extension of historical research which has inevitably
                    superseded his initiatory and meritorious labours. (j. c. mo.)</p>
