                    often quite rudimentary, and early deciduous. Canines, in existing species,
                    absent. Molar series, consisting of the full number of four premolars and three
                    molars above and below, all in contact and closely resembling each other, except
                    the first, which is much smaller than the rest and often deciduous. The others
                    gradually increasing in size up to the penultimate. The upper molars have a very
                    characteristic pattern of crown, having a much-developed fiat or more or less
                    sinuous outer wall, and two transverse ridges running obliquely inwards and
                    backwards from it, terminating internally in conical eminences or columns, and
                    enclosing a deep (middle) sinus between. The posterior sinus is formed behind
                    the posterior transverse ridge, and is bounded externally by a backward
                    continuation of the outer wall and behind by the cingulum. The anterior sinus is
                    formed in the same manner, but is much smaller. The middle sinus is often
                    intersected by vertical laminae (“combing plates ”) projecting into it from the
                    anterior surface of the posterior transverse ridge or from the wall, the
                    development of which is a useful guide in discriminating the species, especially
                    those no longer existing and known only by the teeth and bones. The depressions
                    between the ridges are not filled up with cementum as in the horse. The lower
                    molars have the crown formed by a pair of crescents; the last has no third lobe
                    or talon.</p>
                <p>Head large, skull elongated, elevated posteriorly into a transverse occipital
                    crest. No post-orbital processes or any separation between orbits and temporal
                    fossae. Nasal bones large and stout, co-ossified, and standing out freely above
                    the premaxillae, from which they are separated by a deep and wide fissure; the
                    latter small, generally not meeting in the middle line in front, often quite
                    rudimentary. Tympanies small, not forming a bulla. Brain cavity very small for
                    the size of the skull. Vertebrae :—cervical, 7; dorsal, 19-20; lumbar, 3;
                    sacral, 4; caudal, about 22. Limbs stout, and of moderate length. Three
                    completely developed toes, with distinct broad rounded hoofs on each foot. <note

                    inguinal. Eyes small. Ears of moderate size, oval, erect, prominent, placed near
                    the occiput. Skin very thick, in many species thrown into massive folds. Hairy
                    covering ∙ scanty. All existing species have one or two median horns on the
                    face. When one is present it is situated over the conjoined nasal bones; when
                    two, the hinder one is over the frontals. These horns, which are of a more or
                    less conical form and usually recurved, and often grow to a great length (three
                    or even four feet), are composed of a solid mass of hardened epidermic cells
                    growing from a cluster of long dermal papillae. The cells formed on each papilla
                    constitute a distinct horny fibre, like a thick hair, and the whole are cemented
                    together by an intermediate mass of cells which grow up from the interspaces
                    between the papillae. It results from this that the horn has the appearance of a
                    mass of agglutinated hairs, which, in the newly growing part at the base,
                    readily fray out on destruction of the softer intermediate substance; but the
                    fibres differ from true hairs in growing from a free papilla of the derm, and
                    not within a follicular involution of the same.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rhinocerotidae</hi> are all animals of large size, but of
                    little intelligence, generally timid in disposition, though ferocious when
                    attacked and brought to bay, using the nasal horns as weapons, by which they
                    strike and toss their assailant. Their sight is dull, but their hearing and
                    scent are remarkably acute. They feed on herbage, shrubs, and leaves of trees,
                    and, like so many other large animals which inhabit hot countries, sleep the
                    greater part of the day, being most active in the cool of the evening or even
                    during the night. They are fond of bathing and wallowing in water or mud. None
                    of the species have been domesticated. Animals of the group have existed in both
                    the Old and New Worlds since the beginning of the Miocene period. In America
                    they all became extinct before the end of the Pliocene period. In the Old World
                    their distribution has become greatly restricted, being no longer found in
                    Europe and North Asia, but only in Africa and in portions of the Indian and
                    Indo-Malayan regions.</p>

                <p>The existing species of rhinoceros are naturally grouped into three sections,
                    which some zoologists consider of generic value.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Rhinoceros</hi> proper. The adults with a single large
                    compressed incisor above on each side, and occasionally a small lateral one;
                    below, a very small median, and a very large, procumbent, pointed lateral
                    incisor. Nasal bones pointed in front. A single nasal horn. Skin very thick, and
                    raised into strong, definitely arranged ridges or folds.</p>
                <p>There are two well-marked species of one-horned rhinoceroses. (1) The Indian
                    Rhinoceros, <hi rend="italic">R. uηicomis</hi> of Lin-naeus, <note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Many authors use Cuvier’s
                            name, <hi rend="italic">R. indicus,</hi> in preference to this, on the
                            ground that there are more than one species with one horn, forgetting
                            that the name substituted is equally inconvenient, as more than one
                            species live in India. The fact of a specific name being applicable to
                            several members of a genus is no objection to its restriction to the
                            first to which it was applied; otherwise changes in old and
                            well-received names would constantly have to be made in consequence of
                            new discoveries. </p></note> the largest and best known, from being the
                    most frequently exhibited alive in England, is at present only met with in a
                    wild state in the terai region of Nepal and Bhutan, and in the upper valley of
                    the Brahmaputra or province of Assam, though it formerly had a wider range.</p>
                <p>Roman shows, was of this species. It was sent from India to Emmanuel, king of
                    Portugal, in 1513; and from a sketch of it, taken in Lisbon, Albert Dürer
                    composed his celebrated but rather fanciful engraving, which was reproduced in
                    so many old books on natural history. (2) The Javan Rhinoceros, <hi
                        rend="italic">R. sondaicus,</hi> Cuvier, is distinguished by smaller size,
                    special characters of the teeth and skull, and different arrangement of the
                    plications of the skin (as seen in the figures); the horn in the female appears
                    to be very little developed, if not altogether absent. This has a more extensive
                    geographical range, being found in the Bengal Sunderbans near Calcutta, Burmah,
                    the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra, and probably Borneo.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Ceratorhiηus.</hi> The adults with a moderate-sized
                    compressed incisor above, and a laterally placed, pointed, procumbent incisor
                    below, which is sometimes lost in old animals. Nasal bones narrow and pointed
                    anteriorly. A well-developed nasal, and a small frontal horn separated by an
                    interval. The skin thrown into folds, but these not so strongly marked as in the
                    former section. The smallest living member of the family, the Sumatran
                    Rhiroceros, <hi rend="italic">R. sumatreηsis,</hi> Cuv., belongs to this group.
                    Its geographical range is nearly the same as that of the Javan species, though
                    not extending into Bengal; but it has been found in Assam, Chittagong, Burmah,
                    the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. It is possible that more than one
                    species have been confounded under this designation, as two animals now living
                    in the London Zoological Gardens present considerable differences of form and
                    colour. One of them, from Chittagong, has been named by Sclater <hi
                        rend="italic">R. lasiotis,</hi> the Hairy-Eared Rhinoceros, but until an
                    opportunity is afforded for anatomical examination, it is difficult to pronounce
                    upon the value of the distinction.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Atelodus.</hi> In the adults, the incisors are quite
                    rudimentary or entirely wanting. Nasal bones thick, rounded and truncated in
                    front. Well-developed anterior and posterior horns in close contact. Skin
                    without any definite permanent folds.</p>
                <p>The two well-marked existing species are peculiar to the African continent.</p>
                <p>1. The common Two-Horned Rhinoceros, <hi rend="italic">R. bicomis,</hi> Linn., is
                    the smaller of the two, with a pointed prehensile upper lip, and a narrow
                    compressed deep symphysis of the lower jaw. It ranges through the wooded and
                    watered districts of Africa, from Abyssinia in the north to the Cape Colony, but
                    its numbers are yearly diminishing, owing to <pb break="no"

                    especially of English sportsmen. It feeds exclusively upon leaves and branches
                    of bushes and small trees, and chiefly frequents the sides of wood-clad rugged
                    hills. Specimens in which the posterior horn has attained a length as great as
                    or greater than the anterior have been separated under the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">R. keitloa,</hi> but the characters of these appendages are
                    too variable to found specific distinctions upon. The twohorned African
                    rhinoceros is far more rarely seen in menageries in Europe than either of the
                    three Indian species, but one has lived in the gardens of the London Zoological
                    Society since 1868. Excellent figures from life of this and the other species
                    are published in the ninth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of
                    the society, from which the accompanying woodcuts are reduced.</p>
                <p>2. BurchelΓs or the Square-Mouthed Rhinoceros (/?. <hi rend="italic">simus),</hi>
                    sometimes called the White Rhinoceros, though the colour (dark-slate) is not
                    materially different from that of the last species, is the largest of the whole
                    group, and differs from all the others in having a square truncated upper lip
                    and a wide, shallow, spatulate symphysis to the lower jaw. In conformity with
                    the structure of the mouth, this species lives entirely by browsing on grass,
                    and is therefore more partial to open countries or districts where there are
                    broad grassy valleys between the tracts of bush. It is only found in Africa
                    south of the Zambesi, and of late years has become extremely scarce, owing to
                    the persecutions of sportsmen; indeed, the time of its complete extinction
                    cannot be far off. No specimen of this species has ever been brought alive to
                    Europe. Mr Γ. C. Selous gives the following description of its habits from
                    extensive personal observation :—</p>
                <p>“The square-mouthed rhinoceros is a huge ungainly-looking beast, with a
                    disproportionately large head, a large male standing 6 feet 6 inches at the
                    shoulder. Like elephants and buffaloes they lie asleep during the heat of the
                    day, and feed during the night and in the cool hours of early morning and
                    evening. Their sight is very bad; but they are quick of hearing, and their scent
                    is very keen; they are, too, often accompanied by rhinoceros birds, which, by
                    running about their heads, flapping their wings, and screeching at the same
                    time, frequently give them notice of the approach of danger. When disturbed they
                    go off at a swift trot, which soon leaves all pursuit from a man on foot far
                    behind; but if chased by a horseman they break into a gallop, which they can
                    keep up for some distance. However, although they run very swiftly, when their
                    size and heavy build is considered, they are no match for an average good horse.
                    They are, as a rule, very easy to shoot on horseback, as, if one gallops a
                    little in front of and on one side of them, they will hold their course, and
                    come sailing past, offering a magnificent broadside shot, while under similar
                    circumstances a prehensile-lipped rhinoceros will usually swerve away in such a
                    manner as only to present his hind-quarters for a shot. When either walking or
                    running, the square-mouthed rhinoceros holds its head very low, its nose nearly
                    touching the ground. When a small calf accompanies its mother, it always runs in
                    front and she appears to guide it by holding the point of her horn upon the
                    little animal’s rump; and it is perfectly wonderful to note how in all sudden
                    changes of pace, from a trot to a gallop or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi>
                    the same position is always exactly maintained. During the autumn and winter
                    months (i.e., from March to August) the square-mouthed rhinoceros is usually
                    very fat; and its meat is then most excellent, being something like beef, but
                    yet having a peculiar flavour of its own. The part in greatest favour among
                    hunters is the hump, which, if cut off whole and roasted just as it is in the
                    skin, in a hole dug in the ground, would, I think, be difficult to match either
                    for juiciness or flavour.”— <hi rend="italic">Proe. Zook Soc.,</hi> 1881, p.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Extinct Species of Rhinoceros.—</hi> The family once contained
                    many more species, which were far more widely distributed than at present. As in
                    similar cases, our knowledge of them is as yet but fragmentary, though
                    constantly augmenting, especially by discoveries made in the Tertiary deposits
                    of North America, a region in which they all died out long ago, though, judging
                    from the evidence at present available, this was the locality in which they
                    first made their appearance. In the Eocene formations of the Rocky Mountains are
                    found the remains of numerous modifications of the primitive Perissodactyle
                    type, from which the rhinoceroses may have originated. In the Lower Miocene a
                    form called <hi rend="italic">Hyraeodxn</hi> by Leidy already presented many of
                    the characteristics of the family, though, especially as regards the dentition,
                    in a very generalized condition. The next stage of specialization is represented
                    by <hi rend="italic">Aeeratheriιιm,</hi> found in the Miocene of both Europe and
                    America, which still, like the last, shows no sign of having possessed a nasal
                    horn. It differed from the existing species also in having four toes on the
                    anterior limb, instead of only three. At the same period forms occurred <hi
                        rend="italic">ODixera-theriwrn,</hi> Marsh) which show a pair of lateral
                    tubercles on the nasal bones, apparently supporting horns side by side. These,
                    however, soon disappeared and gave way in the Old World to species with one or
                    two horns in the median line, a stage of development which apparently was never
                    reached in America. In the Pliocene and Pleistocene of Europe and Asia numerous
                    modifications of the existing types have been found. The present African
                    two-horned type was represented in the Early Pliocene of Greece by <hi
                        rend="italic">R. pachy-gηathus,</hi> the skeleton of which is described by
                    Gaudryas intermediate between the existing <hi rend="italic">R. bieornis</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">R. simus.</hi> As many as three species were inhabitants
                    of the British Isles, of which the best known is the Tichorhine or Woolly
                    Rhinoceros, <hi rend="italic">R. aηtiquitatis</hi> of Blumenbach, nearly whole
                    carcases of which, with the thick woolly external covering, have been discovered
                    associated with those of the mammoth, preserved in the frozen soil of the north
                    of Siberia, and which, in common with some other extinct species, had a solid
                    median wall of bone supporting the nasals, from which it is inferred that the
                    horns were of a size and weight surpassing that of the modern species. The
                    one-horned Indian type was well represented under several modifications (A. <hi
                        rend="italic">sivalensis, palaeindicus,</hi> &amp;c. ), in the Pliocene
                    deposits of the sub-Himalayan region, and forms more allied to the African
