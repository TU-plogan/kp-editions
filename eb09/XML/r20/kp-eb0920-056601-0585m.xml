                    greatest rabbi of Africa, and subsequently of the Peninsula, in the llth and
                    l2th centuries, was born in 1013 at KaΓat-Ibn-Hammad near Fez, and died at
                    Lucena in 1103. His teachers were the great rabbins Rabbenu Nissim and Rabbenu
                    Hananeel, both of Kairawan (</hi><hi rend="italic">ob</hi> . 1055). What Rashi
                    (ç.v.) was to the Ashkenazic Riph was for the Sepharadic Jews, <note

                    activity. Rashi left the Babylonian Talmud, corrections of the text excepted
                    (which he, however, confined to his own commentary, and by which his own
                    disciples and publishers corrected the Talmud text), in its old state. Al-phasi,
                    however, first separated from it the Agadah, which he cast aside almost
                    entirely, and then he sifted the Hala-khah <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    thoroughly, retaining only the practical part of it. Thus either title his book
                    has received is correct, the <hi rend="italic">Little Talmud</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decisions of Rab Al-phez.</hi> Late in the 12th century and in the
                    13th a host of rabbins respectively attacked and defended Al-phasi (see Rabad
                    III., and Rλmban), whilst others commented on him (see below). One of the
                    commentaries accompanying the Riph is by Rashi. This commentary, however, which
                    is now an integral part of the book, was not written for it by Rashi himself,
                    who could scarcely have known of Riph’s existence, and much less of his work.
                    The fact is the enterprising publisher of the second edition (Venice, 1521-22,
                    fol.), the famous Daniel Bombergi, had one of the three recensions which Rashi
                    had made on the Talmud excerpted and applied to corresponding parts of the Riph
                    which has the very wording of the Talmud, or something near it. Where no Rashi
                    was to be found in the passages of the <pb break="no"

                    Riph was not only a great Talmudist, but also a man of the greatest magnanimity
                    and highest morality, as may be seen from the following two facts. When R.
                    Yishak Ibn Albalia, who had been his bitterest enemy, lay at the point of death,
                    he recommended his son to Riph, who received him with the greatest kindness, and
                    at once adopted him as son. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    point of death he recommended to the congregation of Lucena for successor, not
                    his own learned and virtuous son Ya'akob, but the yet more learned, though not
                    more virtuous, R. Yoseph Ibn Migash, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
