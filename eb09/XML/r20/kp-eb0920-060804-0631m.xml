                    Tintoretto or Tintoret, one of the greatest painters of the Venetian or of any
                    school, was born in Venice in 1518, though most accounts say in 1512. His
                    father, Battista Robusti, was a dyer, or “tintore”; hence the son got the
                    nickname of “Tintoretto,” little dyer, or dyer’s boy. In childhood Jacopo, a
                    born painter, began daubing on the dyer’s walls; his father, noticing his bent,
                    took him round, still in boyhood, to the studio of Titian,</p>

                <p>to see how far he could be trained as an artist. We may suppose this to have been
                    towards 1533, when Titian was already fifty-six years of age. Ridolfi is our
                    authority for saying that Tintoret had only been ten days in the studio when
                    Titian sent him home once and for all. The reason, according to the same writer,
                    is that the great master observed some very spirited drawings, which he learned
                    to be the production of Tintoret; and it is inferred that he became at once
                    jealous of so promising a scholar. This, however, is mere conjecture; and
                    perhaps it may be fairer to suppose that the drawings exhibited so much
                    independence of manner that Titian judged that young Robusti, although he might
                    become a painter, would never be properly a pupil. From this time forward the
                    two always remained upon distant terms,—Robusti being indeed a professed and
                    ardent admirer of Titian, but never a friend, and Titian and his adherents
                    turning the cold shoulder to Robusti. Active disparagement also was not wanting,
                    but it passed disdainfully unnoticed by Tintoret. The latter sought for no
                    further teaching, but studied on his own account with laborious zeal; he lived
                    poorly, collecting casts, bas-reliefs, &amp;c., and practising by their aid. His
                    noble conception of art and his high personal ambition were evidenced in the
                    inscription which he placed over his studio,—“Il disegno di Michelangelo ed il
                    colorito di Tiziano” (Michelangelo’s design and Titian’s colour). He studied
                    more especially from models of Buonarroti’s Dawn, Noon, Twilight, and Night, and
                    became expert in modelling in wax and clay,—a method (practised likewise by
                    Titian) which afterwards stood him in good stead in working out the arrangement
                    of his pictures. The models were sometimes taken from dead subjects dissected or
                    studied in anatomy schools; some were draped, others nude, and Robusti was wont
                    to suspend them in a wooden or cardboard box, with an aperture for a candle. Now
                    and afterwards he very frequently worked by night as well as by day. The young
                    painter Schiavone, four years Robusti’s junior, was much in his company.
                    Tintoret helped Schiavone gratis in wall-paintings; and in many subsequent
                    instances he worked also for nothing, and thus succeeded in obtaining
                    commissions. The two earliest mural paintings of Robusti—done, like others, for
                    next to no pay—are said to have been Belshazzar’s Feast and a Cavalry Fight,
                    both long since perished. Such, indeed, may be said to have been the fate of all
                    his frescos, early or later. The first work of his which attracted some
                    considerable notice was a portrait-group of himself and his brother—the latter
                    playing a guitar—with a nocturnal effect; this also is lost. It was followed by
                    some historical subject, which Titian was candid enough to praise. One of
                    Tintoret’s early pictures still extant is in the church of the Carmine in
                    Venice, the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple; also in S. Benedetto are the
                    Annunciation and Christ with the Woman of Samaria. For the Scuola della Trinità
                    (the scuole or schools of Venice were more in the nature of hospitals or
                    charitable foundations than of educational institutions) he painted four
                    subjects from Genesis. Two of these, now in the Venetian Academy, are Adam and
                    Eve and the Death of Abel, both noble works of high mastery, which leave us in
                    no doubt that Robusti was by this time a consummate painter,—one of the few who
                    have attained to the highest eminence by dire study of their own, unseconded by
                    any training from some senior proficient.</p>
                <p>Towards 1546 Robusti painted for the church of S. Maria dell’ Orto three of his
                    leading works—the Worship of the Golden Calf, the Presentation of the Virgin in
                    the Temple, and the Last Judgment—now shamefully repainted; and he settled down
                    in a house hard by the church. It is a Gothic edifice, looking over the lagoon
                    of Murano to the Alps, built in the Fondamenta de’ Mori, still standing, but let
                    out cheap to artisans. In 1548 he was commissioned for four pictures in the
                    Scuola di S. Marco—the Finding of the Body of St Mark in Alexandria (now in the
                    church of the Angeli, Murano), the Saint’s Body brought to Venice, a Votary of
                    the Saint delivered by invoking him from an Unclean Spirit (these two are in the
                    library of the royal palace, Venice), and the highly and justly celebrated
                    Miracle of the Slave. This last, which forms at present one of the chief glories
                    of the Venetian Academy, represents the legend of a Christian slave or captive
                    who was to be tortured as a punishment for some acts of devotion to the
                    evangelist, but was saved by the miraculous intervention of the latter, who
                    shattered the bone-breaking and blinding implements which were about to be
                    applied. These four works were greeted with signal and general applause,
                    including that of Titian’s intimate, the too potent Pietro Aretino, with whom
                    Tintoret, one of the few men who scorned to curry favour with him, w <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> as mostly in disrepute. It is said, however, that
                    Tintoret at one time painted a ceiling in Pietro’s house; at another time, being
                    invited to do his portrait, he attended, and at once proceeded to take his
                    sitter’s measure with a pistol (or else a stiletto), as a significant hint that
                    he was not exactly the man to be trifled with. The painter having now executed
                    the four works in the Scuola di S. Marco, his straits and obscure endurances
                    were over. He married Faustina de’ Vescovi, daughter of a Venetian nobleman. She
                    appears to have been a careful housewife, and one who both would and could have
                    her way with her not too tractable husband. Faustina bore him several children,
                    probably two sons and five daughters.</p>
                <p>The next conspicuous event in the professional life of Tintoret is his enormous
                    labour and profuse self-development on the walls and ceilings of the Scuola di
                    S. Rocco, a building which may now almost be regarded as a shrine reared by
                    Robusti to his own genius. The building had been begun in 1525 by the Lombardi,
                    and was very deficient in light, so as to be particularly ill-suited for any
                    great scheme of pictorial adornment. The painting of its interior was commenced
                    in 1560. In that year five principal painters, including Tintoret and Paul
                    Veronese, were invited to send in trial-designs for the centre-piece in the
                    smaller hall, named Saia dell’ Albergo, the subject being S. Rocco received into
                    Heaven. Tintoret produced not a sketch but a picture, and got it inserted into
                    its oval. The competitors remonstrated, not unnaturally; but the artist, who
                    knew how to play his own game, made a free gift of the picture to the saint,
                    and, as a bye-law of the foundation prohibited the rejection of any gift, it was
                    retained <hi rend="italic">in situ,—</hi> Tintoret furnishing gratis the other
                    decorations of the same ceiling. In 1565 he resumed work at the scuola, painting
                    the magnificent Crucifixion, for which a sum of 250 ducats was paid. In 1576 he
                    presented gratis another centre-piece,—that for the ceiling of the great hall,
                    representing the Plague of Serpents; and in the following year he completed this
                    ceiling with pictures of the Paschal Feast and Moses striking the
                    Rock,—accepting whatever pittance the confraternity chose to pay. Robusti next
                    launched out into the painting of the entire scuola and of the adjacent church
                    of S. Rocco. He offered in November 1577 to execute the works at the rate of 100
                    ducats per annum, three pictures being due in each year. This proposal was
                    accepted and was punctually fulfilled, the painter’s death alone preventing the
                    execution of some of the ceiling-subjects. The whole sum paid for the scuola
                    throughout was 2447 ducats. Disregarding some minor performances, the scuola and
                    church contain fifty-two memorable paintings, which may be described as vast
                    suggestive sketches, with the mastery, but not the deliberate precision, of
                    finished pictures, and adapted for being <pb break="no"

                    Visitation, the Adoration of the Magi, the Massacre of the Innocents, the Agony
                    in the Garden, Christ before Pilate, Christ carrying His Cross, and (this alone
                    having been marred by restoration) the Assumption of the Virgin are leading
                    examples in the scuola; in the church, Christ curing the Paralytic.</p>
                <p>It was probably in 1560, the same year when he began working in the Scuola di S.
                    Rocco, that Tintoret commenced also his numerous paintings in the ducal palace;
                    he then executed there a portrait of the doge, Girolamo Priuli. Other works
                    which were destroyed in the great fire of 1577 succeeded,—the Excommunication of
                    Frederick Barbarossa by Pope Alexander III. and the Victory of Lepanto. After
                    the fire Tintoret started afresh, Paul Veronese being his colleague; their works
                    have for the most part been disastrously and disgracefully retouched of late
                    years, and some of the finest monuments of pictorial power ever produced are
                    thus degraded to comparative unimportance. In the Saia dello Scrutinio Robusti
                    painted the Capture of Zara from the Hungarians in 1346 amid a hurricane of
                    missiles; in the hall of the senate, Venice, Queen of the Sea; in the hall of
                    the college, the Espousal of St Catherine to Jesus; in the Saia delΓ
                    Anticollegio, four extraordinary masterpieces—Bacchus, with Ariadne crowned by
                    Venus, the Three Graces and Mercury, Minerva discarding Mars, and the Forge of
                    Vulcan—which were painted for fifty ducats each, besides materials, towards
                    1578; in the Antichiesetta, St George and St Nicholas, with St Margaret (the
                    female figure is sometimes termed the princess whom St George rescued from the
                    dragon), and St Jerome and St Andrew; in the hall of the great council, nine
                    large compositions, chiefly battle-pieces. We here reach the crowning production
                    of Robusti’s life, the last picture of any considerable importance which he
                    executed, the vast Paradise, in size 74 feet by 30, reputed to be the largest
                    painting ever done upon canvas. It is a work so stupendous in scale, so colossal
                    in the sweep of its power, so reckless of ordinary standards of conception or
                    method, so pure an inspiration of a soul burning with passionate visual
                    imagining, and a hand magical to work in shape and colour, that it has defied
                    the connoisseurship of three centuries, and has generally (though not with its
                    first Venetian contemporaries) passed for an eccentric failure; while to a few
                    eyes (including those of the present writer) it seems to be so transcendent a
                    monument of human faculty applied to the art pictorial as not to be viewed
                    without awe nor thought of without amazement. While the commission for this huge
                    work was yet pending and unassigned Robusti was wont to tell the senators that
                    he had prayed to God that he might be commissioned for it, so that paradise
                    itself might perchance be his recompense after death. Upon eventually receiving
                    the commission in 1588 he set up his canvas in the Scuola della Misericordia and
                    worked indefatigably at the task, making many alterations and doing various
                    heads and costumes direct from nature. When the picture had been brought well
                    forward he took it to its proper place and there finished it, assisted by his
                    son Domenico for details of drapery, &lt;fec. All Venice applauded the superb
                    achievement, which has in more recent times suffered from neglect, but
                    fortunately hardly at all from restoration. Robusti was asked to name his own
                    price, but this he left to the authorities. They tendered a handsome amount;
                    Robusti is said to have abated something from it, which is even a more curious
                    instance of ungreediness for pelf than earlier cases which we have cited where
                    he worked for nothing at all.</p>
                <p>After the completion of the Paradise Robusti rested for a while, and he never
                    undertook any other work of importance, though there is no reason to suppose
                    that his energies were exhausted, had his days been a little prolonged. He was
                    seized with an attack in the stomach, complicated with fever, which prevented
                    him from sleeping and almost from eating for a fortnight, and on 3lst May 1594
                    he died. A contemporary record states his age to have been seventy-five years
                    and fifteen days. If this is accurate, 16th May 1519 must have been the day of
                    his birth; but we prefer the authority of the register of deaths in S.
                    Marciliano, which states that Tintoret died of fever, aged seventy-five years,
                    eight months, and fifteen days,— thus bringing us to l6th September 1518 as the
                    true date of his birth. He was buried in the church of S. Maria dell’ Orto by
                    the side of his favourite daughter Marietta, who had died in 1590, aged thirty;
                    there is a well-known tradition that as she lay dead the heart-stricken father
                    painted her portrait. Marietta had herself been a portrait-painter of
                    considerable skill, as well as a musician, vocal and instrumental; but few of
                    her works are now traceable. It is said that up to the age of fifteen she used
                    to accompany and assist her father at his work, dressed as a boy; eventually she
                    married a jeweller, Mario Augusta. In 1866 the grave of the Vescovi and Robusti
                    was opened, and the remains of nine members of the joint families were found in
                    it; a different locality, the chapel on the right of the choir, was then
                    assigned to the grave. Tintoret painted his own portrait at least twice, one of
                    the heads being in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence and the other, done when his
                    age was advanced, in the Louvre. It is a very serious face, somewhat blunt and
                    rugged, but yet refined without the varnish of elegance—concentrated and
                    resolute, its native ardours of frankness and energy welded down into lifelong
                    laboriousness, with a pent look as of smouldering fire. The eyes are large,
                    dark, and round; the grizzled hair close and compact. The face has been held to
                    bear some resemblance to that of Michelangelo, but this does not go very far.
                    Robusti appears also as one of the figures in the two vast pictures by Paul
                    Veronese,—the Marriage in Cana and the Feast in the House of Levi.</p>
                <p>Audacious and intrepid, though not constantly correct, as a draughtsman,
                    majestically great as a colourist, prodigious as an executant, Tintoret was as
                    absolute a type of the born painter as the history of art registers or enables
                    us to conceive. Whatever he did was imaginative—sometimes beautiful and suave
                    (and he was eminently capable of painting a lovely female countenance or an
                    heroic man), often imposing and romantic, fully as often turbulent and reckless,
                    sometimes trivial, never unpainter-like or prosaic. When he chose—which was not
                    always—he painted his entire personages characteristically; but, like the other
                    highest masters of Venice, he conceded and attended little to the expression of
                    his faces as evincing incidental emotion. In several of his works —as especially
                    the great Crucifixion in S. Rocco—there is powerful central thought, as well as
                    inventive detail; but his imagination is always concrete: it is essentially that
                    of a painter to whom the means of art—the form, colour, chiaroscuro,
                    manipulation, scale, distribution—are the typical and necessitated, realities.
                    What he imagines is always a visual integer, a picture—never a treatise, however
                    thoughtfully planned or ingeniously detailed. Something that one could see—that
                    is his ideal, not something that one could narrate, still less that one could
                    deduce and demonstrate. In his treatment of action or gesture the most constant
                    peculiarity is the sway and swerve of his figures: they bend like saplings or
                    rock like forest - boughs in a gale; stiffness or immobility was entirely
                    foreign to his style, which has therefore little of the monumental or severe
                    character. Perhaps he felt that there was no other way for combining “the colour
                    of Titian with the design of Michelangelo.” The knitted strength and the
                    transcendent fervour of energy of the supreme Florentine might to some extent bo
                    emulated; but, if they were to be united with the glowing fusion of hue of the
                    supreme Venetian, this could only be attained by a process of relaxing the
                    excessive tension and modifying muscular into elastic force. In this respect he
                    was a decided innovator; but he had many imitators,—comparatively feeble, if we
                    except Paul Veronese.</p>
                <p>Tintoret scarcely ever travelled out of Venice. He loved all the arts, played in
                    youth the lute and various instruments, some of <pb break="no"

                    theatrical costumes and properties, was versed in mechanics and mechanical
                    devices, and was a very agreeable, companion. For the sake of his work he lived
                    in a most retired fashion, and even when not painting was wont to remain in his
                    working room surrounded by casts. Here he hardly admitted any, even intimate
                    friends, and he kept his modes of work secret, save as regards his assistants.
                    He abounded in pleasant witty sayings whether to great personages or to others,
                    but no smile hovered on his lips. Out of doors his wife made him wear the robe
                    of a Venetian citizen; if it rained she tried to indue him with an outer
                    garment, but this he resisted. She would also when he left the house wrap up
                    money for him in a handkerchief, and on his return expected an account of it;
                    Tintoret’s accustomed reply was that he had spent it in alms to the poor or to
                    prisoners. In 1574 he obtained the reversion of the first vacant broker’s patent
                    in a fondaco, with power to bequeath it,—an advantage granted from time to time
                    to pre-eminent painters. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed “11
                    Furioso.” An agreement is extant showing that he undertook to finish in two
                    months two historical pictures each containing twenty figures, seven being
                    portraits. The number of his portraits is enormous; their merit is unequal, but
                    the really fine ones cannot be surpassed. Sebastian del Piombo remarked that
                    Robusti could paint in two days as much as himself in two years; Annibale
                    Caracci that Tintoret was in many pictures equal to Titian, in others inferior
                    to Tintoret. This was the general opinion of the Venetians, who said that he had
                    three pencils—one of gold, the second of silver, and the third of iron. The only
                    pictures (if we except his own portrait) on which he inscribed his name are the
                    Miracle of Cana in the church of the Salute (painted originally for the
                    brotherhood of the Crociferi), the Miracle of the Slave, and the Crucifixion in
                    the Scuola di S. Rocco; the last was engraved in 1589 by Agostino Caracci.
                    Generally he painted at once on to the canvas without any preliminary. Some of
                    his dicta on art have been recorded as follows by Ridolfi :—“the art of painting
                    remains increasingly difficult”; “painters in youth should adhere to the best
                    masters, these bemg Michelangelo and Titian, and should be strict in
                    representing the natural forms”; “the first glance at a picture is the crucial
                    one”; “black and white, as developing form, are the best of colours”; “drawing
                    is the foundation of a painter’s work, but drawing from life in the nude should
                    only be essayed by well-practised men, as the real is often wanting in
                    beauty.”</p>
                <p>Of pupils Robusti had very few; his two sons and Martin de Vos of Antwerp were
                    among them. Domenico Robusti (1562-1637), whom we have already had occasion to
                    mention, frequently assisted his father in the groundwork of great pictures. He
                    himself painted a multitude of works, many of them on a very large scale; they
                    would at best be mediocre, and, coming from the son of Tintoret, are
                    exasperating; still, he must be regarded as a considerable sort of pictorial
                    practitioner in his way.</p>
                <p>We conclude by naming a few of the more striking of Tintoret’s very numerous
                    works not already specified in the course of the article. In Venice—(S. Giorgio
                    Maggiore), a series of his later works, the Gathering of the Manna, Last Supper,
                    Descent from the Cross, Resurrection, Martyrdom of St Stephen, Coronation of the
                    Virgin, Martyrdom of St Damian; (S. Francesco della Vigna) the Entombment; (the
                    Frari) the Massacre of the Innocents; (S. Cassiano) a Crucifixion, the figures
                    seen from behind along the hill slope; (St Mark’s) a mosaic of the Baptism of
                    Christ,—the oil-painting of this composition is in Verona. In Milan (the Brera),
                    St Helena and other saints. In Florence (Pitti Gallery), Venus, Vulcan, and
                    Cupid. In Cologne ( Wallraff-Richarts Museum), Ovid and Corinna. In Augsburg
                    (the town-hall), some historical pictures, which biographers and tourists alike
                    have unaccountably neglected,—one of the siege of a fortified town is
                    astonishingly fine. In England—(Hampton Court), Esther and Ahasuerus, and the
                    Nine Muses; (the National Gallery) Christ washing Peter’s Feet, a grand piece of
                    colour and execution, not greatly interesting in other respects, also a spirited
                    smallish work, St George and the Dragon.</p>
                <p>The writer who has done by far the most to establish the fame of Tintoret at the
                    height which it ought to occupy is Professor Ruskin in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stones of Venice</hi> and other books; the depth and scope of the master’s
                    power had never before been adequately brought out, although his extraordinarily
                    and somewhat arbitrarily used executive gift was acknowledged. Ridolfi <hi
                    rend="italic">(Meraviglie dell' Art g</hi> gives interesting personal details;
                    the article by Dr Janitschek in <hi rend="italic">Kunst und Künstler</hi> (1876)
                    is a solid account. For an English reader the most handy narrative is that of Mr
                    W. R. Osler <hi rend="italic">(Tintoretto,</hi> 1879), in the series entitled
                    “The Great Artists.” Here the biographical facts are clearly presented; the
                    aesthetic criticism is enthusiastic but not perspicuous. (W. M. R.)</p>
