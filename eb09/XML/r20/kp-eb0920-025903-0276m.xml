                    besides the small British division of Ajmere, which is situated almost in the
                    centre 'of the province. These territories lie between 23° and 30° N. lat. and
                    between 69 30' and 78° 15' E. long., and their combined area is approximately
                    estimated at 130,000 square miles. Rfijputdna extends from the province of Sind
                    on the west to the North-Western Provinces on the east, skirting the Bombay
                    presidency on the south, and stretching to the Punjab on the north. It is
                    traversed from south-west to north-east by the Rajputdna State Railway, and from
                    the south to that railway at Ajmere by the Malwa Railway from Ivhandwa on the
                    Great Indian Peninsula line through Indore. The country is divided by the
                    Aravalli Mountains into two unequal parts (of which the north-western is much
                    the "larger), and consists to a great extent of sandy, arid, and unproductive
                    wastes, but it improves gradually to comparatively habitable and fertile tracts
                    towards the north-east. This division includes the Thur or great sandy desert of
                    northern India, covered everywhere by long parallel dunes, varying from 50 to
                    100 <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n277/mode/1up"

                    destitute of vegetation. The south-eastern division is considerably more
                    elevated and fertile, is diversified in character, and contains extensive
                    hill-ranges and long stretches of rocky wold and woodland; it is watered by the
                    drainage of the VindhyAs, carried north-east by the Chambal and Banas rivers. In
                    many parts there are wide vales, fertile plateaus, and great stretches of
                    excellent soil, with forests and artificial lakes; but even in this division the
                    surface, for the most part, is stony, rugged, under jungle, and infertile,
                    except close to the river banks.</p>
                <p>The chief rivers of Rajputana are the Loni, the Chambal, and the Banas. The first
                    of these, the only river of any consequence in the north-western division, flows
                    for 200 miles from the Pukar valley, close to Ajmere, to the Runn of Cutch. In
                    the southeastern division the river system is important. The Chambal is by far
                    the largest river in Rajputana, through which it flows for about one-third of
                    its course, while it forms its boundary for another third. The source of the
                    river is in the highlands of the Vindhyas, upwards of 2000 feet above the sea;
                    it enters the province at Chaurasgarh in Mewar and soon becomes a considerable
                    stream, collecting in its course the waters of other rivers, and finally
                    discharging itself into the Jumna after a course of 560 miles. Next in
                    importance ranks the Banas, which rises in the south-west near Kankraoli in
                    Mewar. It collects nearly all the drainage of the Mewar plateau with that of the
                    eastern slopes and hill-tracts of the Aravallis, and joins the Chambal a little
                    beyond the northeastern extremity of the Bundi state, after a course of about
                    300 miles. Other rivers are the W. Banas and the Sabarmati, which rise among the
                    south-west hills of Mewar and take a south-westerly course. The river Mahi,
                    which passes through the states of Partab-garh and Banswara, receiving the Som,
                    drains the south-west corner of Rajputana through Gujrat into the gulfs of Cutch
                    and Cambay. Rajputana possesses no natural freshwater lakes, but there are
                    several important artificial lakes, all of which have been constructed with the
                    object of storing water. The only basin of any extent is the Sambhar salt lake,
                    of about 50 miles in circuit.</p>
                <p>Geologically considered the country may be divided into three regions,—a central,
                    and the largest, comprising the whole width of the Aravalli system, formed of
                    very old sub-metamorphic and gneissic rocks; an eastern region, with sharply
                    defined boundary, along which the most ancient formations are abruptly replaced
                    by the great basin of the Vindhyan strata, or are overlaid by the still more
                    extensive spread of the Deccan trap, forming the plateau of Malwa; and a western
                    region, of very ill-defined margin, in which, besides some rocks of undetermined
                    age, it is more or less known or suspected that Tertiary and Secondary strata
                    stretch across from Sind, beneath the sands of the desert, towards the flanks of
                    the Aravallis. Rajputana produces a variety of metals. Ore of cobalt is obtained
                    in no other locality in India, and although zinc blend has been found elsewhere
                    it is known to have been extracted only in this province. Copper and lead are
                    found in several parts of the Aravalli range and of the minor ridges in Ulwur
                    and Shekha-wati, and iron ores abound in several states. Alum and blue vitriol
                    (sulphate of copper) are manufactured from decomposed schists at Khetri in
                    Shekhawati. Good building materials are obtained from many of the rocks of the
                    country, amongst which the Raialo limestone (a fine-grained crystalline marble)
                    and the Jaisalmir (Jeysulmere) limestone stand pre-eminent.</p>
                <p>Rajputana is of great archseologic interest, and possesses some fine religious
                    buildings in ruins and others in excellent preservation. Amongst the latter are
                    the mosque at Ajmere and the temples on Abu. But the finest and most
                    characteristic features of architecture in the country are shown in the forts
                    and palaces of the chiefs and in their cenotaphs.</p>
                <p>Herds of camels, horses, and sheep are found wherever there is pasturage, and in
                    the desert and in the southern part of the country wild asses, nylghau, and
                    antelopes, besides lions, leopards, tigers, wolves, hyienas, jackals, and foxes,
                    are met with.</p>
                <p>The climate throughout Rajputana is very dry and hot during summer; while in the
                    winter it is much colder in the north than in the lower districts, with hard
                    frost and ice on the Bikanir borders. The rainfall is very unequally
                    distributed: in the western part, which comes near to the limits of the rainless
                    region of Asia, it is very scanty, and scarcely averages more than 5 inches; in
                    the south-west the fall is more copious, sometimes exceeding 100 inches at Abu;
                    but, except in the south-west highlands of the Aravallis, rain is most abundant
                    in the south-east. Notwithstanding all its drawbacks, Rajputana is reckoned one
                    of the healthiest countries in India, at least for the native inhabitants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population</hi> .—The census of 1881, which was the first
                    general enumeration of population in Rajputana since England’s connexion with
                    India, gave a total number (including Ajmere division) of 10,729,114. Of these
                    166,343 were Bhils; but no accurate census could be taken of these people owing
                    to their repugnance to bo counted. Exclusive of Bhils, the population numbered
                    10,562,771 (5,710,337 males, 4,852,434 females). The following statement gives
                    the area and population of the several states and of the British division of
                    Ajmere :—</p>

                <p>The great mass of the people are Hindus, numbering in 1881 (excluding Bhils)
                    9,215,272, as against 919,556 Mohammedans and 3519 Christians. Among, the Hindus
                    the paucity of Rajputs is remarkable. It is commonly supposed that, because
                    nearly the whole country is ruled by Rajputs, therefore the population consists
                    mainly of Rajput tribes; but these are merely the dominant race, and the
                    territory is called Rajputana because it is politically possessed by Rajputs.
                    The whole number of this race is roughly estimated at 700,000, and nowhere do
                    they form a majority of the whole population in a state; but they are strongest,
                    numerically, in the northern states and in Mewar. By rigid precedence the
                    Brahmans occupy the first rank; they are numerous and influential, and with them
                    may be classed the peculiar and important caste of Charans or Bhats, the keepers
                    of secular tradition and of the genealogies. Next come the mercantile castes,
                    mostly belonging to the Jaina sect of Hinduism; these are followed by the
                    powerful cultivating tribes, such as the Jats and Gujars, and then come the
                    non-Hindu or so-called aboriginal tribes, chief of whom are the Minas, Bhils,
                    and Mhairs.</p>
                <p>The mass of the people are occupied in agriculture. In the large towns banking
                    and commerce flourish to a degree beyond what would be expected for so backward
                    a country. In the north the staple products for export are salt, grain, wool,
                    and cotton, in the south opium and cotton; while the imports consist of sugar,
                    hardware, and piece goods. Rajputana is very poor in industrial production. The
                    principal manufactures are salt, cotton, and woollen goods, carvings in ivory,
                    and working in metals, &amp;c., all of which handicrafts are chiefly carried on
                    in the eastern states. The system of agriculture is very simple; in the country
                    west of the Aravallis only one crop is raised in the year, while in other parts
                    south and east of the Aravallis two crops are raised annually, and various kinds
                    of cereals, pulses, and fibres are grown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History</hi> .—Only faint outlines can be traced of the
                    condition of Rajputana previous to the invasion of Upper India by the
                    Mohammedans, and these indicate that the country was subject for the most part
                    to two or three very powerful tribal dynasties. Chief of these were the
                    Ralitors, who ruled at Kanauj; the Cliauhans of Ajmere; the Solankhyas of
                    Anhilwara, in Gujrat; the Gehlots with the Sesodia sept, still in Mewar or
                    Udaipur; and the Kachwaha clan, still in Jaipur. These tribal dynasties of
                    Rajputs were gradually supplanted by the Moslem invaders of the 11th century and
                    weakened by internal feuds. At the beginning of the 16th century the Rajput
                    power began to revive, but only to be overthrown by Baber at Fatelipur Sikri in
                    1527. The clans were finally either conquered, overawed, or conciliated by
                    Akbar—all except the distant Sesodia clan, which, however, submitted to Jahangir
                    in 1616. From Akbar’s accession to Aurangzeb’s death, a period of 151 years, the
                    mogul was India’s master. Aurangzeb’s death and the invasion of Nadir Shah led
                    to a triple alliance among the three leading chiefs, which internal jealousy so
                    weakened that the Mahrattas, having been called in by the Rahtors to aid them,
                    took possession of Ajmere about 1756; thenceforward Rajputana became involved in
                    the general disorganization of India. By 1803 nearly the whole of Rajputana had
                    been virtually subdued by the Mahrattas. The victories of Generals Wellesley and
                    Lake, however, saved the Rajputs; but on Wellington’s departure from India the
                    floodgates of anarchy were reopened for ten years. On the outbreak of the
                    Pindari War in 1817 the British Government offered its protection. The Pindaris
                    were put down, Amir Khan submitting and signing a treaty which constituted him
                    the first ruler of the existing state of Tonk. By the end of 1818 similar
                    treaties had been executed by the other Rajput states with the paramount power.
                    Sindhia gave up the district of Ajmere to the British, and the pressure of the
                    great Mahratta powers upon Rajputana was permanently withdrawn. Since then the
                    political history of Rajputana has been comparatively uneventful. The great
                    storm of the mutinies of 1857, though dangerous while it lasted, was <pb

                    been held by the mutineers of that state, in March 1858, marked the extinction
                    of armed rebellion in the province. (W. T. R.)</p>
