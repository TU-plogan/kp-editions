                <p>THE continued existence of an amoeba in a pool of water, or of a white blood-cell
                    in the <hi rend="italic">liquor sanguinis,</hi> depends upon a continual
                    interchange of substances between the organism and the surrounding medium. The
                    substances in question pass from the medium into the organism in a certain
                    chemical form; they pass from the organism into the surrounding medium with
                    their chemical form modified. Regarding merely the initial and final stages of
                    this reconstitution of chemical form, we may speak of it as being of the nature
                    of an oxidation. This view does not profess to be comprehensive; nevertheless,
                    it is true that the metabolic and anabolic processes of cells, taken as a whole,
                    resemble combustion at least to this extent that oxygen and oxidizable carbon
                    take part in them, and that carbon dioxide results from them. Partly as a matter
                    of tradition, and partly as a matter of convenience, physiologists have
                    described the introduction of oxygen into the organism and the emission of
                    carbon dioxide from it as the comρlemental portions of one process of <hi
                    rend="italic">respiration.</hi> Although such a combined consideration is not
                    strictly philosophical, inasmuch as it leaves out of view the introduction of
                    the carbon into the organism, yet it is extremely convenient because the two
                    processes referred to do, in all classes of the animal kingdom from the highest
                    to the lowest, involve the same organs and tissues in their performance.
                    Respiration may therefore be defined as the aggregate of those processes which
                    are concerned in the introduction of oxygen into the system and the escape of
                    carbon dioxide from it.</p>
                <p>Respiration in such an organism as an amoeba is extremely simple. The medium
                    surrounding it contains a practically unlimited supply of oxygen, and is so vast
                    that the carbon dioxide put out into the medium is quickly removed from the
                    neighbourhood of the organism. The <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0492-0475"/>interchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes
                    place at the surface of the organism, so far as we know, continuously. In the
                    higher animals, constituted as they are of a vast number of structural units
                    accurately packed together, each resembling more or less in its physiological
                    instincts the unicellular amoeba, respiration presents a much more intricate
                    problem. The fine interstices which exist between the structural elements do
                    indeed contain a small quantity of a fluid medium which serves the function of
                    the water bathing the amoeba; but the store of oxygen in the medium would
                    speedily become exhausted, and the emitted carbon dioxide would quickly
                    accumulate to a dangerous degree, if the medium were not continually restored to
                    its original purity. This revival is effected by the circulating blood which is
                    brought by its capillaries into the neighbourhood of the remotest cells of the
                    body. But even the mass of the blood is small compared with that of the cells it
                    nourishes; unless it be itself purified and restored in turn the interstitial
                    juices which depend upon it for their purification must soon fail to support the
                    respiration of the cells. Such restoration of the blood takes place in certain
                    organs called lungs or gills, where the blood acquires a fresh store of oxygen
                    and parts with its excess of carbon dioxide.</p>
                <p>Respiration in the higher animals may therefore be divided into (1) internal
                    respiration, or the interchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the cells
                    of the body and the fluid drenching them, and (2) external respiration, or the
                    gaseous interchange taking place in the special respiratory organs (lungs,
                    gills). The first is really a part of Nutrition <hi rend="italic">(g.v.}</hi>;
                    the second, or respiration proper, is the subject of the present article.</p>
                <p>It will be evident on reflection that the process of respiration naturally falls
                    to be described under two divisions, the first of which is concerned with the
                    <hi rend="italic">movements</hi> of the chest in inspiration and expiration and
                    the manner in which they are brought about, and the second with the <hi

                    the air in the lungs.</p>

                    >Structure of the Organs of Respiration.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to understand the movements it is necessary first to know the structure
                    of the air passages and thorax.</p>
                <p>Anatomy of the Air Passages.—The essential organs of respiration consist of an
                    air tube called the trachea, communicating at its upper end with the mouth and
                    bifurcating below into two bronchi, one on the right hand and one on the left.
                    Each bronchus divides and subdivides, diminishing in calibre at every division
                    until a diameter of about 1 mm. is attained; such a diminutive bronchial tube is
                    called a bronchiole. Every bronchiole is a cylindrical tube which divides
                    dichotomously and rapidly several times, and finally terminates in irregular
                    alveolar passages. The sides of the alveolar passages, and of the subdividing
                    bronchioles in less abundance, arc studded with hemispherical dilatations called
                    air cells or alveoli. The terminal portion of an alveolar passage, with its air
                    cells, is sometimes spoken of as an iηfundibιdnιm—a term we may wisely forget at
                    once, since it points to a distinction where no essential difference exists. The
                    alveoli cluster in great abundance about the alveolar passages, and, although we
                    have spoken of them as hemispherical, they are in reality made polygonal by
                    mutual compression. They are surrounded by connective tissue of a very elastic
                    quality, which gives to their delicate walls a firm support, and is so disposed
                    about them that all the alveoli derived from one bronchiole are more closely
                    knit together than they are bound to those of a neighbouring bronchiole; hence
                    we may speak of a bronchiole with the assemblage of its members as a lobule, a
                    term of peculiar importance since it will be evident on reflection that each
                    lobule contains all the essential parts of a lung—is in fact a lung in
                    miniature. By connecting tissue the lobules are compacted to form lobes, of
                    which two on the left side and three on the right go to make up the respective
                    lungs.</p>
                <p>The trachea and larger bronchi are composed of a series of superposed crescentic
                    pieces or imperfect rings of hyaline cartilage which with a tough fibrous and
                    elastic membrane form a tube; in the trachea the incomplete cartilage-rings are
                    so placed that their hiatuses are at the back. In the bronchial tubes,
                    especially the smaller ones', the cartilages are fewer, and less regular in
                    shape, being in fact mere nodules in the bronchial walls. In the bronchioles
                    there is no cartilage. There is an external fibrous and elastic layer investing
                    the trachea and bronchi; and stretching from tip to tip of the imperfect
                    cartilaginous lings are bands of involuntary muscular fibres. The function of
                    the cartilages is doubtless to maintain the patency of the primary air passages
                    by resisting external compression; that of the muscular fibres is probably to
                    resist unusual distension of the tubes, as in the strain of coughing, &amp;c.
                    The mucous membrane of the trachea consists of a mτιcosa of fine connective
                    tissue, mixed with some tissue of the adenoid sort, and with elastic fibres,
                    disposed in longitudinal bundles. Beneath the mucosa is the slight submucosa,
                    which supports large blood-vessels, lymphatics, and mucous glands, and unites
                    the mucosa to the cartilages. Above the mucosa lies the basement membrane,
                    supporting a stratified epithelium, the upper cells of which are columnar and
                    ciliated and may include amongst them the well-known goblet-cells, while the
                    deeper layers are squamous and capable of regenerating the upper stratum if this
                    be lost. The epithelium is pierced by the ducts of glands. Blood-capillaries,
                    lymphatics, and fine nerves have all been shown to exist in the tracheal
                    mucosa.</p>
                <p>The same structural elements as are found in the trachea continue to be found in
                    all the series of bronchial tubes above 1 mm. in diameter; they are arranged in
                    much the same order, save that the muscular fibres are relatively increased and
                    that they surround the whole tube (within the zone occupied by the cartilaginous
                    nodules) somewhat like the tunica media of an artery. The mucous membrane is
                    still ciliated, but its surface-cells are squat. On the other hand the
                    bronchioles and alveolar passages have a different structure: cartilage and
                    glands are no longer found; the epithelium is flat and ciliated; and the
                    muscular fibres gradually thin out on the walls of the alveolar passages.</p>
                <p>It is, however, the air-cells which have most interest for the physiologist. They
                    are about rτ⅛th inch in diameter, and their walls are made up of a delicate
                    film-like basement membrane, on tho outside of which are numerous elastic
                    fibres. Elastic connective tissue intervenes between neighbouring alveoli, and
                    mingled with it are not a few involuntary muscular fibres. The alveoli are lined
                    with flat cells in a single layer, some cells being large, clear, and polygonal,
                    while others are small and granular, and are found singly or in groups of two or
                    three inserted between the edges of the clear sort. The cells are united
                    together by cement in which fine holes are sometimes to be seen; through these
                    holes, or pscudo-stomata, migratory leucocytes can make their way into and out
                    of the alveoli.</p>
                <p>The blood-vessels of the lung are of two sorts, nutritive and functional, i.e.,
                    concerned in the function of the organs. The former are called bronchial, and
                    arise from the aorta or intercostal arteries. They serve to nourish the tissues
                    of the lung, and the blood they contain finds its way, in part into the
                    bronchial veins and thence into the vena azygos, intercostal vein, or superior
                    vena cava, and in part into veins of the functional system. The latter system of
                    vessels consists of the pulmonary arteries, which arise in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0493-0476"/>right ventricle and run through the lung substance
                    pari passu with the bronchial tubes to the lobules. Here they branch into a
                    dense network of capillaries which spread over the outside of the alveoli,
                    enmeshing them so tightly ns to indent their walls. From the capillaries the
                    blood flows into pulmonary venules which run together to form the large
                    pulmonary veins, which open into the left auricle. The pulmonary venules may
                    anastomose freely, but the arteries never do so. The veins possess no
                    valves.</p>
                <p>The lymphatic vessels of the lung abound in all parts, but are usually described
                    as having a threefold distribution,—(a) in the layer of tissue beneath the
                    membrane investing the whole lung, (fi) in the perivascular tissue, and (c) in
                    the peribronchial tissue. When fine carbon particles are introduced into the
                    alveoli of the lung they find their way with the greatest ease into the
                    interalveolar tissues, and finally come to lie in the three positions just
                    referred to, as may be demonstrated in the lung of any coal miner. The
                    lymphatics of the membrane investing the lung communicate with the free surface
                    of that membrane by means of openings not unlike the stomata of leaves.</p>
                <p>The lungs, with the heart and great vessels, are the chief organs contained in
                    the thorax, or that division of the great body cavity which lies above the
                    diaphragm. Each lung is invested with a membrane called pleura, which plays a
                    most important part in the mechanism of respiration.</p>
                <p>The Pleural Membrane.—Let us imagine a bag shaped like an hour glass, and let us
                    suppose one half of this bag to be packed up small and pushed through the
                    constricted portion of the hour glass into the interior of the other half. We
                    should then have a bag shaped like one half of an hour glass but provided with
                    double walls —a more or less globular double-walled bag with a narrow opening
                    into it. If further we imagine the interior of this double-walled bag (no&lt;
                    the interior of the hour glass) to be entirely filled with one lung, we shall
                    have an exact conception of the relationship of the lung to the pleura. The lung
                    so covered is placed in its proper half of the thorax, which in circumstances of
                    health it accurately fills. The outer layer of the double-walled bag is closely
                    glued to the inner wall of the thorax. The inner layer is as firmly adherent to
                    the surface of the lung. The space between the double walls, i.e., the interior
                    of the original hour glass, is called the pleural cavity; it is vacuous in
                    health, being moistened by a mere trace of fluid. The substance of the pleural
                    membrane is mainly connective tissue; and the interior of the pleural cavity is
                    lined with a single layer of flat epithelial cells exhibiting the stomata
                    already referred to.</p>
                <p>The Thorax.—The chest or thorax is formed by the dorsal section of the spinal
                    column behind, with the ribs that spring from it on each side, and the sternum,
                    which lies between the ends of the ribs, in front. The dorsal spine is bowed, so
                    that its concavity looks forward. The ribs, speaking generally, are bowed with
                    their concavity turned towards the interior of the chest; and if we consider the
                    plane of each rib, f.e., that plane in which the arched rib would
                    (approximately) lie flat, we shall find that it declines from the horizontal in
                    a twofold manner—first the rib-plane slopes from behind downwards and forwards,
                    and secondly it slopes on each side from the mesial plane of the body downwards
                    and outwards. The ribs 1-7 are connected with the sternum by means of pieces of
                    cartilage which really form the anterior portion of each rib arch; these ribs
                    are called “true”; the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs are united by cartilage,
                    not to the sternum, but to the cartilages of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs
                    respectively; these ribs are called ‘ ‘ false”; the eleventh and twelfth ribs
                    are called ‘ ‘ floating” because they are unattached anteriorly. Each rib has a
                    head, by which it is joined to the vertebral bodies constituting the spinal
                    column; a tubercle or shoulder at a little distance away from the head, by which
                    in all cases, except those of the tenth and eleventh ribs, it is joined to the
                    transverse process of a vertebra; an angle or rough line a little beyond the
                    tubercle, where the rib, rather suddenly, begins to sweep forwards; and a neck,
                    the part intervening between the head and tubercle. The space between the ribs
                    is filled up by two layers of muscles called intercostal—an outer or superficial
                    layer, whose fibres run from above downwards and forwards, and a deeper or
                    internal layer, whose fibres cross those of the former. The outer layer is not
                    found between the costal cartilages in front, nor the inner layer between the
                    costal necks behind. The upper opening of the thorax is filled by the windpipe
                    blood-vessels and other structures passing into or out of the thorax. The floor
                    of the thorax is formed by</p>
                <p>The Diaphragm.—This consists of a thin arched muscular partition, whose fibres
                    spring from the edge of the lower opening of the thorax and converge towards a
                    sheet of tendon in the. centre, which is shaped somewhat like a trefoil leaf. We
                    may group the muscular fibres of the diaphragm according to the quadrant from
                    which they spring :— (1) a vertebral portion, whose fibres stretch down to be
                    attached in two well-marked columns or pillars to the bodies of some of the
                    lumber vertebrae and by tendinous arches to the transverse processes of the
                    first lumbar vertebra and the twelfth rib; (2) a sternal portion, which
                    springsïrom the back of the tip of the sternum, and from the sheath of the
                    rectus abdominis muscles below it; (3) and (4) two lateral or costal portions,
                    which spring from the lower edge of the thorax all round from the tip of the
                    twelfth rib to the junction between the sixth and seventh costal cartilage where
                    the sternal portion begins. The whole diaphragm forms a dome or cu pola
                    projecting so far into the thorax that the lateral vertical portions of the dome
                    lie in close apposition to the walls of the thorax, as is shown in fig. 2. The
                    top of the dome is somewhat flat and the right moiety of the top is on a higher
                    level than the left, the highest point corresponding with the level of the
                    junction of the right fifth rib with the sternum.</p>
                <p>Other Muscles of Respiration.—The ribs are movable in the sense that each rib
                    plane, which has been described as declining in two ways from the horizontal
                    plane, may be made to approach the horizontal, and may afterwards return to its
                    original position. To accomplish these movements various muscles are provided,
                    the exact position of which need not be very fully described. Suffice it to say
                    that in general they arise from the vertebral axis, or from some extra-thoracic
                    fixed point, and take hold of the movable parts of the thorax in such a manner
                    that they can pull them up or pull them down. Such muscles are the following
                    (enumerated without reference to their function as inspiratory or expiratory
                    muscles; particular descriptions of them must be sought in the article Anatomy)
                    :—levatores costarum; the three scalene muscles; the sterno-cleidomastoid;
                    serratus posticus superior; parts of the great erector spinae muscle; possibly
                    serratus magnus; pectoralis minor and major in certain positions of the arm;
                    obli-quus externus; obliquus internus; transversalis abdominis; triangularis
                    sterni; serratus posticus inferior; quadratus lumborum. In addition to these
                    muscles many others may lend occasional aid in respiration by fixing points,
                    such as the scapula, otherwise too freely movable to act as a point cl'appui;
                    such are trapezius, latis-simus dorsi, rhomboidei, and levator anguli
                    scapuli.</p>
                <p>Dimensions of the Thorax.—The circumference of the chest just below the level of
                    the arms is about 34∣ inches in men, and 32 inches in women. At the level of the
                    tip of the sternum it is 32 and 30⅛ inches respectively. The measurement from
                    clavicle to lower edge of thorax varies very much in different cases. The
                    transverse diameter above the nipple is about 10 to 10∣ inches in men, and about
                    9⅛ to 9f inches in women. The antero-posterior diameter, measured from the
                    spines of the vertebrae behind to the surface of the chest in front is in the
                    upper part of the chest about 6⅜ inches, and in the lower 7⅜ inches. The right
                    half of the chest is generally somewhat larger than the left, because its
                    muscles are usually better developed. Instruments .for measuring the exact
                    circumference of the chest at a given level are called cyrtometers; the best of
                    these is a strip of lead which can be laid along the side of the chest from the
                    spine round to the sternum, and which is pliable enough to follow the
                    inequalities of the chest wall, yet resistent enough to keep the shape imparted
                    to it.</p>

                    The commonest are the movements of ordinary quiet respiration, but we must

                    provoked by disease, other movements, viz., forced respiration, such as
                    accompanies strenuous muscular exertion, and those modifications of the
                    respiratory act called coughing, hawking, sneezing, snoring, crying, sighing,
                    laughing, yawning, and hiccoughing.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Normal Respiration.—</hi> If the naked body of a person asleep
                    or in perfect inactivity be carefully watched, it will be found that the
                    anterior and lateral walls of the chest move rhythmically up and down, while air
                    passes into and out of the nostrils (and mouth also if this be open) in
                    correspondence with the movement. If we look more closely we shall find that
                    with every uprising of the chest walls the membranous intercostal portions sink
                    slightly as if sucked in, while at the same time the flexible walls of the
                    abdomen bulge as if protruded by some internal force. If respiration be in the
                    slightest degree hurried these motions become so marked as to escape the
                    attention of no one. The elevation of the chest walls is called <hi
                    rend="italic">inspiration,</hi> their depression <hi rend="italic"
                    >expiration.</hi> Inspiration is slightly shorter than expiration, and usually
                    there is a slight pause or momentary inaction of the chest between expiration
                    and the following inspiration. Apparatuses for measuring the excursion of a
                    given point of the chest wall during respiration are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >thoracometers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stethometers.</hi> Apparatuses for

                    >Frequency of Respiration.—</hi> The frequency of respiration during perfect
                    rest of the body is 16 to 24 per minute, the pulse rate being usually four times
                    the rate of respiration; but the respiratory rhythm varies in various conditions
                    of life. The following are the means of many observations made by Quetelet: at
                    the age of one year the number of respirations is 44 per minute; at 5 years, 26;
                    from 15 to 20 years, 20; from 25 to 30, 16; from 30 to 50, 18 <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> l. Muscular exertion always increases the frequency of
                    respiration. The higher the temperature of the environment the more frequent is
                    the respiration. Bert has shown that with higher atmospheric pressures than the
                    normal the frequency of respiration is diminished while the depth of each
                    inspiration is increased. The frequency of respiration diminishes until dinner
                    time, reaches its maximum within an hour of feeding, and thereafter falls again;
                    if dinner is omitted, no rise of frequency occurs. The respiratory act can be
                    interrupted at any stage, reversed, quickened, slowed, and variously modified at
                    will, so long as respiration is not stopped entirely for more than a short space
                    of time; beyond this limit the will is incapable of suppressing respiration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Depth of Respiration.—</hi> The depth of respiration is
                    measured by the quantity of air inspired or expired in the act; but the deepest
                    expiration possible does not suffice to expel all the air the lungs contain. The
                    following measurements have been ascertained, and are here classified according
                    to the convenient terminology proposed by Hutchinson. (1) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Residual air,</hi> the volume of air remaining in the chest after the most
                    complete expiratory effort, ranges from 100 to 130 cubic inches. (2) <hi

                    volume of air which can be expelled from the chest after an ordinary quiet
                    expiration, measures about 100 cubic inches. (3) <hi rend="italic">Tidal
                    air,</hi> the volume of air taken in and given out at each ordinary respiration
                    may be stated at about 20 cubic inches. (4) <hi rend="italic">Complemental
                    air,</hi> the volume of air that can be forcibly inspired over and above what is
                    taken in at a normal inspiration, ranges from about 100 to 130 cubic inches. By
                    <hi rend="italic">vital capacity,</hi> which once had an exaggerated importance
                    attached to it, is meant the quantity of air which can be expelled from the
                    lungs by the deepest possible expiration after the deepest possible inspiration;
                    it obviously includes the complemental, tidal, and reserve airs, and measures
                    about 230 cubic inches in the Englishman of average height, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> 5 feet 8 inches (Hutchinson). It varies according to the height,
                    body weight, age, sex, position of the body, and condition as to health of the
                    subject of observation.</p>
                <p>Vital capacity is estimated by means of a <hi rend="italic">spirometer,</hi> a
                    graduated gasometer into which air may be blown from the lungs.</p>
                <p>The residual air, which for obvious reasons cannot be actually measured, may be
                    estimated in the following way (Harless, Gréhant). At the end of ordinary
                    expiration, apply the mouth to a mouth-piece communicating with a vessel filled
                    with pure hydrogen, and breathe into and out of this vessel half a dozen
                    times—until, in fact, there is reason to suppose that the air in the lungs at
                    the time of the experiment has become evenly mixed with hydrogen. Then ascertain
                    by analysis the proportion of hydrogen to expired air in the vessel and estimate
                    the amount of the air which the lungs contained by the following formula <hi
                    rend="italic">υ</hi>: V <hi rend="italic">+v≈ρ</hi>: 100; <hi rend="underline"
                    >r(100-</hi> p).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">P</hi> where V=volume of air in the lungs at the time of
                    experiment, <hi rend="italic">υ=</hi> volume of the vessel containing hydrogen,
                    <hi rend="italic">p=</hi> proportion of air to hydrogen in the vessel at the end
                    of the experiment. V, then, is the volume of air in the lungs after an <hi
                    rend="italic">ordinary</hi> expiration; that is, it includes the residual and
                    the reserve air; if we subtract from this the amount of reserve air ascertained
                    by direct measurement, we obtain the 100-130 cubic inches which Hutchinson
                    arrived at by a study of the dead body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Volume of Respiration.—</hi> It is clear that the ventilation
                    of the lungs in ordinary breathing does not merely depend on the quantity of air
                    inspired at each breath, but also on the number of inspirations in a given time.
                    If these two values be multiplied together we get what might be called the <hi
                    rend="italic">volume</hi> of respiration <hi rend="italic"
                    >(^Athmungsgrösse,</hi> Rosenthal) in contradistinction to depth of respiration
                    and frequency of respiration. Various instruments have been devised to measure
                    the volume of respiration, all more or less faulty for the reason that they
                    compel respiration under somewhat abnormal conditions (Rosenthal, Gad, Panum,
                    Hering). From the data obtained we may conclude that the respiratory volume per
                    minute in man is about 366 cubic inches (6000 cubic centim.). In connexion with
                    this subject it may be stated that, after a single ordinary inspiration of
                    hydrogen gas, 6-10 respirations of ordinary air must occur before the expired
                    air ceases to contain some trace of hydrogen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Types of Respiration.—</hi> The visible characters of
                    respiration in man vary considerably according to age and sex. In men, while
                    there is a moderate degree of upheaval of the chest, there is a considerable
                    although not preponderating degree of excursion of the abdominal walls. In women
                    the chest movements are decidedly most marked, the excursion of the abdominal
                    walls being comparatively small. Hence we may distinguish two types of
                    respiration, the costal and the abdominal, according to the preponderance of
                    movement of one or the other part of the body wall. In forced respiration the
                    type is costal in both sexes, and so it is also in sleep. The cause of this
                    difference between men and women has been variously ascribed (a) to constriction
                    of the chest by corsets in women, (δ) to a natural adaptation to the needs of
                    childbearing in women, and (c) to the greater relative flexibility of the ribs
                    in women permitting a wider displacement under the action of he inspiratory
                    muscles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Certain Concomitants of Normal Respiration.—</hi> If the ear be
                    placed against the chest wall during ordinary respiration we can hear with every
                    inspiration a sighing or rustling sound, called “vesicular,” which is probably
                    caused by the expansion of the air vesicles; and with every expiration a sound
                    of a much softer sighing character. In children the inspiratory rustle is
                    sharper and more pronounced than in adults. If a stethoscope be placed over the
                    trachea, bronchi, or larynx, so that the sounds generated there may be
                    separately communicated to the ear, there is heard a harsh to-and-fro sound
                    during inspiration and expiration which has received the name of
                    “bronchial.”</p>
                <p>In healthy breathing the mouth should be closed and the ingoing current should
                    all pass through the nose. When this happens the nostrils become slightly
                    expanded with each inspiration, probably by the action of the M.</p>

                <p>dilatatores naris. In some people this movement is hardly perceptible unless
                    breathing be heavy or laboured. As the air passes at the back of the throat
                    behind the soft palate it causes the velum to wave very gently in the current;
                    this is a purely passive movement. If we look at the glottis or opening into the
                    larynx during respiration, as we may readily do with the help of a small mirror
                    held at the back of the throat, we may notice that the glottis is wide open
                    during inspiration and that it becomes narrower by the approximation of the
                    vocal chords during expiration. This alteration is produced by the action of the
                    laryngeal muscles. Like the movements of the nostril, those of the larynx are
                    almost imperceptible in some people during ordinary breathing, but are very well
                    marked in all during forced respiration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Mechanics of Respiration.</hi></p>
                <p>In the description of the anatomy of the thorax it has been shown that the thorax
                    is practically a closed box entirely filled by the lungs, heart, and other
                    structures contained within it. If we were to freeze a dead body until all its
                    tissues were rigid, and then were to remove a portion of the chest wall, we
                    should observe that every corner of the thorax is accurately filled by some
                    portion or other of its contents. If we were to perform the same operation of
                    removing a part of the chest wall in a body not first frozen we should find, on
                    the other hand, that the contents of the thorax are not by any means in such
                    circumstances bulky enough to fill up the space provided for them. If we were to
                    measure the organs carefully we should find that those which are hollow and
                    whose cavities communicate with the regions outside the thorax are all larger in
                    the frozen corpse than in that which was not frozen. In other words, the organs
                    in the thorax are distended somewhat in order that they may completely fill the
                    chest cavity; and the nature of this curious and important condition may best be
                    illustrated by the simple diagrams, figs. 3 and 4 (from Hermann’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiologie des</hi><hi rend="italic">Menschen),—</hi> where <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> is the trachea, <hi rend="italic">l</hi> the lung, <hi
                    rend="italic">υ</hi> the auricle of the heart, <hi rend="italic">k</hi> the
                    ventricle, <hi rend="italic">i</hi> an intercostal space with its flexible
                    membranous covering. When the interior of the vessel is rendered vacuous by
                    exhaustion through the tube o, the walls of the lungs and heart are expanded
                    until the limits of the containing vessel are accurately filled, while all
                    flexible portions of the walls of the vessel (corresponding to the intercostal
                    membranes and the diaphragm of the thorax) are sucked inwards.</p>
                <p>From this description it follows that the lungs, even when the thorax is most
                    contracted, are constantly overdistended, and that, when the cause of this
                    over-distension is removed, the lungs, being elastic, collapse. It further
                    follows that if the thorax is dilated, the flexible hollow organs it contains
                    must perforce be still more distended, —a distension which in the case of the
                    lungs is followed by an indrawing of air through the trachea in all cases where
                    the trachea is open. Thus, as the act of respiration is primarily a dilatation
                    of the thorax, the part played by the lungs is, as Galen knew, a purely passive
                    one.</p>
                <p>How is dilatation of the thorax effected? It has been pointed out that the
                    rib-planes decline from the horizontal in two directions, viz., from behind
                    forwards, and from the antero-posterior mesial plane outwards; a glance at fig.
                    5 will make this double sloping clear to the reader. It has, moreover, been
                    explained that the diaphragm arches upwards into the thorax in such a manner
                    that the lateral parts of the arch are vertical and in contact with the inner
                    face of the tho racic -walls (see fig. 2). This being the structure of the
                    thorax, the enlargement of its cavity is brought about</p>
                <p>(1) by raising the rib-</p>
                <p>planes until they ap proach the horizontal, and (2) by depressing the diaphragm
                    and making its rounded dome more cone-like in outline. A moment’s consideration
                    will show how these actions en large the boundaries of the thorax. (ct)</p>
                <p>When the postero-an-</p>
                <p>terior slope of the rib-</p>
                <p>planes is diminished by the raising of the anterior ends of the ribs, the whole
                    ster num is thrust upwards and forwards, and the anteroposterior diameter of the
                    thorax is increased, (Z&gt;) When the lateral slope of the rib-planes is
                    diminished by the ribs being moved upwards about an axis passing through their
                    sternal and vertebral extremities, it is evident that the lateral diameter of
                    the thorax must be increased, (c) When the muscular portion of the diaphragm
                    contracts, the curves of its dome-like shape are straightened, the whole
                    diaphragm comes to look more conical on section, and the apposition of its
                    lateral parts to the inner surface of the thorax is destroyed; the two apposed
                    surfaces are drawn apart much as the leaves of a book might be, and a space is
                    formed between them, into which some portion of the lung slips, (c?) When the
                    diaphragm descends it draws with it the whole contents of the thorax; inasmuch
                    as the contents as a whole are conical in shape with the apex upward and are
                    fitted into the conical space of the thoracic cavity, it is clear that the
                    descent of the contents will tend to create a space between them and the
                    thoracic walls; for each stratum of lung, &amp;c., which is adapted to fit a
                    certain level of thorax, will thereby be brought into a lower and (as the thorax
                    is conical) a more spacious level. Hence the descent of the diaphragm causes a
                    much greater enlargement of the thorax than is measured by the mere elongation
                    of the vertical diameter. In this manner the thorax is distended and air is
                    drawn into the lungs. The contraction of the thorax in expiration is brought
                    about by the return of the ribs and diaphragm to their original position of
                    rest.</p>

                <p>We must now explain how the respiratory muscles effect these movements.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">How the Inspiratory Movements are Produced.—The Rib
                    Movements.—</hi> These are caused by the contraction of muscles which are fixed
                    either to the central axis of the body (including under that term the head and
                    vertebral column) or to some point rendered sufficiently stable for the purpose
                    by the action of other adjuvant muscles. Thus the M. levatores costarum arise
                    from the transverse processes of the 7th cervical and eleven upper dorsal
                    vertebrae, and are attached to the ribs below in series; the M. scaleni spring
                    from the cervical vertebrae, and are attached to the anterior parts of the first
                    and second ribs; he M. sterno-cleido-mastoidei arise from the side and back of
                    the skull, and are inserted into the upper part of the sternum and the clavicle;
                    the M. pectoralis minor arises from the coracoid process of the scapula, and is
                    inserted into the anterior ends of some of the ribs; the M. serratus posticus
                    superior arises from certain of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and is
                    inserted into the posterior part of certain of the ribs; the M. cervicalis
                    ascendens (part of the M. erector spinae) arises from certain of the cervical
                    vertebrae, and is inserted into the posterior part of certain ribs. The M.
                    serratus magnus and the M. pectoralis major, which are affixed on the one hand
                    to the upper arm and to the scapula respectively and on the other to the ribs
                    and to the sternum respectively, may in certain elevated positions of the arm
                    and shoulder act as in spiratory muscles. When all these muscles contract, the
                    ribs are raised in the twofold way already de scribed, some pulling up the
                    anterior ends of the ribs, and others causing the arched ribs to rotate about an
                    axis passing through their vertebral and sternal joints.</p>
                <p>In addition to the muscles just enumerated the M. intercostales externi are
                    undoubtedly inspiratory muscles. Every external intercostal muscular fibre
                    between a pair of ribs must, when it contracts, of necessity raise <hi
                    rend="italic">both</hi> ribs, as is clearly shown by the'accompanying diagram
                    (fig. 6). Here <hi rend="italic">a'd</hi> must be shorter than <hi rend="italic"

                    hence <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> will be larger the smaller the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> for the cosine increases as the angle diminishes.</p>
                <p>By a similar geometrical treatment of the question it may be shown that the
                    in-tefnal intercostal muscles when they contract must of necessity depress both
                    the ribs to which they are attached. If the angle BAc'=x (fig. 7), then c'&lt;Z'
                    <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> =AB <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + (Ac'- B&lt;Z')

                    hence <hi rend="italic">e'd'</hi> will be larger the larger the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>The case, however, is not so clear with reference to the anterior portions of the
                    internal intercostals which lie between the cartilages; for it is evident that
                    these fibres have the same direction with regard to the sternum as an axis as
                    the external intercostals have with regard to the vertebral column as an axis;
                    that is to say, the geometrical diagram in fig. 6 applies to the
                    intercartilaginous internal intercostals as perfectly as it does to the
                    interosseous parts of the external intercostals, the inference being that the
                    intercartilaginous internal intercostals tend to elevate the pair of ribs
                    between which they stretch. The geometrical argument is, however, overborne by
                    physiological experiment: Martin and Hartwell have observed in the dog and the
                    cat that the internal intercostals throughout their whole extent contract (not
                    synchronously) but alternately with the diaphragm; hence we must conclude that
                    their function throughout is not inspiratory like that of the diaphragm, but
                    expiratory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Movements of the Diaphragm.—</hi> The muscular fibres of
                    the diaphragm are arranged in a radial manner, or more strictly speaking in a
                    manner like the lines of longitude on a terrestrial globe. The central tendon of
                    the diaphragm corresponds to the pole of such a globe. The contraction of the
                    fibres is expended on straightening the longitudinal curves rather than on
                    pulling down the central tendon to a lower level; in fact the central tendon
                    moves very little in ordinary respiration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">How the Expiratory Movements are Produced.—</hi> The action of
                    inspiration disturbs many organs from the position of rest into which gravity
                    and their own physical properties have thrown them. The ribs and sternum are
                    raised from the position of lowest level; the elastic costal cartilages are
                    twisted; the elastic lungs are put upon the stretch; the abdominal organs,
                    themselves elastic, are compressed and thrust against the elastic walls of the
                    belly, causing these to bulge outwards. In short the very act of inspiration
                    stores up, as it were, in sundry ways the forces which make for expiration. As
                    soon as the inspiratory muscles cease to act these forces come into play, and
                    the position of rest or equilibrium is regained. It is very doubtful whether any
                    special expiratory muscles are called into action during ordinary respiration.
                    The internal intercostals may in man be exercised in ordinary expiration
                    (although they are certainly not so exercised in the dog and the cat); but in
                    laboured expiration many muscles assist in the expulsive effort. The muscles
                    forming the belly walls contract and force the abdominal contents against the
                    relaxed diaphragm in such a manner as to drive it farther and farther into the
                    thorax. At the same time by their attachment to the lower edge of the thorax
                    these same muscles pull down the ribs and sternum. The M. triangularis sterni,
                    which arises from the back or thoracic aspect of the sternum and lower costal
                    cartilages and is inserted into the costal cartilages higher up, can obviously
                    depress the ribs. So also can the M. serratus posticus inferior, which arises
                    from the thick fascia of the loins and is inserted into the last four ribs. So
                    also can the M. quadratus lumborum, which springs from the pelvis and is
                    attached to the last rib. Indeed there is hardly a muscle of the body but may be
                    called into play during extremely laboured respiration, either because it acts
                    on the chest, or because it serves to steady some part and give a better
                    purchase for the action of direct respiratory muscles.</p>

                    >Coughing.—</hi> There is first a deep inspiration followed by closure of the
                    glottis. Then follows a violent expiratory effort which bursts open the glottis
                    and drives the air out of thé lungs in a blast which carries away any light
                    irritating matter it may meet with. The act is commonly involuntary, but may be
                    imitated exactly by a voluntary efibrt.</p>

                    voluntarily.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sneezing.—</hi> There is first an inspiration which is often
                    unusually rapid; then follows a sudden expiration and the blast is directed
                    through the nose. The glottis remains open all the time. The act is generally
                    involuntary, but may be more or less successfully imitated by a voluntary
                    effort.</p>

                    expirations with the glottis partially closed. Long-continued crying leads to

                    vibrating structures of the larynx and pharynx. The face has a characteristic
                    expression. This act is essentially involuntary, and often is beyond control; it

                <p><hi rend="italic">Innervation of the Respiratory Movements.</hi></p>
                <p>The respiratory actions are seen from the above description to be very
                    complicated: their regular performance depends upon the coordination of a great
                    number of factors; and, inasmuch as the respiratory movements do not happen
                    invariably after one stereotyped pattern, but admit of various modifications,
                    such as sighing, hiccoughing, &amp;c., we must infer that the coordination is
                    such as to admit of corresponding variations. The coordination of the
                    inspiratory and expiratory movements is brought about through the nervous
                    system, the connexion of which with the organs of respiration already described
                    must now be stated.</p>
                <p>Speaking very generally, there is a nervous centre in the cerebro-spinal axis
                    from which certain nerve fibres proceed to the muscles of respiration; these are
                    called the efferent or centrifugal fibres. There are other fibres which run from
                    the peripheral parts of the body towards the same centre and exert a control
                    over it; these are called afferent or centripetal. The impulses to movement
                    start from the centre and travel down the efferent fibres to the muscles, while
                    impressions arising in the periphery of the body are carried along the afferent
                    fibres to the centre and modify its action.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Respiratory Centre.—</hi> There is a portion of the medulla
                    oblongata destruction of which causes immediate and permanent cessation of all
                    respiratory movements. This spot has been found to lie in the grey substance
                    near the tip or nib of the calamus scriptorius; it extends on both sides of the
                    middle line, and has received the name of “le noeud vital” (Flourens). If the
                    spinal cord be severed immediately below the spot, all respiratory movements in
                    the parts of the body below the level of section cease at once, while movements
                    of respiration in parts situated above the level <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi>
                    in the face) continue momentarily. If the severance be made above the vital
                    knot, the facial movements of respiration cease, while those of the trunk
                    continue. The nervous centre is bilateral, each half serving its proper side of
                    the body; if the medulla oblongata be split longitudinally in the middle line,
                    through the noeud vital, respiration goes on unchecked; but if one lateral half
                    of the vital area be destroyed, respiration at once ceases on the same side of
                    the body.</p>
                <p>While the above hypothesis of a respiratory centre in the medulla presiding over
                    the movements of respiration is in all probability substantially correct, it
                    must be stated that, in certain circumstances of experiment <hi rend="italic"
                    >{e.g.,</hi> when the animal is young and has been poisoned with strychnia, or
                    is kept in a warm chamber), respiratory movements do occur even when the medulla
                    oblongata with the noeud vital has been removed. That is to say, there are
                    centres in the cord of a lower order than the medullary respiratory centre which
                    are under ordinary circumstances dependent on the main centre but which may act
                    independently.</p>
                <p>The respiratory centre must be regarded as the seat of origin of the impulses
                    which cause the muscular movements of inspiration and expiration. During the
                    whole of intra-uterine life the centre is inactive, but almost immediately after
                    the child is born, or the placental circulation is interrupted by compression of
                    the umbilical blood-vessels, the centre becomes quickened, and fails not to
                    yield the appropriate stimulus at short intervals during the whole afterperiod
                    of life. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the immediate cause of
                    the activity of the respiratory centre is the impure and impoverished state of
                    the blood, which it is the function of respiration to remedy. So long as the
                    placenta performs the function of purifying the blood of the foetus and
                    supplying it with oxygen the respiratory centre is quiescent; the moment the
                    placenta becomes incapable of purifying the foetal blood, as, for example, when
                    the mother is suffocated or asphyxiated, the respiratory centre prepares to act
                    and respiratory movements follow.</p>
                <p>If it is true that the presence of impure or venous blood in the respiratory
                    centre is the cause of the first respiratory act of an animal, it is also true
                    that the presence of highly arterialized blood is sufficient to render the
                    centre absolutely inactive again. If air or oxygen gas be driven through the
                    lungs of an animal and allowed to escape through holes made in the chest walls,
                    the blood becomes so rapidly and perfectly purified that the whole vascular
                    system is filled with the pure blood which is commonly found in the arteries
                    only. In this case the movements of respiration cease until such time as the
                    blood has again lost its purity, when respiration begins, as one might say, <hi
                    rend="italic">da capo.</hi> There is no doubt that the essential cause of the
                    inactivity of the respiratory centre in this experiment is the presence in
                    excess of oxygen gas, an∣l that the absence of a certain proportion of oxygen in
                    the blood circulating in the body endows the blood with a power of stimulating
                    directly or indirectly the respiratory centre. To this subject we shall
                    return.</p>

                    lying on the corresponding side of the body. Section of one phrenic nerve causes
                    paralysis of the corresponding half of the diaphragm. Other fibres run in the
                    <hi rend="italic">intercostal nerves</hi> for the supply of the intercostal
                    muscles, levatores costarum, &amp;c.; others again run in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cervical nerves</hi> for the supply of the sterno-mastoid, scaleni, &amp;c.
                    Section of these nerves leads to paralysis of the muscles supplied by them. The
                    facial muscles of respiration are supplied by efferent fibres from the seventh
                    cranial nerve, and the laryngeal muscles by the laryngeal branches of the
                    vagus.</p>
                <p>In addition to the nerves which supply the respiratory muscles, there are
                    efferent fibres which run in the course of the vagus to the muscles supplying
                    the larynx and the bronchial tubes. The vagi (also called the pneumogastric
                    nerves) are two important trunks which arise from the medulla oblongata, and,
                    after receiving communications for neighbouring nerves, run down by the side of
                    the windpipe to reach the thorax and abdomen. By means of appropriate apparatus,
                    of which several varieties have been devised, contraction of the small bronchial
                    tubes may be readily made sensible and even graphically recorded. A study of the
                    experimental results obtained after electrical stimulation of the pneumogastric
                    nerves leaves no doubt that these nerves contain motor fibres for the bronchial
                    tubes. The exact distribution of the superior and inferior laryngeal branches of
                    the vagus to the muscles of the larynx is described under Anatomy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Afferent Fibres.—</hi> Many nerve fibres have been
                    ascertained by physiological experiment to have communication with the
                    respiratory centre. For example, the nerves of the skin of the chest, <hi
                    rend="subscript">t</hi> when stimulated by the application of cold water, cause
                    a gasping inspiration; the nerves of the skin of the sides of the body and of
                    the soles of the feet, when stimulated by tickling, cause that peculiar series
                    of spasms of the diaphragm which constitute laughing; and so on. But the vagus
                    nerve is that which contains the afferent fibres of chief importance to the
                    respiratory movements. The vagus fibres proceeding from larynx, trachea, lung,
                    and stomach certainly, and possibly also those proceeding from other organs of
                    the abdomen, are all capable of influencing the activity of the main respiratory
                    centre. If the trunk of the vagus nerve on each side of the neck be laid bare
                    and divided in an animal such as a rabbit, the respiratory movements become much
                    less frequent but at the same time deeper. If the end of the nerve above the
                    point of section be carefully stimulated by a weak electric current, respiration
                    again becomes quicker and proportionately shallow until in fact the natural type
                    is restored. If the strength of stimulus be still further increased, the
                    rapidity and the shallowness of breathing become still more remarkable, until a
                    degree of stimulation is reached when there is no longer any rhythmical
                    character in respiration, which is reduced to a feeble inspiratory spasm. These
                    facts are conveniently grouped and explained by the following hypothetical
                    statement. The vagus nerve contains fibres running up to the respiratory centre
                    which have the function of modifying the native tendencies of the centre in such
                    a manner as to accelerate its explosions of activity and at the same time render
                    them less formidable. These fibres are constantly in action during healthy life;
                    hence, on dividing the vagus trunk including these fibres, the respiratory
                    centre reverts to its natural type of slow and deep action. On stimulating these
                    fibres artificially they may be brought to spur on the centre once more, or even
                    carry the accelerating process to the point of producing continuous
                    inspiration.</p>
                <p>Experiment has, however, shown that the influence of the vagus nerve is not so
                    simple as is here supposed. There are other fibres in the vagus which seem to
                    arise in the larynx and run in the trunk of the two laryngeal (but chiefly in
                    the superior laryngeal) branches of the nerve; these have powers exactly opposed
                    to those ascribed to the main-trunk fibres. If the superior laryngeal nerve be
                    divided and the higher end at the point of division be stimulated, respiration
                    becomes less frequent and more powerful. These fibres of opposite tendencies run
                    side by side in the vagus trunk, and must be alike excited when an electrical
                    stimulus is thrown into the nerve. The fact that the total result of stimulation
                    is in favour of the first-described accelerating nerves may be hypothetically
                    explained by supposing the accelerating fibres to be more numerous, or more
                    potent with the given stimulus, than the slowing fibres.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0498-0481"/>ing questions arise as to the exact mode of action
                    of the respiratory centre. Is there an expiratory centre apart from the
                    inspiratory? In ordinary quiet breathing expiration is not a muscular act in the
                    sense that inspiration is; but in laboured breathing many muscles are
                    coordinated to help in the act; we may therefore assume that there is an
                    expiratory coordinating mechanism as well as an inspiratory. Another inquiry
                    touches the question of the stimulation of the respiratory centre. We have
                    arrived at the conclusion that a certain impoverished or impure state of the
                    blood is the cause of the activity of the respiratory centres. Is it by a direct
                    action of the blood on the nerve centre, or is it by an action of the blood upon
                    the end-organs of nerves in the peripheral parts of the body which indirectly
                    induce the respkatory centre to act? In other words, λvould the respiratory
                    centre act under the stimulus of a certain degree of impurity of its blood if it
                    were cut off absolutely from its afferent fibres? This is not a question which
                    admits of an absolutely decisive experimental answer; but this may be said in
                    reference to it, that, if the cerebrum be extirpated, the pneumo-gastric nerves
                    divided, and the spinal chord severed at a point below that from which the main
                    respiratory efferent nerves emerge, notwithstanding that the respiratory centre
                    is thus separated from by far the greater number of the sensory nerves of the
                    body, respiration still goes on. Further, if the spinal axis is divided at a
                    level immediately above that of the respiratory centre, respiration goes on in
                    the lower parts of the body but ceases in the upper—that is, the facial
                    movements cease; while, if the division be carried through a point immediately
                    below the level of the respiratory centre, although chest movement ceases and
                    respiration may in strictness be said to be permanently stopped, yet the facial
                    movements, which are just as essential to the complete idea of respiration, and
                    which are innervated from the common respiratory centre, continue to be
                    performed so long as any life remains in the mutilated animal. There is
                    therefore a very strong presumption that the respiratory centre is automatic,
                    that is, that it has within itself the spring of its own activity, and that the
                    impurity of the blood which sets the respiratory mechanism agoing does so by
                    acting upon the respiratory nervous centre directly. However started, the
                    inspiratory stimulus is discharged rhythmically down the efferent respiratory
                    nerve during healthy life. The rhythm is capable of wide variation, both by the
                    exercise of the will and by the operation of external conditions, such as heat
                    and muscular exercise of the body, which accelerate respiration independently of
                    the will. The question why the discharge is rhythmical is one of the deeper
                    problems of physiology, and touches the essential nature of nervous actions in
                    general. It is customary in physiological treatises to illustrate it by
                    supposing a mechanism which offers a resistance to the discharges of its own
                    energy; when the energy reaches a certain degree of tension resistance is
                    overcome and the discharge takes place, but a certain time must elapse before
                    energy can again accumulate to the extent of overcoming resistance. It is
                    further supposed that resistance is capable of being varied by external
                    agencies; when it is increased the discharges occur at longer intervals, because
                    more energy must be accumulated before resistance can be overborne, but at the
                    same time they are more violent; when resistance is diminished, the discharges
                    are more rapid but less powerful, until, when resistance becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">nil,</hi> the discharge is continuous. Such illustrations are,
                    however, of very doubtful value; they impart a sense of clearness to our views
                    of nervous action by turning attention from the problem we wish elucidated to
                    another and altogether different problem. There is in fact no probability
                    whatever, so far as facts yet go, that nervous rhythmical action is brought
                    about in any such way.</p>

                <p>The mechanism which has just been described has for its object an interchange of
                    substances between the body and the external medium. Certain substances pass out
                    of the body at the lungs, and others are taken into the body. The discussion of
                    this interchange pertains to what is called the Chemistry of Respiration.</p>

                    knowledge of this exchange of matters may be obtained at once by a simple
                    comparison of inspired and expired air. The air we breathe varies somewhat
                    according to the various circumstances of season, time of day, height above sea
                    level, prevailing wind, &amp;c.; but all samples of pure atmospheric air have
                    substantially the following composition :—</p>

                    must be distinguished carefully from the relative or sensible moisture, which
                    depends more upon the temperature of the air than upon the absolute'quantity of
                    watery vapour it contains.</p>
                <p>Air which is expired from the lungs has approximately the following composition
                    :—</p>

                <p>Probably there is an exceedingly small excess of nitrogen in expired air as

                <p>On an average (subject, however, to considerable variations) it appears that the
                    body takes up in respiration oxygen gas to the amount of 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> 78 vols, per cent, of the air inhaled, and it gives
                    off carbon dioxide to the average amount of 4 ’ 38 vols, per cent., besides
                    traces of nitrogen, ammonia, hydrogen, and light carburetted hydrogen. Leaving
                    out of calculation the minute traces of the latter bodies, it will be observed
                    that the volume of oxygen taken into the body is larger than the volume of
                    carbon dioxide given off; and, since, under like conditions of pressure and
                    temperature, equal volumes of oxygen gas and carbon dioxide gas contain the same
                    quantity of oxygen, it is clear that more oxygen enters the body at the lungs
                    than escapes from it; therefore the whole of the oxygen taken into the body does
                    not leave it as carbonic acid or expired air. The ratio of CO., expired to O
                    absorbed is called the “respiratory quotient”—</p>

                    examination of expired air, that we know the constitution of the air in the
                    recesses of the lungs where it comes most intimately into contact with the
                    blood. To attain such knowledge it is necessary to examine the deeper air
                    directly, and the air is obtained for such purposes by means of a lung catheter.

                    an average person would take in about 10,000 grains of oxygen in respiration,

                    cooler than the body but not cold enough to lower the body temperature, more O

                    they affect the removal of that which is already formed. Increased rate of

                <p>Having ascertained the nature and quantity of the materials exchanged in the
                    lungs, we may now ask concerning the method of the exchange. There is no
                    difficulty in understanding how the cold air introduced into the lungs is warmed
                    and saturated with moisture by contact with the moist walls of the air passages
                    and bronchi. As to the gaseous substances which appear in traces in the expired
                    air nothing definite is known; they may in part arise in the decomposition of
                    the solid organic impurities of expired air, and may in part escape from the
                    blood itself. The origin of the solid poisonous organic substances, which are of
                    such vital interest from a sanitary point of view, is also a matter of great
                    obscurity. Some portions of it doubtless consist of effete particles of tissue
                    from the walls of the bronchial tubes and cavity of the mouth and nose; for
                    example, epithelial scales may be discovered in the condensed moisture of the
                    air expired into an ice-cold globe, and so also may the organized bacilli of
                    tubercle when the subject of experiment happens to be phthisical. Other portions
                    may spring directly from the blood. The chief inquiry, however, centres about
                    the origin of the carbon dioxide and the absorption of the oxygen, for the
                    understanding of which a knowledge of the blood is necessary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Blood.—</hi> This, as it circulates in the vessels of man
                    and vertebrates generally, is a viscous and to the naked eye homogeneous liquid
                    of red colour,—the blood of the pulmonary veins, of the left side of the heart,
                    and of the systemic arteries being normally of a bright scarlet hue, and the
                    blood of the right side of the heart, of the systemic veins, and of the
                    pulmonary artery being of a brownish-red colour. In other words the blood enters
                    the capillaries of the lungs of a brownish-red colour, and leaves them bright
                    scarlet in hue; it enters the general capillaries of the body as a bright
                    scarlet fiuid and leaves them as a brownish-red fluid. Although homogeneous to
                    the naked eye, the blood is found on microscopic examination to consist of a
                    colourless fluid, called <hi rend="italic">liquor sanguinis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">plasma,</hi> holding in suspension large numbers of solid bodies,
                    the <hi rend="italic">corpuscles</hi> of the blood; the more numerous of these
                    are <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> the others are colourless and are commonly
                    spoken of as <hi rend="italic">white.</hi> The specific gravity of blood
                    probably varies between 1045 and 1075. Fresh blood is feebly alkaline in
                    reaction.</p>
                <p>When blood is shed it remains for a minute or two as fiuid as it is in the
                    blood-vessels; but in 2-6 minutes it begins to pass into the state of a soft red
                    jelly, which gradually acquires greater consistence, and by the contraction of
                    one of its constituents at length expresses a fluid; the contracted jelly is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">clot,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">crassameηtum</hi>;
                    the expressed fluid is the <hi rend="italic">serum</hi>; and the whole process
                    is denominated <hi rend="italic">coagulation.</hi> Contraction of the clot may
                    go on for 10-48 hours. This process of coagulation is due to the separation from
                    the plasma of a body called <hi rend="italic">fibrin,</hi> which entangles in
                    its meshes the corpuscles of the blood. When coagulation is delayed for several
                    minutes (as it always is in horse’s blood, and as it usually is in the blood of
                    men suffering from inflammatory diseases), the blood corpuscles, being
                    specifically heavier than the plasma, have time to subside a little way before
                    coagulation commences. Hence the uppermost layers of such blood become nearly
                    free from coloured corpuscles; and subsequently, when the blood coagulates, the
                    clot exhibits the phenomenon of the <hi rend="italic">bujky coat,—</hi> that is,
                    the upper part of the clot is of a yellowish colour. If, instead of allowing
                    blood to coagulate undisturbed, it be stirred or whipped with twigs, the fibrin
                    does not entangle the corpuscles but separates as a stringy mass which adheres
                    to the twigs; the corpuscles remain in the serum and constitute <hi
                    rend="italic">defibriηated blood.</hi> Coagulation is promoted (a) by exposure
                    to a temperature slightly higher than that of the living body; (δ) by contact
                    with foreign matter; (c) by the addition of minute quantities of common salt or
                    other neutral salts. It is delayed or suspended (a) by exposure to an ice-cold
                    temperature; (6) by contact with the living blood-vessels; (c) by the addition
                    of a sufficient quantity of sodium chloride, sodium sulphate, or some other
                    neutral salts.</p>
                <p>Reviewing all the facts which have been ascertained respecting coagulation, it
                    would appear that the process is dependent upon the presence in the liquor
                    sanguinis of a proteid body called fibrinogen, which under favourable
                    circumstances undergoes conversion, or perhaps decomposition, into fibrin. This
                    conversion, when it occurs outside the body, appears to be connected with the
                    action of a ferment produced in the colourless corpuscles, and probably only set
                    free when they break down.</p>
                <p>The red corpuscles of man and the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> generally,
                    except the <hi rend="italic">Camelidae,</hi> are biconcave disks, possessing
                    neither skin nor nucleus or interior body. In birds, reptiles, and most fishes
                    they are nucleated, elliptical, and biconvex. In the camel the red corpuscles
                    are oval. The average diameter of the disk in man is ∙ <hi rend="subscript"
                    >5</hi> - <hi rend="subscript">i</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript">σ</hi> inch and the
                    thickness about i <hi rend="superscript">n</hi> θh∙</p>
                <p>The substance of which the red disks is composed is elastic; the disks may
                    therefore be squeezed through fine chinks smaller than their own diameter and
                    may afterwards regain their original shape. When in the bloodvessels the red
                    corpuscles are hurried along indiscrimately in the blood current, but when the
                    blood stands the red corpuscles cling together in rows like piles of coin, which
                    are technically called <hi rend="italic">rouleaux·,</hi> this is a
                    physical,phenomenon entirely due to the shape of the corpuscles. The white or
                    colourless corpuscles are globular masses of granular protoplasm, provided with
                    one or more interior bodies called nuclei, but destitute of a skin. They have
                    the power of independent movement, which the red cells have not, resembling in
                    this respect the amoeba. They can send out processes, change their outline, and
                    move from place to place by laying hold on resistent objects by means of a
                    projected process and dragging their bodies <pb break="no"

                    haematoblasts,</hi> which are granular and nucleated. Probably these corpuscles
                    are involved in a special manner in the development of the fibrin-ferment. It
                    has been calculated that one cubic millimetre (f.c., a cube whose side measures

                    all kinds.</p>

                    >Fibrin.—</hi> When fresh this is an elastic substance belonging to the group of
                    proteid bodies; it is insoluble in pure water, but is soluble in solutions of
                    common salt and in dilute hydrochloric acid at the temperature of the body.
                    Human venous blood yields from 2 ’ 2 to 2'8 parts per thousand of fibrin. So far
                    as we know, fibrin does not exist as such in the plasma before it is coagu
                    lated; but there does exist a body, fibrinogen, which is the precursor of
                    fibrin.</p>
                <p>It may be separated from plasma by diluting the plasma freely with water at an
                    ice-cold tempera ture, and passing for a long time a stream of CO <hi
                    rend="subscript">2</hi> through it; or by adding common salt to plasma until the

                <p>12 to 16 per cent, of salt the fibrinogen is precipitated in a flaky form.
                    Besides fibrinogen, liquor sanguinis contains another proteid body intimately
                    concerned in the formation of fibrin; this is <hi rend="italic"
                    >serum-globulin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">para-globulin.</hi> It also may be
                    precipitated from diluted plasma by a stream of CO,; but it may be much more
                    perfectly eliminated by adding magnesium sulphate until the plasma is saturated.
                    It is a body the presence of which greatly facilitates or promotes the
                    development of fibrin from fibrinogen; indeed some observers have supposed that
                    fibrin arises in the union of the two bodies fibrinogen and para-globulin.</p>

                <p>It is the cause of the red colour of the corpuscles. It may be obtained in the
                    form of beautiful crystals by a variety of methods, which all have the following
                    steps in common :—(1) to effect the solution of the oxy haemoglobin of the red
                    corpuscles in the serum or in water, and (2) to effect the crystallization of it
                    from solution either by adding alcohol, or by cold, or by both combined.
                    Theforms of the crystals differ in different animals; the chief forms are given
                    in fig. 9. Oxy haemoglobin has the property of giving up a portion of its oxygen
                    on very slight provocation, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> when treated with
                    easily oxidizable sub stances, or when sub mitted to moderate heat in a
                    vacuum.</p>
                <p>The resulting sub stance is called re duced haemoglobin or, shortly, haemo
                    globin; it is capable of reproducing the original oxyhaemo globin on simple ex
                    posure to oxygen or to air. This property is of the highest im portance in the
                    func tion of respiration, as will be explained in the section on the gases of
                    the blood.</p>
                <p>Solutions of oxyhaemoglobin of moderate strength have the fine scarlet hue of
                    arterial blood. When interposed between the sun and a spectroscope they cause
                    the absorption of definite portions of the spectrum, and give a characteristic
                    appearance to it. After the solution has been reduced (as it may be very readily
                    by means of an alkaline solution of a ferrous salt, in which precipitation of
                    ferrous hydrate is prevented by the presence of tartaric or citric acid), it
                    assumes a brownish colour and the absorption spectrum becomes changed. The
                    spectra of oxyhaemoglobin and of reduced haemoglobin when the solutions are of
                    moderate strength are given in fig. 10.</p>

                    moderate temperature the two become again dissociated.</p>
                <p>When blood or a solution of oxyhaemoglobin is shaken up with carbon monoxide, the
                    “dissociable” or “respiratory” oxygen is displaced, and a new compound of CO and
                    haemoglobin is formed which has a spectrum very like that of oxyhaemoglobin, but
                    is incapable of reduction by the means which are sufficient to reduce
                    oxyhaemoglobin. In like manner (with certain precautions) a compound of
                    haemoglobin with NO may be formed.</p>

                <p>The blood when admitted into a vacuous space readily gives up more than half its
                    volume of mixed gases, consisting of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. The
                    oxygen is present in much larger quantities than could be held in simple
                    solution by the water of the blood; it is in fact mainly held in feeble
                    combination by the haemoglobin of the coloured corpuscles; only a trace of it
                    is, under ordinary circumstances, held in true solution. The carbon dioxide,
                    whilst not existing in larger quantity in blood than would be possible if it
                    were simply dissolved by the water of that fluid, is nevertheless to a small
                    extent in a state of loose chemical combination in which both plasma and
                    corpuscles share. The nitrogen is held in a state of simple solution in the
                    liquor sanguinis. These gases are yielded in different proportions by arterial
                    and venous blood, as is shown in the following table :—</p>

                <p>The method of extracting the gases of the blood which has been found to be most
                    convenient is one in which the blood is introduced into the Torricellian vacuum
                    existing above the column of mercury in a barometer. Blood is collected over
                    mercury in such a way as to avoid all access of air; it is then introduced by an
                    appropriate mechanism into the space above the barometric mercury. Λt once the
                    gases froth up and fill the space; the aqueous vapour which at the same time
                    arises is absorbed by a special drying apparatus communicating with the vacuum.
                    Means exist of warming the vacuous space up to about 45° C., which is a
                    temperature sufficient to cause the escape of nearly all the gases of the blood;
                    the last portions of carbonic acid are, however, more rapidly evolved by
                    allowing a small volume of a thoroughly boiled-out solution of phosphoric acid
                    to enter the blood receptacle near the close of the operation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">How the Gaseous Exchanges are Effected in Respiration.</hi></p>
                <p>For the purposes of description, and in reference exclusively to its respiratory
                    function, the blood may be looked upon as a watery solution of certain
                    substances having respectively a slight chemical attraction for oxygen and for
                    carbon dioxide. The chief of these substances is haemoglobin, which is concerned
                    solely with the oxygen; others, less perfectly known, are concerned with the
                    carbon dioxide, and include certain saline constituents of the plasma (NaHCO)
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In a vacuum
                    2HNaCOsplits up into NaCO+ CO+HO. </p></note> and perhaps also certain
                    constituents of the corpuscles. The affinity of these substances for oxygen and
                    carbon dioxide respectively is of so slight a nature that the mere exposure of
                    the substances to a vacuum at a certain moderate temperature is sufficient to
                    overcome the affinity, and dissociate the captive gases. Granted such a solution
                    in the blood-vessels of the lungs, separated from the air of the air cells by
                    the thin moist membranes of the alveolar walls, how are the gaseous exchanges of
                    respiration brought about? In the first place we must premise certain physical
                    relationships which exist between gases and fluids in contact with one another.
                    If a definite quantity of pure water be exposed to the air it will at a given
                    temperature dissolve a definite volume of air. If the air be compressed to
                    one-half (or one-quarter) of its original bulk the water will still absorb the
                    same <hi rend="italic">volume</hi> of it, albeit that volume now contains twice
                    (or four times) the former <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of gas. If the
                    pressure be diminished again the air will escape from the water exactly in
                    proportion to the diminished pressure. This is a concrete example of Dalton’s
                    law that the quantity of a gas dissolved by a liquid varies directly as the
                    pressure of the gas at the surface of the liquid. What is true of the air is
                    true of its constituents. In the above example the quantity of the constituent
                    oxygen absorbed after the compression of the air is twice (or four times) the
                    quantity absorbed before compression. But the quantity which is absorbed of any
                    constituent of a gaseous mixture depends, not upon the total pressure exerted on
                    the liquid by all the gases of the mixture in contact with its surface, but by
                    the partial pressure, or fraction of the total pressure, exerted by the
                    constituent in question. To take an example, let us suppose that a solution of
                    oxygen in water made at a certain definite pressure is exposed to an atmosphere
                    of pure nitrogen exerting as great a pressure, or even a greater, on the surface
                    of the liquid; notwithstanding this pressure the oxygen would escape from
                    solution as readily as if the solution had been placed in a perfectly vacuous
                    space. If water be exposed in a certain space of air (which is, roughly, a
                    mixture of nitrogen and oxygen), the oxygen which it is capable of absorbing
                    would be <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n502/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0502-0485"/>equally well absorbed if all the nitrogen were
                    removed from the space and the oxygen alone left to fill it. These remarks are
                    equally true of a liquid separated from a gas by moist membranes. In short, the
                    blood of the pulmonary vessels, regarded as a simple liquid capable of absorbing
                    O and CO <hi rend="subscript">2</hi> , and apart from the remarkable chemical
                    bodies contained in it, obeys Dalton’s law like any other liquid.</p>
                <p>The blood is, however, not a simple fluid, but contains substances having a
                    peculiar affinity for certain of the gases of the atmosphere; especially does it
                    contain haemo-glôbin. It has been stated that the “dissociable” or “respiratory”
                    oxygen of oxyhaemoglobin is all yielded to a vacuum at the temperature of the
                    body. This yield differs from the yield of a gas simply dissolved in a liquid
                    (which also is perfect in a vacuum) in not proceeding ∕&gt;αri <hi rend="italic"
                    >passu</hi> as the pressure approaches <hi rend="italic">nil.</hi> On the
                    contrary in the case of solutions of haemoglobin, as the oxygen pressure is
                    diminished at the surface of the solution, no changes occur in the
                    oxyhaemoglobin until the oxygen pressure reaches 25 mm. (about 1 inch) of
                    mercury; then the oxyhaemoglobin yields up its respiratory oxygen. If the steps
                    are retraced, and oxygen is gradually readmitted to exercise pressure upon the
                    haemoglobin solution, the latter takes up oxygen once more as soon as the oxygen
                    pressure reaches or exceeds 25 mm. of mercury.</p>
                <p>We may now consider the actual physical conditions of the blood in the lungs.
                    Venous blood is hurried into the capillaries surrounding the air cells; much of
                    its haemoglobin has been “reduced” (or deprived of its dissociable oxygen), and
                    further it is rich in carbon dioxide, which it has obtained from the active
                    tissues in distant organs. In the alveolar walls it comes into relationship with
                    the air of the alveoli; probably these are filled with air which never contains
                    less than 10 per cent, of oxygen, and which (in the dog, be it remembered)
                    contains 3 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 8 per cent, of CO., at a time when the
                    expired air contains 2'8 per cent. Are these conditions such that, owing to the
                    physical laws described, oxygen must pass into the blood, and carbon dioxide out
                    of it? First, as regards the oxygen. Au atmosphere containing 10 per cent, of
                    oxygen implies a partial O-pressure of 76 mm. of mercury (10 per cent, of 760
                    mm.); as this is far above the dissociation point (25 mm.) of oxyhaemoglobin, it
                    is clear that any reduced haemoglobin present would greedily absorb oxygen from
                    such an atmosphere. When the air breathed is much rarefied, the case is
                    different; the partial O-pressure in the alveoli may be so far reduced that the
                    absorption of O by the blood becomes most difficult or impossible. As regards
                    the carbon dioxide the matter is not so clear; but, inasmuch as air drawn from
                    the depth of the lung by means of a catheter contains (in a dog) 3 <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> 8 per cent, of CO <hi rend="subscript">2</hi> , while
                    at the same time the venous blood of the right side of the heart possesses a CO
                    <hi rend="subscript">2</hi> tension of approximately the same percentage, we may
                    assume that CO <hi rend="subscript">2</hi> escapes from the pulmonary
                    capillaries into the alveoli until equilibrium ensues. It is, however,
                    conceivable that the epithelium of the air cells may assist the elimination of
                    CO <hi rend="subscript">2</hi> from the blood by a process of true excretion
                    independently of the above merely physical considerations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">So-called Internal Respiration.</hi></p>
                <p>Venous blood yields up its carbon dioxide and takes up oxygen in the capillaries
                    of the lungs; arterial blood passes to the general capillaries of the tissues
                    and there yields up its oxygen and receives carbon dioxide. To this act, which
                    in its issues is complementary to the interchanges of pulmonary respiration, the
                    term internal respiration, or respiration of the tissues, has been applied. With
                    as much propriety we might speak of internal urination in reference to the
                    nitrogenous effete matters which the tissues cast into the blood. We are in fact
                    not in a position to form any clear picture of the interchanges which occur
                    between the blood and the tissues other than that which is sketched under
                    Nutrition (vol. xvii. pp. 678-682). Muscle is the tissue whose metabolic
                    processes are most clearly understood. Living muscle yields no oxygen to a
                    vacuum, although it gives up carbon dioxide freely; therefore it is presumably
                    itself in a condition to take up oxygen from arterial blood and to give up
                    carbon dioxide to it. But the absorption of oxygen is not <hi rend="italic"
                    >immediately</hi> necessary to the escape, or the formation, of the carbon
                    dioxide, however much it is so in the last instance. In other words, the oxygen
                    passes into the tissue and is at once combined into some intermediate compound
                    which only at a later stage decomposes and yields carbon dioxide. Whenever an
                    organ is active its blood-vessels dilate and permit a more copious flow of blood
                    through it than when it is at rest. In the salivary glands the blood may even
                    pulsate in the veins and look like true arterial blood in colour. After passing
                    through active muscles the blood contains both more CO <hi rend="subscript"
                    >2</hi> and less O than after passing through resting muscle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dyspnoea and Asphyxia.</hi></p>
                <p>When the entrance of air to the lungs is entirely prevented the phenomena of
                    dyspnoea and asphyxia begin to appear. At first respiration is deeper and more
                    frequent than usual (dyspnoea), the extraordinary muscles being called into play
                    in both inspiration and expiration; the heart beats more quickly at first, but
                    afterwards more slowly; this is the <hi rend="italic">first stage.</hi> It is
                    succeeded by the <hi rend="italic">second stage,</hi> in which the violence of
                    respiration is less marked, although the coordination of the act is more
                    irregular; indeed towards the end of the stage respiratory movements merge in
                    general convulsions of the whole body. Throughout this stage expiration is more
                    marked than inspiration, and the pressure of the blood in the bloodvessels is
                    very great. The <hi rend="italic">third stage</hi> is one of exhaustion, which
                    supervenes suddenly, and is marked by loss of consciousness, dilated pupils, and
                    absence of the powers of reflex action. The animal seems dead, except that at
                    long intervals feeble inspiratory gasps occur. Finally there comes one great
                    inspiratory effort: the mouth is fixed wide open, the head thrown back, the body
                    arched backwards, the nostrils dilated, and the pulse after a second or two is
                    indistinguishable (asphyxia). The whole series of events lasts from three to
                    five minutes if the interruption to the entrance of air has been absolute. After
                    death the right side of the heart, with the vessels immediately opening into it,
                    viz., the venae cavae and veins of the neck and the pulmonary artery, are
                    engorged with black blood containing little or no oxyhaemoglobin. The left side
                    of the heart and the systemic arteries are contracted and empty. All these
                    phenomena are best explained by the known power of venous blood to stimulate the
                    nervous centres. As the blood becomes more and more venous it stimulates more
                    powerfully the great nerve-centres of the medulla oblongata. The respiratory
                    centre is stimulated, especially its expiratory portion; and, finally, the whole
                    muscular centres of the spinal system are excited, causing general convulsions.
                    The vaso-motor centre is stimulated, causing the rise of blood pressure in the
                    early stage. The slowing of the heart during the close of the first and second
                    stages is due to stimulation of the vagus cardio-inhibitory centre in the
                    medulla. Finally the centres become exhausted from the impurity of the blood
                    bathing them, and their activity fails altogether.</p>

                    but total deficiency of O. On the other hand, if an animal be placed in a
                    chamber containing a large excess of CO <hi rend="subscript">2</hi> beyond the
                    standard of expired air, but at the same time a superabundant supply of O, no
                    dyspnoea supervenes, and no asphyxia threatens. The animal may suffer from
                    drowsiness (for CO <hi rend="subscript">2</hi> is narcotic in its effects), but
                    true dyspnoea never occurs so long as the supply of O is sufficient. There is
                    little doubt therefore that the absence of O from venous blood is the essential
                    condition of its stimulating property.</p>

                    Respiration, if we assume the essential fact of that process to be the
                    absorption of O and the elimination of CO <hi rend="subscript">2</hi> by the
                    animal body, is coextensive with the whole animal kingdom. It is not, however,
                    in every case served by special air-containing organs or lungs. Indeed the
                    essential interchange of respiration goes on wherever the blood comes into
                    sufficiently close contact with oxygen. For example, the air which happens to be
                    swallowed with our food is so closely in contact with the blood of the
                    intestinal vessels that an interchange of gases occurs, constituting a true
                    intestinal respiration. The <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> all possess true
                    lungs. In birds also there are lungs, but the mechanism of respiration is unlike
                    that of man, since the diaphragm is wanting. There are, in birds, besides lungs,
                    “air sacs” lying among the viscera and communicating with cavities in the bones,
                    these sacs being supplied with air from the lungs. Reptiles and some amphibians
                    breathe by lungs, other amphibians breathe by gills, as also do the young of
                    some of the air-breathing <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> (frogs). Fishes
                    breathe by gills, using the O dissolved in water.</p>
                <p>Many invertebrates respire in air, which is carried into the midst of their
                    tissues in tracheae or air-tubes branched like a tree; other invertebrates
                    breathe by gills in water; others again have lungs. In some the oxygenized water
                    is carried into the body along a series of tubes—the water-vascular system; and
                    in still simpler animals the general surface of the body seems to serve the
                    respiratory function. (a. g.*)</p>
