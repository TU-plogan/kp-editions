                    (1274-1329), king of Scotland, was the son of the seventh Robert de Bruce, lord
                    of Annandale in his own right and earl of Carrick in right of his wife Marjory,
                    daughter of Neil, second earl, and thus was of mingled Norman <note

                    follower of William the Conqueror, was rewarded by the gift of many manors,
                    chiefly in Yorkshire, of which Skelton was the principal. His son, the second
                    Robert, received from David I., his comrade at the court of Henry I., a grant of
                    the lordship of Annandale, and his grandson, the third Robert, siding with David
                    against Stephen at the battle of the Standard, became a Scottish instead of an
                    English baron. The fourth Robert maιτied Isobel, natural daughter of William the
                    Lion, and their son, the fifth Robert, married Isabella, second daughter of
                    David, earl of Huntingdon, niece of the same Scottish king. Thus royal kin made
                    natural the ambition to gain a crown,—an object not beyond the ambition of a
                    powerful noble in feudal times. </p></note> and Celtic blood. His grandfather,
                    the sixth Robert de Bruce, claimed the crown of Scotland as son of Isabella,
                    second daughter of David, earl of Huntingdon; but Baliol, grandson of Margaret,
                    the eldest daughter, was preferred by the commissioners of Edward I. The
                    birthplace of the Bruce—perhaps Turn-berry, his mother’s castle, on the coast of
                    Ayr—is not certainly known. His youth is said by an English chronicle to have
                    been passed at the court of Edward I. At an age when the mind is quick to
                    receive the impressions which give the bent to life he must have watched the
                    progress of the great suit for the crown of Scotland. Its issue in favour of
                    Baliol led to the resignation of Annandale by Bruce the competitor to his son,
                    the Bruce’s father, who, either then or after the death of the aged competitor
                    in 1295, assumed the title of lord of Annandale. Two years before he had
                    resigned, on the death of his wife, the earldom of Carrick to Robert the Bruce,
                    who presented the deed of resignation to Baliol at Stirling on 3d August 1293,
                    and offered the homage which his father, like his grandfather, was unwilling to
                    render. Feudal law required that the king should take sasine of the earldom
                    before regranting it and receiving the homage, and the sheriff of Ayr was
                    directed to take it on Baliol’s behalf. As the disputes between Edward and
                    Baliol, which ended in Baliol losing the kingdom, commenced in this year it is
                    doubtful whether Bruce ever rendered homage; but he is henceforth known as earl
                    of Carrick, though in a few instances this title is still given to his father.
                    Both father and son sided with Edward against Baliol. Towards the end of 1292
                    the elder Robert had a safe-conduct from Edward to visit Norway with a daughter,
                    Isabella, who married Erik, king of Norway, the widower of Margaret of
                    Scotland,—a fact marking the high standing of the family of Bruce. On 20th April
                    1294 the younger Robert, earl of Carrick, had a similar safe-conduct or
                    permission to visit Ireland till Michaelmas and a year following, and a further
                    mark of Edward’s favour by a respite for the same period of all debts due by him
                    to the exchequer. His father, having done homage to Edward, was entrusted in
                    October 1295 with the custody of the castle of Carlisle by a patent in which he
                    is styled lord of Annandale; and Baliol retaliated by seizing Annandale, which
                    he conferred on John Cornyn, earl of Buchan. On 28th August 1296 Robert de Bruce
                    “le vieil” and Robert de Bruce “le jeune,” earl of Carrick, swore fealty to
                    Edward at Berwick; but (according to Hemingford), in breach of this oath,
                    renewed at Carlisle on the Gospels and the sword of Thomas a Becket, the young
                    earl joined Wallace, who had raised the standard of Scottish independence in the
                    name of Baliol after that weak king had himself surrendered his kingdom to
                    Edward. Urgent letters were sent ordering Bruce to support Warenne, Edward’s
                    general, in the summer of 1297; but, instead of complying, he, along with the
                    bishop of Glasgow and the steward of Scotland, laid waste the lands of those who
                    adhered to Edward. On 7th July Percy forced Bruce and his friends to make terms
                    by the treaty called the Capitulation of Irvine. The Scottish lords were not to
                    serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent
                    violence, while in return they owned allegiance to Edward. The bishop of
                    Glasgow, the steward, and Sir Alexander Lindesay became sureties for Bruce until
                    he delivered his daughter Marjory as a hostage. Wallace almost alone maintained
                    the struggle for freedom which the nobles as well as Baliol had given up, and
                    Bruce had no part in the honour of Stirling Bridge or the reverse of Falkirk,
                    where in the following year Edward in person recovered what his generals had
                    lost and drove Wallace into exile. Shortly afterwards Bruce appears again to
                    have sided with his countrymen; Annandale was wasted and Lochmaben taken by
                    Clifford, while Bruce (according <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n616/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0616-0593"/>to Hemingford), “when he heard of the king’s
                    coming, fled from his face and burnt the castle of Ayr which he held.” Yet, when
                    Edward was forced by home affairs to quit Scotland, Annandale and certain
                    earldoms, including Carrick, were excepted from the districts he assigned to his
                    followers,—Bruce and the other earls being treated as waverers whose allegiance
                    might still be retained. In 1299 a regency was appointed in Scotland in name of
                    Baliol, and a letter of Baliol mentions Robert Bruce, lord of Carrick, as
                    regent, along with William of Lamberton, bishop of St Andrews, and John Cornyn
                    the younger,— a strange combination, Lamberton the friend of Wallace, Cornyn the
                    enemy of Bruce, and Bruce a regent in name of Baliol. Cornyn in his own interest
                    as Baliol’s heir was the active regent; the insertion of the name of Bruce was
                    an attempt to secure his co-operation. For the next four years he kept
                    studiously in the background waiting his time. A statement of Langtoft that he
                    was at the parliament of Lincoln in 1301, when the English barons repudiated the
                    claim of the pope to the suzerainty of Scotland, is not to be credited, though
                    his father may have been there. In the campaign of 1304, when Edward renewed his
                    attempt on Scotland and reduced Stirling, Bruce supported the English king, who
                    in one of his letters to him says, “If you complete that which you have begun we
                    shall hold the war ended by your deed and all the land of Scotland gained.” But,
                    while apparently aiding Edward, Bruce had taken a step which bound him to the
                    patriotic cause. On llth June, a month before the fall of Stirling, he met
                    Lamberton at Cambuskenneth and entered into a secret bond by which they were to
                    support each other against all adversaries and undertake nothing without
                    consulting together. The death of his father in this year may have determined
                    his course and led him to prefer the chance of the Scottish crown to his English
                    estates and the friendship of Edward.</p>
                <p>This determination closes the first chapter of his life; the second, from 1304 to
                    1314, is occupied by his contest for the kingdom, which was really won at
                    Bannockburn, though disputed till the treaty of Northampton in 1328; the last,
                    from 1314 to his death in 1329, was the period of the establishment of his
                    government and dynasty by an administration as skilful as his generalship. It is
                    to the second of these that historians, attracted by its brilliancy even amongst
                    the many romances of history and its importance to Scottish history, have
                    directed most of their attention, and it is during it that his personal
                    character, tried by adversity and prosperity, gradually unfolds itself. But all
                    three periods require to be kept in view to form a just estimate of Bruce. That
                    which terminated in 1304, though unfortunately few characteristics, personal or
                    individual, have been preserved, shows him by his conduct to have been the
                    normal Scottish noble of the time. A conflict of interest and of bias led to
                    contradictory action, and this conflict was increased in his case by his
                    father’s residence in England, his own upbringing at the English court, his
                    family feud with Baliol and the Cornyns, and the jealousy common to his class of
                    Wallace, the mere knight, who had rallied the commons against the invader and
                    taught the nobles what was required in a leader of the people. The merit of
                    Bruce is that he did not despise the lesson. Prompted alike by patriotism and
                    ambition, at the prime of manhood he chose the cause of national independence
                    with all its perils, and stood by it with a constancy which never wavered until
                    he secured its triumph. Though it is crowded with incidents, the main facts in
                    the central decade of Bruce’s life may be rapidly told. The fall of Stirling was
                    followed by the capture and execution of Wallace at London on 24th August 1305.
                    Edward hoped still to conciliate the nobles and gain Scotland by a policy of
                    clemency to all who did not dispute his authority. A parliament in London ( 16th
                    September), to which Scottish representatives were summoned, agreed to an
                    ordinance for the government of Scotland, which, though on the model of those
                    for Wales and Ireland, treating Scotland as a third subject province under an
                    English lieutenant, John de Bretagne, was in other respects not severe. Bruce is
                    reputed to have been one of the advisers who assisted in framing it; but a
                    provision that his castle of Kildrummy was to be placed in charge of a person
                    for whom he should answer shows that Edward not without reason suspected his
                    fidelity. Challenged by the king with the bond between him and Lamberton
                    (according to one account discovered by the treachery of John Cornyn, with whom
                    a similar engagement had been made or attempted), Bruce secretly quitted London,
                    and on 10th February 1306 met by appointment, in the church of the Friars Minor
                    at Dumfries, Cornyn, whom he slew at the high altar for refusing to join in his
                    plans. So much is certain, though the precise incidents of the interview were
                    variously told. It was not their first encounter, for a letter of 1299 to Edward
                    from Scotland describes Cornyn as having seized Bruce by the throat at a meeting
                    at Peebles, when they were with difficulty reconciled by the joint regency.</p>
                <p>The bond with Lamberton was now sealed by blood and the confederates lost no time
                    in putting it into execution. Within little more than six weeks Bruce,
                    collecting his adherents in the south-west, passed from Lochmaben to Glasgow and
                    thence to Scone, where he was crowned by the bishop of St Andrews on 25th March,
                    the bishops of Glasgow and Moray, with the earls of Lennox, Athole, and Errol,
                    being present. Two days later Isabella, countess of Buchan, claimed the right of
                    her family the Macduff’s, earls of Fife, to place the Scottish king on his
                    throne, and the ceremony was repeated with an addition flattering to the Celtic
                    race. Though a king, Bruce had not yet a kingdom, and his efforts to obtain it
                    were till the death of Edward I. disastrous failures. In June he was defeated at
                    Methven by Pembroke, and on llth August he was surprised in Strathfillan, where
                    he had taken refuge, by Lord Lorn. The ladies of his family were sent to
                    Kildrummy in January, and Bruce, almost without a follower, fled to Rathlin, an
                    island off Antrim (Ireland). Edward, though suffering from his last illness,
                    came to the north in the following spring. On his way he granted the Scottish
                    estates of Bruce and his adherents to his own followers, Annandale falling to
                    the earl of Hereford. At Carlisle there was published a bull excommunicating
                    Bruce, along with another absolving Edward from the oath he had taken to observe
                    Magna Charta and the other charters on which the English constitution rests.
                    Elizabeth the wife, Marjory the daughter, Christina the sister of Bruce, were
                    captured in a sanctuary at Tain and sent prisoners to England. The countess of
                    Buchan was confined in a cage at Berwick and another of Bruce’s sisters, Mary,
                    in a cage at Roxburgh. The bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow and the abbot of
                    Scone were suspended from their benefices and sent as prisoners to the south of
                    England. Nigel Bruce, his youngest brother, was beheaded at Berwick, Christopher
                    Seton, his brother-in-law, at Dumfries. The earl of Atlιole was sent to London
                    and hanged on a gallows 30 feet higher than the pole on which the head of
                    Wallace still stood. Two other brothers of Bruce, Thomas and Alexander (dean of
                    Glasgow), met the same fate at Carlisle. There were many minor victims, but the
                    chronicler of Lanercost notes that the number of those who wished Bruce to be
                    confirmed in the kingdom increased daily. While thus wreaking his vengeance
                    Edward himself was summoned by death at Burgh-on-the-Sands, on the Solway,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n617/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0617-0594"/>
                <p>on 7th June 1307. By his dying wish the inscription “Edwardus Primus, Scotorum
                    Malleus, Pactum Serva was put on his tomb. In a moment all was changed. Instead
                    of being opposed to the greatest, Bruce now had as his antagonist the feeblest
                    of the Plantagenets. Quitting Rathlin (after a short stay in Arran), Bruce had
                    before Edward’s death attempted to take Turnberry and Ayr, but had failed,
                    though he defeated Pembroke at Loudoun Hill. No sooner was his father dead than
                    Edward II. recalled his banished favourite Gaveston. After wasting the critical
                    moment of the war in the diversions of a youthful court, the new king made an
                    inglorious march to Cumnock and back without striking a blow, and then returned
                    south to celebrate his marriage with Isabella of F rance, leaving the war to a
                    succession of generals. Bruce, with the insight of military genius, seized his
                    opportunity. Leaving Edward, now his only brother in blood and almost his equal
                    in arms, in Galloway, he suddenly transferred his own operations to
                    Aberdeenshire. In the end of 1307 and again in May 1308 he overran Buchan, where
                    at Inverury on 22d May he defeated its earl, one of his chief Scottish
                    opponents. Then crossing to Argyll he surprised Lord Lorn in the Pass of Brander
                    and took Dunstaffnage. In 1309 a truce, scarcely kept, was effected by the pope
                    and Philip of France, and in 1310, in a general council at Dundee, the clergy of
                    Scotland—all the bishops being present—reoognized Bruce as king. The support
                    given him by the national church in spite of his excommunication must have been
                    of great importance in that age, and was probably due to the example of
                    Lamberton. The next three years were signalized by the reduction one by one of
                    the strong places the English still held,—Linlithgow in the end of 1310,
                    Dumbarton in October 1311, Perth by Bruce himself in January 1312. Encouraged by
                    these successes, he made a raid into the north of England, and on his return
                    reduced Butel (in Galloway), Dumfries, and Dalswinton, and threatened Berwick.
                    In March 1313 Sir James Douglas surprised Roxburgh, and Randolph surprised
                    Berwick. In May Bruce was again in England, and, though he failed to take
                    Carlisle, he subdued the Isle of Man. Edward Bruce about the same time took
                    Ruther-glen and laid siege to Stirling, whose governor, Mowbray, agreed to
                    capitulate if not relieved before 24th June 1314. Bruce’s rapidity of movement
                    was one cause of his success. His sieges, the most difficult part of mediaeval w
                    <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> arfare, though won sometimes by stratagem, prove
                    that he and his followers had benefited from their early training in the wars of
                    Edward I. We know that he had been specially employed by that king to prepare
                    the siege-train for his attack on Stirling. By the close of 1313 Berwick and
                    Stirling alone remained English. Edward II. felt that if Scotland was not to be
                    lost a great effort must be made. With the whole available feudal levy of
                    England, a contingent from Ireland, and recruits even out of jails—for murderers
                    were pardoned on condition of joining the army —he advanced from Berwick to
                    Falkirk, which, he reached on 22d June. After a preliminary skirmish on Sunday
                    the 23d, in which Bruce distinguished himself by a personal combat with Henry de
                    Bohun, whom he felled by a single blow of his axe, the battle of Bannockburn was
                    fought on Monday the 24th; and the complete rout of the English determined the
                    independence of Scotland and confirmed the title of Bruce. The details of the
                    day, memorable in the history of war as well as of Scotland, have been
                    singularly well preserved, and redound to the credit of Bruce, who had studied
                    in the school of Wallace as well as in that of Edward I. He had chosen and knew
                    his ground,—the New Park between St Ninian’s and the Bannock, a petty burn, yet
                    sufficient to produce marshes dangerous to heavily-armed horsemen, while from
                    the rising ground on his right the enemy’s advance was seen. His troops were in
                    four divisions; his brother commanded the right, Randolph the centre, Douglas
                    the left. Bruce with the reserve planted his standard at the Bore Stone, whence
                    there is the best view of the field. His camp-followers on the Gillies’ Hill
                    appeared over its crest at the critical moment which comes in all battles. The
                    plain on the right of the marshes was prepared with pits and spikes. But what
                    more than any other point of strategy made the fight famous was that the Scots
                    fought on foot in battalions with their spears outwards, in a circular formation
                    serving the same purpose as the modern square. A momentary success of the
                    English archers was quickly reversed by a flank movement of Sir Robert Keith.
                    The Scottish bowmen followed up his advantage, and the fight became general; the
                    English horse, crowded into too narrow a space, were met by the steady
                    resistance of the Scottish pikemen, who knew Bruce told them truly that they
                    fought for their country, their wives, their children, and all that freemen hold
                    dear. The English rear was unable to come up in the narrow space or got
                    entangled in the broken ranks of the van. The first repulse soon passed into a
                    rout, and from a rout into a headlong flight, in which Edward himself barely
                    escaped. Like Courtrai and Morgarten, Bannockburn marked the momentous change
                    from mediaeval to modern warfare. The armed knights gave place to the common
                    soldiers led by skilful generals as the arbiters of the destiny of nations. In
                    the career of Bruce it was the turning-point. The enthusiasm of the nation he
                    had saved forgot his late adhesion to the popular cause, and at the parliament
                    of Ayr on 25th April 1315 the succession was settled by a unanimous voice on
                    him, and, failing males of his body, on his brother Edward and his heirs male,
                    failing whom on his daughter Marjory and her heirs, if she married with his
                    consent Soon after she married Walter the Steward.</p>
                <p>The last part of Bruce’s life, from 1315 to 1329, began with an attempt which was
                    the most striking testimony that could have been given to the effect of
                    Bannockburn, and which, had it succeeded, might have altered the future of the
                    British Isles. This was no less than the rising of the whole Celtic race, who
                    had felt the galling yoke of Edward I. and envied the freedom the Scots had won.
                    In 1315 Edward Bruce crossed to Ireland on the invitation of the natives, and in
                    the following year the Welsh became his allies. In autumn Robert came to his
                    brother, and they together traversed Ireland to Limerick. Dublin was saved by
                    its inhabitants committing it to the flames, and, though nineteen victories were
                    won, of which that at Slane in Louth by Robert was counted the chief, the
                    success was too rapid to be permanent. The brothers retreated to Ulster, and,
                    Robert having left Ireland to protect his own borders, Edward was defeated and
                    killed at Dundalk in October 1318. On his return Bruce addressed himself to the
                    siege of Berwick, a standing menace to Scotland. While preparing for it two
                    cardinals arrived in England with a mission from Pope John XXII. to effect a
                    truce, or, failing that, to renew the excommunication of Bruce. The cardinals
                    did not trust themselves across the border; their messengers, however, were
                    courteously received by Bruce, but with a firm refusal to admit the bulls into
                    his kingdom because not addressed to him as king. Another attempt by Newton,
                    guardian of the Friars Minor at Berwick, had a more ignominious result. Bruce
                    admitted Newton to his presence at Aldcamus, where he might see the works for
                    the siege going on by night and day, and was informed that Bruce would not
                    receive the bulls until his title was acknowledged and he had taken Berwick. On
                    his return Newton was waylaid and his papers seized, not without suspicion of
                    Bruce’s connivance.</p>

                <p>In March 1318 first the town and then the castle of Berwick capitulated, and
                    Bruce wasted the English border as far as Ripon. In December he held a
                    parliament at Scone, where he displayed the same wisdom as a legislator which he
                    had shown as a general. The death of his brother and his daughter rendered a
                    resettlement of the crown advisable, which was made in the same order as before,
                    with a provision as to the regency in case of a minor heir in favour of
                    Randolph, and failing him Douglas. The defence of the country was next cared for
                    by regulations for the arming of the whole nation, down to every one who owned
                    the value of a cow,—a measure far in advance of the old feudal levy. Exports
                    during war and of arms at any time were prohibited. Internal justice was
                    regulated, and it was declared that it was to be done to poor and rich alike.
                    Leasing-making—a Scottish term for seditious language—was to be sternly
                    punished. The nobles were exhorted not to oppress the commons. Reforms were also
                    made in the tedious technicalities of the feudal law. In 1319 an attempt to
                    recover Berwick was repelled by Walter the Steward, and Bruce took occasion of a
                    visit to compliment his son-in-law and raise the walls 10 feet.</p>
                <p>His position was now so strong that foreign states began to testify their
                    respect. Bruges and Ypres rejected a request of Edward tp cut off the Scottish
                    trade with Flanders. The pope, who had excommunicated Bruce, was addressed by
                    the parliament of Arbroath in 1320 in a letter which compared Bruce to a Joshua
                    or Judas Maccabaeus, who had wrought the salvation of his people, and declared
                    they fought “not for glory, truth, or honour, but for that liberty which no
                    virtuous man will survive.” Moved by this language and conscious of the weakness
                    of Edward, the pope exhorted him to make peace with Scotland, and three years
                    later Randolph at last procured the recognition of Bruce as king from the papal
                    see by promising aid in a crusade. In 1326 the French king made a similar
                    acknowledgment by the treaty of Corbeil. Meantime hostilities more or less
                    constant continued with England, but, though in 1322 Edward made an incursion as
                    far as Edinburgh, the fatal internal weakness of his government prevented his
                    gaining any real success. Some of his chief nobles—Lancaster in 1321 and Sir
                    Andrew Hartcla in 1322—entered into correspondence with the Scots, and, though
                    Hartcla’s treason was detected and punished by his death, Edward was forced to
                    make a treaty for a long truce of thirteen years at Newcastle on 30th May, which
                    Bruce ratified at Berwick. The intrigue of the queen with Roger Mortimer led to
                    the end of the ignominious reign by Edward’s deposition and murder in 1327; and
                    one of the first acts of the new reign, after a narrow escape of the young king
                    from capture by Randolph, was the treaty of York, ratified at Northampton in
                    April 1328, by which it was agreed that “Scotland, according to its ancient
                    bounds in the days of Alexander III., should remain to Robert, king of Scots,
                    and his heirs free and divided from England, without any subjection, servitude,
                    claim or demand whatsoever.” Johanna, Edward’s sister, was to be given in
                    marriage to David, the infant son of Bruce, and the ceremony was celebrated at
                    Berwick on 12th July.</p>
                <p>The chief author of Scottish independence barely survived his work. His last
                    years had been spent chiefly at the castle of Cardross on the Clyde, which he
                    acquired in 1326, and the conduct of war, as well as the negotiations for peace,
                    had been left to the young leaders Randolph and Douglas, whose training was one
                    of Bruce’s services to his country. Ever active, he employed himself in the
                    narrower sphere of repairing the castle and improving its domains and gardens,
                    in shipbuilding on the Clyde, and in the exercise of the royal virtues of
                    hospitality and charity. The religious feeling, which had not been absent even
                    during the struggles of manhood, deepened in old age, and took the form the
                    piety of the times prescribed. He made careful provision for his funeral, his
                    tomb, and masses for his soul. He procured from the pope a bull authorizing his
                    confessor to absolve him even at the moment of death. He died from leprosy,
                    contracted in the hardships of earlier life, on 7th June 1329, and was buried at
                    Dunfermline beside his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh, whom he had married
                    about 1304, and who bore him late his only son, David, who succeeded him. Of two
                    surviving daughters, Matilda married Thomas Ysaak, a simple esquire, and
                    Margaret became the wife of William, earl of Sutherland. Marjory, an only child
                    by his first wife, Isabella of Mar, had predeceased him. Several children not
                    born in wedlock have been traced in the records, but none of them became in any
                    λvay famous.</p>
                <p>In fulfilment of a vow to visit the Holy Sepulchre, which he could not accomplish
                    in person, Bruce requested Douglas to carry his heart there, but his faithful
                    follower perished on the way, fighting in Spain against the Moors, and the heart
                    of Bruce, recovered by Sir William Keith, found its resting-place at Melrose.
                    When his corpse was disinterred in 1819 the breast-bone was found severed to
                    admit of the removal of the heart, thus confirming the story preserved in the
                    verses of Barbour. That national poet collected in the earliest Scottish poem,
                    written in the reign of Bruce’s grandson, the copious traditions which clustered
                    round his memory. It is a panegyric; but history has not refused to accept it as
                    a genuine representation of the character of the great king, in spirit, if not
                    in every detail. Its dominant note is freedom—the liberty of the nation from
                    foreign bondage, and of the individual from oppression. It is the same note
                    which Tacitus embodied in the speech of Galgacus at the dawn of Scottish
                    history. Often as it has been heard before and since in the course of history,
                    seldom has it had a more illustrious champion than Robert the Bruce. (Ae.
