                    hereditament, that is, a profit issuing out of a corporeal hereditament (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Real Estate).</hi> A rent issuing but of an incorporeal
                    hereditament can only be possessed by the crown, or by a subject under statutory
                    authority. Rent is said to lie in <hi rend="italic">render</hi> , as
                    distinguished from profits <hi rend="italic">d prendre</hi> in general, which
                    are said to lie in <hi rend="italic">prender.</hi> At the present day rent is
                    generally a sum of money paid for the occupation of land. It is important to
                    notice that this conception of rent is attained at a comparatively late period
                    of history. The earliest rent seems to have been a form of personal service,
                    generally labour on the land, and w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as at the same
                    time fixed by custom. The exaction of a competition or rack rent beyond that
                    limited by custom was, if one may judge from the old Brehon law of Ireland, due
                    to the presence upon the land of strangers in blood, probably at first outcasts
                    from some other group. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“The three rents, viz., rack rent from a person of a strange tribe, a fair
                    rent from one of the tribe, and the stipulated rent which is paid equally by the
                    tribe and the strange tribe.”—Senchus Mor, p. 159, cited by Maine, Village
                    Communities, p. 180. </p></note> The strict feudal theory of rent admitted
                    labour on the lord’s land as a lower form, and at the same time developed the
                    military service due to the crown or a lord as a, higher form. Rent service is
                    at once the oldest and the most dignified kind of existing rent. It is the only
                    one to which the power of distress attaches at common law, giving the landlord a
                    preferential right over other creditors exercisable without judicial authority
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Distress).</hi> In course of time the increasing
                    importance of socage tenure, arising in part from the convenience of paying a
                    certain amount, whether in money or kind, rather than comparatively uncertain
                    services, led to the gradual evolution of the modern view of rent as a sum due
                    by contract between two independent persons. At the same time the primitive
                    feeling which regarded the position of landlord and tenant from a social rather
                    than a commercial point of view is still of importance.</p>
                <p>Rents as they now exist in England are divided into three great classes—rent
                    service, rent charge, and rent seek. A rent service is so called because by it a
                    tenure by means of service is created between the landlord and the tenant. The
                    service is now represented by fealty, and is nothing more than nominal. Rent
                    service is said to be incident to the reversion, that is, a grant of the
                    reversion carries the rent with it (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Remainder).</hi> A
                    power of distress is incident at common law to this form of rent. Copyhold rents
                    and rents reserved on lease fall into this class. A rent charge is a grant of an
                    annual sum payable out of lands in which the grantor has an estate. It may be in
                    fee, in tail, for life, or for years. It must be created by deed or will, and
                    may be either at common law or under the Statute of Uses. The grantor has no
                    reversion, and the grantee has at common law no power of distress.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0420-0403"/>
                <p>Such power must have been given him by the instrument creating the rent charge.
                    The Statute of Uses, 27 Hen. VIII. c. 10, gave a power of distress for a rent
                    charge created under the statute. The Conveyancing Act, 1881, 44 &amp; 45 Vict.
                    c. 41, § 44, now gives a power of distress for a sum due on any rent charge
                    which is twenty-one days in arrear. By § 45 a power of redemption of certain
                    perpetual rents in the nature of rent charges is given to the owner of the land
                    out of which the rent issues. Rent charges granted since April 26, 1855,
                    otherwise than by marriage settlement or will for a life or lives or for any
                    estate determinable on a life or lives must, in order to bind lands against
                    purchasers, mortgagees, or creditors, be registered in the central office of the
                    Supreme Court (18 <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> 19 Vict. c. 15). In certain other
                    cases it is also necessary to register rent charges, for instance, under the
                    Improvement of Land Act, 1864, and the Land Transfer Act, 1875. Forms of rent
                    charge of special interest are tithe rent charge (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tithes),</hi> ground rents, and the rent charges for the purpose of conferring
                    votes usually called “faggot votes.” Ground rents are rent charges in fee simple
                    issuing out of land sold for building purposes. The lessee erects buildings
                    according to the terms of the lease, making his profit by subletting either at a
                    rack rent or on the terms of a fine on entrance into possession, with an annual
                    rent slightly larger than the ground rent. In the latter case the rent is called
                    an improved ground rent. Ground rents are regarded as particularly eligible
                    investments owing to the extent of the security afforded. Rent charges of the
                    annual value of 40s. for the purpose of creating votes are now rendered
                    ineffective by the Representation of the People Act, 1884, 48 Vict. c. 3, § 4,
                    which enacts (subject to a saving for existing rights and an exception in favour
                    of owners of tithe rent charge) that a man shall not be entitled to be
                    registered as a voter in respect of the ownership of any rent charge. A rent
                    seek <hi rend="italic">(redditus siccus)</hi> is a rent charge reserved without
                    power of distress. But, as power of distress for rent seek was given by 4 Geo.
                    II. c. 28, the legal effect of such rent has been since the Act the same as that
                    of a rent charge. There are varieties of these main divisions of rent to which
                    special names are given. Rents of assize or quit rents are a relic of the old
                    customary rents. They are presumed to have been established by usage, and cannot
                    be increased or diminished. They are found only in manors. Those paid by the
                    freeholders are also called chief rents. Fee farm rents are rents reserved on
                    grants in fee. According to some authorities they must be at least one-fourth of
                    the value of the lands. They, like quit rents, now occur only in manors, unless
                    existing before the Statute of <hi rend="italic">Quia Emptores</hi> or created
                    by the crown (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Real Estate).</hi> A rent which is
                    equivalent or nearly equivalent in amount to the full annual value of the land
                    is a rack rent. A dead rent is a fixed annual sum paid by a person working a
                    mine or quarry, in addition to royalties varying according to the amount of
                    minerals taken. Rents in kind still exist to a limited extent; thus the
                    corporation of London is tenant of some lands in Shropshire by payment to the
                    crown of an annual rent of a faggot. All pepper-corn or nominal rents seem to
                    fall under this head. Services rendered in lieu of payment by tenants in grand
                    and petit serjeanty may also be regarded as examples of rents in kind. Labour
                    rents are represented by those cases, not unfrequent in agricultural leases,
                    where the tenant is bound to render the landlord a certain amount of team work
                    or other labour as a part of his rent. It was held in the Queen’s Bench in 1845
                    that tenants who occupied houses on the terms of sweeping the parish church and
                    of ringing the church bell paid rent within the meaning of the Limitation Act of
                    3 &amp; 4 Will. IV., c. 27.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Apportionment.</hi> —In regard to estate a rent service is
                    apportion -able at common law, as well as under certain Acts of Parliament, such
                    as the Land Clauses Act. A rent charge was formerly not apportionable, for it
                    issued out of every part of the land and was at the same time in contemplation
                    of law against common right as not being incident to tenure. The legal effect of
                    this was that (with some exceptions) a release of part of the land out of which
                    a rent charge issued was a release of the whole. It was provided by 22 <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> 23 Vict. c. 35, § 10, that the release from a rent charge
                    of part of the hereditaments charged does not extinguish the whole rent charge,
                    but operates only to bar the right to recover any part of the rent charge out of
                    the hereditaments released. In regard to time, at common law no kind of rent was
                    apportionable. The effect of this was that if the person entitled to the rent
                    died between rent days no rent was due to the succeeding reversioner for the
                    intermediate period. This was remedied by 11 Geo. II. c. 19, and other Acts,
                    which are now practically superseded by the Apportionment Act, 1870, 33 &amp; 34
                    Vict. c. 35. By this Act all rents are, in the absence of stipulation to the
                    contrary, to be considered as accruing from day to day, and apportionable in
                    respect of time accordingly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Remedies.</hi> —Rent is due in the morning of the day appointed
                    for payment, but is not in arrear until after midnight. It should be demanded
                    just before sunset. The landlord has besides distress his ordinary remedy by
                    action. In addition special statutory remedies are given in the case of tenants
                    holding over after the expiration of their tenancy. By 11 Geo. II. c. 19 any
                    tenant giving notice to quit and holding over is liable to pay double rent for
                    such time as he continues in possession. By 1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 74 a tenant at a
                    rent not exceeding £20 per annum who fails to deliver up possession after his
                    interest has ended may be ejected by summary proceedings before justices. By 19
                    &amp; 20 Vict. c. 108 a similar remedy is given in the county court where the
                    rent does not exceed £50 per annum. Analogous provisions are contained in Acts
                    dealing with the metropolitan district. It should be noticed that, since the
                    writing of the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Distress,</hi> the landlord’s power
                    of distress has been considerably limited in the case of agricultural tenancies
                    falling within the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1883, 46 &amp; 47 Vict. c. 61. §
                    44 confines the right of distress to one year’s arrears of rent instead of six
                    years’ arrears, which could be distrained for before the Act. An extension of
                    time is allowed in cases where in the ordinary course of dealing between
                    landlord and tenant the payment of rent has been allowed to be deferred for a
                    quarter or half year after the rent became legally due. By § 45 live stock
                    belonging to another person and taken in by a tenant to be fed has a qualified
                    privilege from distress; that is, it is not distrainable where there is other
                    sufficient distress to be found. If so distrained for want of other sufficient
                    distress, it may be redeemed by the owner on payment of any sum due for the
                    feeding. Agricultural or other machinery on the premises of the tenant for hire
                    or use and live stock on the premises solely for breeding purposes are
                    absolutely privileged from distress. The Act further makes appraisement before
                    sale unnecessary, and enacts that bailiffs to levy distress are to be appointed
                    by county court judges. For other provisions of the Act dealing with procedure,
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Replevin.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ireland.</hi> —The main
                    differences between Irish and English law have been caused by legislation (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Landlord and Tenant).</hi> One of the most noticeable is
                    the power of ejectment for non-payment of rent given by 23 &amp; 24 Vict. c.
                    154. In England such a power can only be conferred by express agreement.</p>

                    English equivalent is the fee farm rent. Rents are recovered by an action of
                    maills and duties in the Sheriff Court or the.Court of Session, and in
                    non-agricultural tenancies by hypothec. The right of hypothec over land
                    exceeding 2 acres in ext! nt let for agriculture or pasture has been abolished
                    as from November 11, 1881 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hypo</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">thec).</hi> The Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1883, 46
                    &amp; 47 Viet, c. 62, provides by § 27 that when six months’ rent of the holding
                    is due and unpaid the landlord may raise an action of removing before the
                    sheriff against the tenant, concluding for his removal at the term of Whitsunday
                    or Martinmas next ensuing; and, unless the arrears are paid or caution is found,
                    the sheriff may decern the tenant to remove. The tenant so removed has the
                    rights of an outgoing tenant. Labour or service rents were at one time very
                    frequent in Scotland. The events of 1715 and 1745 showed the vast influence over
                    the tenantry that the great proprietors acquired by such means. Accordingly the
                    Acts of 1 Geo. I., sess. 2, c. 54, and 20 Geo. II. c. 50, provided for the
                    commutation of services into money rents. Such services may still be created by
                    agreement, subject to the summary power of commutation by the sheriff given by
                    the Conveyancing Act, 1874, 37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 94, §§ 20, 21. <hi

                <p>United States.—Agricultural rents are, from the different position of the
                    cultivators of the land, of less importance than in England. The law is in
                    general accordance with that of England. The tendency of modern State
                    legislation is unfavourable to the continuance of distress as a remedy. In some
                    States, such as Ohio and Tennessee, it never existed. Fee farm rents exist in
                    some States, like Pennsylvania, which have not adopted the Statute of Quia
                    Emptores as a part of their common law. (J. Wf.)</p>
