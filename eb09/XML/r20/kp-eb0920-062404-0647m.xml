                    assiduity and accuracy, and that familiarity with the commerce of the country,
                    which distinguished his public career. In 1781 he married Manon Jeanne Phlipon,
                    who was his junior by twenty-two years. She was the daughter of Gratien Phlipon,
                    a Paris engraver, who was ambitious, speculative, and nearly always poor. From
                    her early years she showed great aptitude for study, an ardent and enthusiastic
                    spirit, and unquestionable talent. She was to a considerable extent self-taught;
                    and her love of reading made her acquainted first with Plutarch—a passion for
                    which author she continued to cherish throughout her life —thereafter with
                    Bossuet, Massillon, and authors of a like stamp, and finally with Montesquieu,
                    Voltaire, and Rousseau. These studies marked stages of her development; and as
                    her mind matured she abandoned the idea of a convent which for a year or two she
                    had entertained, and added to the enthusiasm for a republic which she had
                    imbibed from her earlier studies not a little of the cynicism and the daring
                    which the later authors inspired. She almost equalled her husband in knowledge
                    and infinitely excelled him in talent and in tact. Through and with him she
                    exercised a singularly powerful influence over the destinies of France from the
                    outbreak of the Revolution till her death.</p>
                <p>For four years after their marriage Roland lived at Amiens, he being still an
                    inspector of manufactures; but his knowledge of commercial affairs enabled him
                    to contribute articles to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie Nouvelle,</hi> in
                    which, as in all his literary work, he was assisted by his wife. On their
                    removal to Lyons the influence of both became wider and more powerful. Their
                    fervent political aspirations could not be concealed, and from the beginning of
                    the Revolution they threw in their lot with the party of advance. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Courrier de Lyon</hi> contained articles the success of which
                    reached even to the capital and attracted the attention of the Parisian press.
                    They were from the pen of Madame Roland and were signed by her husband. A
                    correspondence sprang up with Brissot and other friends of the Revolution at
                    headquarters. In Lyons their views were publicly known; Roland was elected a
                    member of the municipality, and when the depression of trade in the south
                    demanded representation in Paris he was deputed by the council of Lyons to
                    defend the interests of the city before the constituent assembly. Accompanied by
                    his wife, he appeared in the capital in February 1791.</p>
                <p>They had made many and influential friends in advance, and Madame Roland’s salon
                    soon became the rendezvous of Brissot, Pétion, Robespierre, and other leaders of
                    the popular movement. In person Madame Roland was attractive though not
                    beautiful; her ideas were clear and far-reaching, her manner calm, and her power
                    of observation extremely acute. It was almost inevitable that she should find
                    herself in the centre of political aspirations and presiding over a company of
                    the most talented men of progress. Her resolve was fixed, and gradually she
                    impressed it upon all: the France of 1791 was a France of transition; a republic
                    alone was its destiny, was the ideal of philosophy, the expression of liberty,
                    the goal of history. This was the constant aim of her influence and her speech;
                    it was accompanied with a petty animosity, almost hatred, towards the king and
                    queen; but it found a ready echo in the minds of those leaders who willingly
                    admired her calm and learned reasoning. The royal flight in - June and the
                    ignominious return lent impetus to these ideas; a journal entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Republican</hi> appeared in Paris, but at its second number
                    was suppressed. In its organization Madame Roland had a hand.</p>
                <p>In September 1791, Roland’s mission being executed, they returned to Lyons.
                    Meanwhile the inspectorships of manufactures had been abolished; he was thus
                    free; and they could no longer remain absent from the centre of affairs. In
                    December they again reached Paris. Roland became a member of the Jacobin Club.
                    The rupture had not yet been made evident between the Girondist party and that
                    section still more extreme, that of the Mountain. For a time the whole left
                    united in forcing the resignation of the ministers. When the crisis came the
                    Girondists were ready, and in March 1792 Roland found himself appointed minister
                    of the interior. As a minister of the crown Roland exhibited a remarkable
                    combination of political prejudice with administrative ability. While his wife’s
                    influence could not increase the latter it was successfully exerted to foment
                    and embitter the former. He was <hi rend="italic">ex offidο</hi> excluded from
                    the legislative assembly, and his declarations of policy were thus in
                    writing,—that is, in the form in which she could most readily exert her power. A
                    great occasion was invented. The decrees against the emigrants and the
                    non-juring clergy still remained under the veto of the king. A letter was penned
                    by Madame Roland and addressed by her husband to Louis. It remained unanswered.
                    Thereupon, in full council and in the king’s presence, Roland read his letter
                    aloud. It contained many and terrible truths as to the royal refusal to sanction
                    the decrees and as to the king’s position in the state; but it was inconsistent
                    with a minister’s position, disrespectful if not insolent in tone, disloyal in
                    spirit, and grossly disfigured by repeated threats of violence on the part of
                    the people. It was meant, and it was used, simply as a lecture to the king’s
                    face and as an accusation behind his back. Roland’s dismissal followed. Then he
                    completed the plan: he read the letter to the assembly; it was ordered to be
                    printed, became the manifesto of disaffection, and was circulated everywhere. In
                    the demand for the reinstatement of the dismissed ministers were found the means
                    of humiliation, and the prelude to the dethronement, of the king.</p>
                <p>After the abolition of royalty on the lθth of August, Roland was recalled to
                    power, one of his colleagues being Danton. To his dismay he found that the
                    passions which he had lent his aid in evoking he was powerless to allay, and
                    that the party of the Mountain was, on the contrary, utilizing these passions
                    for purposes of incredible excess. F rom this moment, though too late, the
                    conduct of Roland, his wife, and the whole Gironde became heroic. They
                    fearlessly denounced the massacres of September, Roland writing boldly to the
                    assembly on the subject. Both husband and wife became the butt of calumny and
                    the object of increasing dislike on the part of the
                    ultra-revolutionists,—Robespierre shunning them, Danton denouncing them, and
                    Marat in his journal heaping upon them the foulest falsehoods. Still the
                    Girondists, from Vergniaud downwards, banded themselves bravely on their side;
                    but on 22d January 1793 Roland sent in his resignation. It was the day after the
                    execution of the king.</p>
                <p>Still they remained in Paris, unflinchingly, but with ever less and less success,
                    attempting to regulate and elevate the Revolution. Calumny continued. Once
                    Madame Roland appeared personally in the assembly to repel the falsehoods of an
                    accuser, and her ease and dignity evoked enthusiasm and compelled acquittal. But
                    violence succeeded violence, and early on the morning of the 1st of June she was
                    arrested and thrown into the prison of the Abbaye. Roland himself escaped
                    secretly to shelter in Rouen. Released for an hour from the Abbaye, she was
                    again arrested and thrown among the horrors of Sainte Pélagie. Finally she was
                    transferred to the Conciergerie. In prison she won the affections of the guards,
                    and was allowed the privilege of writing materials and the occasional visits of
                    devoted friends. She there wrote her</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Appeal to an Impartial Postent y,</hi> those memoirs which
                    display a strange alternation between self-laudation and patriotism, between the
                    trivial and the sublime. On 8th November 1793 she was conveyed to the
                    guillotine. Before yielding her head to the block, she bowed before the clay
                    statue of Liberty erected in the Place de la Revolution, uttering her famous
                    apostrophe—“O Liberty! what crimes are committed in thy name !” One week later
                    Roland, having heard of his wife’s death, wandered some miles from his refuge in
                    Rouen; maddened by despair and grief, he wrote a few words expressive of his
                    horror at those massacres which could only be inspired by the enemies of France,
                    protesting that “from the moment when I learned that they had murdered my wife I
                    would no longer remain in a world stained with enemies.” He affixed the paper to
                    his breast, and unsheathing a sword-stick fell upon the weapon, which pierced
                    his heart, on 15th November 1793. (τ. s.)</p>
