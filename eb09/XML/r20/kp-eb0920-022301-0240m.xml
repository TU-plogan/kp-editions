                <p> Railways had their origin in the tramways which were laid more than two hundred
                    years ago in the mineral districts of England for the conveyance of coal to the
                    sea. In those days, before Macadam, roads bearing heavy traffic were with
                    difficulty kept in repair. This led to the plan of laying planks or timbers at
                    the bottom of the ruts as a better contrivance than filling in with stones, and
                    then to laying rails of timber on the level surface. In 1676 tramways consisted
                    of rails of timber laid “from the colliery to the river, exactly straight and
                    parallel, and bulky carts were made with four rollers fitting the rails, whereby
                    the carriage was so easy that one horse would draw down four or five chaldron of
                    coals.” The rails originally were formed of scantlings of good sound oak, and
                    were connected by sills or cross timbers of the same material pinned together
                    with oak trenails. By and by an additional or wearing rail, which could be
                    easily renewed when worn, was placed above the supporting rail, and it was then
                    possible to cover the cross pieces or sleepers with earth to protect them from
                    the horses’ feet. These ways, laid by permission of local proprietors, were
                    called “way-leaves.” It became a common practice to nail down bars of wrought
                    iron on the surfaces of the ascending inclines of the road. These bars or rails
                    were about 2 inches wide and half an inch thick, and were fastened to the wood
                    rails by countersunk spikes. But the iron bars, not being stiff enough, were
                    considerably bent when the trucks were loaded, and the resistance was reduced
                    but slightly below that of a well-constructed double wooden tramway. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The earliest system of way on
                    the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and other railroads in the United States was a
                    simple reproduction of this compound of wood and iron. As the ends of the bars
                    became loose and turned upwards they were known as “suakes’ heads.” Occasionally
                    they pierced the floors of the carriages and injured passengers. </p></note>
                    Nevertheless, while the regular load of coals for one horse on the common road
                    was but 17 cwt., on the tramway the horse could regularly take a load of 42 cwt.
                    Cast-iron was first tried incidentally as a material for rails in 1767 by the
                    Coal-</p>
                <p>brookdale Iron Company.</p>
                <p>The iron rails were cast in lengths offeet, 4 inches wide, and 1^ inches thick,
                    formed with three holes, through which they were fastened to the oak rails.</p>
                <p>The tramway was developed into the railway by the em ployment of cast-iron flange
                    rails (fig. 1) to replace the wooden rails; the continuous flange or ledge on
                    their inner edge kept the wheels on the track. The roads were then called
                    tram-roads, probably as an abbreviation of trammel-roads, the flanges of the
                    rails being in reality trammels to gauge the road and confine the wheels to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n241/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0241-0224"/>the track. The leading objection to this system
                    was that the rail was liable to be covered with dust. Jessop therefore in 1789
                    laid down at Loughborough cast-iron “edge rails,” raised above the ground so as
                    to allow a flanged cast-iron wheel to run on them (fig. 2). This appears to have
                    been the first system of rails laid on cast-iron chairs and on sleepers.</p>
                <p>The rails were pinned or bolted into the chairs. A wrought-iron rail was patented
                    by Birkenshaw in 1820, as the “fish-belly” rail, similar in form and mode of
                    support to Jessop’s rail, but rolled in continuous lengths, embracing a number
                    of spans, with stiffening ledges or flanges on the under side. This form of rail
                    grew into favour. It weighed 33 lb per yard, and was laid in cast-iron chairs,
                    spiked down to square stone blocks at 3-feet bearings (see fig. 3). The edge
                    rail and the flanged wheel constitute the basis of the whole system of a
                    railway. The rails forming a line of way were placed to a gauge or distance
                    apart of 4 feet inches, and two parallel lines of way were spaced with 6 feet
                    between the inner rails of the ways. This interspace is popularly known as the
                    “six-foot.”</p>
                <p>The benefits derived from the use of the tramway or railway for the transport of
                    coal suggested to reflective persons the employment of it for the conveyance of
                    general merchandise and of passengers. For the conveyance of heavy merchandise
                    inland the canals little more than sixty years ago furnished the principal
                    means. Though there were three such water-routes between Liverpool and
                    Manchester, they were sometimes so crowded that cotton took a month to pass from
                    the seaport to the manufacturing towns in the interior; yet the whole of the
                    merchandise passing between Liverpool and Manchester did not average more than
                    1200 tons a day. The average rate of carriage was 18s. per ton, and the average
                    time of transit on the 50 miles of canal was thirty-six hours. The conveyance of
                    passengers by the improved coach-roads was comparatively rapid, but it was very
                    costly. The first great movement to mend this state of things was the passing of
                    the Act in 1821 for the construction of the Stockton and Darlington Railway.
                    Colliery railways were in evidence to prove the benefits of railway
                    communication by steam-power. The Hetton Railway, for instance, in the
                    neighbourhood of Newcastle, from the colliery to the river Wear, was 7 miles
                    long, and trains of 60 tons net weight were taken over the line at a speed of 44
                    miles per hour. On the Killingworth Railway an engine and tender weighing 10
                    tons drew a load of 40 tons at a speed of 6 miles per hour, consuming 50 fl&gt;
                    of coal per mile run. Whilst animal-power only was at first relied on for
                    working the Stockton and Darlington</p>
                <p>Railway, the Act provided for working with men and horses or “otherwise.” By
                    another Act applied for at the request of George Stephenson, who became engineer
                    to the line, the company was empowered to work the railway with locomotive
                    engines. The line, with three branches, was over 38 miles in length, and was at
                    first laid as a single line, with passing places at intervals of a quarter of a
                    mile, the way being constructed with wrought-iron fish belly rails, weighing 28
                    ft&gt; per yard. It was opened in September 1825 by a train of thirty-four
                    vehicles, making a gross load of about 90 tons, drawn by one engine driven by
                    Stephenson, with a signalman on horseback in advance. The train moved off at the
                    rate of from 10 to 12 miles an hour, and attained a speed of 15 miles per hour
                    on favourable parts of the line. A train weighing 92 tons could be drawn by one
                    engine at the rate of 5 miles per hour. The principal business of the new
                    railway was the conveyance of minerals and goods, but from the first passengers
                    insisted upon being carried, and in October 1825 the company began to run a
                    daily coach, called the “Experiment,” to carry six inside, and from fifteen to
                    twenty outside, making the journey from Darlington to Stockton and back in two
                    hours. The fare was Is., and each passenger was allowed to take baggage not
                    exceeding 14 Bb weight. The rate for carriage of merchandise was reduced from
                    5d. to one-fifth of a penny per ton per mile, and that of minerals from 7d. to
                    Hd. per ton per mile. The price of coals at Darlington fell from 18s. to 8s. 6d.
                    per ton.</p>
                <p>The Monklands Railway in Scotland, opened in 1826, was the first to follow the
                    example of the Stockton and Darlington line, and several other small
                    lines—including the Canterbury and Whitstable, worked partly by fixed engines
                    and partly by locomotives—quickly adopted steam-traction. But the inauguration
                    of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, opened in 1829, made the first great
                    impression on the national mind that a revolution in the modes of travelling had
                    really taken place. In 1838 a line was opened between London and Birmingham, and
                    the first train accomplished the whole distance—112^ miles—at an average speed
                    of over 20 miles per hour. The London and Greenwich, the London and Southampton,
                    the Great Western, Birmingham and Derby, Bristol and Exeter, Eastern Counties,
                    Manchester and Leeds, Grand Junction, Midland Counties, North Midland,
                    South-Eastern, London and Brighton, Manchester and Birmingham, and Edinburgh and
                    Glasgow, together with many small Bills, were all passed within four years from
                    the time of the passing of the London and Birmingham Bill. Thus in the course of
                    four or five years the foundations were laid of most of the existing trunk lines
                    of railway in Great Britain. The original Liverpool and Manchester line, 3(4
                    miles in length, now forms part of a network of lines, the property of one
                    company, nearly 1800 miles in extent, representing a capital invested in railway
                    works and plant of &lt;£100,000,000.</p>
                <p>Meantime the construction of the way was the subject of much consideration. The
                    fish-belly form of wrought-iron rail was troublesome to roll, and so the
                    flat-bottom or flat-foot rail (fig. 4) was designed, combining a solid head with
                    a flange base. This rail, with holes through the · flange to hold the spikes,
                    was used to some extent, and was laid on longitudinal timber sleepers, and also
                    on transverse sleepers. The disadvantage was want of vertical stiffness of the
                    system; and, if the rail was made higher, it was liable to rock on the sleeper
                    and work loose on the spikes. This rail, known as the Yignoles rail, has been
                    much improved in form and proportions and is extensively used. The bridge rail
                    (fig. 5)—so called <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n242/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0242-0225"/>because it was first laid on bridges—was that
                    first used on the Great Western Railway, and is of a shallow section, but wide,
                    and possessed of lateral stiffness. The first line was a series of beech piles,
                    12 inches square, driven into the ground, to which were bolted at the surface
                    level cross balks of timber, one on each side of the pilehead on which they were
                    shouldered. Longitudinal balks, 15 feet long, were laid on the cross balks. The
                    longitudinals were covered with oak or elm planking screwed down to the surface.
                    When the ballast was packed under the longitudinal balks, the surface of the oak
                    planks was planed level, and the bridge rails screwed down on them, with felt
                    between. It was supposed that there would be no yielding whatever, but a very
                    short time demonstrated that the piles formed a series of solid resistances,
                    while the balks between sprang, and it was found necessary to cut away the
                    piles. Transoms were then framed into the longitudinals and secured by
                    strap-bolts, and the whole resembled a long ladder laid on the ground. Eight
                    different sections of rails were tried in succession; one section measured l¿
                    inches in height by 7 inches in width, weighing 41 lb per yard; and the last
                    section 2f inches high by 6 inches wide, weighing 62 K) per yard. The screws
                    which held down the rails were counter-sunk beneath the wheel-flanges, and
                    nut-headed on the other side (see fig. 6). In consequence of the want of depth
                    in the rails, they bent longitudinally under the wheels, and the horizontal
                    flanges curled up at the sides, while the holes through them bent into angles.
                    One remedy tried was to cross-board the longitudinal timbers on the surface, and
                    thus the fibre was made less yielding.</p>
                <p>The double-headed rail (fig. 7) was originated by Joseph Locke, and was first
                    laid on the Grand Junction Railway. It also weighed 62 lb per yard. The two
                    tables were equal; the rail was more easily rolled than others, and, being
                    reversible, it was in fact two rails in one. But as it was laid in cast-iron
                    chairs the lower table was exposed to damage under the hammering of the traffic;
                    and many engineers were led to make the lower table of smaller size, as in fig.
                    8, merely as a support, not as a surface to be used by the wheels. This rail,
                    which acquired the title of “bull-headed,” was, like the flat-foot and bridge
                    rails, used as a prop supported on its base. There was a waste of metal in these
                    early rails, both flat-foot and double-headed, owing to the excessive thickness
                    of the vertical web, which has been corrected in recent designs.</p>
                <p>It was found, naturally, that rails would not rest in their chairs at the joints,
                    but were loosened and bruised at the ends by the blows of the traffic. The
                    fish-joint was therefore devised in 1847 by Mr W.</p>
                <p>Bridges Adams, the intention being by “fishing” the joints to convert the rails
                    into continuous beams. In the original design two chairs were placed, one under
                    each rail, a few inches apart, as in fig. 9. The joint was thus suspended
                    between the two chairs, and two keys of iron, called “fishes,” fitting the side
                    channels of the rails, were driven in on each side between the chairs and the
                    rails. In subsequent modifications the fishes were, and they continue to be,
                    bolted to and through the rails, the sleepers being placed further apart, and
                    the joint suspended between them.</p>
                <p>In the employment of steam-power for traction on railways rapid progress was made
                    in response to the demand for power. The year 1829 is famous in the annals of
                    railways not only for the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester line but for
                    the invention and construction of the first high-speed locomotive of the
                    standard modern type. Robert Stephenson’s engine, the “Rocket,” was made under
                    competition for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and it gained the prize
                    for lightness, power, and speed awarded by the directors. The two
                    steam-cylinders of the “Rocket” w־ere 8 inches in diameter, with 164 inches of
                    stroke, and the driving-wheels were 4 feet 8| inches in diameter. The engine
                    weighed 4 tons 5 cwt., the tender following it 3 tons 4 cwt., and two loaded
                    carriages drawn by it on the trial 9 tons 11 cwt.: thus the weight drawn was 12
                    tons 15 cwt., and the gross total 17 tons. The pressure of steam in the boiler
                    was 50 ft&gt; per square inch. An average speed of 14 miles per hour was
                    attained, the greatest velocity being 29 miles per hour; and the boiler
                    evaporated 18^ cubic feet, or 114 gallons, of water per hour. The “Rocket”
                    possessed the three elements of efficiency of the modern locomotive,—the
                    internal water-surrounded fire-box and the multitubular flue in the boiler, or a
                    number of small tubes in place of one large tube; the blast-pipe, by which the
                    waste steam of the engine was exhausted up the chimney; and the direct connexion
                    of the two steam-cylinders, one on each side of the engine, with the driving or
                    propelling wheels, on one axle. The subdivision of the single large flue, up to
                    that time in general use in locomotives, into a number of small tubes greatly
                    accelerated the generation of steam without adding to the size or weight of the
                    boiler. But the evaporating tubes would have been of little avail practically
                    had they not been supplemented by the blast-pipe, which, by ejecting the steam
                    from the engine after it had done its work in the cylinder straight up the
                    chimney, excited a strong draught through the boiler and caused a brisk and
                    rapid combustion of fuel and generation of heat. The heat was absorbed with
                    proportional rapidity through the newly applied heating-tubes. The blast-pipe,
                    thus applied, in conjunction with the multitubular flue, vastly improved the
                    capacity and usefulness of the locomotive. And, taking into account the direct
                    connexion of the steam-cylinder with one axle and pair of wheels, the
                    improvements were tantamount to a new and original machine. The “Rocket”
                    subsequently drew an average gross load of 40 tons behind the tender at a speed
                    of 133־ miles per hour. The old Killingworth engine, one of the earlier type of
                    locomotives constructed by George Stephenson, weighing with its tender 10 tons,
                    could only work at a maximum of 6 miles per hour with 50 tons.</p>
                <p>For many years engines belonged to two general classes. In one class there were
                    six wheels, of which one pair was placed behind the boiler, typified in the
                    engines of the day made by Robert Stephenson; in the other class there were but
                    four wheels, placed under the barrel of the boiler, leaving the fire-box
                    overhung, typified in the engines made by Bury for the London and Birmingham
                    Railway. Experience demonstrated the disadvantage of an overhanging mass, with a
                    very limited wheel-base, in the four-wheeled engine running at high speed; and
                    now it is the general <pb break="no"

                    ordinary locomotive stock. The earliest four-wheeled locomotive constructed by
                    Robert Stephenson and Co. as an article of regular manufacture weighed 9 tons in
                    working order. The six-wheeled engines which followed weighed 11J tons. In the
                    course of business locomotives of greater power and greater weight were
                    constructed; and there are locomotives of the present time which weigh 47∣ tons
                    in working order, and with the tender full of water and coal about 80 tons
                    gross. There are other engines of special design with twelve wheels which weigh
                    in working order, with fuel and water, 72 tons. The contrast is emphasized in
                    the history of the old Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, which was opened about the
                    year 1829. The first engines of that line weighed from 8 to 9 tons. They had
                    steam-cylinders 11 inches in diameter, and 4-feet wheels of cast-iron, with a
                    working pressure in the boiler of 50 lb per square inch. The “Garnkirk” engine
                    used to take a train of three carriages, together weighing 7 tons gross, at the
                    average speed of 16 miles per hour between Glasgow and Gartsherrie. When the old
                    line, 8 miles in length, was merged in the Caledonian Railway, now comprising a
                    system of nearly 1000 miles in length, the power of the engines was greatly
                    increased, and at this day (1885) there are express passenger engines working
                    over the same ground having large cylinders of 17 or 18 inches in diameter, and
                    wheels of 7 and 8 feet in diameter, weighing from 35 to 45 tons. These engines,
                    with steam of 120 R&gt; pressure per square inch, take a gross load of 90 tons
                    at a speed of from 40 to 50 miles per hour.</p>

                    Railway, was 8053 miles (of which nearly one-fourth was single line of way),
                    costing about £35,500 per mile. In 1874 that mileage was doubled (16,449 miles,
                    nearly one-half being only single line), costing about £37,000 per mile.
                    According to the latest published return the length of railways open for traffic
                    at the end of 1883 amounted to 18,681 miles, and the proportion of single line
                    had decreased, being under 46 per cent. Whilst the mileage open was increased at
                    the rate of 420 miles a year during the earlier period (1854-74), it was only
                    increased by 248 miles a year during the later period (1874-83). But many miles
                    of way in multiple have been laid for the working of traffic concentrated on
                    main lines,—127 miles of triple line and 285 of quadruple. The largest share of
                    multiple way belongs to the London and North-Western Railway Company, which owns
                    28 miles of triple way and no less than 114 of quadruple. The principal section
                    of this railway, 80 miles in length, between London and Rugby, is entirely in
                    quadruple,—two lines for goods and two for passenger traffic. Table I. shows the

                <p>In 1857 the ordinary stock was 57 per cent., as against 37’4 per cent, in 1883;
                    and the guaranteed and preferential stock together were but one-third of the
                    ordinary share capital, while in 1883 they equalled it. The English railway
                    system, so far as capital is concerned, has become adjusted to the rule of
                    having rather less than 40 per cent, of the capital in “open stock.” In 1845-46
                    the dividends of railways appear to have reached a maximum. The precipitate
                    influx of new lines during the four years from 1846 to 1850, contests before
                    parliament, competition in various forms, and other causes then came in to
                    depress dividends, and reduced the average proportion of net receipts in 1849 to
                    2 ’ 83 per cent, of the total capital and loans raised at that time. In 1857 the
                    percentage of net receipts had risen again to 4’06 per cent, of the total
                    capital and loans; and notwithstanding the accumulation of preference capital
                    and loans, both taking precedence of ordinary capital, the available dividend on
                    the latter increased from 1 ’ 88 per cent, to 3'6 per cent. Since that time the
                    average dividend paid on ordinary capital has maintained its level at least, and
                    it amounted for 1883 to 4'68 per cent. The average cost per mile open at the end
                    of 1883, calculated on the amount of capital raised, with that for 1857 added

                    earlier works of construction in England, where great expenditure was incurred
                    for the sake of securing long levels and very easy gradients, until Joseph Locke
                    made a new departure, and constructed the Grand Junction Railway on economic
                    principles by following in great part the contour of the surface. For this line
                    and the London and Birmingham line, for which Robert Stephenson was the
                    engineer, Acts were passed in the same year (1833). The latter line was
                    expensively laid out with tunnels, viaducts, and heavy cuttings and embankments,
                    and cost in round numbers £53,600 per mile, as against £23,200 per mile for
                    Locke’s line. The cheaper line abounded in inclines of from 1 in 85 to 1 in 265,
                    whilst the more expensive line was ruled by gradients not steeper than 1 in 330.
                    Locke reckoned upon the sufficiency of the engine-power to take the trains up
                    the inclines, and the famous Crewe engine was the outgrowth of the situation.
                    The London and South-Western Railway, which cost £26,800 per mile, was laid out
                    by Locke to a ruling gradient of 1 in 250. There are other instances of
                    economical construction by the same engineer in the original Caledonian and
                    Scottish Central Railways—now amalgamated—the former of which was made with long
                    gradients of 1 in 75, 1 in 80, 1 in 100, and other steep slopes. Besides these
                    there are other cheaply made railways in Scotland; but there is only one
                    Scottish railway of the monumental class,—the Edinburgh and Glasgow, nearly dead
                    level, with enormously expensive works. On the Metropolitan Railway system, 22
                    miles in length, upwards of £11,000,000 have been paid up, or about £500,000 per
                    mile. The enormous cost of this line, as well as of the Metropolitan District
                    system (18 miles long, costing £374,000 per mile) and the North London system
                    (12 miles long, costing £325,000 per mile), is sufficiently explained by the
                    place and conditions. The original London and Blackwall Railway, built, like the
                    North London, for the most part on arches, cost £311,912 per mile. The original
                    Birkenhead, Cheshire, and Lancashire Junction Railway, now vested in the
                    neighbouring railway companies, cost upwards of £75,000 per mile, owing partly
                    to the protracted contests in which it had been involved with the neighbouring
                    railways, and partly to the costly works of construction joining the railway to
                    the docks at Birkenhead. Of railways in England, the original Carlisle and

                    at the foot of the list, having cost £6474 per mile. Of the Scottish lines the
                    Caledonian system stands at the head of the list, costing £45,500 per mile. The
                    North British system cost £33,000 per mile. At the foot of the list stood the
                    original East of Fife line, 7 miles long, with a cost of £4351 per mile. But the
                    cheapest lines of considerable length are the Forth and Clyde line, costing
                    £5525 per mile, and the Peebles line, costing £5545 per mile. Both these lines
                    have been taken into the North British system. In Ireland the Dublin and
                    Kingstown Railway, 8 miles long, a suburban railway, cost £53,000 per mile. The
                    original Limerick and Foynes line, costing £5282 per mile, is probably the
                    cheapest piece of railway in the United Kingdom.</p>

                <p>In general the lines of preponderating passenger-train miles run the greater
                    number of miles per engine. The small mileage per engine of the London and
                    North-Western line, with a relatively small goods-train mileage, is partly
                    explained by the fact that this company had 141 duplicate locomotives in 1883.
                    Engines run many miles unavoidably “empty,”—that is, without a train, the
                    proportion of the empty or unprofitable mileage depending on the traffic and the
                    nature of the line. A line with locally heavy gradients must have “assistant” or
                    “pilot” engines in readiness to assist the trains up the inclines, and such
                    engines usually have to return empty to the depot; and in cases of special
                    trains empty engines are run to or from the train, as the case may happen.
                    Engines, especially assistant engines, may have to stand “in steam” or with the
                    steam up and the fire in good order, in readiness to act when required. Some
                    railway companies register the whole time the engines are in steam, also the
                    assistant, ballasting, and empty mileage run, besides the time on active duty
                    and the train miles run. The nature of the duty of goods engines, which is
                    various, is also distinguished, so as, in short, to make a complete record of
                    the work done. Thus for the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway
                    Table VIII. (see above) gives the duties performed by the engines during the
                    second half-years of 18S7 and 1883. The times of engines assisting and running
                    empty are included in the hours in steam with trains,—passenger and goods
                    respectively. There were about 170 engines employed in shunting and marshalling
                    trains. The relative percentages of the hours the engines were in steam and of
                    miles run on different duties in the second half-year of 1883 are given in Table
                    IX. :—</p>

                <p>The proportion of extra engine mileage to the work done in hauling goods,
                    minerals, and passengers varies very much on different systems, according to the
                    nature of the traffic, for by far the greater part of it arises in connexion
                    with goods and minerals, which itself is a very varying quantity. The train
                    mile, therefore, —that is, the revenue-producing train mile—though it is the
                    simplest and handiest unit of performance, is not an absolute measure of work
                    done. The shunting or marshalling of trains is an item not indicated by train
                    mileage, and yet it is hard work and occupies as many hours in steam as the
                    train mileage. Again, the fuel consumed, reckoned only on the train mileage run,
                    amounts to 53 lb per mile run; but, reckoned on the total mileage run by
                    engines, in which the extra mileage, whether ballasting, shunting, or assisting,
                    is hard work, it amounts only to 41 lb per mile run.</p>
                <p>On the London and North-Western Railway in 1874 the total shunting time was
                    613,472 hours of one engine—about the same as on the Sheffield line in 1883—and
                    on this work 171 engines were constantly employed, marshalling and classifying
                    the trains in the sidings. A like number, so employed on the Sheffield line,
                    amount to one-third of the total locomotive stock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Traffic.—</hi> Before the establishment of the railway from
                    twenty to thirty coaches'ran daily between Manchester and Liverpool, whereas the
                    railway carried 700,000 passengers during its first eighteen months. Wherever
                    railways were made the carriage of passengers was found to be one of the most
                    remunerative sources of traffic. Nearly fifty years ago Porter, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Progress of the Nation</hi> (1836), estimated that in Great
                    Britain 82,000 persons daily, or 30,000,000 per annum, travelled by coach an
                    average distance of about 12 miles each, at an average cost of 5s. for each
                    passenger, or 5d. per mile, whereas in 1881 upwards of 600,000,000 passengers
                    travelled by railway at a cost, taking averages, of 10⅜d. each, which at the
                    average rate of say 1⅛d. per mile travelled would represent an average length of
                    8⅜ miles, at one-fourth of the cost and in one-third of the time required by
                    coach.</p>

                <p>The number of passengers conveyed in the year 1883 per mile of the mean length of
                    railway open during the year was, in England 46,340, in Scotland 17,550, and in
                    Ireland 7710.</p>
                <p>The receipts from passenger traffic in 1883 are given in Table XII. (see below).
                    The decided preponderance of third-class traffic shown in this table is the
                    outcome of the work of years. In 1854 upwards of 111 million passengers
                    travelled by railway, of whom 13 per cent, travelled by first, 34 by second, and
                    53 by third class and parliamentary carriages. In 1873, the year before the
                    Midland Railway Company ceased to carry second-class passengers, upwards of 455
                    million passengers travelled by railway, of whom only 8½ per cent, travelled by
                    first, 15 by second, and 76½ by third class carriages. In 1881 upwards of 623
                    million passengers travelled by railway, nearly six times as many as in 1854. Of
                    these only 6 per cent, were first and 10½ second class passengers, whilst the
                    third-class and parliamentary passengers rose to 83½. Finally, in 1883 (as
                    already stated in Table XI. ), 85 per cent, of the passengers were third class.
                    The same movement is exemplified in the receipts, the mass of receipts
                    gravitating towards third class, as shown by the following abstract per mile
                    open for the years already mentioned (Table XIII.)</p>

                <p>These figures show that in 1854 first and second class receipts together made up
                    two-thirds of the whole receipts from passengers, but that they steadily
                    declined in succeeding years, not only proportionally but absolutely,—the
                    third-class receipts, on the contrary, exhibiting a rapid increase, insomuch
                    that, whereas in 1854 they were exactly one-third of the whole receipts, in 1883
                    they amounted to more than two-thirds of the whole receipts from passengers. The
                    reaction in first-class receipts is all the more remarkable because the number
                    of first-class passengers in 1854—14½ millions—was nearly trebled in 1873; that
                    of 1873 was almost exactly the same as in 1881,—about 38 millions; -whilst in
                    1883 there were nearly 36½ millions. The explanation is probably to be sought
                    partly in the fact that first-class fares have been reduced in many cases and
                    express fares have been almost entirely abolished, and partly to the increased
                    habit of taking third class for long journeys, so that first-class journeys,
                    being shorter on the average, have become less remunerative to the companies
                    than before. The third class is by far the most remunerative portion of the
                    passenger traffic of railways; and it is difficult to understand the policy
                    still pursued by railway companies in France, of discouraging third-class
                    traffic. On those railways where fast trains do not take third-class passengers,
                    or third-class carriages are deterrently uncomfortable and repulsive, only those
                    travel who travel by necessity, or to whom money is no object. On the contrary,
                    low fares and comfortable carriages invite traffic; they may almost be said to
                    create it,—a fact which has long been recognized by the more intelligent of
                    railway managers. The high speed of express trains —from 45 to 50 miles and
                    upwards per hour—is, of course, an additional inducement to travel. On certain
                    lines there are only two classes of carriages,—first and third. The Caledonian
                    Railway Company was the first to adopt, about thirty-five years ago, the system
                    of two classes only for local main-line passenger traffic. The Great North of
                    Scotland Railway Company opened its line in 1854 with only first and third class
                    carriages. The Midland Railway Company, as already noticed, ceased in 1874 to
                    run second-</p>
                <p>class carriages, at the same time readjusting and lowering the fares, —the
                    revised rates being 1½d. and 1d. respectively per mile for first and third
                    class. The result was that in 1875 27∣ million passengers travelled on this
                    railway,—nearly 5 millions more than in 1873, before the change was made; whilst
                    in 1881 there were 29 million travellers, of whom -27 millions were third and
                    only 2 millions first class passengers; and in 1883 upwards of 31 million
                    passengers were carried, of whom 29½ millions were of the third and a little
                    over 1¾millions of the first class. The gross receipts for passenger traffic on
                    the Midland Railway were, in round numbers, £1,660,000 in 1873, £1,787,000 in
                    1881, and £1,904,000 in 1883, whilst the percentage of working expenditure
                    remained the same. On the whole, it appears from the results of this grand
                    experiment that the change has succeeded financially, whilst there is no doubt
                    that it has stimulated the provision for and development of third-class
                    travelling on other railways. The gravitation of traffic to the lowest level is
                    unquestionable; and it is aided by the fact that third-class carriages have been
                    (1885) for some years run with nearly all trains, fast as well as slow, and that
                    the largeness of the number of third-class passengers has forced upon the
                    management of the companies improvements in the popular class of carriage. As
                    the downward movement of the classes continues the outcome will most likely be a
                    general reduction of the number of classes to two,—nominally first and third,
                    practically first and second. On 1st May 1885 second-class carriages were
                    abolished on the branch lines of the Great Northern Railway; and, if the
                    experiment answers expectations, second-class carriages will be abolished on the
                    entire Great Northern system.</p>

                <p>These statistics of merchandise and mineral traffic show that upwards of 266
                    million tons were conveyed in 1883 in the United Kingdom, seven-tenths of which
                    were minerals. In 1857 71 million tons were conveyed, of which only two-thirds
                    consisted of minerals; whence it appears that a more rapid development of
                    mineral traffic than of general merchandise took place in the interval.</p>
                <p>The whole of the receipts directly earned on the railways in 1883, with the
                    miscellaneous receipts derived from rents, tolls, navigation, steamboats,
                    &amp;c., are brought together in Table XVI. (see below). The receipts per train
                    mile from passengers and from goods and mineral traffic are reckoned exclusive
                    of the receipts on railways working mixed trains; but all the receipts per train
                    mile for passengers and goods together are divided by the total mileage run by
                    all trains. In the last column the gross receipts, including <hi

                    mileage.</hi></p>

                    For the year 1857 the corresponding amounts were as 3, 2, 1, so that the growth
                    of traffic in the interval has been greater in England than in Scotland, and

                <p>Table XIX. (below) contains a summary of the expenditure of the railways of the
                    United Kingdom for the year 1883, with the rate of expenditure of different
                    kinds per mile open and per train mile run, and, in addition, the proportional
                    expenditure of the different kinds in parts of the total working expenditure.
                    The heads of expenditure are classified in this table in order to separate
                    direct or really working expenditure from what may be called contingent or
                    incidental expenditure not essential to the working of a railway, as rates,
                    duty, compensation, &amp;c. The direct or essential working expenditure is thus
                    upwards of 32 millions sterling, or 86 per cent, of the whole expenditure. The
                    amount and proportion of the net receipts are shown by deducting the total

                <p>apparent discrepancy it may be stated that some companies had invested a portion
                    of their capital in the stocks and shares of other companies; that interest is
                    occasionally paid on the capital of companies whose lines are not open for
                    traffic; and that interest on loan capital is not always paid out of net
                    earnings. The appropriation of the gross receipts to working expenditure and
                    dividends, according to the tabulated statement of expenditure, is summarily as

                <p>Thus the receipts were quadrupled during the thirty years from 1853 to 1883,
                    whilst the mileage of railway open was increased by two and a half times. The
                    receipts per mile increased notwithstanding their continual dilution by the
                    accession of new lines. These results, taken together, indicate the inherent
                    elasticity of the railway and its seemingly inexhaustible resources.</p>
                <p>Of the main trunk-lines, which constitute the foundation of the railway system,
                    those which converge towards and terminate in London—the metropolitan lines—are
                    more important than the provincial lines. London is the great heart of the
                    country and is the chief centre of commerce; moreover, the metropolitan
                    railways, taken together, possess a greater variety of traffic than others;
                    hence they are selected for discussion illustrative of the growing magnitude and
                    distribution of traffic. On the nine metropolitan railways, including the London
                    and Black wall and the North London, in operation in 1854-57, Table XXI. shows
                    the receipts for these four years; and the receipts for the year 1883 derived
                    from the twelve metropolitan companies then in operation are added for
                    comparison :—</p>

                </table>
                <p>In the early years—1856, for instance—the metropolitan railway mileage open
                    constituted one-third of the total mileage open, whilst it produced nearly
                    one-half of the total traffic receipts of the United Kingdom, insomuch that the
                    receipts per metropolitan mile were two-fifths more than the average total
                    receipts per mile. Recently—in 1883—though the metropolitan mileage open was
                    less than one-half of the total mileage open of the United Kingdom, it earned
                    six-tenths of the total receipts; and the receipts per metropolitan mile were
                    one-third more than the average total on the whole mileage of the country.
                    Lastly, the increase of receipts of the metropolitan lines is greater than that
                    of the entire system. Whether, therefore, the increase of receipts be compared
                    with the total receipts or with the mileage open, the traffic of the
                    metropolitan railways increases the most rapidly, and it is also of the greatest
                    absolute magnitude. But, to bring out clearly the relative importance and
                    progress of the traffic of different districts, let us separate what may be
                    distinguished as the coast lines to the south and east of the metropolis—the
                    Great Eastern, and the railways south of the Thames—from the interior lines to
                    the north and west, the Great Northern, Midland, North-Western, Great Western,
                    and the three local lines, the North London, Metropolitan, and District. The
                    receipts may be correspondingly classified and compared with the receipts in
                    other parts of the United Kingdom (Table XXII.):—</p>

                <p>This comparative statement shows some strong contrasts. In 1857 the densest
                    traffic in England, averaging £86,10s., over 1515 miles lay to the north and
                    west of the metropolis; the railway traffic of the country was very partially
                    distributed; and, taking London as the great focus, the traffic radiated and
                    converged in all directions, with decreasing intensity as the distance from the
                    centre increased. In the year 1883, on the contrary, whilst the metropolitan
                    traffic continued to be the densest, the traffic of the metropolitan coast lines
                    per mile open had advanced so rapidly as even to surpass that of the interior
                    metropolitan lines,—the receipts being £98 per mile per week against £96. The
                    rapid development of the southern lines passenger traffic is, as will be shown,
                    the cause of the great advance in receipts. Further insight into the comparative
                    conditions of interior and coast lines may be got by taking four great inland
                    lines (Great Northern, Great Western, Midland, and London and North-Western),
                    which are lines of preponderating goods and mineral traffic, and contrasting
                    them with four great coast lines of preponderating passenger traffic
                    (South-Eastern; London, Brighton, and South Coast; London, Chatham, and Dover;
                    and South-Western). In the annexed table (XXIII.) for 1883 the average fare per
                    passenger is calculated on the assumption that the fares formed 80 per cent, of
                    the whole receipts for passenger trains, and the average length of a passenger’s
                    journey is got by taking 85 per cent, of the passengers as third class at Id. a
                    mile and 15 per cent, as first and second class at 1∣d. a mile.</p>

                <p>The coast lines, being freer from competition, get higher rates both for goods
                    and passengers; but the inland lines have the advantage in direct working
                    expenditure per train mile, and a still greater advantage in the much smaller
                    capital raised per mile of line open, so that, in spite of competition and low
                    rates, they earn 5∣ per cent, on their capital as against a little over 4⅛
                    earned by the coast lines. The greater capital outlay on the coast railways
                    seems to be due to the costliness of stations and carriage stock for a
                    preponderating passenger traffic; and as this more than outweighs the gains from
                    higher rates the statistics support the generally accepted opinion that goods
                    and mineral traffic on railways is profitable and should be encouraged and
                    developed. Mr R. Price Williams, an accepted authority on railway statistics,
                    supports this conclusion. Mr F. R. Conder, on the contrary, who has deeply
                    studied the question, maintains that the heavy mineral traffic of railways
                    should be relegated to the canals, which, though slow, are low in their
                    charges.</p>

                <p>From this table it may be estimated that there are now two drivers and two
                    firemen for every 3 miles of line open. In 1857 there were only two drivers and
                    two firemen for every 5 miles; and, though the train service has increased
                    faster than the train mileage, the work of the drivers has sensibly diminished,
                    each man on an average doing 20,950 miles as against 23,420 in 1857.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Railway Construction.</hi></p>
                <p>The selection of lines of railway is mainly governed by the same principles as
                    hold good for roads, but the cost of the rails renders it of greater importance
                    to shorten the length of the route than to make slight savings in embankments
                    and cuttings. The first step in the survey is to ascertain the positions of the
                    watercourse and watershed lines of the district to be passed through. The
                    general direction having been selected by the help of an ordnance map, a
                    sketch-map, or a special reconnaissance survey, the river-crossings are to be
                    examined and decided upon, and the points determined at which the watersheds are
                    to be crossed and the approaches to bridges set out. Trial lines should be run
                    between the points thus fixed, and the country should be carefully examined on
                    each side of these before the route is finally decided on. Sharp curves and
                    steep gradients are in themselves evils, involving special cost for maintenance
                    and for working, although original outlay may be economized by the adoption of
                    them. A straight and horizontal surface is assumed as the standard of
                    perfection; and the proper business of the engineer in laying out a railway is
                    to harmonize the engineering and the financial conditions of the problem so as
                    to yield the highest practicable return on the money expended, and to see that,
                    whilst the railway may be neither quite straight nor quite level, it shall not
                    be unduly costly in construction from excessive cutting, tunnelling, and making
                    of embankments, in order to obviate severe curves and gradients, nor excessively
                    cheap from following the surface of the ground too closely and incurring heavy
                    gradients and severe curves, and as a consequence heavy working expenditure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cuttings and Embankments. —</hi> Engineers endeavour so to plan
                    the works of a railway that the quantity of earth to be excavated shall be equal
                    to the quantity that goes to form the embankments. The earthwork is the
                    foundation and support of the superstructure, and as such it must be uniformly
                    firm, of liberal width, easy slopes, thorough drainage. Figs. 10 and 11 are
                    type-sections of cuttings and embankments for a double line of way on the
                    national gaιme, showing the “formation” surface and the ballast on which the
                    permanent way is supported, with the slopes, the side drains, and the fencing.
                    Fig. 12 is a type-section of the permanent way on the national gauge, settled by
                    Mr John Fowler for the South Wales Railway. Upon the formation level the ballast
                    is deposited, 2 feet in depth at the centre, dressed level, for about 22 feet in
                    width for a double line of way. The sleepers and chairs are buried in the
                    ballast, and the rails partially also, these standing 2 or 3 inches above the
                    ballast. The intermediate space between the two lines of way is, as before
                    stated, 6 feet, and, taking the lengths of the sleepers at 9 feet, the total
                    width for two lines of way over the sleepers is 6 feet + 4 feet 8½ inches + 2½
                    inches × 2 (width of the rails) + 9 feet = 20 feet 1½ inches; and it is seen
                    that, as the ballast is 22 feet wide at the upper surface, it extends to nearly
                    1 foot beyond the ends of the sleeper at each side and about 3½ feet beyond the
                    outer rails at each side.</p>
                <p>The slopes of cuttings vary according to stratification, soil, direction of the
                    vein, moisture. In gravel, sand, or common earth the slopes rise 1 foot for 1 to
                    1½ or 2 feet of base; in solid rock the slopes are nearly vertical. Cuttings are
                    as deep as from 50 to 100 feet below the surface, and embankments as high above.
                    The London and Birmingham Railway had upwards of 12 million cubic yards of
                    excavation, and 10½ millions of excavation in the original estimates, or above
                    100,000 cubic yards of earthwork per mile. The heaviest cutting on the line is
                    at Tring, 2½ miles long, averaging 40 feet deep, the greatest depth being 60. In
                    the case of the great Blisworth cutting the strata were unequal in consistency.
                    About halfway up the face of the cutting a stratum of limestone rock, 25 feet in
                    thickness, was found, with loose strata below and above it, and it was necessary
                    to prevent the lower stratum, consisting of wet clay, from being forced out
                    under the superincumbent mass by undersetting. A rubble wall, averaging 20 feet
                    in height, was built on each side underneath the rock, strengthened by
                    buttresses at intervals of 20 feet, resting on inverted arches carried across
                    underneath the line. A puddle-drain was formed behind each wall, with a small
                    drain through the wall to let off the water from behind. Fig. 13 is an elevation
                    of the w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> est end of the cutting where it is about
                    40 feet deep, show-</p>

                    shows a sec tion of the wall in the water, and the right-hand side shows the
                    section through a buttress, together with the invert and drains. One of the
                    walls is shown in front elevation in fig. 15. The New Cross cutting through the
                    London clay, on the South-Eastern Railway, is 2 miles long, and is for some
                    distance from</p>
                <p>80 to nearly</p>
                <p>100 feet in depth. This cutting affords an example of the tendency of some soils
                    to slip. The slopes of the cutting were finished at 2 horizontal to 1 vertical;
                    and they remained as thus finished for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n250/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0250-0233"/>about two years, when, after continued bad
                    weather, the slopes commenced slipping to such an extent that the line was
                    rendered impassable for some weeks, and parts of the slopes were reduced to an
                    inclination of 4 to 1. The Winchburgh cutting, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow
                    Railway, is 4 miles long and from 25 to 60 feet deep, through solid rock. It is
                    succeeded by an embankment 1^ miles long and 60 feet high, followed in immediate
                    succession by a stone viaduct half a mile long and 80 feet high. The Olive Mount
                    cutting of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway is 2 miles long and at some
                    places 100 feet deep.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most interesting case of embankment and cutting in combination is
                    that of the crossing of Chat Moss, on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The
                    moss was 44 miles across, and it varied in depth from 10 to 30 feet. Its general
                    character was such that cattle could not stand on it, and a piece of iron would
                    sink in it. The subsoil was composed principally of clay and sand, and the
                    railway had to be carried over the moss on the level, requiring cutting and
                    embanking for upwards of 4 miles. In forming 277,000 cubic yards of embankment
                    670,000 yards of raw peat were consumed, the difference being occasioned by the
                    squeezing out of the water. Large quantities of embanking were sunk in the moss,
                    and, when the engineer, Stephenson, after a month’s vigorous operations, had
                    made up his estimates, the apparent work done was sometimes less than at the
                    beginning of the month. The railway ultimately was made to float on the bog.
                    Where embankment was required drains about 5 yards apart were cut, and when the
                    moss between them was dry it was used to form the embankment. Where the way was
                    formed on the level drains were cut on each side of the intended line, and were
                    intersected here and there by cross drains, by which the upper part of the moss
                    became dry and firm. On this surface hurdles were placed, 4 feet broad and 9
                    long, covered with heath, upon which the ballast was laid.</p>
                <p>*· <hi rend="italic">Tunnels</hi> .—The relative costs of rock - cuttings and
                    cuttings in clay do not greatly differ; for, not only does the vertical
                    rock-cutting require less excavation than the wide yawning earth-cutting of the
                    same depth, with extended slopes, but, when it is executed, the rock-cutting is
                    not liable to the expensive slips which sometimes overtake the other. For depths
                    exceeding 60 feet it is usually cheaper to tunnel.</p>
                <p>The tunnel (see fig. 16) under Callander ridge near Falkirk station, on the
                    Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, is a fair representation of tunnels as usually
                    constructed. It is lined with brick 18 inches thick, founded on stone footings
                    of greater breadth, in order to throw the ,load securely upon the subsoil, as
                    shown in the transverse section. The sides and roof of the tunnel are curved
                    from footing to footing, so as effectually to resist the inevitable external
                    pressure of the earth, to a span of 26 feet in width and a height of 22. The
                    sectional view shows also the centering or timber framing employed in the
                    building of the tunnel, which was braced diagonally and transversely to resist
                    the unavoidable inequalities of pressure without alteration of form whilst the
                    arch was in course of construction. Externally the entrances are built of stone,
                    and the flank walls are 3 feet in thickness, with counterforts at intervals.
                    This tunnel is not straight, but is formed on a curve of 1 mile radius, and is
                    830 yards, or nearly half a mile in length.</p>
                <p>The Ivilsby tunnel, on the London and Birmingham Railway, was rendered necessary
                    by the opposition raised to the line passing through Northampton. It is driven
                    160 feet below the surface and is 2398 yards in length, 30 feet in width, and 30
                    feet high, constructed with two wide air-shafts 60 feet in diameter, not only to
                    give air and ventilation but to admit light enough to enable the engine-driver
                    in passing through it with a train to see the rails from end to end. The
                    construction of the tunnel was let for the sum of £99,000, but, owing chiefly to
                    the existence of unseen quicksands, the tunnel is stated to have actually cost
                    nearly £300,000, or £125 per lineal yard.</p>
                <p>The Box tunnel, on the Great Western Railway, between Bath and Chippenham, was
                    another difficult and expensive work. It is about 70 feet below the surface, and
                    is 3123 yards in length, or rather more than If miles; the width is 30 and the
                    height 25 feet. Where bi'icked, the sides are constructed of seven and the arch
                    of six rings of brick, and there is an invert of four rings. There are eleven
                    air-shafts to this tunnel, generally 25 feet in diameter.</p>
                <p>The tunnel under the Mound at Edinburgh (see fig. 17), on the Edinburgh and
                    Glasgow Railway, supplies an excellent illustration of tunnels formed with
                    inverts,— that is to say, inverted arches built under the rails. The figure is a
                    transverse section, showing the truly circular arch of the tunnel,</p>
                <p>28 feet in diameter and 20 high above the rails, built of brick 3 feet thick,
                    stiffened with counterforts ex-ternally, and with ribs of masonry internally,
                    founded on a solid bed of mason-work, with an inverted arch to distribute the
                    weight. The</p>
                <p>Mound was a mass of loose earth and rubbish on a boggy soil, hence the necessity
                    for the invert arch, on which the tunnel may be conceived to float.</p>
                <p>The Shakespeare tunnel, or, more correctly, double tunnel, driven through the
                    Shakespeare Cliff near Dover, on the South-Eastern Railway, is in fact two
                    narrow tunnels, carrying each one line of rails (see fig. 18), 12 feet wide and
                    30 in extreme height, through the chalk, separated by a solid pier or wall of
                    chalk 10 feet thick. The chalk is of variable quality, and the greater part of
                    the tunnel is lined with brick, strengthened by counterforts at 12 feet
                    intervals, which carry the weight of doubtful beds of chalk. The tunnel is 1430
                    yards, or upwards of three-quarters of a mile in length, rising westward with an
                    inclination of 1 in 264. The tunnel being within a short distance of the face of
                    the cliff, the material excavated was discharged through galleries about 400
                    feet long, driven in from the face of the cliff, into the sea,—the first
                    operation being to run a bench or roadway along the face of the cliff. There are
                    seven vertical shafts from the surface, averaging 180 feet deep.</p>
                <p>There were in 1857 about 70 miles of railway tunnelling in Great Britain, or 1
                    mile of tunnel for 130 miles of railway. There are now (1885) probably at least
                    100 miles of tunnelling. The cost of tunnelling has averaged £102 per mile. The
                    longest tunnel is the Woodhead, at the summit of the Manchester, Sheffield, and
                    Lincolnshire Railway, being 3 miles and 60 feet long. The tun-nelling on the
                    Metropolitan Railway is noticed below, p. 239.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bridges and Viaducts</hi> .—There are very few level crossings
                    on English railways—that is, the crossing of one railway with another, or with a
                    common road, at the same level—the chances of accidents having demanded, in
                    general, the construction of bridges over or under the railway. The general
                    appearance of an ordinary stone or brick bridge is represented by fig. 19,
                    showing in elevation a bridge over or under the railway. The minimum height of a
                    bridge over the railway is ruled by the elevation necessary to clear the top of
                    the chimney of the locomotive. A11 excellent method of carrying roads over
                    railways, where the height is limited and the span is moderate, consists in
                    erecting flat-arched cast-iron beams over the railway, and throwing brick arches
                    of small span between the beams upon their lower flanges, to cany the roadway.
                    Thus the vertical depth from the soffit or crown of the main arch to the roadway
                    above may but very little exceed the depth of the beam, which is apparent in the
                    sectional view. This method of construction is, moreover, well adapted for
                    skew-bridges. Cast-iron <pb break="no"

                    structures, been very generally superseded by wrought-iron, forming plate girder
                    bridges. Timber is now almost unheard of for railway bridges on account of its
                    want of durability and stiffness; and such bridges as have formerly been built
                    of timber in Great Britain are being rebuilt of stone, brick, or plate-iron.</p>
                <p>. The longest viaduct in England is perhaps the Congleton, on the</p>
                <p>The Forth Bridge, designed by Mr John Fowler and Mr Benjamin Baker, is the
                    largest and most remarkable railway bridge in the world. One of its spans is
                    shown in elevation and plan in fig. 20. The bridge consists of 2 spans of 1700
                    feet each, 2 of 675 each, 15 of 168 each, and 5 of 25 each. Including the width
                    of the piers, there is almost exactly 1 mile of main spans and half a mile of
                    approaches by viaducts, making together about 1| miles of total length. The
                    clear headway under the centre of the bridge is 150 feet above the level of high
                    water, and the highest part of the bridge is 361 above the same level. Each of
                    the three main piers consists of a group of four cylindrical piers of masonry
                    and concrete, 49 feet in diameter at the top and from 60 to 70 in diameter at
                    the bottom. The deepest pier is about 70 feet below low water, and the rise of
                    the tide is 18 feet at ordinary spring tides. In the piers there are about
                    120,000 cubic yards of masonry and in the superstructure 44,500 tons of steel.
                    The contract was let for the sum of £1,600,000, being at the rate of £645 per
                    lineal yard. An impression of the magnitude of the bridge is derived from a
                    comparison with the largest railway bridge in England, the Britannia Bridge,
                    which has a span of 465 feet, the ratio of which to that of the Forth
                    Bridge—1700 feet—is as 1 to 365־. The site of the Forth Bridge is at
                    Queensferry. At this place the Firth of Forth is divided by the island of
                    Inchgarvie into two channels, which, being as much as 200 feet in depth,
                    precluded the construction of intermediate piers. Hence the adoption of two
                    large spans of 1700 feet each, between which the central pier is founded on the
                    island midway across. The bridge is composed of three double lattice-work
                    cantilevers, like scale-beams, 1360 feet in length, poised on three
                    substructures, and connected at their extremities by ordinary girders 350 feet
                    long, which complete the main spans. The bridge is taper in plan, varying from a
                    width of 120 feet—the distance apart of the lower members of the cantilevers at
                    the piers—to a minimum of 31 £ at the ends, in order to confer a degree of
                    stiffness laterally, for resisting irregular stresses, wind - pressure in
                    particular. The columns above the piers, forming the basis of the cantilevers,
                    are 12 feet in diameter. The lower booms, as well as the struts of the
                    cantilevers, being the members in compression, are circular in cross section,
                    this form of section having been selected as the most effective for resisting
                    compressive stress. The lower boom is at the piers 12 feet in diameter,
                    constructed of plates lj inches in thickness. The size is gradually reduced
                    towards the ends, where the diameter is 5 feet, made of plates three-eighths of
                    an inch in thickness. Correspondingly the upper member of each cantilever is a
                    tapering box-lattice girder, rectangular in section, 12 feet deep by 10 wide at
                    the piers, and 5 feet by 3 at the ends. The central girders are 32 feet apart.
                    The wind-pressure is assumed for calculation at a maximum of 56 lb per
                    superficial foot. It is calculated that the maximum possible stress on any
                    member of the bridge is at the rate of 7 j tons per square inch of section. The
                    required ultimate strength of steel under compression is from 34 to 37 tons per
                    square inch, and under tension from 30 to 33 tons. Between the two main girders
                    the double line of way is to be carried on an</p>
                <p>Manchester and Birmingham Railway; it is of stone, 1026 yards or more than half a
                    mile in length and 106 feet high, and it cost £113,000, or £113 per yard run.
                    The Dane viaduct, on the same line, is of brick, 572 yards long and 88 feet
                    high, and it cost £54,000, or £96 per yard run, having 23 arches of 63 feet
                    span. The Avon viaduct, on the Midland Railway, is of brick, 240 yards in length
                    and 51 feet high, with 11 arches of 50 feet span; it cost £14,000, or £60 per
                    yard run. For comparison it maybe stated that the Britannia Tubular Bridge
                    across the Menai Straits, 616 yards long and 104 feet high, cost £600,000, or
                    £974 per yard run. On the different lines entering London there are several
                    miles of brick viaducts in the approaches to termini, and also at Manchester and
                    other large cities and towns. Many interesting details might be given as to
                    bridges and viaducts of the larger kind, but we must here confine ourselves to
                    some account of the Forth Bridge, now in course of construction at Queensferry,
                    referring the reader for other examples to the article Bridges.</p>
                <p>internal viaduct (see smaller figure in fig. 20), supported by trestles and cross
                    girders. The way will consist of heavy bridge rails, Brunel section, laid on
                    longitudinal sleepers bedded in four steel troughs, into which the wheels will
                    drop in case of derailment, and then run on the sleepers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railway Stations.—</hi> Railway stations are either “terminal”
                    or “intermediate.” A terminal station embraces (1) the passenger station; (2)
                    the goods station; (3) the locomotive, carriage, and waggon depots, where the
                    engines and the carrying stock are kept, cleaned, examined, and repaired. At
                    many intermediate stations the same arrangements, on a smaller scale, are made;
                    in all of them there is at least accommodation for the passenger and the goods
                    traffic. The stations for passengers and goods are generally in different and
                    sometimes in distant positions, the place selected for each being that which is
                    most convenient for the traffic. The passenger station abuts on the main line,
                    or, at termini, forms the natural terminus, at a place as near as can
                    conveniently be obtained to the centre of the population which constitutes the
                    passenger traffic. The goods station is approached by a siding or fork set off
                    from the main line at a point short of the passenger station. Terminal branches
                    of the railways—where, for example, there is a sharp incline—are sometimes
                    worked by stationary engines and ropes to the point where the locomotive joins
                    the train. The locomotive station is placed wherever the ground may most
                    conveniently be obtained, at or near to the terminus; in some cases it is found
                    at a distance of 3 or 4 miles. An abundant supply of good water and ample means
                    of drainage are important at stations. There should be ample area of land to
                    admit of the greatest possible extension of accommodation, and the erection of
                    buildings on land adjacent to the station grounds should be discouraged.
                    Companies have been compelled to repurchase at greatly advanced cost land
                    originally disposed of by them as “surplus,” and generally with a view to
                    building operations. When this course is adopted prudent managers should take
                    care to secure in the conveyance power to repurchase the freehold at original
                    prices, with allowance for outlay in building or otherwise, by valuation.</p>
                <p>In laying out the approaches and station-yard of passenger, stations ample width
                    and space should be provided, with well-1 defined means of ingress and egress to
                    facilitate the circulation off vehicles, and the setting-down pavement should be
                    as long as possible, to admit of several carriages discharging passengers and
                    luggage at the same time. The pavement should be wide and sheltered from the
                    weather by a roof, overhanging beyond the kerb, or spanning the roadway, but in
                    all cases free from columns. The position of the main buildings relative to the
                    direction of the lines of rails is the distinguishing feature in terminal
                    stations. When space permits, the usual course is to place them on the departure
                    side parallel to the platform, but they are frequently placed at the end of the
                    station at right angles to the rails and platforms. Or these two systems are
                    combined in a third arrangement, in which the offices are placed in a fork,
                    between two or more series of lines and platforms. Of the metropolitan termini,
                    the Great Northern <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0252-0235"/>passenger station, the Great Western, and the
                    South-Western stations are examples of the first class; the London Bridge,
                    Cannon Street, Charing Cross, and Victoria stations (comprising the
                    South-Eastern and the Brighton lines), and the Great Eastern and the Eenchurch
                    Street stations (comprising the North London, Black-wall, North Woolwich, and
                    Tilbury lines), are examples of the second class; and the London and
                    North-Western station is an example of the third class. The first and usual
                    class of stations commands the greatest length of setting-down pavement, ample
                    space for booking and other offices, waiting-rooms, &amp;c., and the shortest
                    average distance for passengers and luggage from the offices to the outgoing
                    trains. Nevertheless, where the traffic is various, involving the despatch of
                    numerous trains to different points in quick succession, and necessarily with
                    perfect regularity, the second system is the best. But where the frontage is
                    limited, and where trains start at some distance from the entrance, there is
                    inconvenience in the movement of luggage over a crowded platform. The third plan
                    is probably the least commodious of the three; but it has the advantage of
                    affording two arrival platforms, with carriage-roads alongside, the others
                    having but one so situated. In all the classes, it may be observed, transverse
                    lines are inserted with turn-tables, to place all the lines in compact
                    communication for turning on or off spare carriages, loaded horse-boxes, or
                    carriage-trucks. Independently of the turn-tables, the lines of rail are
                    connected by switches or points converging towards the two main lines of rail,
                    outgoing and incoming; and thus the assortment and marshalling of trains may be
                    effected by horse or engine power independently of the turn-tables. Each plan of
                    station comprises one or more large turn-tables for reversing the engine with
                    its tender together.</p>
                <p>The correct arrangement and appropriation of t*he several lines of railway in a
                    terminal station materially affect the economical and efficient working of the
                    traffic. It is essential that every traffic line, both in and out, should be
                    provided with one or more spare sidings, in addition to those set apart for the
                    break-vans, horse-boxes, and carriage-trucks, and for the locomotive department.
                    All these lines should communicate with each other by means of points and
                    crossings, to allow of shunting with engine-power, and to reduce to the lowest
                    limits the number of turn-tables or their substitutes. Curves ought never to
                    have a radius of less than 800 feet.</p>
                <p>The practice with regal’d to the height of platforms above the rails has varied
                    considerably, the tendency being to raise them much higher than was usual at
                    first; 3 feet may be stated aS the limit in this respect. Too much attention
                    cannot be given to the necessity for obtaining the greatest possible width of
                    platform. Where the platform is used on one side only, the width ought never to
                    be less than 20 feet; and when both sides are required 80, or even 40, should be
                    allowed. The best mode of constructing the platform is undoubtedly with stone
                    slabs laid hollow upon longitudinal walls, so as to admit of carrying beneath it
                    the water and gas pipes, telegraph or signal wires, and the general drainage,
                    with free access to each. Cutting out for turn-tables and openings for cross
                    lines of rails are frequently inevitable difficulties, which have given rise to
                    various ingenious contrivances, as shifting-stages, drawbridges, &amp;c. By far
                    the best substitute for the turn-table yet introduced is the traverser. If well
                    made and carefully worked and attended to, the shifting of carriages from line
                    to line can be performed without extra manual labour or interference either with
                    the rails or the platforms. The other objection is best met by the use of easy
                    inclines, with crossings on the rail-level. Where the platforms do not exceed 2
                    feet in height and the surface is smooth, gradients of 1 in 10 are not too steep
                    for luggage-barrows, nor are they dangerous in a crowd.</p>
                <p>The earlier terminal railway stations were designed either with intermediate
                    columns supporting the roof or with brick walls, varying in number of spans from
                    two to five or six. It often happens that in the course of a few years such
                    stations have to be remodelled to meet the constantly increasing traffic; and
                    great difficulties are occasionally met with in the rearrangement of platforms
                    which are wasted where lines of rails have been laid, whilst rails are wasted
                    where platforms are placed, and where columns interfere. To allow engines and
                    carriages to pass from one line of rails to another at the shortest possible
                    intervals it becomes necessary to have diagonal crossings from one pax־t of the
                    station to another in many directions, while at the same time the free movements
                    of passengers and luggage on the platforms must not be impeded. Thus there arose
                    a system, originated, it is believed, in the great Continental termini, of
                    constructing roofs in two spans, one covering the up lines of rails and the
                    other the down lines. King’s Cross passenger station is an example of this kind.
                    The principle of wide spans for the roofs of railway stations, clear of
                    intermediate walls or columns, was adopted in England probably for the first
                    time in 1848-49, in covering Lime Street station, Liverpool, on the London and
                    North-Western Railway, by one span of 1532 feet. The extreme length of the roof
                    was 374 feet. The new Lime Street station, it may be added, is covered by a roof
                    of one span of 212 feet. Tythebarn Street station, Liverpool, on the Lancashire
                    and</p>
                <p>Yorkshire Railway, is covered by a roof in one span of 136 feet; there, as the
                    traffic increased, the lines and platforms were changed so as to admit of treble
                    the quantity of traffic being conducted, which would have been impossible if the
                    roof had been built with sectional spans and columns. It is averred that the
                    railway company has been repaid the excessive cost of the single-span roof many
                    times over in economy of working. The next single-span roof on a large scale
                    appears to have been that of 212 feet covering the New Street station,
                    Birmingham, in which five lines of way, belonging to different companies—the
                    London and North-Western and others—meet and concentrate passenger and goods
                    traffic of every description. The roof was 840 feet in length, with trusses or
                    principals placed at intervals of 24 feet. The principal consists of one arched
                    plate-iron girder 15 inches deep, having a rise of 45£ feet at the centre. The
                    ends of the arch are tied by a round tie-bar 4 inches in diameter, from which
                    the arch is strutted at intervals. This is said to cover the largest area of any
                    station in England.</p>
                <p>The Cannon Street station of the Charing Cross Railway is the terminus of the
                    City extension of that line, giving direct access to the City of London for the
                    South-Eastern Railway, and linking the Charing Cross station at the west end
                    with the City. During the year 1867—the first year the extension was open for
                    traffic—about 8 million passengers used the Cannon Street station, of which
                    nearly one-half were local passengers booked between Cannon Street and Charing
                    Cross. The length of ground between the river Thames and Cannon Street is 855
                    feet, of which the fore-court occupies 90, the booking-offices 85, and the shed
                    or covered portion of the station reaching to the river 680. The station is 201
                    feet 8 inches wide outside the walls and 187 feet inside. The whole of the
                    station is built on a substructure of brick piers and arches, excepting the
                    booking-offices and the part which is over Upper Thames Street. The ordinary
                    piers are 5 feet thick with footings 8 feet wide, resting on a bed of concrete
                    10 feet in thickness, and the whole of the under structure is made available for
                    storage and other purposes. The rails and platforms are carried across Upper
                    Thames Street on wrought-iron girders 2J feet deep to 37 feet of span. The floor
                    of this bridge is of creasoted Baltic planking 8 inches thick. The walls of the
                    station are of brick-work, 45 feet high above the level of the platform. They
                    are built in piers 6 feet 4J inches thick and panels 2 feet <hi rend="italic"
                    >7\</hi> inches thick. The roof is of one clear span of 190 feet 4J inches
                    circular, having a rise or versed sine of 60 feet at the centre, composed of
                    ribs constructed of plate-iron and angle-iron, and, like ordinary girders, 21
                    inches deep, each foot of each rib being tied by a tie-bar of round wrought-iron
                    5TV inches in diameter. The tie-bar rises 30 feet and the depth of the truss at
                    the centre is 30 feet. One end or foot of the rib is fixed to the supporting
                    wall and the other end is placed on rollers, by the aid of which the principal
                    or truss is free to expand or to contract according to the variations of
                    temperature. The trusses are placed at from 33| to 35 feet apart. The
                    booking-offices, waiting-rooms, &amp;c., are at the end of the station on the
                    ground floor of the building, which above and below them forms the City Terminus
                    Hotel. Parcels offices, stores, cellarage, &amp;c., are provided in the
                    basement, with hydraulic lifts worked by direct pressure from tanks in the
                    towers at the south end. The used water is discharged into tanks about 9 feet
                    above the level of the platform, whence it is again utilized for the general
                    purposes of the station. There are nine lines of way in the station, of which
                    eight run alongside five platforms, and one line is space for stock and for
                    standing-room. The two outer platforms are employed for the short traffic to
                    Greenwich and AI id-Kent and to Charing Cross, 13^ feet wide by 522 and 486 feet
                    long respectively. The general departure platform is 665 feet long and 19 wdde;
                    and the two general arrival platforms, one on each side of the cab road, are 721
                    feet long by 12£ wide. On this system there are two lines of rail to each
                    platform, reckoning the general arrival platforms as one; accommodation is thus
                    found for 4788 lineal feet of trains. These nine lines of way converge and merge
                    in five lines of way over the bridge for a length of about 600 feet,
                    constituting the station-yard. The first line, on the western or up-stream side,
                    is exclusively for trains proceeding from Cannon Street to Charing Cross; the
                    second line is for trains approaching Cannon Street, whether from London Bridge,
                    the country, or Charing Cross; the centre line is exclusively for trains from
                    London Bridge or the country; the fourth is the main down line; the fifth, or
                    east line, is for engines going to or from the engine dépôt at the far end of
                    the bridge, or for engines waiting for their trains. The movements of the trains
                    are regulated from the signal-bridge, which crosses the converged lines of way
                    at a distance of about 140 feet from the south end of the station, by means of
                    about forty pairs of points, with twenty-four semaphore arms, eight of which are
                    for trains outward and sixteen for trains inward. The signal-box on the bridge
                    is 42 feet long and 9 wide, and contains sixty-seven levers, by thirty-seven of
                    which signals on Saxby and Farmer’s system are worked, and by thirty the points
                    are worked. Several of the point-levers work the switches at both ends of
                    cross-over lines. The signals lock the points and each other, so that no
                    contradictory signals can be <pb break="no"

                    platform be given until the points are set accordingly. There are in the locking
                    frame thirty-two slides and about a thousand locks, and an idea of the duty that
                    falls on this apparatus may be formed from the fact that 775 trains have passed
                    under the signal-bridge in a single working day (Whit-Monday), and that, each
                    train being reversed here, a fresh engine has to be attached to it, the
                    superseded engine being passed into a siding. In the course of thirty-five
                    minutes one morning thirty-five trains were signalled and passed in or out of
                    the station. The duty of signalling is performed by tw <hi rend="superscript"

                <p>The cost of the works of the Cannon Street station, with the cost for Charing
                    Cross station for comparison, is shown in Table XXV. (below). The substructure
                    is reckoned to the formation-level, inclusive of the public footway under
                    Charing Cross station and the public roadway under Cannon Street station, but
                    exclusive of the river abutment of the bridge. The superstructure includes the
                    fore-court, booking-offices, fittings, towers, roof, gas and water mains,
                    &amp;c., excluding the permanent way.</p>

                <p>The total cost of the works of the whole Charing Cross Railway, from London
                    Bridge station to Cannon Street and Charing Cross, with the terminal stations,
                    was £1,160,118. The cost of the land for the whole railway, after deducting the
                    value of surplus land, Hungerford Bridge, pier tolls, &amp;c., was £1,900,000,
                    making a total for land and works of over £3,000,000. For this sum there are 4⅜
                    miles of railway for double line, the cost being at the rate of £680,000 per
                    mile. The works include two large bridges over the river Thames, a number of
                    expensive bridges over streets, viaducts, and two large metropolitan termini.
                    The cost for land at Cannon Street station was at the rate of £3,15s. 7d. per
                    square foot, and that at Charing Cross station was £2, 18s. 5d.</p>
                <p>St Pancras passenger station of the Midland Railway is the most recently
                    constructed metropolitan terminus. The approach to the land on which the station
                    is built was crossed by the Regent’s Canal, and in order to secure good
                    gradients and suitable levels for metropolitan suburban stations the main
                    passenger line is earned over the canal; and, as a result, the level of St
                    Pancras station is from 12 to 17 feet higher than that of the adjoining roads.
                    The St Pancras branch, on the contrary, for effecting a junction with the
                    Metropolitan Railway, leaving the main line some distance from the terminus,
                    descends through a tunnel beneath the Regent’s Canal and the passenger station,
                    as well as under a considerable length of the main line. The height of the rails
                    above the ground-level admitted of the construction of a lower floor with direct
                    access to the streets, built and arranged for Burton beer traffic. The floor of
                    the station is supported on girders and columns extending from side to side and
                    acting as a tie for the roof girders, which start from the ground-level and form
                    the roof as a single arch. The ribs or girders forming the roof are laid to a
                    clear span of 240 feet; the walls built between the ribs are 245½ feet apart.
                    The clear height of the ribs above the level of the platforms is 96 feet at the
                    centre. The length of the station is 689 feet 4 inches. The lower floor contains
                    720 cast-iron columns set on brick piers, and 49 rows of principal girders
                    across the station, with 15 rows longitudinally. Upon these intermediate girders
                    are carried, and the whole is covered in with Mallett’s buckled plates. The cost
                    of the ironwork of the floor was £57,000, being at the rate of £3, 0s. 6d. per
                    square yard. The roof girders, twenty-five in number, are placed at intervals of
                    29 feet 4 inches, except at the outer end, where the last two girders are only
                    14 feet 8 inches apart. The cost of the roof, including covering, with two
                    gables and screens, amounted to £69,365, being at the rate of £40, 18s. per
                    square of 100 square feet or 10 feet square. If there had not been any
                    floor-girders to act as roof-ties, the extra cost for ties at the level of the
                    floor would have been about £1 per square.</p>

                <p>The goods and mineral station at King’s Cross may be selected as an example of
                    such stations. It comprises coal dépôts and wharves, potato-stores,
                    engine-sheds, repairing sheds, stores, stables, and all the necessary offices,
                    buildings, and appliances required for the goods and mineral traffic of the
                    company. Twelve lines of rail run into the goods-shed, with a platform at each
                    side for the receipt and despatch of goods. On the outer side of the rails,
                    within the building, space is reserved for the vans engaged in collecting and
                    distributing the goods. The outer line of rails at the east side of the platform
                    is used for unloading the -waggons with the inward goods, and that on the west
                    side for loading the outward goods. The inner lines nearest to these are used
                    for the arrival of goods trains, for empty waggons, and for making up trains for
                    departure. The waggons, after being unloaded, are taken by means of turntables
                    and cross-roads to the departure side of the station, where the business of
                    loading and despatching them is carried on. The platforms have each two rows of
                    hydraulic cranes, of 1 and 2 tons lifting power alternately. The receiving
                    offices are on the platforms, but the general offices are adjacent to the main
                    building. The stables are under the platform; the granary is at the south end of
                    the goods-shed, through which it is approached by two lines running through the
                    middle of the shed,—two other lines, one on each side of them, being reserved
                    for full waggons. When emptied, the waggons are removed by two lines which run
                    one on each outer side of the goods-shed. The shed and the granary are supplied
                    with water communication through tunnels under the roads to a basin on the
                    south, and thence to the Regent’s Canal; and lighters can receive or discharge
                    their freights directly under the buildings. On the west of the goods-shed are
                    the coal dépôts and staiths. The coal arriving at the station is discharged in
                    some cases directly from the waggons into carts alongside; in other cases it is
                    discharged through hoppers on to weighing machines at a lower level, and thence
                    filled into sacks. For this operation there is a frontage of 343 yards; and
                    there is in addition a coal dépôt in Cambridge Street, adjoining the goods-yard,
                    with a frontage of 196 yards. There is a coal and stone dock or basin connected
                    with the Regent’s Canal, where barges are loaded directly from the coal -
                    waggons, either through doorways in the bottom of the waggons or by discharging
                    the coal from the sides of the waggons into hoppers. There is also a hopper at
                    the Cambridge Street dépôt for the purpose of loading barges on the canal.
                    Adjoining the canal basin there are numerous private wharves for bricks and
                    other merchandise. To the north are the locomotive and carriage sheds for
                    repairing the stock, also two engine-running sheds, one round and the other
                    rectangular. The goods, mineral, and locomotive stations cover an area of about
                    70 acres, and the total area covered by the goods and passenger stations and the
                    running lines to Copenhagen tunnel is upwards of 90 acres. The principal
                    goods-shed and granary is 300 feet long and 175 wide, and the area occupied by
                    the goods-warehouses, potato-market, coal-offices, and other buildings amounts
                    to 8¾ acres. In addition, 1 acre is covered by open sheds and 1⅜ acres by the
                    stables and the engineers’ shops. The engine-sheds can hold eighty-four engines
                    and tenders, and they, with the workshops, tanks, carriage-repairing shops, and
                    sundry premises, cover 2½ acres. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The headquarters of the locomotive and carriage department
                    are at Doncaster station. </p></note> There are in the goods, mineral, and
                    engine yards 28½ miles of single line of way and more than 250 sets of switches,
                    200 turn-tables for waggons, and one for engines and tenders; of that length of
                    line 11⅜ miles of sidings are used for coal-waggons.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to dwell at length on the arrangement of small terminal
                    stations for branch lines. Where the line is single a single platform suffices,
                    the trains being light and moving only in one direction at one time.</p>
                <p>In fixing intermediate stations the first step should be to get a good map of all
                    the places -within the scope of the railway, and to mark upon it the population
                    of each place from the last parliamentary census. The greater the number of
                    stations, the more the travelling increases; for quick and cheap transit creates
                    traffic. Stations, especially important ones, should be on the surface rather
                    than on an embankment or a viaduct or in a cutting. Facilities of access in all
                    directions from the surrounding districts, with good roads in the case of
                    passenger traffic, and good water and railway communication for goods dépôts,
                    are obviously indispensable. For safety and regularity there should be an
                    uninterrupted view along the line of railway—no sharp curves or complication of
                    over-bridges —in the vicinity of a large station. Intermediate and junction
                    stations should be situated on dead levels, since, when a good length of level
                    can be had, with gradients falling from it both ways, there is the greatest
                    possible facility for working the traffic. Falling gradients towards a station
                    are objectionable, but cannot in all cases be avoided. When the station is
                    situated midway between towns of such extent as to cause an equal flow of
                    traffic in each direction, offices may be requisite on both sides of the line;
                    but, where the bulk of the traffic tends one way only, it will be desirable to
                    concentrate it on that side which involves the larger number of passengers and
                    the greater extent of waiting space.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0254-0237"/>
                <p>This rule, again, will be modified by the position of the town or the district
                    whence the traffic is to be derived, especially if the railway lies on the
                    natural surface and adjoins a public road, whether crossing on the level or
                    otherwise. This last condition is the most frequent one; and, as some portion at
                    least of the traffic must be expected to depart from the platform opposite to
                    the offices, provision must be made for crossing with the least amount of danger
                    to the public. When the passengers are numerous in both directions,
                    over-bridges, as before stated, are objectionable; and in a surface-station an
                    archway under the line is frequently impracticable. Some good authorities have
                    adopted the plan of making the trains take up and set down the passengers at one
                    platform only, when the platform may be made rather more than double the length
                    of a single train, having crossings in the centre to communicate with both lines
                    of rails, thus placing the trains when standing on the platform upon a
                    loop-siding distinct from those lines. This system offers great convenience to
                    the public when there is much first-class traffic and a large quantity of
                    baggage; and it is especially applicable when the station partakes of the
                    character of a terminus, or is used as a receiver from branch or neighbouring
                    lines, offering, as it does, great facilities for making up and receiving trains
                    which may run over a portion only of the main lines, as well as for attaching
                    and detaching the carriages intended or used for branch traffic, i The buildings
                    and yards in junction stations may be placed in the fork between the two double
                    lines of railway forming the junction, or beyond the point of junction.</p>
                <p>Locomotive stations comprise two departments,—the running: and the constructing
                    and repairing of engines and tenders. The chief locomotive station of the
                    Midland Railway at Derby may be taken as an example. It is contiguous to the
                    passenger station, and is in communication with the main line by a number of
                    sidings branching off at the north end of that station, near the bridge over the
                    Derby Canal. The area of ground enclosed is about 80 acres, of which 12 are
                    covered by buildings. The walls of the erecting shops are 284 feet high; those
                    of the fitting and other shops are 20. The tools are 693 in number. The number
                    of locomotives housed at Derby station (1885) is 289. There is room in the
                    erecting shops for seventy-one locomotives. The workshops are capable of turning
                    out 120 engines per year—say, thirty new engines with tenders, and ninety
                    engines with new boilers, cylinders, and other working parts.</p>
                <p>The carriage and waggon works of the Midland Railway at Derby are situated about
                    half a mile south of the passenger station, with which they are connected by a
                    double line of way branching out from the south end of the station. The works
                    were built in 1875-76, on an enclosed piece of land 67 acres in extent, of which
                    19| are covered by buildings. There are 15J miles of single way within the
                    enclosure. The workshops are built in blocks, separated by open spaces of at
                    least 70 feet in width. They consist principally of seven large shops, of red
                    brick, the walls being of a uniform height of 21 feet; four on the west side are
                    devoted to the preparation of timber and the building and painting of carriages
                    and waggons, and three on the east side to the manipulation of various metals,
                    comprising the foundry and iron stores, the smithy and the machine and fitting
                    shop. Each block of building is entirely surrounded by a 7-inch water-main
                    continually charged with water at a pressure sufficient to throw a jet over the
                    ridge of the roof of any of these buildings. Vehicular communication is carried
                    on between the shops on the east and the west side of the works by means of
                    traversing tables, the rails for which are laid the entire distance across the
                    shops from north to south, and intersect the nine principal lines of sidings
                    flanking the shops. Both steam-power and horse-power are used for moving the
                    traversers.</p>
                <p>The saw-mill is 320 feet long and 200 wide. In the cellar underneath all the main
                    shafting, pulleys, and belting are placed. About a hundred loads of oak logs are
                    converted into plank or scantling weekly. There are in all about a hundred
                    machines for sawing and working wood. Outside the saw-mill are large
                    crosscutting saw-benches, with circular saws 6 feet in diameter, by which logs
                    of deal are cut to the required length before being taken into the mill. The
                    waggon-shop is 320 feet long and 200 wide. The carriage building and finishing
                    shop is 384 by 200 feet wide. In the panel-shed fitted with louvre ventilators,
                    mahogany panel boards, maple boards, &amp;c., are stored for about two years, to
                    be thoroughly dried and seasoned before being used in vehicles. The painting and
                    trimming shop is 384 by 300 feet. It has seventeen lines of rails, each capable
                    of holding ten ordinary vehicles. From the commencement to the finish,
                    twenty-five distinct operations— pruning, filling up, rubbing down, painting,
                    varnishing—are performed on a passenger carriage. Young girls and women—the
                    children and widows of the company’s servants who have lost their lives by
                    accident in the service—are employed on the light work of sewing, stuffing of
                    cushions and backs of carriages, french-polishing, washing and dyeing, cleaning
                    and lacquering light brass-work and gilding.</p>
                <p>The foundries, iron and brass, are 200 feet long by 90 wide. Two thousand tons of
                    iron castings are turned out annually. There are the bar-iron stores 200 by 45
                    feet, the general stores 150 by 90 feet, and the mess-room 45 by 70 feet,
                    providing accommodation for 500 workmen; also two smiths’ shops, one of them 22

                <p>One of the engine houses or sheds for engines on duty, at Gorton station, on the
                    Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire railway, is shown in fig. 21. It is a
                    rotunda of 150 feet in diameter inside, and is capable of holding seventeen
                    engines with their tenders, leaving the entrance and exit lines clear. The
                    advantage of this arrangement over the ordinary polygonal engine-house is in the
                    absence of pillars for supporting the roof, of which there are twelve for a
                    twelve-sided polygon; in this building there is but one column, at the centre.
                    To the left of the entrance is a furnace for holding live fuel, from which the
                    engines are lighted; and there are two lines of rail across the central
                    turn-table, on one of which the engines enter and on the other depart. Between
                    the rails of each radiating line a pit is constructed to afford access below the
                    engines for inspection. The roof is of wrought-iron, surmounted by a louvre for
                    ventilation, which is glazed to admit light freely. In the engine-shed of the
                    North-Eastern Railway at Newcastle five ordinary engine-house rotundas have been
                    replaced by a single rectangular building 450 by 280 feet with five turn-tables.
                    This shed has berths for ninety engines, and the extra space enclosed by the
                    rectangular building as against separate rotundas is used for executing minor
                    repairs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Station Fittings</hi> .—The use of switches and crossings is to
                    form a Jink of communication between one line of rails and another. They are
                    either constructed with ordinary rails or with rails specially rolled, and are
                    carried in cast-iron chairs spiked down to sleepers. The switch-rails are
                    movable, and when worked independently are moved by rods to which heavy weights
                    are attached, —the function of the weights being to retain the points in one
                    position, and to act as a self-acting adjustment in restoring them to their
                    normal position after they have been shifted for the passage of a vehicle or a
                    train. "When only one of the terminal rails is movable it is called a single
                    switch and is used only on sidings or branch lines of rail. The double switches,
                    being more perfect in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0255-0238"/>action, are adopted on the main line; and, as a
                    general rule, switches on the main line are ordered to be laid with the points
                    in the direction of the traffic, so that passing trains may run out of the
                    points, and not into them. “Facing-points,” as they are termed, are such as are
                    laid on the main line, facing or pointing towards the regular advancing trains.
                    Many accidents have been caused to trains by facing-points, improperly set or
                    out of order, turning the train unexpectedly into a siding, when it was
                    impossible to pull up in time to prevent a collision, or throwing the train off
                    the rails altogether. So dangerous are facing-points felt to be, particularly on
                    high-speed lines, that on some railways they are absolutely forbidden at all
                    except at terminal stations and at intermediate stations where every train is
                    ordered to stop. In some situations this rule can only be followed by
                    sacrificing simplicity and increasing the number of backing-points; but it no
                    doubt diminishes the risk of accident.</p>
                <p>Turn-tables are of two classes,—for turning carriages and waggons, and for
                    turning engines and tenders together. Those ordinarily used are of cast-iron,
                    and carry two transverse lines of rails. They revolve upon a central pivot and
                    conical rollers near the circumference, which are upheld by and turn upon a cast
                    - iron base bedded in cement, or on a. built foundation (see fig. 22). For
                    turning engines and tenders together turntables about 40 feet long are required.
                    A common plan of table consists of two longitudinal balks of timber, to carry a
                    line of rails, framed together with cast - iron beams in such aJ way that the
                    centre is supported on a pivot and the extremities on rollers. The table
                    revolves, in a pit about 4 feet deep, on a large circular race of cast-iron
                    bedded on a firm foundation to carry the rollers, and the motive force is
                    applied by means of gearing. In situations where there is much traffic it is
                    needful to extend the deck of the table laterally, like wings, to complete the
                    circle, and so cover in the pit.</p>
                <p>Traversers are a convenient substitute for turn-tables, particularly for working
                    a number of parallel lines of rails. A traverser is simply a low rectangular
                    frame, made with two overhanging rails, to receive carriages or waggons, and
                    movable on rollers across the lines of rail, so as to receive the carriage from
                    any one line of rail and deposit it on any other.</p>
                <p>Water-cranes for delivering water to locomotives are too familiar to every one to
                    need description.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railway Signals</hi> .—The earliest passenger railways were
                    opened without any fixed signals. Flags and disks, elevated on posts and
                    pillars, were first employed, in various forms, and were worked on various
                    codes. Sir Charles Hutton Gregory, about the year 1841, designed and erected at
                    New Cross station, on the Croydon Railway, the semaphore signal, an adaptation
                    of the old form of semaphore used for telegraphing over short distances. This
                    was the most important step ever taken in the development of railway signalling.
                    The semaphore has been almost universally adopted for fixed signalling on
                    railways. There are two arms, to the right and to the left, to command trains
                    arriving in either direction. The arm is turned out horizontally, in a position
                    perpendicular to the post, to signal danger; diagonally downwards at an angle of
                    about 45’ as a signal of caution; and it is turned home, disappearing within the
                    post, when the line is right for the approach of a train. But the general
                    practice now (1885) is to work the semaphore in two positions only,—at danger
                    and at caution. It is thus always in sight, and its position can be identified
                    without hesitation. To make the signal system safe there must be clear
                    definition and strict enforcement of the duties of the attendant; good men must
                    be selected at adequate pay, and they must have convenient, warm, well-fitted
                    lodges, with ample window-space, within which they may keep a constant watch
                    over the line without exposure to weather. At junctions and other important
                    signal-stations the lodges should be raised some height above the surface, to
                    give perfect supervision in every direction and prevent distraction. At night
                    the place of semaphores or disks is supplied by large and powerful lamps with
                    reflectors, capable of showing lights of three colours,—a white light, a blue or
                    green light, and a red light, signifying respectively safety, caution, danger;
                    or, as in general practice, two lights only are shown,—red and green.</p>
                <p>Signalling has been a subject of much controversy, and has been divided into two
                    main systems. In “negative” signalling the normal position is that of caution,
                    or that of safety, as the practice may be, and the signal is only turned on to
                    danger when specially required for the protection of the station on the line. On
                    the other hand, the “positive” system presupposes the normal state of the signal
                    to be that of danger, so that, if the signalman neglect his duty to lower the
                    semaphore when the station is clear for the passage of an approaching train, the
                    train is bound to stop. The positive system has long been in successful
                    operation at all large and important junctions., In such a situation the use of
                    a stringent code is manifestly conducive to the greatest degree of safety, as by
                    the unavoidable intersections of the lines of rails there are many chances of
                    collision. The positive system has been merged in what is known as the block
                    system of signalling,—that is to say,! the positive system has been on most
                    railways extended to every s station on the lines in combination with
                    telegraphic signalling. The best, perhaps the only, safeguard against error on
                    the part of the persons in charge of trains is to be found in the adoption of
                    the absolute block system, and of means for enabling engine-drivers to observe
                    signals well in advance. The absolute block system consists in dividing the line
                    of railway into intervals of convenient lengths, and by means of telegraphic and
                    fixed signals allowing only one train at a time on any single length of single
                    way. The signalman at station A does not send a second train to station B until
                    he receives a signal from station B that the first train has arrived there;
                    meantime the signal at A stands at danger until the man at B signals the arrival
                    of the train at B. Under the “permissive block” system it is simply permitted to
                    signalman B to block signalman A in the event of anything occurring at station B
                    that may render that course advisable. But, supposing that a train has just left
                    station A, then the message from B comes too late to enable signalman A to
                    prevent the train from running into the obstruction at B. The permissive system
                    has been well tried on the principal railways, and is preferred on some lines
                    because it admits of trains being passed on one after another with greater
                    rapidity than on the absolute block system. But it does not afford much
                    protection, and it is now generally preferred to work on the absolute block
                    system, and, for the purpose of doing so effectually, to erect intermediate
                    stations on lines of constant traffic, so as to provide shorter intervals for
                    blockings and obviate the delay incidental to unduly long intervals. The average
                    distance apart of passenger stations is, say, 3 miles, but the distance of
                    signal-stations, whilst it seldom exceeds 4 miles, is frequently only a quarter
                    of a mile, and the average interval may be taken as 1^ miles. Distant
                    signals—that is, signals placed at a distance in advance of points of danger and
                    worked by wire communication from the signal-box—were, it is believed, first
                    introduced on the North British Railway at Meadowbank station near Edinburgh in
                    1846, after the opening of the Hawick branch. In 1852 the Great Northern Railway
                    was completely fitted with distant signals of the semaphore type. Distant
                    signals are occasionally fixed at 1500 yards’ distance; but beyond 800 yards
                    their action is uncertain, and it is checked by a repeater—electric or
                    mechanical—by which, by way of confirmation, the signal is returned to the
                    signalman.</p>
                <p>As railway junctions were multiplied it became apparent, not only that distant
                    signals were to be provided for distinct lines, but that concerted action should
                    be established between signals and switches. They are said to be connected when
                    they are simply coupled together and are moved simultaneously. They are said to
                    be interlocked when the necessary movement of the switches is' completed before
                    that of the signal to safety is commenced; and,! conversely, the movement of the
                    signal to danger is completed before the movement of the switches can be
                    commenced. This is the fundamental principle of the interlocking system of
                    signalling now generally practised. By the combination of the absolute block
                    system and the interlocking system the greatest possible number of trains are
                    enabled to travel over one pair of rails in a given time. At Cannon Street
                    station, at the busiest time of the day, eighteen trains arrive and eighteen
                    depart within an hour; 108 operations of shifting switches and signals, by means
                    of sixty-seven levers or handles, have to be performed in that time. On the
                    North London Railway, at Liverpool Street station, 250 trains pass over the same
                    rails in a day of nineteen hours, averaging only four minutes between trains;
                    frequently only two minutes elapse. The number of trains daily using Moorgate
                    Street station on the Metropolitan Railway is more than 770, involving twice as
                    many movements of engines—1540 movements—on four lines of way in nineteen hours,
                    and every movement is separately signalled. This, of course, could not be
                    performed without the aid of electric mstru<pb break="no"

                    each other, and to have a constant record on the faces of the instruments to
                    show what is being done.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Metropolitan Railways.</hi></p>
                <p>Railways designed for the local service of large cities are necessarily either
                    sunk below or raised above the level of the streets. The late Mr Charles
                    Pearson, solicitor to the City of London, was the originator of the system of
                    intra-metropolitan railways. He worked at the subject from the year 1837. The
                    Metropolitan and the Metropolitan District Railways in and around London are
                    examples of the underground system. In 1854 the first Act of Parliament was
                    passed; the works were commenced in 1860; the first section of the
                    line—Paddington to Farringdon Street—was opened in January 1863, Mr John Fowler
                    being the engineer. Several consecutive extensions into the City and towards
                    Westminster and the Mansion House were made at different times, until the “inner
                    circle” was completed in October 1884, thirty years after the passing of the
                    first Act, and twenty-four years after the commencement of the work of
                    construction. The inner circle of railways as constructed is the direct outcome
                    of the recommendation of the Lords’ Committee of 1863, that they should abut
                    upon, if they did not actually join, nearly all the principal railway termini in
                    the metropolis, completing the circle by a line on the north side of the Thames.
                    The total length of the inner circle is 13 miles and 176 yards. About 2 miles of
                    this length are laid with four lines of rails, and there are twenty-seven
                    stations on the circle at an average distance of half a mile apart. The combined
                    length of the two systems, including the extensions beyond the inner circle,
                    amounted in December 1883 to 40 miles.</p>
                <p>The cost of the Metropolitan Railway system, 22 miles in length, in December 1883
                    has already been stated as £500,000 per mile, and that of the Metropolitan
                    District Railway system, 18 miles in length, as £374,000 per mile. In 1871, when
                    the works had been completed and opened from Moorgate Street to Mansion House
                    station, the capital expenditure by the District Railway Company for works and
                    equipment of 7 j miles of double-line railway was officially stated to be
                    £5,147,000; and by the Metropolitan Railway Company £5,856,000 on lOj miles,
                    —subject to deduction in respect of surplus lands. The combined cost for 17¿
                    miles was at the rate of £630,000 per mile—the greater cost per mile being, no
                    doubt, due to the gi’eater proportion of underground work. The cost of the 1^
                    miles recently opened between ]Mansion House and Aldgate stations was about
                    £450,000, or about £400,000 per mile. The longer axis of the inner circle is
                    about 5^ miles in length, east and west, and the shorter about 2 miles long at
                    the widest part, north and south. The line runs at very various levels,
                    traversing the sloping ground that stretches from the river Thames towards the
                    heights of Hampstead and Highgate. Several natural sewers, formerly clear brooks
                    or tidal channels, now covered, are traversed by the railway. They occasioned
                    many difficulties and great outlay, as they required to be conveyed across the
                    line in specially constructed conduits. The Ranelagh sewer, for instance, is
                    carried under the Metropolitan Railway at Gloucester Terrace in a brick-built
                    channel 9 feet wide by 8 high; and over the District Railway at Sloane Square
                    station in a cast-iron tube 9 feet in diameter, supported on wrought-iron
                    girders of 70 feet span. The Fleet Ditch had to be crossed five times. The
                    average level of the rails of the District Railway, which traverses the old bed
                    of the river and the swamps of Pimlico and Bridge Creek, is 13 feet below Thames
                    high-water mark; whilst that of the northern part, on the Metropolitan Railway,
                    is 60 feet above that datum, making 73 feet of difference of level, and giving
                    rise to heavy works and steep gradients at the west and east ends of the circle.
                    Cuttings 42 feet deep and a tunnel 421 yards in length are found at Campden Hill
                    on the west; and cuttings 33 feet deep and a tunnel 728 yards in length at
                    Clerken-well on the east, on gradients of 1 in 75 and 1 in 100 respectively.</p>
                <p>The works of construction consist of covered ways, tunnels, and open cuttings
                    with retaining v׳alls. The cost of property precluded the use of ordinary open
                    cuttings with slopes. The covered ways were formed by making open cuttings in
                    the first place and then building “open” or artificial tunnels, and covering
                    them in, so as to restore the surface. The sides of the cuttings were made
                    vertical or nearly vertical, and they were supported by timber framing or poling
                    boards till the masonry of the tunnel was completed. The line from Paddington to
                    Moorgate was made in this way with a mixed gauge—that is, the 7 feet gauge and
                    the 4 feet 8i inch gauge in combination—to take the traffic of the Great Western
                    Railway as well as that of national gauge lines. The covered way was therefore
                    made 28J feet wide and 17 high for the mixed gauge, and the arch is elliptical,
                    built of seven “rings” or courses of brick, with side walls three bricks or 27
                    inches thick, on footings 4 feet wide. At the junction of a branch with the main
                    line a “bell-mouth” or expanding arch was constructed in which the span was
                    gradually enlarged to 60 feet. The covered way on the extension, where the
                    national gauge alone was laid, was 25 feet wide. The normal or standard type of
                    arched covered way is 15 feet 9 inches high above the level of the rails. The
                    side walls are three bricks or 27 inches in thickness, and the backs of the
                    walls are carried down vertically to the foundation. The arch was ordinarily
                    built with five rings of bricks, making 22£ inches of thickness; but the number
                    of rings was increased occasionally to eight, nine, or ten rings. The haunches
                    of the arch are backed with concrete. The footings of the walls rest on concrete
                    foundations 30 inches in thickness. A drain-pipe 18 inches in diameter is laid
                    longitudinally along the middle of the tunnel. The whole of the tunnelling of
                    the District Railway, of which Mr Fowler was the engineer, was put in with open
                    cuttings. Two trenches 6 feet wide were sunk to receive the side walls, which
                    were built up to a level 4 feet above the springing of the arch. As the
                    construction of the walls proceeded the timbering was removed and replaced by
                    concrete backing behind the walls. The earth in the middle, called the
                    “dumpling” or core, was excavated to such a level as to admit of the centering
                    being put into position for the turning of the arch. When the arch was built and
                    the centering removed, the dumpling, which had been utilized for transport, was
                    excavated down to the floor-level from the ends, whence the stuff was conveyed
                    away. By this economical method of procedure the only earth and gravel that
                    required to be lifted was that which was excavated in forming the trenches for
                    the side walls. It was raised by means of steam-cranes travelling on temporary
                    rails laid by the sides of the excavations. Again, the centering for the arch
                    was supported on the core, and was simple and less costly than ordinary
                    centering. The complete arch is shown in section in fig. 23. Inverts, or
                    inverted arches, were laid in across the bottom, between the footings of the
                    walls, where, from the nature of the soil or from excessive lateral pressure,
                    the floor was thought likely to rise. W hen there was not sufficient depth for a
                    brick arched way the side walls were made, as shown in fig. 24, of brick and
                    concrete, in bays 8 feet wide, of piers and recesses, spanned by cast-iron
                    girders from 18 to 30 inches in depth, carrying jack-arches between them. The
                    average cost of the arcli-covered ways, 25 feet wide, was about £40 per lineal
                    yard, as against £52 per yard for the girder-covered way.</p>
                <p>On the inner circle there are three tunnels,—the Clerkenwell I tunnel, 728 yards
                    long, of which the level of the rails was from c 29 to 59 feet" below the
                    surface of the ground; the “widening” tunnel, 733 yards long, parallel to the
                    Clerkenwell tunnel; and the tunnel under Campden Hill, 421 yards in length. Even
                    when the utmost precautions are taken, tunnelling through a town is a risky
                    operation. Settlements may occur years after the completion of the works; water
                    mains may be broken in the streets and in the houses; stone staircases may fall
                    down; and other unpleasant symptoms of instability may show themselves. The cost
                    of the tunnel of 25 feet in width was at the rate of £63 per lineal yard.</p>
                <p>Open cuttings are 28^ feet in clear width on the original line of mixed gauge and
                    25 feet wide on the extensions. The retaining walls are of brick and concrete,
                    in 11 feet bays, consisting of piers 3 feet wide on the face, and recesses
                    between the piers 8 feet wide. They are inclined backwards with a batter of l|
                    inches to 1 foot. The foundations are 5 feet below the level of the rails, and
                    the thickness of the walls at the base is 40 per cent., or two-fifths of the
                    height. Occasionally, where the depth is considerable, the thickness is less,
                    and one or two rows of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0257-0240"/>cast-iron struts, according to the depth, are
                    placed between the walls at the upper part to take the thrust. A section of open
                    cutting with two rows of struts is shown in fig. 25. The cost of open cuttings
                    25 feet wide and 25 deep was, say, £67 per lineal yard, or with one row of
                    cast-iron struts £55 per yard. With two rows of struts for a depth of 42 feet,
                    the cost was £108 per lineal yard. It was the intention originally to make the
                    stations as well as the railway strictly “underground,” and those at Baker
                    Street, Portland Road, and Gower Street were so constructed. At Baker Street a
                    segmental arch of 45 feet span and 10 feet 4 inches of rise extends over the
                    entire length of 300 feet of platform. The cost of such a station, including
                    booking-offices, restorations, and other contingencies, amounted to £18,000. Ou
                    the extensions the stations were, when the conditions admitted it, placed in
                    open cuttings, roofed over, 300 feet long, with platforms 15 feet wide. The
                    average cost exceeded that of the same length of ordinary covered way by from
                    £14,000 to £22,000. Not only sewers but gas mains and water mains occasionally
                    demanded very expensive diversions. In passing Broad Sanctuary 2000 feet of gas
                    mains, ranging from 14 to 30 inches in diameter, were diverted; and in simply
                    crossing High Street, Kensington, 600 feet of pipes of from 3 to 30 inches bore
                    were diverted. In passing a sound building on a good foundation the work was
                    executed in short lengths, with carefully timbered trenches quickly followed up
                    by the concrete and brickwork of the retaining walls or covered way. Under the
                    houses of Pembridge Square the side walls of the railway were constructed in
                    short lengths, and to form the roof of the covered way main girders of 25 feet
                    span were slipped between the walls of the houses at convenient places, between
                    which jack-arches were built. At Park Crescent only a floor of old ship timber
                    separates the kitchens from the railway. The permanent way originally consisted
                    of wrought-iron flange rails with longitudinal sleepers and then of steel flange
                    rails; but these have been gradually replaced by double-headed rails in chairs.
                    Fig. 26 shows a section of the covered way under Queen Victoria Street, with the
                    main sewer underneath and the galleries for pipes, &amp;c., at the sides.</p>
                <p>The Glasgow City and District Railway will supply important links of
                    communication between the railways on the north side of the river Clyde. The
                    line extends from College station, High Street, by George Street and Regent
                    Street, crossing Dumbarton Road to the existing Stobcross line, over a length of
                    nearly 2£ miles, almost wholly underground. Of this length 1700 yards, or nearly
                    1 mile, are tunnelled and 1000 yards are covered way. The tunnels are arched
                    with four rings of biick in cement, to a clear height of 18.} feet at the crown
                    and 27 feet in width, for two lines of way. The covered way is arched over with
                    brick.</p>
                <p>We may take the “elevated railroads” of New York as an instance of metropolitan
                    railways for local service above ground. In 1867 the first attempt was made to
                    improve existing means of transit between the residential and the business
                    quarters of the city by the construction of an elevated railroad worked by a
                    wire rope and a stationary engine. The railroad passed into other hands in 1872,
                    and the New York Elevated Railroad Company w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as
                    formed. The lines of this and of the Metropolitan Elevated Railroad Company are
                    now worked together by the Manhattan Railway Company. From the southern terminus
                    of the former railway at South Ferry diverge the lines by which the eastern and
                    western sides of the city are • traversed. Junctions are made with the Grand
                    Central Dépôt of the New York Central and other railroads, and with the New York
                    City and Northern Railroad. In the beginning of 1880 the elevated system was
                    worked over 34£ miles of line; in 1884 96,702,620 passengers were carried over
                    the system, averaging 265,000 per day, over half on one line (3d Ave.). Trains
                    run every two minutes in the morning and evening, when the fares are 5 cents or
                    2£d. for any distance; and in the quieter hours of the day every four or five
                    minutes for a general fare of 10 cents or 5d. The working charges amounted in
                    1883-84 to 58 per cent, of the gross earnings. On the New York Elevated Railroad
                    the line is supported on square wrought-iron lattice-work columns let into
                    cast-iron base blocks founded on brickwork and concrete, at distances of from 37
                    to 44 feet apart. Where the street traffic is crowded a single row of columns is
                    planted in the line of each curb, on the upper ends of which a pair of
                    longitudinal girders are fixed to carry a line of way, 22£ feet high above the
                    street level, as shown in fig. 27, at each side of the street. In other
                    situations the two lines of way are supported at a height of 21 feet on
                    longitudinal girders in the middle of the street, fixed to transverse girders,
                    which span the street and are carried on columns at the curbs. A third
                    arrangement is adopted where the columns are planted in the street at a distance
                    transversely of 23| feet, as in fig. 28, each carrying a line of rails at a
                    height of 18 feet, and connected at intervals by arched bracing to steady the
                    structure. In this illustration the street is occupied by a double line of
                    tramway. The rails are of the Vignoles pattern, of Bessemer steel, weighing 50
                    lb per yard, spiked to cross timber sleepers, and guarded by two longitudinal
                    timbers, one on each side of each rail. The sharpest curve on the main line has
                    90 feet of radius. The gradients conform, for the most part, to those of the
                    streets, and the steepest gradient is 1 in 50 for a length of 800 yards. The
                    traffic is worked with outside cylinder, four-coupled wheel, bogie-truck
                    locomotives, weighing in working order 19^ tons. The driving-wheels are 3^ feet
                    in diameter, and the cylinders 12 inches in diameter with a stroke of 16 inches.
                    The cars are of the usual American type, entered from each end, 45 feet long and
                    8 wide, with seats for forty-two passengers. They are placed on two bogie
                    trucks, and weigh 12 tons. The trains are provided with continuous air-brakes.
                    The stations are about one-third of a mile apart; the platforms are 200 feet
                    long and 13 wide. The cost per mile of double way is given by Mr R. E. Johnston
                    as follows:—</p>

                <p>No payment has been made for way-leave along the streets, nor for compensation to
                    frontagers, though it is known that in the residential quarters traversed by the
                    railroads rents have in many instances, at least, been depreciated to the extent
                    of 50 per cent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Permanent Wat.</hi></p>
                <p>The permanent way consists of rails, chairs, spikes, keys, and sleepers laid in a
                    bed of ballast deposited on the formation. The sleepers of substructure should
                    be bedded on broken stones, cinders, or gravel, at least 12 inches in depth

                    interfere with the drainage of water through the ballast to the formation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gauge.—</hi> The measure of the standard or British national
                    gauge of railways is 4 feet 8⅛ inches of width between the rails forming a line
                    of rails or a way. There are many other gauges in existence in different parts
                    of the world. In England the gauge of 7 feet, originally adopted on the Great
                    Western Railway, was known as the “broad gauge” in contradistinction to the
                    ordinary gauge of 4 feet 8⅜ inches, which was for a long time known as the
                    “narrow gauge.” But the 7 feet gauge has been to a great extent replaced by the
                    4 feet 8⅜ inch or national gauge, and it is being gradually replaced altogether.
                    The lengths of line now (1885) laid on the two gauges on the Great Western
                    Railway are as follows :—</p>

                <p>The name of ‘ ’ narrow gauge” has now ceased to be applicable to the standard
                    gauge, and is reserved for gauges of much less width,— the metre gauge and
                    others of from 2 to 3 or 3⅜ feet wide. Why a fractional measure of gauge should
                    have been selected is a question which has puzzled many people. The fact seems
                    to be that the track of the original carts or trains—5 feet wide outside the
                    wheels— was taken as a standard for the gauge of rails, which was measured
                    outside also. The width of the single rail at the top being originally 1 j
                    inches, the width for the two rails together is 3⅜ inches, which leaves 4 feet
                    8⅜ inches for the inside measure or true gauge. There are in the United Kingdom
                    a few railways of gauge narrower than the standard gauge, of which instances
                    occur in the following lines :—Festiniog, 1 foot 11⅛ inches; Talyllyn, 2 feet 6
                    inches; Dinas and Snowdon, Southwold, Isle of Man, Manx Northern, Ravenglass and
                    Eskdale, Ballymena and Larne, each 3 feet. The following statement (Table
                    XXVII.) comprises the gauges of the principal railway systems in the world

                <p>The relative advantages of broad gauges and narrow gauges were exhaustively
                    discussed at the Institution of Civil Engineers (in 1873), on the reading of Mr
                    W. T. Thornton’s paper on “The Relative Advantages of the 5 feet 6 inch Gauge
                    and of the Metre Gauge for the State Railways of India.” The fallacy pervading
                    the arguments for narrow gauges is that they take the width between the rails as
                    the basic unit of the system; whereas that is really little more than an
                    incident, and the dimensions of the railway must in point of fact be governed by
                    the size and weight of the vehicles which the traffic requires. Speaking
                    generally, the national gauge of 4 feet 8.) inches is at least as good as any
                    other for the purposes of general traffic. If the width of gauge were still an
                    open question, it might be maintained that a gauge of 5 feet would be rather
                    more convenient in view of the increasing size of the more powerful
                    locomotives.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rails.—</hi> “The experience of the last twenty-five years,”
                    said Mr George Parker Bidder, speaking in 1861, “has shown that one system has
                    been adopted almost universally—the double-headed rails, upon chairs with cross
                    sleepers, a plan which has been materially improved by fishing the joints.” On
                    the continent of Europe and in America, however, engineers have almost
                    universally laid the flat-foot or flange rail; and in France double-headed
                    rails, keyed in chairs, have been replaced by flange rails. On the Metropolitan
                    and Metropolitan District Railways, on the contrary, the flange rails have been
                    taken up and replaced by double-headed rails in chairs. The case may be briefly
                    stated in the following terms. The double-headed rail system with chairs is the
                    best where supplies of material and labour for maintenance and repair are always
                    ready and available. The single-headed flange rail system is the best when the
                    main thing to attain is simplicity in construction.</p>
                <p>Steel rails are now very generally used instead of iron; and indeed it may be
                    affirmed that but for the introduction of that material for rails and also for
                    the wheel tires of locomotives the railway system would have broken down under
                    the enormous growth of traffic. Rails of wrought-iron on the early railways
                    lasted about twenty-five years; those of later date have been worn out in from
                    five to ten years and in certain situations in twelve months, mainly owing to
                    increased traffic, heavier loads on the engine-wheels, increased speed, quicker
                    stopping and quicker starting. Steel has come to the rescue both in the
                    engine-wheels and in the rails. Loads of from 15 to 18 tons are now placed with
                    impunity on the single wheels of engines as well as on coupled wheels, while it
                    appears from the investigations of Mr R. Price Williams, a leading authority on
                    permanent way, that a fully proportioned bull-headed rail of steel outlasts
                    fifteen or eighteen iron rails. Steel rails are not merely stronger or harder
                    but, owing to their texture, are worn away only by simple abrasion, whereas iron
                    rails separate out into strands as soon as the outer coating that binds them
                    together is worn off. Mr Alfred A. Langley laid down in 1874 samples of
                    permanent way near Stepney station on the London and Blackwall Railway, where
                    upwards of 300 trains a day passed over a single line of way. The weight of each
                    train was on an average about 150 tons, making a total of about 45,000 tons
                    daily over one line of rails. The rails are both of steel and of iron, weighing
                    80 lb per lineal yard and keyed in cast-iron chairs on cross rectangular
                    sleepers. The greater number of the w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> rought-iron
                    rails had to be turned after one year and three-quarters, during which period
                    they had worn down about one-eighth of an inch; but the necessity for reversing
                    did not arise from the wear itself, but because they gave way in places, either
                    bulging or splitting. The steel rails had worn about one-sixteenth of an inch in
                    the same period. About 27,000,000 tons had passed over the line.</p>
                <p>The rails generally, indeed almost universally, used for the way of railways are
                    the double-headed, the bull-headed, and the flange or Vignoles rails (in the
                    United States, Germany, Canada, and Mexico), the double-headed and the
                    bull-headed rails being keyed into cast-iron chairs spiked to sleepers, the
                    flanged being laid upon and fastened direct to the sleepers. The principal
                    advantage of the flange rail is the facility with which it can be attached to
                    the sleeper with fastenings of a simple description. The disadvantages are that
                    it cannot be turned or reversed when the head is worn, as the double-headed rail
                    may be, and that the rigid attachment of the rail to the sleeper causes a
                    greater degree of disturbance of the way and involves more labour for
                    maintenance than in the case of the double-headed rail. The double-headed rail
                    is made heavier foτ the same class of traffic than the flange rail; but it is
                    also stronger and is easily bent to curves, although owing to the mode of
                    attachment to the chairs by wooden keys there is a liability to a slight
                    longitudinal movement of the rails, known as ‘ <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>
                    creeping.” The bull-headed rail possesses the advantages of the doubleheaded
                    rail, except that, like the flange rail, it is not reversible. The bull-headed
                    rail is laid on most of the railway lines of England and Scotland; the
                    double-headed rail is also in use. In Ireland the bull-headed and the flange
                    rails are used. Double-headed and bull-headed rails in English practice are
                    rolled to a weight of from 82 to 86 lb per yard; the heads are made from 2⅜ to
                    2∣ inches wide; the webs are from five-eighths to thirteen-sixteenths of an inch
                    in thickness; and the height of the rail varies from 5∣ to 5 j inches. The rails
                    are now made of steel, in bars for the most part 30 feet in length, with the
                    advantage in comparison with shorter lengths of a more solid road, fewer joints,
                    and less cost for maintenance. They are fixed into massive cast-iron chairs,
                    weighing from 31 to 55 lb each, by means of hard wood keys—oak. They are canted
                    inwards in their seats at an angle usually of 1 in 20, the better to resist
                    lateral blows from wheels. The chairs are made of considerable width on the more
                    heavily worked lines— from 7 to 8 inches, against a minimum of 4⅜ inches on
                    other lines. On some lines the seats of the chairs on which the rails rest are
                    slightly rounded in the direction of the rail; this forms a compensation for
                    slight deviations from the level in the sleepers, but is mainly useful in
                    preventing indentation of the rails by the concussions to which they are
                    subject—a matter <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> of importance with double-headed
                    rails which are by and by to be reversed. In such cases Mr T. E. Harrison places
                    cushions of hard wood in the chair to support the rails, which are thus
                    effectually protected from indentation; and, in addition, the trains run more
                    smoothly. The oak keys by which the rails are fastened in the chairs are
                    generally applied at the outer side of the rail, as the jar caused by the
                    lateral percussion of the flanges of wheels is then less than when the key is
                    placed inside; but on the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway the
                    key is put at the inner side of the rail, and there is this to be said in favour
                    of the practice, that the rails are kept firmly to gauge and the key is less
                    likely to shift. On some railways contrivances are employed to prevent the keys
                    from shifting or creeping out of their proper position in the chair; these will
                    be noticed in their places. The rails are laid end to end, one-eighth or
                    three-sixteenths of an inch apart at ordinary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n259/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0259-0242"/>temperatures, to allow for expansion in hot
                    weather. The joints of the rails are united or fished with parallel steel plates
                    lodged within the side channels of the rails and fastened with four bolts and
                    nuts passed through the web of the rails, and, in order that the fish-plates may
                    take a solid and steady bearing, the entering faces of the upper and lower
                    members of the rails are in most instances formed straight and steep,—at an
                    angle of about 2 to 1. For the same purpose the fish-plates are hollow at their
                    inner faces, so as not to be in contact with the vertical members or web of the
                    rails, and are slightly elastic in consequence. Vertical stiffness, also, is of
                    prime importance in fish-plates, which act as beams fixed at the ends and
                    uniformly loaded, being required to sustain the loads of trains passing over the
                    joints. On some lines, accordingly, the fish-plates are made of greater depth,
                    extending downwards along the lower table of the rail, and are even turned under
                    it, whence they are called clip fish-plates. The chairs are laid on transverse
                    timber sleepers, ordinarily cut from Baltic redwood to a scantling of 10 inches
                    wide and 5 deep, and 9 feet in length,— speaking precisely, only 8 feet 11
                    inches in length, to secure the timber from import duty. They are most commonly
                    submitted to a preserving process by the injection of about 2⅜ gallons of
                    creasote into each sleeper. The chairs are fixed to the sleepers by iron spikes
                    or oak trenails, or both, varying in number from two on the lines of lighter
                    traffic to three or four on lines of heavier traffic. On the London and
                    South-Western Railway and on the South-Eastern Railway a compound fastener is
                    used,—a spike driven into a hollow trenail, after the latter is driven into the
                    sleeper. There are usually eleven cross sleepers to each length of rails of 30
                    feet, making the average distance between the sleepers about 2 feet 9 inches
                    from centre to centre. It is usual to space them apart more widely in the middle
                    portion of the rail-bars (up to 3 feet) and more closely about the joints, with
                    a view to equalizing the vertical resistance of the rails to rolling loads, by
                    supplying a greater degree of support from the sleepers near the joints.</p>
                <p>The standard models of permanent way on the double-headed rail and chair system
                    adopted by Mr John Fowler for the New South Wales railways have been already
                    noticed. The rails are shown in section in figs. 29 and 35. The sleepers are of
                    colonial hard woods, chiefly iron-bark timber. They are laid 2 feet 6 inches
                    apart between centres at the joints of the rails, and 3 feet 1 inch apart
                    elsewhere. The upper and lower tables of the rails are curved or rounded in
                    section to a radius of 5∣ inches, the height of the rail. The entering or
                    overhanging faces of the rail are inclined at a slope of about 1 in 2, forming
                    straight and equally inclined bearings to receive the fish-plates. The rails,
                    while in course of manufacture, are tested by selecting a few rails of each
                    day’s make, from which a portion 4⅜ feet in length is cut off and placed on iron
                    supports 3⅜ feet apart, and is subjected to three blows from a weight of 1 ton
                    falling 12 feet each time. The rails are to deflect not less than 6⅛ inches and
                    not more than 7⅜ under this test without showing any signs of fracture. The
                    fish-bolts, as well as the spikes for fastening the chairs to the sleepers, are
                    made of the finest quality of close fibrous iron. Fifty per cent, of the rails
                    were ordered 24 feet in length, 40 per cent. 21, and 10 per cent. 18. The chairs
                    (fig. 30) are 13⅛ inches long at the sole, 41 wide, and 1⅜ thick at the seat of
                    the rail. Test bars of the metal used for the chairs are cast to a scantling of
                    2 inches by 1 inch and 3⅜ feet long. They are placed on edge, on supports 3 feet
                    apart, and are required to sustain a dead load of 30 cwt. suspended from the
                    centre of the bar without fracture. The spikes are seven-eighths of an inch in
                    diameter, tapered at the head to fifteen-sixteenths, with hemispherical or
                    cup-heads forged from the solid bar. The above-described way, as laid in New
                    South Wales, is bedded in ballast consisting of broken stone 12 inches in depth
                    below the sleepers, broken to a gauge of 3 inches, boxed up with broken stone of
                    a smaller size to a gauge of 2 inches for a depth of 8 inches. The total depth
                    of the ballast from the crown of the formation is 22 inches.</p>
                <p>The surface of the formation below the ballast is rounded in cross-section, in
                    order to drain off such water as penetrates through the ballast. Grips or
                    furrows are cut and drains laid in where necessary, so that no water is allowed
                    to remain on the line or under the ballast.</p>
                <p>The South-Eastern double-headed rail (fig.</p>
                <p>31) is keyed into chairs 4⅜ inches wide and 13g long at the sole. They are fixed
                    to the sleeper by two spikes driven into two hollow oak trenails. The sleepers
                    at the joints are laid 2 feet 4 inches apart between centres.</p>
                <p>The following are the quantities of material for 1 mile of way, single line
                    :—</p>

                <p>These quantities are considerably less than those of the Midland Railway (which
                    are stated below), as may naturally be the case for a line chiefly of passenger
                    traffic in comparison with one of heavy goods and mineral traffic. The
                    double-headed rails of the North-Eastern Railway, 82 ft&gt; per yard, are bedded
                    on blocks or cushions of oak placed in the bottom of the chairs, the advantages
                    of which have already been noticed.</p>
                <p>The type section of way of the Midland Railway is shown in fig. 32. The formation
                    is inclined each way from the centre, making two straight slopes for drainage.
                    The ballast is of strong gravel broken stone, and ashes or clinker,—chiefly
                    gravel. It covers a width of 26⅜ feet for two lines of way. It is laid to a
                    depth of 16 inches at the middle of the six-foot, and is formed level with the
                    upper sides of the sleepers between the rails in the four-foot, with a medium
                    depth of 16 inches, or 11 inches beneath the sleepers. At the outer sides of the
                    rails the ballast is heaped level with the tops of the chairs, or, more
                    precisely, the tops of the keys, and is sloped down to the formation at each
                    outer side. The upper and lower surfaces of the rail (see fig. 33) are curved to
                    a radius equal to the height of it, and the planks are flat,—adapted for taking
                    up lateral blows and mitigating wear.</p>
                <p>The chairs are remarkable for large dimensions, being 7½ inches wide and</p>
                <p>15½ long at the sole, which is 1⅞ inches thick under the rail, and for their
                    weight,</p>
                <p>50 lb each. The cost of relaying 1 mile of single way on the Midland system just
                    described, based on contract prices in</p>
                <p>1884, amounts to £1572, 8s. 5d. Deduct-</p>
                <p>ing credit for old material to the amount of £714, 8s. 3d., the net cost of
                    relaying is £858, 0s. 2d. The particulars of quantities, cost, and credit are
                    given in the following statement, prepared by Mr Alfred A. Langley, the engineer
                    of the railway :—</p>

                    ballast guards, use of waggons, &amp;c., in relaying 1 mile of single line, £50.
                    The lift of 3 inches signifies the wear and tear of ballast and the quantity
                    required to be replaced.</p>
                <p>The standard rail on the London and North-Western Railway is, like that of the
                    Midland, bull-headed, but less high and wider at the head and the foot and
                    thicker in the web. The chairs have the peculiarity of being ribbed horizontally
                    on the inner face against which the oak key is driven, in order to grip the key.
                    The sleepers at the joints are placed 2 feet 3 inches apart between centres. The
                    Great Northern Company’s standard rail contrasts with the two immediately
                    preceding rails in being less high than either, and having a thinner web and a
                    larger head than the others. There are peculiarities in the disposition of the
                    way. The first is that the joints of the rails are supported in a chair directly
                    under each joint, to which the fishes are bolted; the second is that the two
                    rails forming a line of way break joint with each other, the joints alternating
                    from side to side, and that, as a consequence, all the sleepers are placed
                    equally apart. On this system, it is argued, the way is of as nearly uniform
                    strength as it is possible to make it. The keys for fixing the rails are of
                    compressed fir.</p>
                <p>The Great Western, the Metropolitan, and the Lancashire and Yorkshire rails are
                    the heaviest of the bull-headed rails noticed in</p>
                <p>Table XXVIII. (see below),—weighing 86 lb per yard, having comparatively thin
                    webs and great development of head (see fig. 34). In the</p>
                <p>Great Western chair the inner face of the jaw that holds the key is formed with
                    an indenta-</p>
                <p>tion, to aid in keeping the key in place,—the key being likely to expand into the
                    vacancy.</p>
                <p>In the Metropolitan way the chairs are fast ened to the sleepers by two through
                    bolts and nuts to each chair. The rails of the</p>
                <p>Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Rail way are placed in chairs of great
                    length, 16¼</p>
                <p>inches; and, contrary to usual practice, the oak keys for securing the rails in
                    the chairs are fixed on the inner side of the rail, the rail taking its bearing
                    directly upon the jaw of the chair. Thus the lateral strokes of the wheels on
                    the rails are resisted directly by the jaw of the chair, and not through the
                    medium of the key. There are twelve sleepers to each length of rail, averaging 2
                    feet</p>
                <p>6 inches apart between centres, as against the usual number on other lines,
                    eleven per rail-length of 30 feet. The sleepers, of Baltic redwood, are not
                    creasoted nor preserved by any other process, except in one or two places where
                    sand ballast is used.</p>
                <p>The leading particulars of standard double-headed and bullheaded rails, with
                    chairs and sleepers, are given in Table XXVIII. (see below).</p>
                <p>Specimen standard flange rails are illustrated in figs. 35 and 36 in cross
                    section. Leading particulars of flange rails are given in Table XXIX. below.</p>
                <p>In the case of the flange rail of the New South Wales Railway (fig. 35) the
                    inward cant of the rails is provided for by planing out by machinery the beds of
                    the rails at the upper sides of the sleepers to the angle 1 in 20; and that the
                    rails may be kept in gauge the beds are notched into the surface by as much as
                    the thickness of the flange of the rail. No holes of any kind, either punched or
                    drilled, are made in the flanges of the rails; these are fastened to the
                    sleepers by screws and spikes alternately, having projecting heads, by which the
                    flange is clipped and held down. In order to check the tendency to creeping of
                    the rails as well as of the fish-plates, it is intended to flange the
                    fish-plates and to cut a notch at each end of them, in each of which a dog-spike
                    is to be driven into the sleepers. The Great Northern of Ireland rail is similar
                    to Mr Fowler’s on the New South Wales Railway, but heavier. The Midland Great
                    Western rail (fig. 36) is peculiarly formed, with a web of taper section, being
                    nine-sixteenths of an inch thick at the head, and thickened to 1 inch at the
                    flange. The bridge rail of the Great Western Railway (fig. 37) is laid on the
                    model originally adopted by Mr Brunel. The rails are only 3 inches high, and are
                    aided in resisting vertical stress by the continuous longitudinal sleepers of
                    large scantling, 14 inches wide and</p>
                <p>7 deep, on which they are laid, with pine packing 8 inches wide and 1 thick. The
                    rails are laid so as to break joint with the sleepers, which are in lengths of
                    25 feet, whilst the rails are from 18 to 32 feet in length. The rails are
                    fastened down by fang-bolts,</p>

                <p>which pass through their flanges and the sleeper together. At the joints they are
                    fortified by square iron plates laid under the joints, through which fang-bolts
                    are passed. The longitudinals are connected and kept to gauge by transoms or
                    cross-ties at intervals.</p>
                <p>The minimum weight of ordinary flange rails is about 45 lb per lineal yard. If
                    the weight is less than this for main lines the upper bearing surface is
                    objectionably narrow, and it is scarcely high enough above the sleepers. The
                    maximum weight of flange rails is about 80 lb per lineal yard. Flange rails,
                    like headed rails, are laid on transverse sleepers, to which they are fixed,
                    most commonly by means of screws, spikes, or flange bolts and nuts. In all cases
                    it is preferable to effect the fastening of steel rails without piercing them in
                    the flange, as they are materially weakened by such perforations.</p>
                <p>In the United States (also very largely in Germany, Canada, and Mexico) the
                    Yignoles rail is universally used for railways, varying in weight from 67 or 70
                    lb per yard on a few leading lines to 30 lb on narrow-gauge railways. No
                    railroads with any considerable traffic are now laid down with rails of less
                    weight than 60 lb per yard. The Pennsylvania Railroad, laid to a gauge of 4 feet
                    9 inches, is constructed of flange rails of two sections, one of 60 lb per yard
                    4 j inches high, the other of 67 lb 4J inches high, in lengths of 30 feet. The
                    fishes or splices are 2 feet in length, held by four bolts and nuts. The outer
                    splice is formed with a horizontal flange or “tongue,” which overhangs the
                    flange of the rail and is spiked to the sleeper. Allowance for expansion when
                    the rails are laid in winter is provided by laying the rails five-sixteenths of
                    an inch apart, endwise; in summer a space of only.one-sixteenth of an inch in
                    width is allowed. The cross sleepers are 8 inches wide by 7 deep, and are 8^
                    feet in length; they are laid so closely that the maximum distance apart between
                    centres does not exceed 2 feet. There are sixteen sleepers for each length of 30
                    feet, and the sleepers at the joints are laid with a clearance of over 10 inches
                    between them. The rails are fastened by spikes to the sleepers at the inside and
                    the outside. The width for the double line of way at the formation level is 31
                    feet 4 inches in cuttings; and on embankments the width of the formation is 24
                    feet 3 inches, sloping from the centre at the rate of 1 in 20. The ballast is
                    laid to a depth of not less than 12 inches under the sleepers, and is filled in
                    to the level of the upper surface of the sleepers. Where stone ballast is used
                    it is broken uniformly to a gauge of 2£ inches in diameter. For double lines of
                    way large stones are placed in the bottom, at the centre, between the lines to
                    provide for drainage; but the stones are not placed under the ends of the
                    sleepers; thus water is drained off rapidly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metallic Permanent Way</hi> .—Metallic permanent way, in which
                    the sleepers are of iron, has been much employed in tropical countries, and is
                    now to some extent adopted in France and in Germany. The oldest and most widely
                    used system of metallic way is that of Mr H, Greaves, who ' in 1846 introduced a
                    spherical or bowl sleeper of cast-iron, having the chair for the rail cast on
                    its summit (see fig.</p>
                <p>38). Every second pair of sleepers are connected and held to gauge by transverse
                    tie-bars, which pass through and are bolted to them. The form of the sleeper is
                    strong, it holds well in the ground, the chair is not liable to be detached, the
                    whole bearing surface is directly beneath the road, the ballast is kept dry and
                    elastic, and there is a simple means of packing the sleeper through holes in the
                    top, with a pointed rammer from the surface, so that the sleeper and the rail
                    can be forced upwards without disturbing the general bed of ballast. They may
                    also be lowered by taking out a portion of ballast from the interior. Another
                    system, Mr W. Bridges Adams’s “suspended girder rail,” is shown in fig. 39. The
                    rail is 7 inches deep, weighing 65 lb per lineal yard, and is suspended by
                    continuous angle-wires, or side wings bolted to it, and bedded in the ballast;
                    and, as the bearing surface on the ballast was approximated to the bearing
                    surface of the rail, a great degree of stability was anticipated. Wrought - iron
                    transverse sleepers were first tried in Belgium in 1862, then in France and in
                    Portugal, and afterwards in Germany. There are various systems, most of which
                    were׳ unsatisfactory, but the Yautherin sleeper, first tried in 1864 on the
                    Lyons railway, has been successful. It is hollow in section, of the form A
                    truncated, supposing the upper part of the letter to be removed, presenting a
                    flat bearing surface, 3.| inches wide, for a flange rail. It is 8 feet in length
                    and 9 inches wide over the flanges forming the base. It is three-eighths of an
                    inch thick at the centre and is only half that thickness in the wings. The rail
                    is fixed to the sleeper with gibs and cotters. It has been reported that the
                    motion over the Vautlierin sleepers is much easier than that over sleepers of
                    oak, and that in consequence the cost of maintenance is comparatively low. It is
                    stated that amongst a number of rails laid for trial under similar conditions,
                    some of them on wooden sleepers and some of them on Yautherin sleepers, the
                    number of defective rails amounted to only 2^ per cent, of those laid on
                    Yautherin sleepers against 13 per cent, of those laid on wood. It was found that
                    if the Vautherin sleepers were not at least 8 feet in length they failed at the
                    ends, and that even for this length it was expedient to strengthen them at the
                    angles. It was also found that large and hard ballast, or broken stoqes or
                    broken slag, aggravated the tendency to give way. Ballast of ashes produced a
                    similar bad effect, and also caused the sleepers to rust. On the contrary,
                    ballast of gravel, of a marly character, adapted itself admirably to the form of
                    the sleeper. The system of fastening the rails to the sleepers by gibs and
                    cotters has been abandoned in favour of clips and liook-bolts. The Hartwich
                    system of iron way need not be described here, having always given bad results.
                    The Hilf system of iron way consists of two parts,—an iron longitudinal sleeper
                    and a flange rail of steel. It is simple, easily laid and maintained, and
                    economical. The sleeper is in section like the letter E, bevelled at the angles,
                    having an upper flat surface and three flanges downwards. It is 12 inches wide
                    and about 2£ deep; and it can be rolled to lengths of 30 feet and only one-third
                    of an inch in thickness, and to a weight of 59 lb per yard. The rail is 432־
                    inches high, with 232־ inches width of table, 340־ width of flange base, and
                    four-tenths of an inch thickness of web. It is rolled in lengths of 30 feet and
                    weighs 5H lb per yard. It is fish-jointed and is fixed to the sleeper with two
                    rows of bolts and nuts at intervals of from 30 to 40 inches. The gauge is
                    preserved by means of 1-inch tie-rods, screwed at both ends with nuts. One
                    tie-rod is sufficient for each length of rail. The combined rail and sleeper,
                    placed on supports 54 inches apart, can carry 18 tons at their middle, without
                    impairing their elastic strength.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Locomotive Power.</hi></p>
                <p>Locomotives may broadly be reduced to two classes, according to the situation of
                    the working cylinders. In the first class these are within the framing, under
                    the boiler, with the main driving axle cranked at two points to receive the
                    power from the two cylinders; in the second class they are outside the framing,
                    and connected, not to the axle, which is straight, but to crank-pins fixed
                    between the spokes of the wheels, in connexion with the nave. From these
                    distinguishing features the two types of engines are known respectively as
                    “inside cylinder locomotives” and “outside cylinder locomotives.” In the latter
                    the general contour of the cylinders is usually visible at the fore-end of the
                    machine. The tenders have six or four wheels, according to the taste of the
                    designer, and they are supplied with powerful brakes, worked by screws, with
                    blocks of wood placed against each wheel. A water-tank forms the upper part of
                    the tender, namely, the two sides and the back, usually in the form of a
                    horse-shoe, holding from 1000 to 3000 gallons; and in the hollow of the shoe the
                    fuel is deposited, of which a full charge may weigh from 30 cwt. to 3^ tons. The
                    engine and the tender are sustained on springs placed over the axle-bearings.
                    Again, there is the general classification of locomotives into passenger engines
                    and goods and mineral engines. As the power of the engine is brought into action
                    through the grip of the driving wheels upon the rails, it is necessary, for the
                    exertion of maximum power in goods engines, to make two or more pairs of the
                    wheels of one ·size, and transmit the driving force from the central pair of
                    wheels to the front and back pairs by means of coupling-rods attached to
                    crank-pins at the naves of the wheels. Such engines are called “six-coupled,”
                    and for them the most convenient combination is with inside cylinders. When the
                    cylinders are outside it is usual to couple only the hind pair of wheels to the
                    driving wheels, making a <hi rend="italic">“</hi> four-coupled” engine, the
                    leading or front wheels being of smaller diameter than the driving-wheels, and
                    so leaving room for the convenient placement of the cylinders. The six-coupled
                    engine can take the heaviest train on a good straight railway,—that is, one free
                    for the most part from curves; but four-coupled engines work more economically
                    on lines with frequent curves, and may be made so as to take, in average
                    practice, as great a load as six-coupled engines. Passenger locomotives have
                    usually been constructed with a single pair of driving-wheels, for free running
                    at high speeds; but as traffic became heavier four-coupled-wheel passenger
                    engines came into vogue: and express trains are · now for the most part worked
                    with four-coupled engines. In recent years the forepart of engines has in many
                    cases been placed on a four-wheeled truck connected <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n262/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0262-0245"/>by a central bolt or pivot to the frame of the
                    engine, so that the fore-wheels can swing to the curves of the line. On the
                    Metropolitan, Metropolitan District, and North London Railways entirely, and on
                    many large railway systems partially, where sharp curves are frequent,
                    bogie-engines are employed, and with great advantage in facilitating traction.
                    Another device for the same purpose is the use of radial axles,—that is, axles
                    either at the forepart or the back of the engine, which by their axle-boxes
                    slide laterally between circularly formed guides on entering and on leaving
                    curved parts of the way, and so maintain a radial position at right angles to
                    the line of rails.</p>
                <p>American practice, many years since, arrived at two leading types of locomotive
                    for passenger and for goods traffic. The passenger locomotive has eight wheels,
                    of which four in front are framed in a bogie, and the four wheels behind are
                    coupled drivers. This is the type to which English practice has been
                    approximating. The tender is carried on eight wheels, disposed under two trucks
                    or bogies, fore and aft. Goods locomotives are made with eight wheels and with
                    ten wheels, of which, in each case, the leading pair of wheels are connected
                    with a swing bolster and radius bar, to conform laterally and radially to
                    curves.</p>
                <p>As the speed increases a more than proportional increase in the engine-power is
                    necessary to draw a given train. Thus, if an engine and tender, weighing
                    together 40 tons and exerting a given tractive force, takes, say, forty loaded
                    carriages, weighing 360 tons, at 20 miles per hour on a level, the loads which
                    it could take if it exerted the same tractive power at higher speeds would be
                    only as follows :—</p>

                <p>The influence of gradients also is very important. If an engine and tender,

                <p>This is the reason why the older railways were made nearly level at an enormous
                    cost,—the elder Stephenson’s policy being to incur a large expenditure in
                    construction in order to avoid otherwise heavy inclines and heavy expenses. The
                    ruling gradient of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was fixed at 1 in 900,
                    excepting, of course, the inevitable inclines at Rainhill summit, for working
                    which special provision was made; that of the next great line, the London and
                    Birmingham, was fixed at 1 in 330; on the Great Western Railway, one of the
                    earliest made lines, the ruling inclination is 1 in 1320 for the greater part of
                    the way. Locke, as already explained, initiated the system of cheaply
                    constructed railways, as the facilities for increasing the power of locomotives
                    became betteι <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> understood; he constructed lines
                    with long steep gradients, some of them 1 in 70, 1 in 75, 1 in 80. The Great
                    Northern Railway, of comparatively recent origin, was constructed on a ruling
                    gradient of 1 in 200; and, in general, the more recently made lines have the
                    steepest gradients. Steep railways are generally also lines of frequent curves,
                    which is another cause of loss of locomotive power. Moreover, the ruling speeds,
                    as they may be called, have in the course of years increased. Thus in every way
                    more powerful engines are now needed than in the early days of railways.</p>
                <p>The fundamental characteristics of English practice are fairly represented by a
                    few types of locomotives. Take first an express passenger locomotive, which
                    stands on a wheel base—the distance apart of the centres of the extreme axles—of
                    15 feet 4 inches. The cylinders are inside and are 16 inches in diameter, with a
                    slide of 22 inches. The driving-wheels are 7 feet in diameter. The firegrate has
                    an area of 18 square feet, and the heating surface of the fire-box and
                    flue-tubes taken together is 1339 square feet. The total weight of the engine in
                    working order is 28 tons 6 cwt., of which nearly 12 tons are driving weight,—the
                    weight at the driving-wheels. The tender stands on three pairs of wheels and
                    weighs about 16 tons, with, in addition, 1780 gallons or 8 tons of water when
                    filled, and 3 tons of coal.</p>
                <p>The “Lady of the Lake” is an express passenger locomotive, one of a class which
                    was designed by Mr John Ramsbottom with special regard to the running of express
                    trains on the northern division of the London and North-Western Railway. The
                    cylinders are “outside”; they are 16 inches in diameter, with 24 inches of
                    stroke, and the driving-wheels are 7 feet 7 inches in diameter. The fire-grate
                    has an area of 15 square feet, and there is over 1000 square feet of heating
                    surface. The engine weighs 27 tons in working order and the tender 17⅜, together
                    44⅜ tons. The tender is fitted with Mr Ramsbottom’s apparatus for picking up
                    feed-water whilst running: a scoop is let down from the bottom of the tender and
                    dips into water contained in a long open trough, laid between the rails, from
                    which it is scooped up into the tanks. The minimum speed at which this operation
                    can be effected is 22 miles per hour. By the aid of the water-lifter this
                    express engine has been enabled to run the whole distance from Holyhead to
                    London—264 miles— in one continuous run, at an average speed of 42 miles per
                    hour, taking a train of eight or nine carriages, and consuming 27 lb of coal as
                    fuel per mile run.</p>
                <p>An express passenger locomotive having 18-inch cylinders and four-coupled
                    driving-wheels, 7 feet in diameter, with a four-wheel bogie in front under the
                    smoke - box, was designed by Mr T. W. Johnson for the traffic of the Midland
                    Railway. The engine stands on eight wheels, forming a base 21⅜ feet long. It
                    weighs about 42 tons in working order, and with the tender, including coal and
                    water, about 68 tons. The average load taken by engines of this class is
                    fourteen carriages at the time-bill speed of 50 miles per hour, over gradients
                    of from 1 in 120 to 1 in 130, with a consumption of 28 lb of coal per mile run.
                    The engine can take as a maximum load seventeen carriages between Manchester and
                    Derby, over ruling gradients of 1 in 90 and 1 in 100 for 10 miles, at a speed up
                    the inclines of 35 miles per hour, and on levels and falling gradients at 50
                    miles per hour. The carriages weigh, with passengers, 11 tons each, making up a
                    train of the gross weight of 187 tons.</p>
                <p>The express passenger engines on the Great Northern Railway (fig. 40), designed
                    by Mr Patrick Stirling, have outside cylinders, 18</p>
                <p>inches in diameter, and a single pair of 8-feet driving-wheels. It is one of the
                    most recent developments of the single-wheel engine. It is placed on eight
                    wheels, of which the first four are framed in a bogie, or truck, pivoted on a
                    centre under the smoke-box. The cylinders are placed outside, and between the
                    wheels of the bogie at each side. They are 18 inches in diameter, with a stroke
                    of 28 inches,—dimensions which, taken together, exceed in magnitude those of any
                    other engine for English passenger-traffic. The driving-wheels are 8 feet 1 inch
                    in diameter and the bogie-wheels 3 feet 11 inches. The engine weighs 38 tons in
                    working order, the distribution of the weight being as follows :—</p>

                <p>The pivot of the bogie is 6 inches nearer the hind than the front axle,—these
                    being 6⅜ feet apart. By this disposition the' bogie appears to lead better than
                    if the pivot were, as usual, equidistant between the axles. The working pressure
                    in the boiler is 140 lb per square inch. There are 217 brass flue-tubes, l-9/16
                    inches in diameter, presenting a heating surface for evaporation of upwards of
                    1000 square feet. There is in all 1165 square feet of surface, and there is 17'6
                    square feet of grate surface. Mr Stirling, on the question of single-wheel <hi
                    rend="italic">versus</hi> coupled wheels for passenger locomotives, states that
                    he constructed two classes of engines,—one class with four 6½-feet wheels
                    coupled, the other with a single pair of 7-feet driving-wheels. The boilers of
                    the two classes were alike; also the cylinders, which were 17 inches in
                    diameter, with 24 inches of stroke. The pressure in the boilers was 140 lb. With
                    like trains the single-wheel engine had the better of it; in fact, it generally
                    beat the coupled engine in time, running from King’s Cross to Potter’s Bar, a
                    distance of nearly 13 miles, nearly all uphill, the gradients varying from 1 in
                    105 for 2 miles to 1 in 200. Engines of the class of the 8-feet-wheel engine
                    travel between King’s Cross and Leeds or York. The steepest gradients on the
                    route are met with on leaving Leeds, ascending 1 in 50, besides the gradient 1
                    in 105 leaving King’s Cross. Trains of from sixteen to twenty-two carriages are
                    taken from King’s Cross station with ease; and on several occasions twenty-eight
                    carriages have been taken, and time has been kept. On one occasion a distance of
                    15 miles in <pb break="no"

                    sixteen carriages, making a speed of 75 miles j&gt;er hour. The engine has taken
                    a train of thirty-three carriages full of passengers from Doncaster to
                    Scarborough and back at an average speed of 45 miles per hour.</p>
                <p>It is capable of moving a gross weight, including engine, tender, and train, of
                    356 tons on a level at a speed of 45 miles per hour. The average results of the
                    regular performance of seven engines of this class between Doncaster,
                    Peterborough, and London for the third quarter of 1884 show that a train of
                    twelve six-wheeled carriages weighing 13 tons each was taken at a speed of from
                    50 to 53 miles per hour, for a consumption of 25¿ lb of coal per mile run and
                    five pints of oil per 100 miles run.</p>
                <p>Four-coupled locomotives, having the cylinders inside, and four wheels coupled
                    “in front,” with a pair of hind or trailing wheels, are known as “mixed
                    engines,”—that is to say, engines adapted for either passenger traffic or goods
                    traffic,—a generally useful type. In one example the cylinders are 16 inches in
                    diameter, with a stroke of 22 inches; the coupled wheels are 5 feet in diameter.
                    The weight of the engine is 244 tons, of which 20 tons are driving weight.</p>
                <p>The next engine to be noticed is a generally useful engine, four-coupled
                    “behind,” for passenger traffic, such, for instance, as that with inclined
                    fire-grate and sloping fire-box designed by Mr J. J. Cudworth for service on the
                    South-Eastern Railway. Chi a wheelbase of 15 feet the weight of the engine—30£
                    tons—is so distributed that 10| tons fall at each pair of driving-wheels and 94
                    tons at the leading wheels. The cylinders are inside, 16 inches in diameter,
                    with 24 inches of stroke and 6-feet driving-wheels.</p>
                <p>Another express passenger locomotive, having inside cylinders and four-coupled
                    wheels behind, for service on the London and North-Western Railway, has
                    cylinders 17 inches in diameter, with 24 inches of stroke, and 6 feet 7 inch
                    driving wheels. The engine weighs 29| tons, of which 11 are at the middle
                    wheels, 8f at the hind wheels, and 94 at the front; thus the driving weight
                    amounts to two-thirds of the total weight. This engine can move a gross weight
                    of 293 tons, comprising engine, tender, and train, on a level at a speed of 45
                    miles per hour, with a working pressure of 120 lb per square inch in the boiler.
                    With trains averaging ten carriages the consumption of coal is 26| lb per mile
                    run.</p>
                <p>A tank locomotive is an engine which carries its supply of fuel and water with it
                    on its own frame, dispensing with the tender. Such engines are mticli used for
                    short traffic, as well as for shunting and marshalling trains.</p>
                <p>The four-coupled tank engine (fig. 41) used for the passenger traffic of the
                    Metropolitan Railway has four wheels coupled behind and a bogie in front. This
                    engine weighs in working order 45£ tons, of which about 35 tons are utilized as
                    driving weight, making 17| tons for one pair of wheels,—about the greatest load
                    on one pair of wheels anywhere. The regular duty of this engine is to take a
                    train of six carriages capable of holding in all 432 passengers, and weighing in
                    themselves 13 tons each, at an average speed, including stoppages, of 18 miles
                    per hour, consuming 37 lb of Welsh coal per train mile run. Whilst passing
                    through the tunnels or covered ways the exhaust steam from the engine is
                    condensed in large tanks carried on the engine, filled with cold water. The
                    quantity of condensing water consumed is 900 gallons for half the journey, or
                    every 6¿ miles; it is raised to 200° Fahr. temperature.</p>
                <p>The eight-wheeled tank engine (fig. 42) has been designed by Mr</p>
                <p>T. W. Worsdell to work the heavy suburban metropolitan traffic of the Great
                    Eastern Railway,—the ordinary trains in this service being composed of fifteen
                    or twenty close-coupled carriages, taken over steep gradients and sharp curves.
                    For this purpose the fore and hind axles are radially mounted, as before
                    explained, to take the curves with facility, the engine running either end
                    first. The engine weighs 52 tons in working order, and of these 30 tons are
                    driving weight placed on the two pairs of coupled driving-wheels. With large
                    cylinders 18 inches in diameter, and driving-wheels only 5 feet 4 inches in
                    diameter, the engine is adapted for starting promptly, which it is required to
                    do in order to keep time between closely placed stations. Every stop is made by
                    the Westinghouse brake, with which the engine is fitted.</p>
                <p>Locomotives for drawing heavy goods trains, though not heavier than the most
                    powerful passenger locomotives, can take goods trains of great weight.
                    Six-coupled goods engines, with 17-inch cylinders and driving-wheels 5 feet in
                    diameter, weighing 32 tons in working order, can take a train weighing 360 tons
                    on a level at a speed of 25 miles per hour, consuming from 40 to 45 lb of coal
                    per mile run with trains. The Fairlie engine (fig. 43) is placed on two bogies
                    or swivelling trucks, the foremost of which carries the cylinders and propelling
                    gear and the hindmost the tank and coal-boxes.</p>
                <p>The longest distance run without stopping, combined with the' highest speed, is
                    performed on the Great Northern Railway, between! Grantham and King’s Cross,
                    105J miles, in 1 hour 58 minutes, at the rate of 53£ miles per hour. The Great
                    Western Company run from Paddington to Swindon—77£ miles—in 1 hour 27 minutes,
                    being at the rate of 53¿ miles per hour. On the London and North-Western Railway
                    the distance—77| miles—from Willesden to Rugby is run in 1 hour 28 minutes, at
                    the rate of 52f miles per hour. The average rate of express and mail passenger
                    trains on this line is 40 miles per hour or more. Parliamentary trains, calling
                    at all stations, run at an average speed of from 19 to 28 miles per hour.
                    Express goods trains attain a speed of from 20 to 25 miles per hour. The speed
                    of coal trains is limited, as far as possible, to 15 miles per hour.</p>
                <p>The coal trains on the London and North-Western, Midland, and Great Northern
                    Railways generally consist of from thirty to thirty-five waggons, weighing from
                    5 to 54 tons each, and carrying a load of 8 tons of coal. At this rate the total
                    load of coal for thirty-five waggons weighs 280 tons, and, adding the weight of
                    the brake-van at the end of the train, 10 tons 17 cwt., the maximum gross weight
                    of train is 483 tons 7 cwt., as on the Great Northern Railway. This train is
                    taken by a goods engine with six-coupled wheels 54 feet in diameter, having two
                    steam cylinders 174 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 26 inches, and a
                    pressure of 140 lb per square inch in the boiler. The locomotive weighs in
                    working order 36 tons 18 cwt., and the tender with fuel and water 30 tons 17
                    cwt., making together 67 tons 15 cwt. for the locomotive and tender. The gross
                    weights are as follows:—</p>
                <p>Tons, cwts</p>
                <p>Train, thirty-five vehicles (waggons, load, and brake-van). .4S3 7</p>

                <p>Engine, tender, and train ................................551 2</p>
                <p>These large coal trains are taken at a speed of IS miles per hour, on ascending
                    inclines of 1 in 178 at 10 miles per hour. The consumption of coal as fuel in
                    the engine is at the rate of 45 lb per mile run, including the coal consumed in
                    getting up steam. Mr Patrick Stirling, the locomotive engineer of the Great
                    Northern Railway, has also designed and constructed still more powerful engines,
                    having six-coupled 5-feet wheels, with cylinders 19 inches in diameter and of 28
                    inches stroke. These engines are capable of taking a train of forty-nine loaded
                    coal-waggons, weighing with brake-van 672j tons. Including the weight of the
                    engine and tender the total gross load is, say, 740 tons, taken with a
                    consumption of 50 lb of coal per mile run. This is probably the most
                    extraordinary example of a dead pull on an ascending incline of 1 in 178. It is
                    equivalent to a gross weight of 1816 tons on a level. It was found that this
                    train was too long for some of the sidings, besides fouling both the level
                    crossings in the city of Lincoln; hence the train was reduced in number to
                    forty-five waggons. Six-coupled goods-engines of the usual proportions, working
                    at full power, exert a tractive force of from 5 to 6 tons in the direction of
                    the rails, equal to the movement of a gross weight of engine, tender, and train
                    of from 1240 to 1500 tons on a level straight line at a speed of 15 miles per

                    tractive force of 10 or 12 lb is capable of drawing 1 ton on a level at 10 miles
                    per hour. At 60 miles per hour the required tractive force is about 45 lb for 1
                    ton of gross weight.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Carriages and Waggons.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">is</hi> The
                    common varieties of vehicle employed in railway traffic are as follows :—(1)
                    Passenger-train stock: first-class carriage, second-class carriage, third-class
                    carriage, composite carriage, luggage brake-van, horse-box, carriage-truck. To
                    these may be added the mail - carriage or travelling post-office. (2)
                    Goods-train stock: platform-waggon, open or box waggon, high-sided round-end
                    waggon, covered goods - waggon, cattle - waggon, sheep - waggon, coal-waggon,
                    coke-waggon, brake-van. Besides these there are other waggons specially designed
                    for special traffic, as gunpowder, salt, and lime, also ballast-waggons, for the
                    private use of the engineer’s department. Carriages are usually made of the same
                    external length, width, and height. The under works of the stock may thus be
                    identical in construction, and an economical uniformity of working and wearing
                    parts is secured. Uniformity of waggons is still more important than in the case
                    of carnages, as their total number and cost are much greater, and the
                    supervision with which they are favoured is less minute; besides, the cost of
                    maintenance is less than where many varieties of waggon exist on the same line.
                    · But, whatever may be the upper works, the under works of the whole of the
                    waggon stock should be entirely uniform. One of the greatest evils of railway
                    engineering has been want of uniformity in stock, partly due to different
                    companies not arranging to have stock suitable for joint use on each other’s
                    lines and partly to inevitable changes of plan to meet the growing wants of
                    traffic. Another source of mischief was the separation of the duties of engine
                    and of carriage and waggon superintendence. The carriage superintendent, aiming
                    at the utmost economy of maintenance in his department, continually added to the
                    quantity and weight of material employed in the construction of the carrying
                    stock, as the remedy for the observed failure of weak parts; and thus the stock,
                    particularly waggons, was increased in strength rather by adding to the mass of
                    matter than by studying to throw the same weight of timber and iron into
                    superior combinations. Meantime the heavy trains, handed over to the locomotive
                    department, led to the construction of heavier and more powerful locomotives,
                    when the maximum was quickly reached, and strongly evinced by the damage done to
                    the permanent way. It was found, moreover, that the older carriages suffered
                    most in cases of collision; hence there was an additional inducement to add to
                    the size and weight of carriages. But this line of development has been mainly
                    determined by the demands of the public for greater convenience, speed, and
                    safety, and from the growth of traffic, involving greater length and weight of
                    trains.</p>
                <p>The early first-class carriages weighed 3£ tons, the bodies or upper parts being
                    15 feet long, 6| feet wide, and 4 feet 9 inches high, divided into three
                    compartments, to hold six passengers each, or eighteen in all. They now weigh
                    from 8 to 13 tons each, and are from 20 to 30 feet in length and from 8 to 8^
                    feet wide. Carriages have until recent years been placed almost all on four
                    wheels; but six wheels on three axles are now generally in use. A modern
                    first-class carriage, 28 to 30 feet long with four compartments, gives 7 to 7i
                    feet of total length for each compartment, as against 5 feet in the early
                    carriages. Second and third class carriages, in length from 28 to 31 feet, are
                    divided into five compartments, each from 5 feet 7 inches to 6 feet 2 inches
                    long. Saloon carriages are occasionally used, so called because two or more of
                    the ordinary compartments are merged in one. Second-class carriages originally
                    were destitute of cushioning, hard and square, on the nearly obsolete policy of
                    making them uncomfortable in the hope of inducing passengers to travel first
                    class. The London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company in 1857-58 were the
                    first to supply comfortably padded seats in their second-class carriages, and
                    the receipts of that company were in 1858 materially augmented in consequence.
                    Third-class carriages have been improved, under the stimulating example of the
                    Midland Railway Company, who abandoned their second-class carriages, and raised
                    their third-class stock to an equality with the second-class vehicles of other
                    lines. But there are yet lines of railway on which the third-class carriages are
                    little better than obsolete first and second class carriages converted into
                    third-class.</p>
                <p>Passenger luggage brake-vans are made open (for the most part) inside for
                    passengers’ luggage. They are fitted with a dog-box or small enclosure from side
                    to side with doors at both ends, and with projecting sides, glazed, to
                    accommodate the guard and afford a view <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> of the
                    train from end to end. A pair of doors are placed in each side for luggage. In
                    some designs a separate compartment is partitioned off for the guard, in other
                    cases a compartment of a passenger carriage is allotted for luggage and for the
                    guard. The luggage van is fitted with a powerful brake; it should be fitted with
                    three pairs of wheels. Horse-boxes are constructed to carry three horses.</p>
                <p>The long double-bogie passenger-car universally in use in the United States,
                    originally introduced by Ross "VVinans on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, is
                    distinguished essentially from the carriages on British railways by the
                    longitudinal passage in the centre of the body, reaching from end to end of the
                    car, with seats at each side, and admitting of the free passage of the conductor
                    throughout the train. The absence of doors at the sides permits of the
                    enlargement of the body laterally. These cars are also distinguished by the use
                    of two four-wheeled bogies or trucks on which the body is carried, and to which
                    it is pivoted, allowing the car to pass with facility over quick curves. There
                    is generally but one class of travellers; yet for the long journeys Pullman and
                    other sleeping cars have come into use, at extra fares. From the Atlantic cities
                    to the West there is a special “immigrant” class, as also over the Pacific
                    railroads; and between the chief Western cities and the seaboard of late years a
                    second-class system has been begun: passengers are usually carried in smoking
                    cars at rates but little lower than first-class fares, which on these lines are
                    about Id. per mile. Refreshment cars are also attached to trains. Ordinary
                    passenger cars are 9| to 10 feet wide and 44$ in length of body, or 49 feet over
                    the extreme platforms. They are about 7$ feet high at the sides, inside the
                    body, and nearly 10 feet high at the centre. The car is entered by steps at the
                    ends. The middle passage is about 2 feet vdde. On each side there are fourteen
                    seats, placed transversely, each 38 inches wide and holding two persons. The
                    backs of the seats, which do not rise more than 34 inches above the floor, are
                    mounted on swivels, by which the seat is made reversible. A window is placed
                    next each seat, having a movable glass and a Venetian blind. The cars are heated
                    by stoves or steam heaters, burning coal, and are lighted by oil-lamps or
                    candles, on some lines by compressed coal-gas. Each car is provided with a
                    water-closet and a supply of iced v <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ater, and a
                    vendor of books, papers, and cigars patrols the cars. There is a cord of
                    communication with the engine-driver. The car, complete, weighs from 17 to 20
                    tons, and sleeping cars about one-half more.</p>
                <p>The form of goods truck generally used for some years after the opening of the
                    Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1829 was simply a platform about 10 feet
                    long, on four wheels, with sides varying from 4 to 10 inches in height, weighing
                    from 2£ to 3| tons. Many such waggons were employed for transporting heavy rough
                    goods of 2 tons weight. The general unfitness of this style of waggon led to the
                    adoption of portable sides and ends, which consisted of open crib-rails dropped
                    into staples; and to these was added the costly tarpauling or sheet to cover the
                    goods and bind them down. The waggon thus appointed, 13 or 14 feet in length and
                    weighing about 3£ tons, was fit to carry 4 or 5 tons of ordinary goods. But
                    loose or removable parts of waggons are liable to be lost or get out of order,
                    and are costly to maintain, while a new tarpauling may be spoiled on the first
                    day of using it by injury from projecting angles of goods under cover.
                    Crib-rails and tarpaulings, therefore, have been to some extent superseded by
                    built covered waggons from 14 to 16 feet long and <hi rend="italic">7\</hi> feet
                    wide, with sliding or hinged doors and roofs, so that with the crane-chairs a
                    bale of goods, however heavy, can be deposited at or moved from any part of the
                    interior of the waggon, and the goods may be pei’fectly enclosed and protected
                    from damage by fire, wind, or rain. Covered waggons weigh from 4 to 6| tons, and
                    they can carry, according to their dimensions, from 6 to 8 tons of goods. The
                    cost of maintenance of ordinary open waggons is said to amount to from 7 to 10
                    per cent of the first cost, whilst that of covered waggons is said to be only 4
                    per cent. It may be stated generally that waggons if properly made will carry 60
                    per cent, more than their own weight of goods, but that ill-designed badly-made
                    waggons will carry no more than their own weight of goods. The great demand for
                    weight in waggons arose, as much as from anything else, from the absence of
                    sprin״-buffers at the ends, which exposed them daily to rude and trying
                    collisions. By and by buffing-springs were introduced at one end of the waggon,
                    the other being left “dead,” and at length, cheap and convenient buffers having
                    been devised, springs came to be placed at both ends of new stock. "Waggons, as
                    formerly made, were .in long trains likewise subjected to violent shocks in
                    starting into motion, and therefore the draw-bars also were placed upon springs.
                    Some companies have gone further and placed the guard or side chains upon
                    springs. Thus the waggon has come to be defended by springs at all points, and
                    there is no doubt that the extra cost so incurred has been amply covered by
                    savings on repairs and diminished breakages of goods. Spiral springs for buffing
                    and drawing, made of round or of oval steel, fixed externally to the ends of
                    waggons, have been much employed; but laminated springs, placed under the floor,
                    are taking their place. Broad-gauge (7-feet gauge) waggons have been constructed
                    sufficiently strong to carry 20 tons of load on six wheels; but they were not
                    generally made to carry more than 10 tons. Even 10 tons is considered in some
                    quarters to be excessive as a maximum waggon-load on the ordinary or 4 feet 8£
                    inch gauge. On the Midland Railway, for instance, the standard coal - waggon is
                    constructed to carry 8 tons. The <pb break="no"

                    constructed, the greater is the tear and wear of the stock, insomuch that the
                    waggons on that line which stood to their work best were the old 6-ton
                    waggons.</p>
                <p>Railway carriages are composed of two distinct parts,—the underframe or
                    substructure, and the body or superstructure. The underframe has to carry the
                    body and to resist the stress of work. It should be on axles placed well apart,
                    and should be firmly framed together, of hard wood, with iron tie-rods,
                    brackets, knees, straps, bolts, and nuts. Powerful laminated springs are lodged
                    Within the frame to take the pull of the train through the central drawbars and
                    to intercept and absorb the thrusts of the buffers at the ends through the
                    buffing-rods. On the Midland Railway four-</p>
                <p>Each of these carriages is fitted With a vacuum brake. In the beginning of 1885
                    there Were 837 bogie carriages at work on the Midland Railway, inclusive of 34
                    Pullman cars. The bogie cars, in virtue of their ability to swing their bogies
                    to the curves on the line, run more freely than ordinary carriages, which have
                    parallel axles. Six-wheeled carriages are enabled to run the more freely by an
                    allowance of lateral play for the axle-boxes of the middle axle between the
                    axle-guards, whereby the wheels adapt themselves freely to the rails on curves.
                    The Pullman cars in use on the Midland Railway were sent from America. They are
                    of two kinds, —the drawing-room for day service and the sleeping-car. The body
                    of the cars is 51½ feet in length externally and 8 feet 9 inches wide. Inside
                    the body is 8 feet 2 inches wide, and 8 feet 6½ inches high above the floor. The
                    total length, including the gangways at the ends, is 58 feet. Each car is
                    mounted on two four-wheeled bogies. There are seats for twenty-seven persons in
                    the drawingroom car, with lavatories and heating apparatus, and twenty-two beds
                    are made up in each sleeping-car. The cars weigh 21½ tons and their cost is
                    £2700 each.</p>
                <p>The carriage stock of the Metropolitan Railway was designed to carry large
                    numbers. The bodies of the carriages are 39½ feet in length and 8½ feet wide
                    outside, running on eight wheels, of which the extreme axles radiate, or are
                    movable laterally to suit the curves of the way. The first-class carriages are
                    divided into six compartments, providing seats for forty-eight passengers. The
                    second and third class carriages have eight compartments, holding altogether
                    eighty passengers in each. These carriages weigh 13 tons each.</p>
                <p>The waggon stock of the Midland Railway is of several classes. All the standard
                    goods and mineral waggons, as well as cattle-waggons, are constructed to carry 8
                    tons. Leading dimensions, weights, and prices are given below in Table XXXI.

                    it is believed, were the first to use gas instead of oil for lighting carriage
                    stock. Thirty gas-lights in a train are supplied from two reservoirs or
                    gasholders in the brake-vans, which hold 200 cubic feet of ordinary coal-gas,
                    supplied from the mains,—enough to serve the train for from two hours to two and
                    a half hours. The gas is conducted by pipes over the roofs of the carriages,
                    with a branch wheeled carriages are (1885) being gradually superseded by
                    sixwheeled and long bogie carriages. Four varieties of bogie carriage and three
                    varieties of six-wheeled carriage are constructed for the service. First-class
                    compartments are constructed to seat six persons, three on each side;
                    third-class compartments seat ten persons, five on each side. A uniform width of
                    8 feet outside, or 7½ inside, is adopted for all carriages; and, as a rule,
                    first-class compartments are 7¼ feet long between the partitions, and
                    third-class compartments 6 feet long. The roof is 7 feet 4 inches above the
                    floor at the centre, and the clear height of the doorway is 6 feet. The wheels
                    are 3 feet 7½ inches in diameter. Leading particulars of the several kinds of

                <p>to each compartment. Ordinary coal-gas has also been used on the metropolitan
                    railways. Pintsch’s system of lighting carriages by compressed oil-gas is
                    extensively in use on Continental railways, where it has been in operation for
                    upw <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ards of ten years. In 1876-77 the system was
                    tried successfully on the Metropolitan Railway, when it appeared that 1000 cubic
                    feet of the compressed gas could do the work of 6500 cubic feet of coal-gas, at
                    a cost of scarcely one farthing per burner per hour, against one-third of a
                    penny for coal-gas lamps, and from ½d. to ¾d. for oil-lamps. The gas is
                    distilled from cheap oils, as the waste - products from the manufacture of
                    paraffin, soft lignite, or shale. The gas is pumped from the gasholder into
                    reservoirs, in which it is compressed to about one-tenth of its ordinary volume.
                    From these it is drawn off into a reservoir stowed under each carriage at a
                    pressure of six atmospheres, or 90 lb per square inch. The Pintsch system is in
                    use on railways in England and Scotland on nearly 3000 vehicles, and is being
                    extended to other stock; the number of vehicles thus lighted in all the railways
                    of Europe is about 18,000. Besides, the system is employed for the head-lights
                    of locomotives.</p>
                <p>Intercommunication signals for railway trains are provided between driver and

                    commonly employed. There is the ordinary guard’s cord, extending along the train
                    outside, placed so as to be accessible from the window; then there are the same
                    cord, with an attachment coming inside the window, the English cord, connected
                    with a bell in the driving cab, a line inside the carriage connected with the
                    steam-whistle, and so on. The acoustic signals appear to belong to the last
                    type; but none of these systems is comparable with the through middle passage of
                    the American cars already noticed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Continuous Brakes.—</hi> No department of railway practice has
                    in recent years received closer attention and more minute study than that of
                    continuous brakes,—brakes applied to the several vehicles in a train. With the
                    amount of brake-power that had for many years been supplied to passenger
                    trains—hand-brakes on tenders and guards’ vans—a train running at from 45 to 50
                    miles per hour on a straight level line could not be pulled up within from 800
                    to 1200 yards; and even that inadequate amount of brake-power was in the hands
                    of several men. It was clear that the problem of arresting a train in the
                    shortest distance could only be solved by bringing a power to bear on every part
                    of the train in the shortest possible time. But the difficulty consisted in
                    establishing continuity of action, so that the engine-driver or the guard should
                    be enabled to apply the brake-blocks on a series of vehicles in one operation.
                    Mechanical means were first tried, in the systems of Fay and Newall, in which
                    the brakes are worked by a continuous rod passed under the vehicles. These
                    systems were found to be available only on sections of not more than four or
                    five vehicles, and were not worked by the driver but by the guard. In September
                    1858 a circular was issued by the Board of Trade to the railway companies,
                    calling attention to the advantages to be derived from having their trains
                    controlled by a sufficient amount of brake-power. Subsequently many inventions
                    were tried,—brakes worked by fluid pressure, others worked by chains; but no
                    practical solution of the problem appears to have been arrived at until Mr
                    Westinghouse of Pittsburgh, U.S.A., invented a really continuous brake worked by
                    compressed air, which was quickly adopted in the United States, and was tried a
                    few years later on several railways in England. It is still (1885) employed
                    exclusively on the Metropolitan District Railway.</p>
                <p>Although the Westinghouse brake was greatly in advance of previously existing
                    systems and answered ordinary requirements <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n266/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0266-0249"/>remarkably well, it became evident that for the
                    worst types of accidents something more was wanted. The brake as first produced
                    was non-automatic, being worked from the engine only, not by the guard. And,
                    since the power had to travel from the engine along the whole length of the
                    train, there was a loss of valuable seconds of time whilst the brake-blocks were
                    being applied. Mr Westing-house therefore designed a system by which each
                    vehicle was supplied with a complete brake apparatus, carrying its own store of
                    power in the form of an auxiliary reservoir of compressed air, in addition to
                    the brake cylinder already there. By the action of the “triple valve ”—a later
                    introduction—which is fitted to each smaller reservoir on the branch by which it
                    is connected to the main or brake-pipe, the brakes can be instantly applied. A
                    store of compressed air is maintained throughout the train in the continuous
                    pipe and auxiliary reservoirs; and so long as the pressure in these is
                    maintained the brakes are kept off. By a reduction of the pressure in the pipe
                    the triple valve is brought into action, and the compressed air in the reservoir
                    flows into the brake-cylinder and applies the brake. The brake can be at once
                    released by restoring the pressure in the brake-pipe, when the compressed air in
                    the cylinder escapes into the atmosphere. In the event of a train being parted
                    and the brake-pipe severed, the escape of air reduces the pressure in the pipe,
                    and the brakes are instantly self-applied. They have thus become known as
                    “automatic” brakes. The compressed air by the agency of which the Westinghouse
                    automatic brake is worked is stored in a main reservoir on the engine, as well
                    as in the local reservoirs under the carriages, at a pressure of from 70 to 80
                    lb per square inch. The air is compressed by means of a steam-pump attached to
                    the engine and worked by steam from the boiler. The compressed air is supplied
                    through the brake-pipe, which passes through the whole length of the train to
                    the secondary reservoirs. A brake-cylinder is fixed near each secondary
                    reservoir, and the charge enters the cylinder at the middle of its length
                    between the pistons, which are driven apart, one towards each end of the
                    cylinder, and act, through piston-rods and levers, upon the brake-blocks which
                    are applied to the wheels. The pistons are maintained in their central positions
                    in the brake-cylinder, when out of action, by spiral springs which abut on the
                    ends of the cylinders; and so the brake-blocks are kept clear of the wheels. The
                    general arrangement of the brake-apparatus applied to a carriage is shown in
                    fig. 44; and the reservoir and brake-cylinder, with their connexions to each
                    other and to the main pipe, and the intermediary triple valve in section, are
                    shown on a larger scale in fig. 45. The triple valve, by means of which instant
                    automatic action throughout the train is produced, consists of a piston in a
                    short cylinder, carrying a slide valve,—the piston and the valve moving
                    together. A vehicle out of order can be cut out of the system by turning a tap,
                    and brakes which have been applied by the parting of a train can be released by
                    opening a valve on the cylinder.</p>
                <p>In 1874 a royal commission on railway accidents was appointed, and in June 1875
                    brake trials were made at Newark. On a level road a train, weighing 2086־ tons,
                    running at a speed of 511 miles per hour, and fitted with the Westinghouse
                    automatic pressure-brake—there tested for the first time on an English
                    railway—was brought to a stand in a distance of 825 feet in the course of 18
                    seconds,—the equivalent distance for an initial speed of 50 miles per hour being
                    777 feet. In trials on the North-Eastern Kailway in July 1879, a train, fitted
                    with the Westinghouse brake, weighing 208 tons, and running at a speed of 51
                    miles per hour, was stopped in a distance of 621 feet in 14f seconds,—the
                    equivalent distance for a speed of 50 miles per hour being 594 feet. In August
                    1877 the Board of Trade urged the railway companies to united and harmonious
                    action, and stated the requirements which in their opinion were essential in a
                    good continuous brake: it should be— efficient in stopping trains; instantaneous
                    in action and easily applied by engine-drivers or guards; in case of accident
                    instantaneously self-acting; capable of being put on or taken off with facility,
                    on the engine, tender, and eveiy vehicle of a train; regu-lai־ly used in daily
                    working; and the materials employed easily maintained and kept in order. That a
                    brake should be instantaneous in action is evident on considering that at a
                    speed of 50 miles per hour a train advances through 73 J feet in a second of
                    time. A striking example of the value of seconds under such circumstances is
                    quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Report,</hi> contrasting the working of the
                    Westinghouse compressed-air brake and the Westinghouse vacuum-brake. The rates
                    of speed were nearly the same,—about 52 miles per hour, or 76 feet per second.
                    The train with the former brake ran 825 feet, whilst that with the latter ran
                    1533 feet. Now, it took <hi rend="italic">7 i</hi> seconds to put on the
                    vacuum-brakes and 1^ seconds to put on the pressure-brakes. The difference,
                    seconds, at 76 feet per second, makes a space of 475 feet traversed by the train
                    before the brake came into action. In consequence of these steps taken by the
                    Board of Trade all the large railway companies have now (1885) adopted
                    continuous brakes, though some of these do not comply with the conditions of the
                    Board of Trade. The principal question is not now that of Automatic <hi
                    rend="italic">rerms</hi> non-automatic, but of automatic pressure-brakes <hi
                    rend="italic">verms</hi> automatic vacuum-brakes. In the latter, as the name
                    indicates, the work is done by the atmospheric pressure against the pressure of
                    a comparative vacuum. At 31st December 1878 only 21 per cent, of the total
                    carriage stock was fitted with brakes of some form, of which 128־ per cent, were
                    automatic; whilst at 30th June 1884 of the total carriage stock 76 per cent, was
                    fitted with continuous brakes, of which 58 per cent, were automatic.- It appears
                    that there are in the United Kingdom considerably more Westinghouse automatic
                    brakes in operation than any other single system. The same brake is very
                    largely, used in America and on the Continent, and at the end of 1884 it had
                    been adopted to the extent of upwards of 15,000 sets for locomotives and 78,000
                    for carriages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity.</hi></p>
                <p>The employment of electricity in the working of railways has already been
                    referred to in the application of block-signalling to the direction of the
                    traffic, in the working of junctions, the protection of stations and sidings,
                    and the repetition of signals.</p>
                <p>The first attempt to apply electric power for propulsion on railways was made by
                    Mr R. Davidson, who in September 1842 tried on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway
                    an electro-magnetic locomotive, running on four wheels and weighing 5 tons. A
                    speed of 4 miles per hour was attained. Electric power was applied in 1881 by
                    Messrs Siemens and Halske of Berlin on an electric railway, the Lichterfelde
                    line, near Berlin; and since then they have constructed an electric line 14
                    miles long, from Charlottenburg to the Spandauer Bock, and a short line in
                    Costverloren Park near Amsterdam. They also applied the system to a railway in
                    the mines at Zankerode in Saxony. At the International Electric Exhibition in
                    Paris (1881) an electric line was worked by Messrs Siemens Brothers which
                    carried an average of over 13,000 passengers per week; and in September 1883 a
                    railway of 3 feet gauge, 6 miles in length, was opened between Portrush and
                    Bushmills in the <pb break="no"

                    having a slope of 1 in 35 at many parts. The curves are very quick, following
                    the line of the road. The conductor employed consists of a third rail, weighing
                    19 lb to the yard, and laid close to the fence. Electricity is transmitted
                    through the conductor, by means of steel brushes, to the Siemens motors by which
                    the car is propelled. The dynamo-machines by which the electricity' is generated
                    are driven by the power of a natural waterfall of 26 feet in the river Bush. Two
                    turbines are driven by the fall of water at a speed of 225 revolutions per
                    minute; each is capable of yielding 50 liorse-power. The electric car can run on
                    the level at the rate of 12 miles per hour.</p>
                <p>Several large metropolitan and other stations are lighted by electricity. At the
                    Waterloo station of the London and South-Western Railway, for example, the new
                    main line suburban passenger station, about If acres in area, has been lighted
                    by the Anglo-American Brush Light system since February 1881, sixteen arc -
                    lamps of 2000 candle - power each being employed. The Windsor line station at
                    the same terminus, about H acres in area, has been lighted by the Edison
                    Company’s system since January 1S83 with 200 glow-lamps of 16 candle-power each.
                    The large goods-yard on the same railway, about 18 acres in extent, at Nine
                    Elms, has been lighted since January 1883 by fourteen arc-lamps of 4000
                    candle-power each. The lighting of railway trains by electricity' has been
                    successfully effected on the Great Eastern Railway since October 1884. The power
                    is derived from a dynamo-machine driven by' a compact rotary' engine, placed
                    together in a small case on the top of the locomotive, and worked by steam from
                    the boiler. Sixty electric lights are generated, each of them sufficient to
                    light thoroughly' a compartment of a carriage, and supply light for a train of
                    at least twelve vehicles. Trains on other lines also are lighted by
                    electricity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Accidents.</hi></p>
                <p>Accidents on railways arise from three causes,—inattention of servants, defective
                    material either in the works or the rolling stock, and excessive sped. But the
                    adoption of the absolute block system, with the use of interlocked points and
                    signals and continuous brakes, has led to an absolute diminution of the number
                    of accidents, whilst the amount of traffic has been greatly increased. In 1883
                    the total number of train accidents on railways in the United Kingdom, reported
                    on to the Board of Trade, was 94 on 18,681 miles open, against 241 accidents ten
                    years earlier on 16,082 miles open. The increased efficiency of management is
                    strikingly brought out by Table XXXII.</p>

                <p>During the period 1873-1883 there was therefore a material improvement not only'
                    in the character of the way and works but also in that of the rolling stock.
                    Accidents from entering stations at too great a speed have been augmented in
                    number,—a result naturally arising from the greater speeds and volumes of
                    traffic. Ten of these (for 1873 and 1883) were due to want of control of the
                    trains, and seven others to want of continuous brakes. Collisions have been
                    diminished to a marked extent; and nearly all of those in 1883 took place at
                    junctions, stations, and sidings, mostly within fixed signals. Many of these
                    collisions could have been obviated if proper interlocking and block working had
                    been in use, together with continuous brakes on the trains. Of the 94
                    investigated train accidents 75 took place on the lines of fifteen companies,
                    working in the aggregate 12,850 miles, and having run upwards of 216 millions of
                    miles with trains,—showing that one accident happened for every 171 miles of
                    railway, or for every 3 millions nearly of miles run. One person in every 625
                    employed in the traffic—locomotive, carnage, engineers’, and stores departments—
                    in 1883 was killed in the sendee. The employes who stand at the extremes of the
                    scale of fatality are guards: of brakesmen and goods-guards 1 in 97 lost their
                    lives, and of passenger-guards only 1 in 5902. Pointsmen and signalmen occupy a
                    medium position in the scale, 1 in 800 losing their lives; of engine-drivers 1
                    in 643 was killed, and of firemen 1 in 533. Of persons other than pass engers or
                    servants of railway companies who suffered in accidents, trespassers, including
                    suicides, as usual form the largest number, —354 killed and 165 injured. Of
                    passengers 125 were killed and 1416 were injured—together, 1541 persons, or 1 in
                    about 444,000 of the total number of passengers in 18S3.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Railway Law.</hi></p>
                <p>Parliament soon began to exercise control over railways by' means ’ of standing
                    orders; and in 1832 a passenger duty of |d. per mile 1 for every' four
                    passengers carried was levied on railway companies.! In 1842 a Government
                    department was instituted whereby the Board of Trade was empowered to appoint
                    inspectors of railways, to postpone the opening of railway's, to disallow by <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> e-laws, and to institute legal proceedings against
                    companies for infringing the law. The Board of Trade was further empowered to
                    direct companies to make returns of accidents, of traffic, and of tolls levied.
                    The passenger duty was fixed at 5 per cent, of the gross receipts from
                    passengers. In 1846 the Commissioners of Railways, five in number, were
                    appointed, to whom the jurisdiction of the Board of Trade was transferred, but
                    in 1851 it was re-transferred to the Board of Trade. The Railway and Canal
                    Traffic Act, 1854, requires railway companies to provide “reasonable facilities”
                    for receiving, forwarding, and delivering their own traffic and the traffic of
                    other companies, and to abstain from “unreasonable” preference. It appears to
                    have been of small practical utility until 1873. The Regulation of Railway's
                    Act, 1873, establishes a new tribunal, “The Railway Commissioners,” not more
                    than three in number, one to be of experience in the law and one of experience
                    in railway business. The principal duty of the commissioners is to enforce the
                    observance of the “reasonable facilities” section of the Act of 1854. The
                    commissioners have power to enjoin the forwarding of through traffic at through
                    rates, the power being set in motion by the companies only. The commissioners
                    are empowered whenever there is a dispute between two companies that can be
                    referred to arbitration to decide such dispute. The Employers’ Liability Act,
                    1880, provides that where personal injury is caused to a workman by' reason of
                    the negligence of any' person in the service of the employer, who has the charge
                    or control of any signal, points, locomotive engine, or train upon a railway',
                    he or his representatives shall have the same right of compensation or remedy
                    against the employer as if the workman had not been in the service of the
                    employer nor engaged in his work. The amount of compensation is not to exceed
                    three years’ earnings of the workman. (D. K. C.)</p>

                    .—A few unimportant tramways were opened in France in 1826-32. In 1833 the
                    Government began a comprehensive system of surveys, and laid down the general
                    plan of railway' development for the whole country; and in 1842 Thiers devised a
                    scheme by' which the state was to furnish half the cost (about £10,000 per
                    mile), while private companies were to lay the lines at their own expense and
                    equip and work them for a term of years. In 1857 six great companies were
                    working their lines with profit; but the state found it necessary (1859) to
                    guarantee them the interest on the additional lines which were needed. By
                    subsequent legislation the construction of local railways on a cheaper scale was
                    encouraged, and in 1875-76 unsuccessful efforts were made by speculators to
                    unite these local lines into systems which should compete with the old companies
                    and break their monopoly <hi rend="superscript">7</hi> . Since that date some
                    have been absorbed by <hi rend="superscript">7</hi> the great companies; others
                    have passed into the hands of the state. After more than one scheme for a
                    comprehensive system of state railways had been formed by leading statesmen and
                    then for one reason or another abandoned, in 1884 agreements were made by <hi
                    rend="superscript">7</hi> which some 7000 miles of railway were to be
                    constructed in addition to the 17,000 miles then in operation, the money to be
                    supplied by the six great companies and ultimately repaid by the state, which
                    meanwhile guaranteed the shareholders of each company <hi rend="superscript"
                    >7</hi> a dividend equal to the average of recent years (in no case so low as 7
                    per cent.). The profitable system of monopoly has not been favourable to the
                    development of enterprise in railway management in France. Scarcely any <hi
                    rend="superscript">7</hi> of the so-called express trains run at as high a speed
                    as 40 miles an hour. The time allowed for the despatch of goods is very long.
                    The average rates (078־d. per passenger-mile, 082׳d. per ton-mile) are somewhat
                    higher than those of Germany <hi rend="superscript">7</hi> . The long-distance
                    traffic especially has received but little encouragement. On the other hand,
                    many of the technical arrangements of the French lines are excellent. Although
                    the state owns so few railroads, it has reserved extensive rights of regulation,
                    both in matters of business and in engineering; there is a body of Government
                    engineers organized with almost military precision.</p>
                <p>Soon after 1830 plans were laid for a Belgian system to be owned and managed by
                    the state, and work was actively begun in 1833. The Government lines were
                    arranged in the form of a cross, the point of intersection being at Malines. By
                    this means the Government was able to develop the traffic of Belgium itself, and
                    at the same time to secure a large share of the transit trade between Ger<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0268-0251"/>many and England which had formerly gone <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> Holland. Having obtained control of the main lines with a
                    length of about 300 miles the Government left the rest to private enterprise.
                    Between 1850 aud 1870 the private lines had increased from less than 200 to 1400
                    miles and competition between the state and private railways soon became active,
                    and for ten years after 1856 rates were in consequence reduced to the lowest
                    possible point. The state railways, however, had certain advantages: they had
                    been well laid out and economically constructed; their organization was
                    admirable and the very keenness of private competition was sufficient to guard
                    against serious abuses. Nevertheless about 1870 the Government decided to
                    purchase most of the competing lines, and by 1874 it owned more than half the
                    railways of the country. It now (1885) owns three-quarters; there is only one
                    large private system which could by any possibility compete, and with this there
                    is a joint-purse agreement. The charges in general have not been raised as a
                    result of the new policy, and they are still the lowest in Europe.</p>
                <p>The first lines in Holland were constructed by private companies in 1840-56. In
                    1860 a state system was begun, which included at one time nearly two-thirds of
                    the mileage of the kingdom. It was not, however, managed by the state directly,
                    but leased to a private company. But the financial results were not satisfactory
                    to either party, and the commission of 1881-82 reported strongly against the
                    arrangement. The absence of connexions or of mutual accommodation between the
                    different systems elicited severe criticism.</p>
                <p>. The first German line was opened in 1835. While most of the states were too
                    small to have a comprehensive ·policy, Prussia from the very outset encouraged
                    railway development, giving pecuniary assistance, and in return reserving
                    important rights of state control. About 1848 the Government began to construct
                    railways of its own, at the same time purchasing shares of stock in private
                    companies. After 1870 the same policy, which had been for a time suspended, was
                    again pushed forward in the direction of creating a German imperial system; but
                    the jealousy of the smaller states proved fatal to its success. The Prussian
                    Government, however, began to extend its own system on a large scale. In 1878 it
                    owned only 3000 miles of railroad and managed 2000 more, while 6000 were in the
                    hands of private companies. Now (1885) there are 13,000 miles of state railways
                    and only about 1000 in private hands. The prices paid by the Government were, as
                    a rule, high (in one instance the sellers secured an income of more than 16 per
                    cent.), but the lines are nevertheless managed with reasonable profit to the
                    state. The passenger-train service is prompt and comfortable. The speed attained
                    is greater than elsewhere in Continental Europe, the maximum being about 45
                    miles. The passenger rates are low, averaging not quite 07־d. per mile for all
                    passengers carried. There are comparatively few accidents. The freight service
                    is rather slow, and the charges are not relatively so low as those for
                    passengers. On the other hand, they have for the most part avoided preferential
                    rates; something very like a system of equal mileage rates prevails, though not
                    always quite consistently carried out. In addition to this rate there is a fixed
                    terminal or “Grundsatz but it is put, almost purposely, too low, so as not to
                    interfere with the very short-distance traffic. The result is that the mileage
                    rate is relatively too high, and for the long-distance traffic it reaches a very
                    high figure. Down to 1880 this result was evaded by a system of special tariffs
                    for export, import, or transit traffic, but during the last five years a strong
                    effort has been made to do away with them. It has not been altogether
                    successful, owing to the competition of water-routes.</p>
                <p>In Austria a tramway line for general traffic was chartered in 1824 ·.and opened
                    in 1828. But until 1838 the Government positively discouraged the introduction
                    of railways. The policy then adopted, however, guaranteed to each railway a
                    monopoly in its own district during the (comparatively short) period for which
                    its charter was to run. At the same time the state made lines of its own on a
                    large scale. The revolution of 1848 led to financial straits; and in the years
                    following most of the state railways, at least in Austria itself, were sold to
                    private companies for about one-half their real value. But in Hungary the
                    reality of a state railway system was more steadily maintained. The growth of
                    the Austrian system was slow until after the war of 1866; then it began to
                    develop rapidly. The railway speculation which ended in the crisis of 1873,
                    being perhaps more recklessly carried on in Austria than anywhere else in the
                    world, resulted in very severe distress. Since 1876 there have been consistent
                    efforts to increase the importance of the state railway system both by the
                    purchase of old lines and the construction of new ones. At present there are in
                    Austria 2000 miles of state-managed railroad, and not quite 6000 managed by
                    private companies; while in Hungary there are 2000 miles of state railroad and
                    3000 in private hands. The policy of the state management has been to reduce
                    rates, especially for passengers; but they are still higher than in Germany. In
                    1883 the average receipt per mile for each passenger was 084־d.; while the
                    average receipt per ton of freight was 1 · 09d. Per train-mile the receipts were
                    about 9s.; but the traffic was so light in many parts of the country that the
                    average profit on the investment was only 4f per cent.</p>
                <p>The Austrian railways belong to the German Yerein, and are like the German lines
                    in most of their methods and principles of administration. They have carried the
                    system of traffic agreements, even between the state and private companies, into
                    the same detail; but they have not adopted the system of equal mileage rates in
                    their tariffs; on the contrary, they have (like Belgium) adopted a sliding
                    scale, diminishing for longer distances. Probably no other country is so
                    situated that it has to deal with such perplexing problems of railway tariff
                    policy as Austria. Nearly all the Austrian railways are of standard gauge; but
                    the problem of the economical construction and management of local lines has
                    received most careful attention from the authorities; and the law specially
                    encourages the construction of cheap railways in mountainous districts or for
                    purely local traffic. About fifty such railways were chartered between 1880 and
                    1883.</p>
                <p>The first lines in Switzerland were merely local, and the summer passenger
                    traffic formed a main source of income. It was not until Austria had completed
                    two routes across the Alps and France one that the first Swiss route, the St
                    Gotthard, was projected. It is, however, the greatest work of them all, the main
                    tunnel being over 9j miles in length. In spite of the character of the country,
                    the Swiss railways ai’e nearly all of standard gauge. They are entirely owned by
                    private companies, though many of them have received aid from the cantons. The
                    rates for freight are somewhat high. There are now about 2000 miles in all.</p>
                <p>After 1860 the railways of Italy developed rapidly. There were four main
                    systems—the upper Italian, the Roman, the Calabrian, and the southern system
                    (along the Adriatic). Although this last had in many respects the least
                    promising field, it was the most enterprising and the most successful. The other
                    systems had been arranged more in accordance with the old political divisions
                    than in accordance with the wants of trade. In spite of liberal subsidies from
                    the Government they did not prosper. The lines of Calabria (and Sicily) were the
                    most unfortunate; and the Government in 1870 was compelled to take the railways
                    of this section into its own hands. The gross receipts have been constantly less
                    than the working expenses. In 1873 the Government contracted to purchase the
                    Roman railways for the same general reasons. The financial difficulties were
                    such that the contract was not carried out till 1880-82. Meantime similar
                    contracts, though for very different reasons, had been made for the purchase of
                    the other two systems. But a special commission, which thoroughly studied the
                    question during 1878-81, reported that the Italian Government had better not
                    undertake to work its lines, even though it virtually owned them. Eventually
                    they were leased for a term of sixty years to two main companies, each
                    controlling about 3000 miles of line, with a third, much smaller, in Sicily. The
                    state is to receive about 27^ per cent, of the gross receipts, the companies 62|
                    per cent.; the remainder is to be divided in a somewhat complicated system of
                    reserve funds. On the whole, the railways of Italy leave much to be desired both
                    in construction and equipment. The rates are reasonable, particularly for local
                    traffic; but the service is always slow, and often quite inadequate to the wants
                    of trade.</p>
                <p>The first railway line in Spain was opened in 1848, and the period of most rapid
                    development was from 1855 to 1865. The Government encouraged railways by most
                    liberal subsidies, which had the effect of bringing forward a number of purely
                    speculative undertakings. The indirect results were bad; and for this, as well
                    as other reasons, the years 1869-75 formed a time of most serious depression.
                    Since then matters have improved greatly, on account both of changes in
                    legislation made about 1870 and of the improvement in the country itself. There
                    are now about 5000 miles of railway. One-fourth of the money spent has been
                    advanced by the Government; and of late years the financial results have been
                    reasonably good. The ratio of working expenses to gross earnings is about 45 per
                    cent. Tire charges for passengers are rather low; but those for freight are
                    extremely high. The gauge is 5| feet.</p>
                <p>The first Portuguese line was constructed by the state in 1853 or 1854. The
                    Government now owns about half the roads of the country,—one system in the north
                    and another in the south, each somewhat less than 200 miles long. The central
                    lines are owned by a company, chartered in 1859, which has been for many years
                    managed by a body of French directors, from whose control it has but recently
                    been freed. The financial results have been far from satisfactory. The railways
                    are built on a 5| feet gauge.</p>
                <p>In Denmark and in Norway railway development has been slow. The greater part of
                    the lines are owned and managed by Government. Most of the Norwegian lines are
                    laid on a gauge of 3 <hi rend="italic">h</hi> feet. The running is slow and the
                    traffic very light. Sweden possesses something over 4000 miles in all, of which
                    the state owns about one-third. The capital averages less than £7000 per
                    mile,—lower than in almost any other country of the world. The railways are in
                    the hands of a number of local companies, which control on an average hardly 30
                    miles each.</p>
                <p>In Russia a short railway—little more than an experiment—was constructed in the
                    neighbourhood of St Petersburg in 1835-37. The first line of any length was
                    opened in 1851 between St Peters <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0269-0252"/>burg and Moscow. This was built by the state, but
                    afterwards sold to a private company. After the close of the Crimean War railway
                    construction was more rapid. The lines were laid down by the Government
                    surveyors, but were constructed and managed by private companies, receiving,
                    however, much help from the Government. Of the 15,000 miles in operation hardly
                    a tenth part belongs to the state, even including the 700 miles of state railway
                    in Finland. Yet about half the capital employed in railway construction has been
                    furnished by the state. Since 1880 the construction of railways in European
                    Russia has moved slowly. Of greater importance has been the development of the
                    Asiatic lines. The first of these, in the Caucasus, was opened in 1872 to a
                    length of nearly 200 miles. The Trans-Caspian military railway was begun in
                    1880; the connexion between the Caspian and the Black Sea was completed in 1883.
                    The Siberian railway is being pushed forward as rapidly as the finances of the
                    empire will allow. The administration is in most respects modelled upon that
                    adopted by Germany and Austria. The plan of the Russian railways has been
                    dictated by military rather than industrial considerations. The gauge is 5
                    feet.</p>
                <p>Isolated lines were constructed in Turkey in 1860 and 1866. The first general
                    plan for a system of importance dates from 1869, and was modified in 1872.
                    Foreign companies furnished the capital and received a subsidy from the
                    Government. In return they were to make certain annual payments; but the clauses
                    providing for this were so carelessly drawn that the companies seem to have had
                    an interest in delaying the completion of the work. Some of the lines were lost
                    in the cession of territory which followed the war of 1878. There are now open
                    for traffic about 1000 miles of railway in European Turkey, and 200 more in Asia
                    Minor.</p>
                <p>There is a fairly developed system of railways (1000 miles or more) in Roumania,
                    owned by the state; and there are a few lines in Servia. Arrangements seem to be
                    completed by which through communication in these countries will soon be
                    established on a large scale, if the authorities in Turkey and Bulgaria do not
                    fail in their duty. The Government of Greece is also engaged in extending its
                    railway system, which has hitherto amounted to nothing. (A. T. II.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">America</hi> .—In the Dominion of Canada 9113 miles of railway
                    and 6735 of tramway, together 15,848, were open in the end of 1883. The accounts
                    show that the total outlay for construction amounted to about 73 millions
                    sterling, being at the rate of £4610 per mile. The gross earnings for the year
                    1883 amounted to upwards of 6 millions sterling, of which 723־ per cent, was
                    absorbed as working expenses, leaving £1,693,000 net earnings, which amounted to
                    only 23־ per cent, on the capital cost. The earlier railways were laid to gauges
                    of 5£ and 3£ feet, but the inconveniences of break of gauge with the railways of
                    the United States led to the relaying of all the lines to the standard gauge,
                    except those of Newfoundland and Prince Edward’s Island, which remain on the 3.)
                    feet gauge. The principal system is the Grand Trunk Railway, comprising the
                    original Grand Trunk and the Great Western, which were consolidated in 1882,
                    making a total length of 2358 miles of line. The first section of the
                    system—Portland to Montreal—was opened in 1853, the first line opened in Canada.
                    In June 1884 of the (estimated) 2899 miles of the Canadian Pacific Railway,
                    connecting the Pacific with the Atlantic, 2105 miles were open and in
                    operation.</p>
                <p>In Mexico the first railway constructed and opened was the Mexican Railway,
                    between Mexico city and Vera Cruz, 264 miles, with a branch 29 miles, the first
                    section from Vera Cruz to Paso del Macho being opened in 1865. This railway,
                    with one or more others in Mexico, was constructed to the 4 feet 8^ inch gauge,
                    but others, including the Mexican National Railway, 910 miles long, are laid to
                    the 3 feet gauge. The Mexican Central Railroad, 1224 miles long, was completed
                    in 1884.</p>
                <p>The Panama Railroad, Colombia, between Aspinwall and Panama, 47£ miles in length,
                    was opened in January 1855. The rails are laid to a gauge of 5 feet. Railways
                    were in progress in 1883-84 in several of the other states of Colombia, all of
                    them to a gauge of 3 feet.</p>
                <p>In Guatemala the first line of railway from San José to Esquintla, 13 miles in
                    length, laid to a gauge of 3 feet, was opened in June 1880. A line from
                    Champerico to Ritalhulca, 30 miles long, was opened in December 1883; and
                    another from San José to the capital, 69 miles long, is now finished.</p>
                <p>In the empire of Brazil the Manâ Railway was the first line opened, early in the
                    decade 1850-60. It is a short line of single way, 11 miles long, between the
                    head of the bay of Rio de Janeiro anti the foot of the serra. It was laid to a
                    gauge of 5£ feet; but other lines in Brazil are laid to a gauge of 5 feet 3
                    inches. The empire possessed in January 1884 railways of a total length of 3500
                    miles open for traffic, besides 1500 miles in course of construction. The state
                    owns nine lines, having 1300 miles open, the principal of which is the Dom Pedro
                    II., intended to connect the eastern and western provinces of the empire.</p>
                <p>Chili was one of the first states in South America to initiate the construction
                    of railways. The Copiapo Railway, laid to the 4 feet 8| inch gauge, was opened
                    about 1850; and an Act was passed in 1852 authorizing the construction of a line
                    to connect Santiago with Valparaiso, 114 miles distant. In 1855 the first 8
                    miles were opened for traffic, and in 1863 the line was opened throughout. It
                    was constructed to a gauge of 5| feet. In 1883 the total length of lines open
                    for traffic was 1378 miles.</p>
                <p>In Peru a system of railways has been in course of construction 1 since 1852,
                    chiefly at the expense of the state. In 1878 there were open for traffic, or in
                    course of construction, twenty-two lines belonging to the state and to private
                    individuals, 2030 miles in length, representing a cost of about 36 millions
                    sterling.</p>

                    pri-1 marily to connect Alexandria, Cairo, and Suez, with branches to Mansurali
                    and elsewhere in the Delta. The line first laid out, between Alexandria and
                    Cairo, 130 miles long, was opened in January 1856. The junction line from Bennah
                    to Suez is 101f miles in length; the total length of railways open for traffic
                    in Egypt at the end of 1883 was 941 miles, laid to the 4 feet 84 inch gauge.</p>
                <p>There are three systems of railway at the Cape of Good Hope,— &lt; the Western

                <p>In the Island of Mauritius there are two lines of railway laid to the 4 feet 8¿
                    inch gauge, with two branches, of a total length of 94 miles. The North line,
                    starting from Port Louis, is 31 miles long, and was opened in 1864; the Midland
                    line, passing through the centre of the island, is 35 miles long, and was opened
                    in 1865.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Asia</hi> .—In 1845 the East Indian and the Great Indian
                    Peninsula Railway Companies were formed. Four years later the Government entered
                    into arrangements with these two companies for the construction of railways in
                    the presidencies of Bengal and Bombay, guaranteeing for ninety-nine years a
                    dividend of from to 5 per cent, upon the estimated cost of these and succeeding
                    railways. They adopted one uniform gauge of 5 feet 6 inches. Down to 1869 this
                    policy of guarantee and uniform gauge was adhered to. But in 1869, under the
                    rule of Lord Lawrence, the Government altered the standard gauge for new lines
                    to one metre, or 3 feet 3§ inches, and used the lightest rails and rolling-stock
                    compatible with the requirements of Indian traffic. There are now five different
                    railway gauges in India, namely, the 5J feet, the 3 feet 3§ inch, the 4 feet,
                    the 2£ feet, and the 2 feet. The first piece of railway opened in India was a
                    section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 20§ miles long, from Bombay to
                    Tannah, in 1853. At the end of March 1884 there were 1288 miles of that railway
                    open for traffic. The East Indian Railway was opened for a length of 38 miles in

                    Government, though it is still worked by the company. Of the Madras Railway 65
                    miles were opened in 1856; there are now 861 open. The first of the imperial
                    state railways was opened (114 miles) in 1873. At the end of March 1884 the

                <p>i In Queensland a system of light substantial railways has been laid out on the

                    carrying the line over the main range to the tableland of the Darling Downs. The
                    first section of the Southern and Western Railway was opened in 1867. At the end
                    of 1883 there were 1038 miles of railway open for traffic, and 454 were in
                    course of construction.</p>
                <p>In South Australia a gauge of 5 feet 3 inches was at first adopted. The Adelaide

                    Kapunda Railway, connecting the capital with the chief copper mines, 50¿ miles
                    long, was opened in 1857. At the same time railways on a 3J feet gauge were also
                    constructed; the first of these, between Port Wakefield and Blyth, was partly
                    opened in May 1867. The Port Augusta and Port Darwin Railway, destined to

                    2000 miles in length. The colony had 991 miles of railway open for traffic at
                    the end of 1883, with 225 in course of construction. In view of the
                    inconveniences of a break of gauge, the progress of the broader gauge lines was
                    stayed northwards, after the junctions had been effected, and new main lines

                    Railway, connecting the port town with the capital of the province, 6 miles
                    long, was commenced in 1860, and opened in 1867, laid to a gauge of 5 feet 3
                    inches. The Great Southern Railway, a portion of the trunk line to the south, of
                    the same gauge, was opened, also in 1867, to the river Selwyn, distant 23 miles
                    from Christchurch. A comprehensive system of railways connecting the chief towns
                    of the colony was commenced at the expense of the Government in 1872, for which
                    the 3^ feet gauge was adopted as the standard. The first lines so constructed
                    were the Wellington and Woodville Railway and the Napier and Manawatu Railway.

                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.</hi><hi rend="italic">Construction</hi> .—The
                    low cost of American railways has been due largely to a close adaptation of the
                    alignment to the natural surface by the use of grades and curves. The importance
                    of saving in materials, labour, and cost has been very much greater than in
                    Europe, because labour and nearly all materials but timber were much costlier,
                    and especially because the interest on money was very much higher,—until about
                    1875, on the average probably 9 or 10 per cent. The use of the “truck” or
                    “bogie” under locomotives and cars made it possible for the Baltimore and Ohio
                    Railroad, the first long line in a mountainous country, to be constructed with
                    curves of 600 feet radius, and on temporary lines on the same railway with
                    curves of 300 and 278 feet radius. Curves of 955 and even 716 feet radius are
                    common through difficult country; curves of 573 feet radius occur on some
                    important lines; and 410 to 383 feet radii are not uncommon in mountainous
                    regions. On the United States military railroads in 1864 an immense traffic
                    passed safely over temporary lines with a curve of 50 feet radius. Early
                    experiments as to the real power of the locomotive to surmount gradients led to
                    the adoption of 110 and 116 feet per mile for ascents 17 miles long, and to the
                    successful use on a temporary track over a tunnel (in 1852) of gradients of 1 in
                    10, over which a locomotive weighing 25 tons hauled regularly one-car trains
                    weighing 53^ tons, including its own weight. A gradient of 1 in 127 miles long,
                    in a mining branch in Colorado is now regularly worked. In the construction
                    proper a noticeable peculiarity has been the free use of open trestle-work of
                    timber, to save both masonry and earth or rock excavation. Some of these timber
                    structures have been of enormous proportions, as the Portage Viaduct (see vol.
                    iv. p. 328) over the Genesee River, 234 feet high and 800 feet long, in 50 feet
                    spans, built in eighteen months (1858), at a cost of only $140,000, and
                    containing 125,000 cubic feet of timber and 80 tons of bolts. Structures of
                    timber exceeding 100 feet in height have been rare, but of all dimensions below
                    that exceedingly common, the usual intent and practice having been to replace
                    them as they became unserviceable with masonry embankments. Although their use
                    has not unfrequently been abused by permitting them to become unsafe from decay,
                    they have in the main been thoroughly solid and substantial. For bridge spans of
                    30 to 250 feet the wooden “Howe truss” bridge, a type peculiar to America, was
                    early invented and almost universally used where wrought-iron trusses would be
                    now used both in Europe and America. The piers and abutments for such trusses
                    were usually of stone, but not unfrequently of timber also. These wooden trusses
                    are now being rapidly replaced with iron,-the lead-ing types being the Whipple,
                    Post, Fink, and Bollman trusses (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bridges,</hi> vol. iv.
                    p. 322 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> The sleepers (in America called ties or
                    cross-ties) are usually of hard wood (white oak), hewn on top and bottom, with
                    the natural surface of the tree on the sides. The usual dimensions are 6
                    (sometimes 7) inches thick, 8 (sometimes 8| or 9) feet long, and 8 to 10 or even
                    12 inches face. The usual rule is to place them 2 feet or less apart, and 2640
                    to 2700 to the mile. The large bearing surface thus afforded has especially
                    favoured the use of the flat-based or Vignoles rail, and it is in exclusive use
                    throughout North and for the most part South America. The rails now most largely
                    rolled weigh from 56 to 65 lb per yard. On the light-traffic lines of the south
                    and west there are still many 50 lb rails, and in the north and east rails of
                    70, 72, 75, and 80 tb sections are in limited but increasing use. An average for
                    the whole United States would now be somewhat under 60 lb. The close propinquity
                    of the sleepers gives much greater stiffness to the rail than comparative
                    weights alone would indicate, a 60 lb rail being fully equivalent in stiffness
                    and strength to an 80 lb rail supported on chairs 3 feet between centres. The
                    ballast and drainage of American railroads have often been very defective, with
                    the view to effecting a large saving in first cost. Improvements in this as in
                    other respects have taken place in recent years, and many thousand miles are now
                    maintained at a high standard of excellence. Right of way, usually in a
                    continuous strip 100 feet wide (wider where necessary, but never narrower), has
                    been largely given, or purchased at veiy low rates. The widths of road-bed
                    (almost always first graded for a single track) are usually 18 to 20 feet in
                    excavation and 14 feet on embankments, with 1| to 1 slopes. Side slopes of 1 to
                    1 have been largely used in regions not exposed to frost. Parallel tracks are
                    placed 13 feet between centres.</p>
                <p>Railway development in the United States has had to adapt itself to the needs of
                    a new and rapidly growing country, a large part of which was first made
                    available for settlement by railways. Three locomotives were imported from
                    England in 1829, and the first trial in America took place on 8th August 1829 at
                    Honesdale, Pennsylvania. The first railway constructed to be worked by
                    locomotives was the South Carolina Railroad (1828-30), though trials of an
                    experimental locomotive had been made before on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
                    which continued to be worked by horse power until 1832. The mileage of railway
                    construction about kept pace with that of the United Kingdom until 1850; at the
                    beginning of 1885 it amounted to 125,379 miles. The mileage completed amounted
                    to 40 miles at the end of 1830, to 3361 miles in 1841, and to 5206 miles in
                    1847, of which 1340 miles had been opened within six years. Then there was a
                    sudden and great increase, the yearly additions for seven years being 1056 miles
                    in 1848, 1048 in 1849, 1261 in 1850, 1274 in 1851, 2288 in 1852, 2170 in 1853,
                    3442 miles in 1854. The Civil War checked railway construction, only 3257 miles
                    being opened during the five years ending with 1865, when the aggregate amounted
                    to 32,996 miles. But during the seven years ending with 1872 the mileage of the
                    country was nearly doubled, the yearly additions being 1403 miles in 1866, 2541

                    total of 30,272 miles in seven years. At the close of this period of
                    construction there was a mile of railway to every 666 inhabitants. It was
                    followed by great financial disasters and industrial stagnation, and by a period
                    of comparative inactivity in railway extension, only 5217 miles being opened in
                    1873, and only 14,057 in the five years ending with 1878 (2428 in the last-named
                    year). During the five years ending with 1883 40,000 miles were opened, of which
                    11,568 fell to 1882. At the end of 1884 the population per mile of railway w <hi

                    until 1853, and then only 38 miles; in 1860 there were 1930 miles (24,990 on the
                    east), and in 1865 3007 miles. (29,988 on the east). Since 1865 46,600 miles
                    have been built west of the Mississippi. About one-half of the population of the
                    United States is in the territory lying north of the Potomac and Ohio and east
                    of the Mississippi, including sixteen States with an aggregate area of 418,495
                    square miles, 29,000,000 inhabitants, and 55,725 miles of railway. France and
                    Germany together have nearly the same area (416,205 square miles), 83,000,000
                    inhabitants, and 40,682 miles of railway. The United States has one mile of
                    railway to 75־ square miles of territory and 520 inhabitants, aml Europe 1 mile
                    of railway to 102־ square miles and 2040 inhabitants. The two States of New York
                    and Pennsylvania, whose area is about equal to that of Great Britain, have one
                    mile of railway to 62־ square miles, against one to 59־ in Great Britain; and
                    Massachusetts and New Jersey, with one-third more area than Belgium (which has
                    more railway in proportion to area than any other European country), have 4
                    square miles of area per mile of railway, while Belgium has 42־. In the Southern
                    States the railways are much less numerous and have lighter traffic and
                    earnings. The prevailing course of traffic in America is east and west, or
                    rather <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0271-0254"/>to and from the north-eastern Atlantic States
                    north of the Potomac. The eastern “trunk lines,” as they are called, extending
                    from the west to the north-eastern seaports (and also to Canada), have a heavier
                    goods traffic than any other lines of considerable length in the world. The
                    companies owning these lines also own or control in some way extensive systems
                    reaching as far west as Chicago, and in several cases to the Mississippi at St
                    Louis. Two great systems centre on the Pacific coast. Chicago is the chief
                    traffic centre of the interior.</p>
                <p>The railways having at first to serve a thinly peopled but rapidly growing
                    country, American engineers devised methods of construction and working which
                    produced a line at very small cost, lacking very many of the appliances
                    considered necessary in Europe, but capable of being extended and developed as
                    the country itself became more settled and prosperous. At first many Unes cost
                    only £2000 per mile, and much better lines are now being built for £3000 per
                    mile or less. Even when fully developed they are still usually very much less
                    costly than European railways. Some of the large systems have cost, on the
                    average, only from £7000 to £3000 per mile. The average reported cost in 1884 of
                    the 125,000 miles of railway in the United States was £11,400 per mile; but the
                    actual average cost is probably much less.</p>
                <p>In the United States coal for fuel and timber for building and other purposes are
                    carried by railway 1500 miles or more from the place of production. Cattle are
                    carried 2000 miles and more, and wheat and other grains worth but half as much
                    per ton, in immense quantities, 1500 to 1800 miles. This is possible only by
                    rates which in most countries would be thought ruinously low. But in recently
                    settled parts of the United States the population are often dependent upon the
                    railway for almost everything they consume; and almost everything they produce,
                    except their bread and meat, has to be carried by the same means. Thus the
                    traffic per inhabitant is very much larger than in most old countries. Hence too
                    manufactured goods can often be carried 1000 or 1500 miles at a cost very little
                    more than that at the place of manufacture or importation. In one year the five
                    eastern trunk lines received at their western termini (about 450 miles from New
                    York) for transportation eastwards 8,200,000 tons of goods, equal to more than
                    26,000 tons daily. This has greatly promoted the formation of large railway
                    systems and the construction of branches and extensions by railway companies
                    near unsettled districts. A company with a line 500 miles long is induced to
                    make extensions not only by the profit to be made on the new line, which in a
                    new country may be almost nothing for several years, but also by the profit made
                    by carrying the traffic of the new line over the 500 miles of old railway.
                    Comparing the traffic per inhabitant in the United States, Germany, and
                    Austria-Hungary in 1883, we get (Table XXXIV.)</p>

                <p>The railways of America have enjoyed great liberty in fixing their rates, which,
                    however, have been somewhat restricted by new legislation in several States
                    since 1870, notably one limiting the New York Central to 2 cents (1d.) per mile
                    for all classes of passengers. The average rates for goods have been reduced
                    very much since the Civil War and even since 1875. Passenger rates have also
                    been reduced, but not nearly so much. Table XXXV. shows, in pence, the average

                <p>The classification of passengers is but little developed in America. For local
                    journeys there are usually but one class and one rate of fare; but on several
                    important lines additional charges are made for certain special kinds of
                    accommodation. Railway “wars” often bring down the through fares to a
                    ridiculously low figure: for instance, the first-class fare for 960 miles, New
                    York to Chicago, has been £2 or less, and the immigrant fare during the spring
                    and summer of 1884 was 4s. The rates on goods are innumerable and are often
                    changed. Table XXXVII. gives examples of the great fluctuations in these rates,
                    the figures being the number of cents per 100 lb of first-class (the highest
                    class) freight :—</p>

                <p>The rates which the railways have endeavoured to maintain on this traffic since
                    1877 have been, with but slight changes, 75 cents for first-class freight, 60
                    for second, 45 for third, 35 for fourth, and 25 cents for fifth. The highest of
                    these is at the rate of 1∙644 cents per American ton per mile ( = 0∙92d. per
                    English ton per mile); the lowest is 0∙548 cent ( = 0 <hi rend="superscript"
                    >-</hi> 307d.) The “basis rate” is that on grain and flour from Chicago to New
                    York,—grain, flour, and meats forming about four-fifths of the whole traffic
                    eastwards. Twenty cents ( = 0∙492 cent or 0 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 275d.
                    per ton per mile) is considered a remunerative rate. Another “basis rate” is
                    that from Chicago south-west to Kansas City, which governs rates from places
                    about 500 miles from Chicago west and south-west. This rate is usually nearly
                    the same as that from Chicago north-west to St Paul, 400 miles, governing a
                    large amount of traffic in that direction. Between the Missouri river and the
                    Pacific coast is another territory with another basis; and in the south, rates
                    from the Atlantic ports to inland towns are governed by one general rule, as
                    also those from places in the upper Mississippi valley (like St Louis, Chicago,
                    Cincinnati, and Louisville) to the same or other interior towns of the south.
                    Traffic is facilitated on the longer routes by organizations known as “fast
                    freight lines,” whose cars run over several connecting railways. When first
                    established these lines were independent corporations, owning their cars,
                    collecting the charges for transportation, and paying dividends out of their
                    profits. Nowall but a few are simply co-operative agencies of the several
                    associated railway companies, which contribute cars in certain agreed
                    proportions, and share the expenses of the joint agencies, each company
                    receiving the earnings for the freight passing over its railway precisely as for
                    any through freight.</p>
                <p>The laws governing the formation of railway corporations and authorizing railway
                    construction differ in different States, but in most it is open to any
                    association of men with the necessary capital to form a company and construct a
                    railway anywhere. Generally the laws relating to raising and extending capital
                    and the disposition of income are very lax, and under them great abuses have
                    occurred. All but a very small number of the railways have been projected and
                    constructed by private enterprise; but many companies have received aid from
                    towns, cities, counties, or States, and the Federal Government and the State of
                    Texas (the only State owning the public land within its borders) have subsidized
                    many railways, mostly west of the Mississippi, by immense grants of public
                    lands, in the aggregate amounting to 200,000,000 acres. The' Federal Government
                    also lent its bonds to the amount of £13,000,000 to aid in the construction of a
                    few lines between the Missouri and the Pacific coast. Between 1830 and 1840
                    several States undertook to construct railways on their own account; but most of
                    these attempts ended in disaster, and the railways were completed by companies,
                    if completed at all. There remain, however, two State railways, one 138 miles
                    long owned by Georgia, which it leases to a corporation for working, and the
                    other by Massachusetts, mostly in the long Hoosac tunnel. Owing to the
                    pernicious system of raising capital for railway construction from the sale of
                    bonds, secured only by the property bought by the proceeds, before the end of
                    1874 108 railway companies were insolvent, and interest was unpaid on more than
                    £100,000,000 ($497,807,660) of mortgage bonds which they had issued. Indeed, of
                    the total nominal railway capital of the United States very nearly one-half is
                    represented by bonds. One great company which has paid dividends for many years
                    has £9,500,000 of stock to £20,000,000 of debt. The management of railway
                    companies in the United States is often autocratic to the last degree. When once
                    directors have been elected by the vote of the majority of the shareholders,
                    they take the most important steps without ever consulting the shareholders, and
                    in their annual reports they give only such information as they please, subject
                    to no examination by independent auditors. This state of things naturally leads
                    to grave abuses, to directoral mismanagement and dishonest speculation in bonds
                    and shares. In some cases, however, the authority of the directors is limited by
                    the charter or constitution of the company.</p>

                    960 miles from New York to Chicago in 25 hours. A great obstacle to fast running
                    is the original vice of construction with level highway and railway crossings.
                    Only few lines are provided with the block signals and interlocking apparatus
                    required with numerous fast trains; but the use of continuous air-brakes is
                    general. There has been more success in designing appliances to mitigate the
                    effect of accidents than in inventions for avoiding them altogether. Accidents
                    are very numerous, the casualties being more frequent in proportion to traffic
                    than in the principal European countries. The number of accidents to passengers,
                    however, is insignificant when compared with that of accidents to employés and
                    persons walking over crossing-lines. In 1880 the numbers killed and injured were

                <p>Though American railways have steeper grades and sharper curves than in Europe,
                    the loads carried in freight trains are sometimes exceptionally large: trains of
                    45 or 50 eight-wheeled cars each loaded with nearly 18 tons are common. The
                    average load on the principal lines has been doubled since 1870, largely by the
                    adoption of heavier and more powerful locomotives and by the better management
                    of trains, and to some extent by a better condition of permanent w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> ay. This has had much to do with the great reduction
                    in the rates charged. The cost of working American railways is usually a larger
                    proportion of the earnings than in Europe. An American railway which spends 60,
                    66⅔, or 75 per cent, of its earnings for working expenses would in England be
                    called costly to work. The expense per ton per mile on several railways in
                    recent years has been, in cents per ton of 2000 lb (Table XXXIX.) :—</p>

                <p>American railways also contrive to do their work with a very small number of men.
                    In 1880 86,781 miles of railway were worked with a force of 418,957 men, or 4∙7
                    men per mile, against 367,793 in the United Kingdom on 18,681 miles, or 19∙7 per
                    mile, and 316,570 in Germany, or 143 per mile. The greater thinness of traffic
                    on American lines accounts for but part of this, for the number of train-miles
                    per year per man employed in different countries is 929 in the United States,
                    350 in the United Kingdom, 476 in Germany, 395 in Austria-Hungary. A better
                    measure of the work done per man is the number of passenger and ton miles for
                    each man employed (which cannot be given for the United Kingdom); this is shown
                    in Table XLI. :—</p>
