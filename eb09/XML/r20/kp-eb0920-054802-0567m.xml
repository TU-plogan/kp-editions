                    the styles of the Middle Ages, was born in 1776 at Maidenhead, Berkshire, where
                    his father practised as a surgeon, and was brought up as a member of -the
                    Society of Friends. In 1797 he was apprenticed to a London druggist as a step
                    towards entering his father’s profession, but finding the xvork distasteful he
                    gave it up, and for several years tried one employment after another with little
                    success. He married early, and lost his wife, who was his cousin, in 1808. At
                    that time life was a partner in a corn-factor’s business in London, but he
                    afterwards went to live in Liverpool as assistant to an insurance broker, and
                    was soon led to take a very keen interest in the study of ancient buildings,
                    especially churches. All his spare time was spent in sketching and making
                    careful measured drawings, till he gained a knowledge which was very remarkable
                    at a time when but little taste existed for the beauties of the Gothic styles.

                    his study of old examples; and, when a large grant of money was made by the
                    Government to build new churches, he sent in a design of his own which was
                    successful in an open competition; thus he was fairly launched upon the
                    profession of an architect, for which his natural gifts strongly fitted him.
                    Rickman then moved to Birmingham, and at first worked at his new profession with
                    Mr H. Hutchinson as managing clerk; and when he died in 1830 Rickman entered
                    into partnership with Mr Hussey, having become one of the most successful
                    architects of his time. He built an immense number of churches, chapels, and
                    other buildings, among which some of the chief are churches at Hampton Lucy,
                    Ombersley, and Stretton-on-Dunsmore, St George’s at Birmingham, St Philip’s and
                    St Matthew’s both in Bristol, two in Carlisle, St Peter’s and St Paul’s at
                    Preston, St David’s in Glasgow, Grey Friars at Coventry, and many others. He
                    also designed the new court of St John’s College, Cambridge, a palace for the
                    bishop of Carlisle, and several large country houses. These are all in the
                    Gothic style, but, though superior perhaps to the buildings of his predecessors,
                    they show more knowledge of the outward form of the mediaeval style than any
                    real acquaintance with its spirit, and are little better than dull copies of old
                    work, disfigured by much poverty of detail. Rickmann nevertheless was an
                    important stage in the revival of taste for mediaevalism, perhaps in that
                    respect only second to Pugin. His book entitled <hi rend="italic">An Attempt to
                    Discriminate the Styles of Architecture in England</hi> is a work which deserves
                    great credit for its painstaking research; a great many editions of it were
                    published, and it was eventually much improved and enlarged. Rickman died in
                    1841.</p>
