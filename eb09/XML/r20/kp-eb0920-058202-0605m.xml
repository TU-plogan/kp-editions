                    might have been easily avoided. They appear to have been often laid out in a
                    line with some prominent landmark, and their general straightness is perhaps due
                    to convenience in setting them out. In solidity of construction they have never
                    been excelled, and many of them still remain, often forming the foundation of a
                    more modern road, and in some instances constituting the road surface now used.
                    It is consequently possible, with the help of allusions of ancient writers, to
                    follow the mode of construction. Two parallel trenches were first cut to mark
                    the breadth of the road; loose earth was removed until a solid foundation was
                    reached; and it was replaced by proper material consolidated by ramming, or
                    other means were taken to form a solid foundation for the body of the road. This
                    appears as a rule to have been composed of four layers, generally of local
                    materials, though sometimes they were brought from considerable distances. The
                    lowest layer consisted of two or three courses of flat stones, or, when these
                    were not obtainable, of other stones, generally laid in mortar; the second layer
                    was composed of rubble masonry of smaller stones, or a coarse concrete; the
                    third of a finer concrete, on which was laid a pavement of polygonal blocks of
                    hard stone jointed with the greatest nicety. The four layers are found to be
                    often 3 feet or more in thickness, but the two lowest were dispensed with on
                    rock. The paved part of a great road appears to have been about 16 feet wide,
                    and on either side, and separated from it by raised stone causeways, were
                    unpaved side-ways, each of half the width of the paved road. Where, as on many
                    roads, the surface was not paved, it was made of hard concrete, or pebbles or
                    flints set in mortar. Sometimes clay and marl were used instead of mortar, and
                    it would seem that where inferior materials were used the road was made higher
                    above the ground and rounder in cross section. Streets were paved with large
                    polygonal blocks laid as above described and footways with rectangular slabs.
                    Specimens are still to be seen in Rome and Pompeii. There are no traces of Roman
                    influence in the later roads in England, but in France the Roman method appears
                    to have been followed to some extent when new roads were constructed about the
                    beginning of the 18th century. A foundation of stones on the flat was laid, and
                    over that two layers of considerable thickness, of larger and smaller stones,
                    bordered by large stones on edge, which appeared on the surface of the road. In
                    1764 Tresaguet set the foundation-stones on edge and reduced the thickness of
                    the upper layers, and his method was generally folloλved until the influence of
                    Macadam began to be felt. A French chaussée with accotements still retains, some
                    resemblance to the old Roman roads.</p>
                <p>The almost incredibly bad state of the roads in England towards the latter part
                    of the 17th century appears from the accounts cited by Macaulay <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hist.,</hi> c. iii.). It was due chiefly to the state of the law,
                    which compelled each parish to maintain its own roads by statute labour, but the
                    establishment of turnpike trusts and the maintenance of roads by tolls do not
                    appear to have effected any great improvement. At the time of Arthur Young’s six
                    months’ tour in 1770 the roads would seem to have been almost as bad as ever,
                    and it is doubtful if there was much improvement up to the beginning of the
                    present century. The turnpike roads were generally managed by ignorant and
                    incompetent men until Telford and Macadam brought scientific principles and
                    regular system to their construction and repair. The name of Telford is
                    associated with a pitched foundation, which he did not always use, but which
                    closely resembled that which had been long in use in France, and the name of
                    Macadam often characterizes roads on which all his precepts are disregarded.
                    Both insisted on thorough drainage and on the use of carefully prepared
                    materials, and adopted a uniform cross section of moderate curvature instead of
                    the exaggerated roundness given before; but, while Telford paid particular
                    attention to a foundation for the broken stone, Macadam disregarded it,
                    contending that the subsoil, however bad, would carry any weight if made dry by
                    drainage and kept dry by an impervious covering. Macadam was engaged more with
                    the repair of old roads than with the construction of new ones, and, though it
                    is not possible to agree with all his doctrines, the improvement which he
                    effected in road management and maintenance was great and lasting.</p>
                <p>Construction of Roads.—A road should be as short as possible between two points
                    to be connected, but straightness must often be sacrificed to avoid difficulties
                    and expense and to secure good gradients. The latter should be as easy as
                    practicable, having regard to the country to be traversed, and it is desirable
                    that there should be a ruling gradient than which none should be steeper. On a
                    level macadamized road in ordinary repair the force which the horse has to put
                    forth to draw a load may be taken as one-thirtieth of the load. But in going
                    uphill the horse has also to lift the load, and the additional force to be put
                    forth on this account is very nearly equal to the load drawn divided by the rate
                    of gradient. Thus on a gradient of 1 in 30 the force spent in lifting is
                    one-thirtieth of the load, and in ascending a horse has to exert twice the force
                    required to draw the load on a level. In descending, on the other hand, on such
                    a gradient, the vehicle, when once started, would just move of itself without
                    pressing on the horse. Λ horse can without difficulty exert twice his usual
                    force for a time, and can therefore ascend gradients of 1 in 30 on a macadamized
                    surface without sensible diminution of speed, and can trot freely down them.
                    These considerations have led to 1 in 30 being generally considered as the
                    ruling gradient to be aimed at on first-class roads, though 1 in 40 has been
                    advocated. Telford adopted 1 in 30 as the ruling gradient on the Holyhead road
                    through North Wales, and there are only two gradients steeper, in places where
                    they were unavoidable. All unnecessary rises and falls should be avoided, but a
                    dead level is unfavourable for drainage, and on this account 1 in 100 to 1 in
                    150 is the flattest gradient that is desirable. Such slight rises and falls are
                    probably rather favourable than otherwise to ease of draught by horses.</p>
                <p>In transverse section, roads in the United Kingdom generally comprise the
                    carriage-way, a space on each side, on one or both of which there may be a
                    footpath, then the fences, and outside all the ditches. The width of the
                    carriage-way may be from 15 feet, which allows of the easy passage of two
                    vehicles, to 30 or 50 feet <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0606-0583"/>for roads of importance near towns. The side
                    spaces may be from</p>
                <p>4 or 5 to 8 or 10 feet wide; wide sides give the sun and air access to the road,
                    and tend to keep it dry, and also afford space for the deposit of road materials
                    and scrapings. In cuttings or on embankments the transverse section has of
                    course to be modified. The road surface should have just enough convexity to
                    throw the wet off freely, and a very moderate amount is sufficient when a good
                    surface is maintained. On a too convex road the traffic keeps to the middle, and
                    wears ruts which retain the water, so that the surface is not so dry as with a
                    flatter section which allows the traffic to distribute itself over the whole
                    width. Telford used a cross section differing slightly from an arc of a circle
                    in being more convex in the middle than at the sides. Walker recommended two
                    straight lines joined in the middle of the road by a curve, and inclined about 1
                    in 24 towards the sides, the objection to which is that the flat sides are
                    liable to wear hollow. An arc of a circle is often used, and is a good form, but
                    on the whole a curve more convex at the centre than towards the sides is the
                    best. The rise in the curve from the sides to the centre need not exceed
                    one-fortieth of the width, and one-sixtieth is generally enough on well-kept
                    roads, and if seven-eighths of the total rise are given at one-fourth the
                    distance from the centre to the sides and five-eighths at half that distance a
                    curve of suitable form will be obtained. It is generally best to obtain the
                    requisite convexity by rounding the formation surface or seat of the road and
                    giving a uniform thickness to the coating of stone. When there is not a kerb
                    there should be a “shouldering” of sods and earth on each side to keep the road
                    materials in place, and to form with the finished surface the water tables or
                    side channels in which the surface drainage is collected, to be conveyed by
                    outlets at frequent intervals to the side ditches. The outlets are open cuts
                    through the sides or drains beneath the footpaths. The side ditches should be
                    deep enough to thoroughly drain the foundation of the road, and cross or mitre
                    drains under the road communicating with the side ditches may be required in wet
                    soil. A thorough drainage of the subsoil is of the greatest importance, and it
                    is economical in the end to go to considerable expense to secure it. In a
                    cutting, or where there are no side ditches, the surface water may be taken off
                    by gratings and under drains beneath the side channels.</p>
                <p>The thickness to be given to a road made altogether of broken stone will depend
                    on the traffic it is intended for. On a good well-drained soil a thickness of 6
                    inches will make an excellent road for ordinary traffic, and Macadam’s opinion
                    that 10 inches of well-consolidated material was sufficient to carry the
                    heaviest traffic on any substratum if properly drained has proved to be
                    generally correct. In a new road the loss of thickness during consolidation must
                    be allowed for, and the materials should be laid about one-half thicker than the
                    coating is intended to be. When the materials are not rolled, a thickness of 3
                    to 6 inches should be laid first, and when that has partly consolidated under
                    the traffic other coats may be added to make up the full thickness. There is
                    great wear and waste of the materials in consolidating if they are laid too
                    thickly at once. Inferior material is sometimes used in the lower part of the
                    road coating, especially when the surface is to be of granite or other hard
                    expensive stone. Thus flints or gravel may be used for the lower</p>
                <p>5 or 6 inches of a road to be coated with 3 or 4 inches of granite. Telford
                    covered the broken stone of new roads with 1⅛ inches of gravel to act as a
                    binding material. Macadam absolutely interdicted the use of any binding
                    material, leaving the broken stone to work in and unite by its own angles under
                    the traffic. An unsound road may be made by the improper use of a binding
                    material, but there is no doubt that broken stone consolidates more quickly, and
                    without losing its angular form, when binding is moderately used. About one half
                    the volume of broken stone is void space, and, as the results of examinations
                    into the composition of the coatings of roads when thoroughly consolidated prove
                    that a very large proportion must necessarily be small stones and detritus, it
                    is much better to give some portion of this at first rather than to obtain it by
                    the crushing and grinding of the materials by the traffic. The binding
                    material—fine gravel, sand, or road scrapings— should be spread over the surface
                    after the broken stone is laid and not be mixed with it. Uniform consolidation
                    is much aided by raking.</p>
                <p>Whenever it is possible a new road should be finished with a roller. The
                    materials are consolidated with less waste, and wear and tear of vehicles and
                    horses is saved. Horse-rollers, if heavy enough to be efficient, require a
                    number of horses to draw them and are cumbersome to use. A ton or a ton and a
                    half weight per foot of width is desirable, and to obtain it a roller 4 feet
                    wide must be loaded to 5 or 6 tons, and will require as many horses to draw it.
                    In Great Britain horse-rollers have to a great extent been superseded by steam
                    road rollers in consequence of the superiority and economy in the work done. A
                    lδ-ton roller, 7 feet wide, giving upwards of 2 tons weight per foot, can
                    thoroughly consolidate 1000 to 2000 square yards of newly-laid materials per
                    day. The materials should be formed to the proper section, and not more than 4
                    or 5 inches in thickness; if a greater thickness is required it is better to
                    roll two coats separately. After several passages of the roller any hollows must
                    be filled up with small materials, and the rolling must be continued until it
                    causes no motion among the stones. When this result has been attained the
                    binding material may be added. It should be spread dry and uniformly in moderate
                    quantities and should be rolled into the interstices with the aid of watering
                    and sweeping. Provided that all the interstices in the upper stratum of stones
                    are filled after the stones are thoroughly consolidated, the less binding that
                    is used the better. By using binding in larger quantity, and before the stone is
                    thoroughly consolidated, the amount of rolling required is lessened, but at the
                    expense of durability in the road. Watering is necessary from the commencement
                    of the rolling unless the weather is wet, but excessive watering, especially in
                    the earlier stages, tends to soften the foundation.</p>
                <p>A pitched foundation like that used by Telford is always desirable for a road
                    that is subject to heavy traffic. It consists of fiat stones carefully set on
                    edge in courses across the road with the broadest edges downwards. The upper
                    edges should not exceed 4 inches in breadth, to hold the broken stone well. All
                    inequalities must be knocked off, and small stones and chips must be firmly
                    pinned into the interstices with a hammer, so as to form a regular convex
                    surface, with every stone firmly fixed in place. The thickness of the pitching
                    is generally 6 or 7 inches; it should not be less than 4, and it may generally
                    be thicker without any sensible increase of cost. At least 4 inches of broken
                    stone are required over the pitched foundation, and, when consolidated, 6 are
                    always sufficient. A foundation of cement concrete 6 inches thick was used by
                    Sir J. Macneill on the Highgate Archway (London) road on a bad clay bottom, and
                    common lime concrete was subsequently used elsewhere. A bed of lias lime
                    concrete 12 inches thick was laid as a foundation in Southwark Street and on the
                    Thames Embankment, but it is too expensive for a macadamized road under ordinary
                    circumstances. Burned clay, gravel, or even sand may be usefully employed as a
                    foundation on a clay bottom, to cut off the road material from the clay.</p>
                <p>The qualities required in a good road stone are hardness, toughness, and ability
                    to resist the action of the weather, and these are not always found together in
                    the same stone. Limestones possess another quality, that of furnishing a
                    mortar-like detritus which binds the stone together, and enables it to wear
                    better than a harder material that does not bind. For heavy traffic the best
                    materials are traps, basalts, greenstones, and syenite; quartzose grits and
                    cherty sandstones are also excellent materials. For moderate traffic the harder
                    limestones are sufficiently durable and make the smoothest and pleasantest
                    roads. Coefficients of quality for various road materials have been obtained by
                    the engineers of the French “Administration des Ponts et Chaussées.” The quality
                    was assumed to be in inverse proportion to the quantity consumed on a length of
                    road with the same traffic, and measurements of traffic and wear were
                    systematically made to arrive at correct results. These processes requiring
                    great care and considerable time, direct experiments on resistance to crushing
                    and to rubbing and collision have also been made on 673 samples of road
                    materials of all kinds. The coefficients obtained by these experiments, which
                    were found to agree fairly well with those arrived at by actual wear in the
                    roads, are summarized in the following table. The coefficient 20 is equivalent
                    to “excellent,” 10 to “sufficiently good,” and 5 to “bad.”</p>

                <p>Stone for a new road should be evenly broken to a size that will pass every way
                    through a ring 2⅜ inches in diameter. For repairs, especially when the material
                    is tough, a gauge of 2{ or 2 inches may be used with advantage, as the stone
                    covers a larger surface, consolidates sooner, and makes a smoother surface.
                    Stone is best broken by hand, but stone-breaking machines have been introduced
                    which supersede hand-breaking to some extent, especially where large quantities
                    of hard stone are to be broken. There is always a certain amount of crushing in
                    breaking by a machine, from which softer stones suffer more, and machine-broken
                    stone is never nearly so cubical, uniform in size, or durable as stone well
                    broken by hand. Broken road material contains about 55 per cent, of solid stone
                    to 45 of void space. In a well-consolidated road the void is filled up by small
                    fragments, detritus, and mud, the result of wear, and specimens of good road
                    surfaces weigh from 93 to 95 per cent, of the weight of the solid stone of which
                    they are made. In the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n607/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0607-0584"/>coating of a well-maintained road the proportion
                    of stones of various sizes varies, but generally from one-third to one-half is
                    found to consist of detritus under three-eighths of an inch in diameter, and
                    there is a very constant proportion of about one-fifth of mud and detritus under
                    one-thirtieth of an inch in diameter. This appears to be the amount necessary to
                    fill the voids between the fragments of stone when compacted together. In an
                    ill-kept road, from which the mud is not removed, the proportion of detritus is
                    much higher, and mud may constitute nearly one-half of the coating. In
                    proportion as the detritus and mud are kept down to the minimum by constant
                    removal from the surface, so will the road be able to resist the action of wet
                    and frost and the wear of the traffic.</p>
                <p>The wear of materials, resulting in their gradual reduction to detritus, is due
                    to the joint action of the traffic and the weather, which cause surface wear,
                    wear arising from cross breaking, and from rubbing of the stones together. When
                    there is no movement in the body of the road, and the wear is confined to the
                    crushing and grinding at the surface, it is the least possible; but, when a road
                    is weak from insufficient thickness or solidity on a yielding foundation,
                    bending and cross breaking of the coating take place under passing loads in
                    addition to the surface wear, and the effects are aggravated by the softening
                    action of water finding its way into the road through cracks formed in the
                    surface and by the disintegrating action of frost. The wear and waste are thus
                    far larger than on roads of sufficient strength, properly maintained. The
                    destructive effect of wheels is greater as the diameter is less, and to a much
                    greater degree as the tire is narrower. On hard and strong roads no greater
                    width of wheel than 4⅜ inches is useful, as a wider tire does not bear evenly,
                    but on yielding roads a greater width is of some advantage, though it does not
                    prevent damage from bending and cross breaking of the whole coating under
                    excessive loads. A good deal of attention has been given by French engineers to
                    the measurement of traffic, wear, and the consumption of road materials. Without
                    a knowledge of the amount of traffic accurate comparisons of wear are
                    impossible, and an account of the traffic on the roads of France is taken
                    periodically in “collars” or horses drawing loads, and in the weight drawn.
                    Traffic as measured by weight drawn has of late been observed in some of the
                    streets of London and Liverpool, and has been reduced for comparison to the
                    weight per foot or yard of width of the carriage-way. Wear may be measured by
                    loss of thickness in the coating; but the loss of stone in proportion to
                    detritus must also be ascertained before all the effects of wear can be
                    determined. The accurate measurement of wear as practised by the French
                    engineers is a complicated process, and it must suffice here to state that
                    measured by thickness the wear is seldom found to exceed half an inch, or on the
                    most frequented roads of France one inch, of consolidated surface per year, and
                    that about 100 cubic yards of good materials per mile per year are considered as
                    the average consumption under 100 collars of traffic per day. Observations in
                    the United Kingdom on roads well and systematically maintained have confirmed
                    these results.</p>
                <p>The new materials may be added to the road either in thin coats and small patches
                    year by year or in a thick coat consolidated by rolling. The first method, by
                    which the wear is replaced annually and the traffic is depended on to work the
                    materials into the road, can be followed with excellent results, and at no great
                    inconvenience to the public under proper management when the traffic is not
                    excessive. Considerable care in the use of materials is required that none may
                    be unnecessarily applied. The annual employment of one-fifth or one-sixth the
                    quantity which it would take to cover the whole surface one stone in thickness
                    is often sufficient to replace wear, and it will then take five or six years to
                    coat every part of the road if it is covered regularly. It is therefore
                    important to apply the new materials only where they are needed, and not to use
                    them where the road is already sufficiently thick. The irregularity of wear and
                    of thickness enables a good roadman to judge where new materials must be
                    applied, and he will apply them in small quantities wherever weak places appear.
                    To facilitate this the materials should be placed in heaps by the roadside in
                    the summer, and they should be carefully spread in the autumn and attended to
                    afterwards to ensure consolidation without waste. By good management a large
                    quantity of materials may be incorporated in a road before the middle of the
                    winter without harassing the traffic, and the strength may not only be
                    maintained but increased. On a hard strong road consolidation may be aided by
                    loosening the surface with a pick; generally only the margin of a patch need be
                    picked up. But if the road is soft or weak it is better not to disturb the
                    surface at all. Binding may sometimes be used to aid consolidation, but it is
                    seldom necessary if the materials are properly laid and attended to, as the
                    coating already contains detritus enough. In the second method a coating of
                    materials is laid on at once sufficient to endure the wear of several years with
                    such slight repairs as may be necessary to keep a good surface, and, when the
                    wear has gone as far as it can be safely allowed to go, the process is repeated.
                    Unless the wear is very considerable there is no economy in this method, though
                    the convenience to the public, especially in towns, is undeniable. Consolidation
                    by rolling (after the manner already described) is essential, and it is
                    generally desirable to loosen the old surface to ensure the incorporation of the
                    new coating with it. Scraping and attention are required between one coating and
                    another and also slight repairs to the surface, as, however well the materials
                    may be laid and rolled, the wear of the ordinary traffic will search out places
                    which have escaped the full pressure of the roller and produce inequalities.</p>
                <p>Besides a regular application of new materials to replace wear, there must be in
                    road maintenance on proper principles a systematic removal of the detritus by
                    scraping or sweeping, which must be regarded as keeping the whole coating in
                    proper condition, and not as mere surface cleansing. The wear should also be
                    reduced as far as possible by providing sufficient thickness to carry the
                    traffic, by keeping an even surface on which water can never stand and soak, and
                    by good drainage both of surface and subsoil. An adequate amount of skilled
                    manual labour is necessary for economy of maintenance, and this and the constant
                    attention which is required to keep a road in good order are best secured by
                    putting a man in permanent charge of a defined length. In the autumn and winter,
                    when more labour is wanted, extra men should work under the directions of the
                    permanent road labourer, whose knowledge of his length of road will enable him
                    to employ them to the best advantage.</p>
                <p>Concrete macadam, formed by grouting with lime or cement mortar a coat of broken
                    stone laid over a bed of stone previously well rolled, has been tried as an
                    improvement on an ordinary macadamized surface, but not hitherto with much
                    success. When cleanliness is of importance, and great durability is not
                    required, tar macadam or bituminous concrete may be usefully employed. It is
                    sometimes made by first spreading a coating of broken stone and consolidating it
                    by a roller, and then pouring over it a mixture of coal-tar, pitch, and creasote
                    oil, upon which a layer of smaller stone is spread and rolled in, and the
                    surface finished with stone chippings rolled in. More usually the broken stone
                    and bituminous mixture are well incorporated together before they are spread,
                    the stone sometimes being previously heated. The lower layer, about 4 inches
                    thick, may be of stone broken to 2⅜ inches gauge, and the next layer, about 2
                    inches thick, may be of smaller stone. Each layer must be well rolled, and when
                    perfectly solid a thin coating of fine stone or granite chippings is spread over
                    the surface and rolled in. Hard limestone is found to be more suitable than
                    sili-cious or igneous rocks for this material. A road surface well made in this
                    manner will last several years under light traffic without any repairs, and it
                    can easily be patched when necessary.</p>
                <p>Stone Pavements.—Early pitched roadways consisted of pebbles or rounded boulders,
                    bedded in the natural surface or in sand or gravel. The next step in advance was
                    to employ roughly-squared blocks; but the wide and irregular joints admitted the
                    water to the subsoil, and the mud worked up and the stones sank irregularly
                    under the traffic. Telford, who was called upon to report on the street
                    pavements of the parish of Hanover Square in 1824, saw the necessity of cutting
                    off all connexion between the subsoil and the paving stones. He recommended a
                    bed of about 6 inches of clean river ballast, rendered compact by being
                    travelled upon for some time before the paving was laid, but he subsequently
                    considered that nothing short of 12 inches of broken stone, put on in layers 4
                    inches thick and completely consolidated by carriages passing over them, would
                    answer the purpose. He recommended paving stones of considerable depth and of
                    from 4⅜ to 6 or 7⅜ inches in breadth for the gι ’ eatest thoroughfares, and he
                    pointed out the importance of working the stones flat on the face and square on
                    all sides, so as to joint close and preserve the bed or base as nearly as
                    possible of the same size as the face, and of carefully placing together in the
                    same course stones of equal breadth. Many pavements thus laid with stones of
                    considerable breadth still remain, but experience proved that it was a mistake
                    to suppose that broad stones having a larger base would support better the
                    weight and shocks of heavy traffic; on the contrary, a wide stone has a tendency
                    to rock on its bed, and also to wear round on the top and become slippery. To
                    obtain an evener surface and a better foothold for the horses the stones were
                    reduced in width, and in 1840 a granite pavement was laid by Walker on
                    Blackfriars Bridge, which may be considered the first of modern set pavements.
                    The stones were 3 inches broad and 9 deep; they were laid on a bed of concrete 1
                    foot thick and were jointed with mortar. The reduction of breadth to about 3
                    inches was generally followed, but it is only of late years that a concrete
                    foundation has been employed to any great extent, the frequent breaking up to
                    which streets are subject having prevented it. In London a foundation of broken
                    stone has been continued in the chief thoroughfares, the sets being evenly
                    bedded in gravel upon it and rammed with a heavy wooden rammer. Hard core—a
                    mixture of broken stone, clinker, brick rubbish, and old building materials—has
                    also been largely used to form a foundation. In the northern towns of England
                    cinders have been employed, and where the traffic is exceptionally heavy a
                    pitched foundation of stones on edge has been laid when the sets were not paved
                    upon an old macadamized surface. The concrete for a foundation to a paved street
                    should be made with the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0608-0585"/>best Portland cement, thoroughly mixed in proper
                    proportions with the sand and gravel or other materials used, water being added
                    as sparingly as possible. A thickness of 6 inches of well-made cement concrete
                    is sufficient for the heaviest traffic, and it can be cut out in slabs for
                    pipe-laying or repairs and can be relaid and cemented in its place. To obtain
                    the best result a new foundation should not be paved upon for a week. A
                    foundation of bituminous concrete is sometimes used where only a thin bed can be
                    laid, in consequence of there being an old foundation which it is undesirable to
                    disturb. It is made by pouring a composition of coal-tar, pitch, and creasote
                    oil while hot over broken stone levelled and rolled to the proper form, and then
                    spreading a thin layer of smaller broken stone over the surface and rolling it
                    in. It has the advantage that it can be paved upon a few hours after it has been
                    laid.</p>
                <p>The best materials for pavement sets are the hard igneous and metamorphic rocks,
                    though millstone grit and other hard sedimentary rocks of the same nature are
                    used when the traffic is comparatively light. Excessively hard stone which wears
                    smooth and slippery is objectionable in spite of its durability. Penmaen-Mawr
                    stone, which is much used in many of the large Lancashire towns, is of this
                    character, and its use was discontinued in London in consequence of its
                    slipperiness and noise. Guernsey granite (syenite) and Mount Sorrel granite
                    (syenite) have the same nature in a less degree, and in London Aberdeen blue
                    granite is preferred, as, though it wears faster, it keeps a rough surface.
                    Walker’s observations on the wear of tram stones showed that Aberdeen granite
                    wore three and a quarter times as fast as Guernsey granite, and in the set
                    pavement of Blackfriars Bridge it was found that after thirteen and a half
                    years’ wear the Aberdeen stone had worn 1⅜ inches, while the Guernsey granite
                    had only worn one-fourth of an inch (equal to '11 and <hi rend="superscript"
                    >-</hi> 019 inch per year respectively), or that the former had worn six times
                    as fast as the latter. Observations made by Mr Haywood showed the general rate
                    of wear of Aberdeen granite under heavy traffic in the City of London pavements
                    to have been from ’ 14 to <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 23 inch per year. The
                    rate of wear of Penmaen-Mawr and Carnarvonshire sets in Liverpool under the
                    greatest traffic is stated to be seldom more than ‘02 inch per year. A certain
                    proportion between the depth and the length and breadth of sets is required for
                    stability. A shallow stone is more easily tilted up by a heavy weight coming on
                    one edge, and a narrow stone has a tendency to turn over sideways. The length,
                    measured across the street, must be sufficient to break joint properly, as two
                    or more joints nearly in-a line lead to the formation of grooves. For the softer
                    stones a breadth of 4 or 5 inches may be adopted, but for sets of granite or
                    other hard material, with which the joints must be depended on for foothold, the
                    breadth should not much exceed 3 inches. The depth should not be less than twice
                    the breadth, and, as deeper sets weigh more and cost more than shallower ones
                    and the loss by wear is but slight, there is some reason for not exceeding the
                    minimum depth. Where, however, the speedy relaying of a street pavement is of
                    more importance than a saving in first cost, deeper sets are used, and when they
                    have become, so worn as to be uneven the street is relaid with new sets and the
                    old ones are removed to be redressed for use in other streets, the sets being
                    used again and again in less important streets as their depth is reduced. In
                    London sets 3 inches wide, 10 to 15 long, and originally 9 deep are used in this
                    manner. In Liverpool sets 4 to 14 inches wide, to average with the joints, 5 to
                    7 inches long, and 6 to 7⅜ deep according to the traffic are used. In Manchester
                    the sets are 3 to 3⅜ inches wide, 5 to 7 long, and 5 to 6 deep, or 7 in
                    exceptional situations. Sets should be well squared and not taper from the face
                    downwards; both joints and face should be free from irregular projections. On a
                    concrete foundation sets are generally bedded on a thin layer of sand or fine
                    gravel; sometimes they are laid in a bed of fine cement concrete, enough of
                    which is spread over the concrete foundation to be covered while fresh by the
                    sets, which are put in place and smartly tapped, and the joints are grouted at
                    once with cement grout. To allow the cement to become thoroughly set it is
                    desirable that traffic over the pavement should not be allowed for a fortnight,
                    if that can be arranged. The courses of sets are laid square across the street,
                    no advantage arising from a slanting direction, which makes the wear more
                    irregular. At junctions of streets the courses are laid meeting at an angle at
                    the centre line of the narrower street, so that the courses may not run in the
                    direction of the traffic. On steep inclines the sets are sometimes slightly
                    tilted on their beds, forming a serrated surface to give foothold, and slate has
                    been inserted in the joints for the same purpose. The water channels are formed
                    by two or three courses of sets laid parallel to the kerb.</p>
                <p>J oints simply filled in with gravel are of course pervious to water, and a grout
                    of lime or cement does not make a permanently watertight joint, as it becomes
                    disintegrated under the vibration of the traffic. Grouted joints, however, make
                    a good pavement when there is a foundation of concrete or broken stone or hard
                    core. Where there is not a regular foundation imperviousness in the joints is of
                    great importance. In some of the Lancashire towns the joints have for many years
                    past been made by first filling them with clean gravel, well shaken in by
                    ramming, and then pouring in a composition of coal-tar, pitch, and creasote oil.
                    The Manchester pavements are good examples of this system of trusting to
                    impervious jointing to prevent unequal settlement. The foundation, where there
                    is not already an old road surface, is a bed of cinders about 1 foot thick, over
                    which are laid 3 inches of gravel, which are thoroughly consolidated by allowing
                    the traffic to pass over them. The sets are evenly bedded and well rammed after
                    the joints have been filled with clean gravel, ramming and gravelling being
                    repeated till the joints are full of gravel. The mixture of coal-tar, pitch, and
                    creasote oil, well boiled, is then poured over the surface and allowed to
                    percolate and fill up all interstices in the joints, and the pavement is
                    finished by covering it with small gravel. Joints so formed are impervious to
                    wet and have a certain amount of elasticity; the foundation is kept dι∙y; and
                    the pavement keeps its form well for many years. The objection is made that in
                    hot weather the composition runs from the joints and makes the streets
                    unpleasant for foot-passengers. This sort of jointing is used in Liverpool and
                    some other large towns, where the sets are laid on a concrete foundation. The
                    elasticity diminishes vibration and noise, and pavements so jointed are said to
                    wear better than others.</p>
                <p>A curve like that before described, flattening gradually towards the sides, and
                    having a rise equal to one-sixtieth of the width of the carriage-way, is a
                    common cross section for a paved street. Sometimes the rise is even less.</p>
                <p>A pavement consisting of broad, smooth, well-jointed blocks of granite for the
                    wheel tracks, and pitching between for the horse track, was laid by Walker in
                    Commercial Road (London) for the heavy traffic to the West India Docks in 1825,
                    and similar pavements have been successfully used elsewhere, principally for
                    heavy traffic, in streets only wide enough for one vehicle. In Milan, Turin, and
                    other towns of northern Italy tramways of the same sort are extensively used for
                    the ordinary street traffic. The tractive force required is small, while the
                    foothold on the horse track is good; but the train-stones are slippery for
                    horses to pass over. The rigidity of the roadway renders it more suitable for
                    slow heavy traffic than for light quick vehicles, and the improvement in other
                    pavements has limited the application of this one in ordinary streets.</p>
                <p>Wood Paving.—Wood pavements were introduced in England in 1839. Hexagonal· blocks
                    of fir, 6 to 8 inches across and 4 to 6 deep, were bedded in gravel laid on a
                    foundation previously levelled and beaten. The blocks were either bevelled off
                    at the edges or grooved across the face to afford foothold. Other wood pavements
                    were tried in London about the same time, but they soon got out of order from
                    unequal settlement of the blocks, and most of them lasted but a few years. The
                    best of these was Carey’s, which consisted of blocks 6⅜ to 7⅜ inches wide, 13 to
                    15 long, and 8 or 9 deep, the sides and ends having projecting and re-entering
                    angles locking the blocks together with the view of preventing unequal
                    settlement. Pavements on this system were laid in Mincing Lane in 1841 and in
                    Gracechurch Street in 1842. In the latter street the blocks appear to have been
                    relaid every three or four years and to have been entirely removed about every
                    eleven years, until the pavement was removed in 1871, to be superseded by
                    asphalt. Experience led to a reduction in the width of the blocks to 4 inches
                    and in the depth to 5 or 6, and the salient and re-entering angles disappeared
                    from the sides. With these modifications Carey’s pavement remained in use from
                    1841 until after the introduction of more modern systems in recent years. The
                    “improved wood pavement” was first used in London in 1871. After the foundation
                    was formed to the proper cross section a bed of sand 4 inches deep was laid,
                    upon which came two layers of inch deal boards saturated with boiling tar, one
                    layer across the other. The wooden blocks were 3 inches wide, 5 deep, and 9
                    long; they were dipped in tar and laid on the boards with the ends close
                    together, but transversely the courses were spaced by fillets of wood
                    three-fourths of an inch wide nailed to the floor and to the blocks. The joints
                    were filled up with clean pebbles rammed in and were run with a composition of
                    pitch and tar, the surface being dressed with boiling tar and strewed with small
                    sharp gravel and sand. In this pavement a ’somewhat elastic foundation was
                    provided in the boards, which were also intended to prevent unequal settlement
                    of the blocks; but the solidity of the pavement depended upon its
                    water-tightness, for, when the surface water reached the sand, as it did sooner
                    or later, settlement and dislocation of the blocks under the traffic arose.
                    Γavements on this system were laid between 1872 and 1876, and were kept in
                    repair and relaid from time to time, but about 1877 the plank foundation was
                    abandoned for a foundation of cement concrete.</p>
                <p>A concrete foundation for a wood pavement appears to have been first employed in
                    a pavement laid in 1872 in Gracechurch Street by the JAgno-Mineral Company. The
                    concrete was of blue lias lime 4 inches thick formed to the curve of the road.
                    The blocks were of beech, mineralized by a special process, 3⅜ inches wide, 4⅜
                    deep, and 7⅛ long, with the ends cut to an angle of 60°, so that each block
                    might derive support from the next one. They were laid with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n609/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0609-0586"/>ends inclining in opposite directions in alternate
                    courses. The upper edges of the blocks were chamfered, and there was a chamfered
                    groove near the bottom. In a few years this form of block was abandoned for
                    rectangular blocks, and mineralized fir was substituted for beech. The blocks
                    were bedded in Portland cement and laid with joints one-fourth of an inch wide,
                    partly filled with asphalt and then grouted with mortar. The adoption of a bed
                    of concrete as the weight-bearing foundation of the road marks a new departure,
                    and in all the more recent systems of wood pavement a substantial foundation of
                    concrete is an essential feature. In Norwich, however, a large quantity of wood
                    pavement has been laid on the old street foundation, the blocks being bedded in
                    gravel and sand and rammed, and the joints grouted with lime and sand. The
                    experience of from four to seven years has proved the pavements to be
                    successful, but the foundation is exceptionally dry and hard and the traffic not
                    very heavy. With a concrete foundation there is no reason for complicated shapes
                    and contrivances for locking the blocks together; and wood pavements in their
                    modern form consist of rectangular blocks (obtained by cutting off the end of a
                    deal plank), bedded on the concrete with the fibres of the wood vertical, thus
                    constituting a slightly elastic wearing surface on a rigid foundation, by which
                    the weight of the traffic is borne. There is, however, considerable variation in
                    the method of bedding and jointing the blocks. The Asphaltic Wood Pavement
                    Company laid half an inch of asphalt upon the concrete, and formed the lower
                    part of the joint of asphalt and the upper part of a grout of Portland cement
                    and gravel, the advantage claimed being a slightly clastic bed for the blocks
                    and water-tight joints. The blocks have been laid in unset cement over the
                    concrete and rammed to an even surface; but the ramming is liable to split the
                    blocks, and the indentations formed in the cement surface of the foundation have
                    to be removed when the time comes for renewing the blocks. It is now more usual
                    to bed the blocks directly on the concrete, a smooth surface being formed either
                    with the concrete itself or by a floating of cement, and to fill the joints with
                    a grout of cement and gravel. A cement joint adheres to the blocks, resists wet,
                    and does not wear down too much below the surface of the wood, and so form a
                    receptacle for mud. In Henson’s system, which has been largely used, the blocks
                    are bedded and jointed with ordinary roofing felt, a strip of which, cut to a
                    width equal to the depth of the blocks, is placed between every two courses. The
                    joint is made as close as possible by driving up the blocks as every eight or
                    ten courses are laid with heavy mallets,—a plank being laid along the face of
                    the work. A perfectly close and slightly elastic joint is thus formed. A
                    continuous layer of felt is likewise laid over the concrete foundation to give a
                    slightly elastic bed to the blocks. A V-shaped groove along the centre of every
                    fourth block was at first considered necessary for foothold, but its use has
                    been discontinued except on gradients steeper than 1 in 30. The surface of the
                    pavement is dressed over with a hot bituminous compound, and covered with fine
                    clean grit. This method of laying a wood pavement, although somewhat more
                    expensive, is probably the best that has hitherto been devised for smoothness
                    and durability. The blocks are laid in courses across the streets, any change in
                    the direction of the latter being accommodated by shorter courses ending with
                    wedge-shaped blocks. At street junctions the courses are laid diagonally, or
                    meeting at right angles. Two or three courses are laid parallel with the kerb to
                    form a water channel. The blocks may be laid close end to end across the street
                    if some allowance be made for expansion by wet, without which the kerbstones and
                    footways will be displaced, or the courses will be bent in reversed curves. To
                    afford relief the joints of the courses parallel to the kerb may be left open,
                    or the course next the kerb may be left out until expansion has ceased, the
                    space being temporarily filled in with sand. In the direction of the traffic
                    joints more or less wide are generally thought necessary for foothold. A wide
                    joint allows the fibres of the wood to spread and give way at the upper corner
                    of the blocks for want of lateral support, and it also forms a receptacle for
                    mud and wet. Experience has shown that the space of three-fourths of an inch or
                    one inch, once thought necessary for foothold, may safely be reduced to
                    one-fourth or three - eighths of an inch. For spacing the courses to form the
                    joints strips of wood of the proper thickness may be laid in and removed before
                    the joints are filled, or they may be nailed to the lower part of the blocks.
                    Two fillets have been nailed on, or three cast-iron studs fixed in the sides of
                    each block to keep them steady in place until the joints are filled and
                    thoroughly set. The latter method secures more uniformity in the width of the
                    joints.</p>
                <p>There is some difference of opinion as to the best material for a wood pavement.
                    Pitch pine and the harder red and yellow deals are the most durable, but they
                    are less elastic than the softer woods, and are apt to wear slippery. Soft white
                    woods have been recommended for the sake of a more elastic surface; but on the
                    whole either Memel or Swedish yellow deal is generally considered the best
                    material. Whatever wood is used, it should be sound, close-grained, even in
                    quality, free from knots and sap, and from the blue tinge which is a sign of
                    incipient decay. After the blocks are cut, all those that are unsound, knotty,
                    or badly shaped should be carefully rejected, as defective blocks soon cause
                    holes in the surface and must be replaced, or the adjoining blocks will suffer
                    undue wear and the surface become irregular. The breadth of the blocks never now
                    exceeds 4 inches, and it is generally 3, the length being determined by the
                    breadth of the deal or batten from which they are cut. The depth is usually 5 or
                    6 inches; 5 inches are considered by many to be enough to give sufficient depth
                    for as long as the pavement will retain a sufficiently good surface without
                    renewing the wood, and blocks of that depth have been laid in many London
                    streets. It is doubtful if any advantage is derived from creasoting or from
                    dipping the blocks in creasote oil or coal tar. Dipping affords a cover for the
                    use of defective or inferior wood, and thorough creasoting, though it preserves
                    the wood from decay, has little or no influence on the wear, which in almost all
                    cases determines the life of the blocks.</p>
                <p>With a curved cross section like that already described a rise from the mean
                    level of the channels to the crown of the road equal to one-sixtieth or
                    one-seventieth of the width of the carriage-way is enough. The necessary profile
                    must be accurately given to the concrete foundation when wet. Wooden moulds or
                    templates are fixed across the street 10 or 12 feet apart, over which a straight
                    batten is worked to give the concrete the required form and a smooth surface.
                    The moulds are removed when the concrete is partially set and the spaces are
                    made good with cement mortar. In a level street provision should be made in the
                    foundation for a fall in the side channels towards the gullies of not less than
                    1 in 150, and the necessary modifications of cross section at the intersection
                    of streets must also be provided for. Every care should be taken to ensure a
                    good homogeneous concrete for the foundation, as upon that the strength of the
                    road depends. With a well-made Portland cement concrete a thickness of 6 inches
                    is sufficient. It should be allowed to set thoroughly before the blocks are
                    laid, and traffic should not be allowed to pass over it for a week. The finished
                    pavement should be covered with a thin layer of sharp grit, which is forced into
                    the wood by the traffic and forms a hard face. Several applications of grit are
                    desirable at first, and from time to time afterwards, both as a protection to
                    the wood and to prevent slipperiness. Systematic cleansing is required to
                    prevent slipperiness and foul smells, and to preserve the pavement. Cleansing
                    may be aided by washing, and when it is thoroughly carried out but little
                    watering is required to keep down the dust. A wood pavement is the quietest for
                    the residents, pleasant to travel over, and favourable to the wear of vehi les.
                    Traction on it is easy and foothold good, so that it may be laid on gradients as
                    steep as 1 in 20.</p>
                <p>The wear of wood pavements in London is stated by Mr Stayton to be from Ό65 inch
                    per year in Sloane Street, with a traffic of 279 tons per yard of width per day,
                    to '456 inch per year in Fleet Street, with a traffic of 1360 tons per yard of
                    width per day. Reduced to a standard of traffic of 750 tons per yard per day,
                    the comparative annual wear becomes ’ 175 in the former and ‘251 in the latter
                    street. In Parliament Street, Westminster, blocks removed after four years in
                    places where patching was required had lost 1⅛ to 1⅛ inches in thickness, equal
                    to one-third of an inch per year under traffic stated to be 1106 tons per yard
                    of width per day. From information afforded by Mr Haywood it appears that in the
                    City of London under traffic of from 300 to 660 vehicles per yard of width per
                    day of 12 hours the wear is from '2 to ’ 3 inch per year, and that in King
                    William Street, London Bridge, under a traffic of about 1200 vehicles per yard
                    of width in 12 hours the wear was found to be 2 j inches in 3⅛ years in the
                    middle of the road, or ’81 inch per year. This is the heaviest traffic to which
                    wood pavement has been subjected. The wear is generally considered to be as much
                    due to the horses’ feet as to the wheels, and the action of the former is more
                    destructive on steep gradients. Towards the end of the life of the blocks the
                    wear is more rapid than at first. Few’ wood pavements retain a sufficiently good
                    surface after about six years’ wear without extensive repairs, and it is
                    probably not advantageous to lay blocks of a greater depth than will provide for
                    a duration of seven years; 5 inches are almost always sufficient for this.</p>
                <p>Wood pavements of plain blocks on a cement concrete bed are now’ (1885) laid at
                    from 10s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. per square yard, a considerable reduction on the
                    prices paid for patented systems a few years ago. Of the above prices 2s. 3d. to
                    3s. 9d. is the cost of the foundation, which does not require renewal like the
                    blocks. Assuming the average life of the latter to be seven years, Mr Stayton
                    estimates the annual cost of wood paving in Chelsea with a traffic of 500 to 750
                    tons per yard of width per (lay to be Is. 9d. per square yard, which includes
                    the cost of original construction, repairs and renewals, and interest, spread
                    over fifteen years. Cleansing and sanding are estimated to cost 5d. per square
                    yard in addition.</p>
                <p>Asphalt Paving.—Asphalt was first used for street paving in Paris in 1854. It was
                    introduced in London in 1869, when Thread-needle Street was paved by the Val de
                    Travers Asphalt Company,, and since then it has been extensively used for paving
                    both streets and footways. The material is a hard limestone impregnated with
                    bitumen in the proportion of from 6 to 8 per cent, in the Seyssel <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n610/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0610-0587"/>rock, and from 10 to 12 in that from Val de
                    Travers. Asphalts containing less than the former proportion have not sufficient
                    coherence for street pavements, and those containing more than the latter
                    proportion soften from heat in the summer. Asphalt is employed either as a
                    mastic or compressed. The mastic is previously prepared in cakes and is melted
                    for use in caldrons with a small quantity of bitumen, and for a street pavement
                    is thoroughly mixed with sand or grit. It is spread in one thickness on a
                    concrete foundation, covered with sand, and beaten to an even surface. This
                    material has not proved so successful for street surfaces as compressed asphalt.
                    To produce this the rock asphalt, previously reduced to a fine powder by
                    mechanical means, is heated in revolving ovens to from 220° to 2δ0° , spread
                    while still hot, and compressed into a solid mass by hot disk-shaped rammers,
                    and afterwards smoothed with irons heated to a dull redness. The original rock
                    is thus as it were reconstructed by taking advantage of the power of coherence
                    of the molecules under pressure when hot. In heating the powder the moisture
                    combined in the limestone must be driven off without reducing the proportion of
                    the bitumen more than is unavoidable. The powder cools very slowly and may be
                    conveyed long distances from the ovens; it may even be kept till the next day
                    before use. Whên laid it should still retain a temperature of from 150° to 200
                    <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> . It is spread evenly with a rake by skilled
                    workmen for the whole width of the street to a thickness about two-fifths
                    greater than the finished coating is intended to be. Ramming is commenced with
                    light blows to ensure equality of compression throughout and is continued with
                    increased force until the whole is solidified. The ramming follows up the
                    spreading, so that a joint is required only when the work is interrupted at the
                    end of a day, or from some other cause. In a few hours after it has been laid an
                    asphalt pavement may be used for traffic. When finished, its thickness may be
                    from 1⅜ to 2∣ inches, according to the traffic; a greater thickness than the
                    latter cannot be evenly compressed with certainty. The asphalt loses thickness
                    by compression under the traffic for a long time and to the extent, it is said,
                    of one-fifth or one-fourth, but the wear appears to be very small. A pavement in
                    Paris which had lost more than one-fourth of its thickness was found to have
                    lost only 5 per cent, of its weight after sixteen years’ wear. The pavement in
                    Cheapside, after fourteen years under exceptionally heavy traffic, has been
                    reduced, where not repaired, from its original thickness of 2J to about 11
                    inches. The wear-resisting power of the asphalt is due to its elasticity; tracks
                    are made by the wheels at first, but when thoroughly compressed by the traffic
                    the surface retains little or no trace of the heaviest loads. Repairs are easily
                    and quickly made by cutting out defective places and ramming in fresh heated
                    powder, which can be done in the early morning without stopping the traffic. An
                    unyielding foundation is indispensable; it should be of the best Portland cement
                    concrete, 6 inches in thickness, which must be well set and perfectly dry
                    throughout before the asphalt is laid, or the steam generated on the application
                    of the hot powder will prevent coherence and lead to cracks and holes in the
                    asphalt, which quickly enlarge under the traffic. For the same reason the
                    asphalt should be laid in dry weather. The concrete foundation must be carefully
                    formed to the proper profile, with an inclination towards the sides of not more
                    than 1 in 50, which is sufficient with so smooth a surface. About 1 in 50 is the
                    steepest gradient at which an asphalt pavement can be safely laid. When either
                    dry or wet it affords good foothold for horses, but when beginning to get wet,
                    or drying, it is often extremely slippery. This is said to be due to dirt on the
                    surface, and not to the nature of the material. Sand is strewed over the surface
                    to remedy the slipperiness; it tends, however, to wear out the asphalt, and
                    great cleanliness is the best preventive. An asphalt pavement can be kept
                    cleaner than any other, is impervious to moisture, and dries quickly. It is
                    noiseless, except from the clatter of horses’ feet on it; it is the pleasantest
                    pavement to travel upon, but it has the drawback of imperfect foothold and
                    slipperiness at times. The cost of a compressed asphalt pavement 2 to 2⅜ inches
                    thick on a Portland cement concrete foundation 6 inches thick is from 13s. to
                    16s. a square yard, and the maintenance is usually undertaken for a period of
                    seventeen years by the company laying the pavement, the first two years free and
                    at 3d. to Is. 6d. per square yard, according to the traffic, in succeeding
                    years.</p>

                <p>Asphalt paving may be placed between wood and bituminous concrete in the above
                    order. These comparisons show the high cost of a macadamized surface in a street
                    where the traffic is great. However well it may be maintained, a macadamized
                    street must be dirtier and dustier than any pavement, though it is superior to
                    them all in safety and to set pavements in the matter of noise. Bituminous
                    concrete or asphalt macadam is cheaper, cleaner, and quieter than ordinary
                    macadam and is sufficiently durable when the traffic is not heavy. For heavy
                    traffic no pavement is so economical as granite sets; but for the sake of quiet
                    and cleanliness a wood or asphalt pavement is often preferable. Asphalt can be
                    kept cleaner than any other pavement and is the pleasantest to travel over;
                    wood, on the other hand, is quieter for the residents, less slippery, and can be
                    laid on steeper gradients.</p>
                <p>The comparative ease of draught on various surfaces is largely influenced by the
                    amount of foothold afforded, and it may be doubted if dynamometer experiments,
                    however carefully made, are altogether conclusive. The tractive force is
                    influenced by the gradient, the diameter of the wheels, the friction of the
                    wheel axles, and the speed, as well as by the resistance of the road surface,
                    and these must be all taken into account to obtain accurate results. Some recent
                    experiments made, under the direction of Sir J. W. Bazalgette, with Easton and
                    Anderson’s horse dynamometer on London street surfaces gave the following mean

                <p>The gross load was 4 tons, drawn at a speed of from 2 to 6 miles an hour. It is
                    remarkable that the tractive force on asphalt is so high; but the other results
                    are consistent with former experiments by Morin, Macneill and others.</p>
                <p>The comparative safety of granite, wood, and asphalt pavements in the City of
                    London was the subject of careful observations, which were fully reported on by
                    Mr W. Haywood in 1873. The pavements selected were granite sets 3 inches wide,
                    ligno-mineral pavement of beech blocks 3⅛ inches wide, improved wood pavement of
                    fir blocks 3 inches wide, and Val de Travers compressed asphalt pavement. On
                    known lengths of these the traffic, the accidents to horses, the weather, and
                    other circumstances were observed for fifty days, and when the distance
                    traversed was taken into account it was found that as a mean result a horse
                    might be expected to travel 132 miles on granite without falling, 191 on
                    asphalt, and 446 on the improved wood pavement. The condition of the weather had
                    considerable effect: on the granite when dry a horse might be expected to travel
                    78 miles without falling, when damp 168, and when wet 537; on wood when damp 193
                    miles, when wet 432, and when dry 646; on asphalt λvhen damp 125 miles, when wet
                    192, and when dry 223. It thus appeared that wood pavement was less slippery
                    than either granite or asphalt in a marked degree, it being only more slippery
                    than granite when both pavements were wet. About 85 per cent, of the falls on
                    the wood pavement were falls on the knees, which are less likely to injure the
                    horses and are less inconvenient to the traffic than other falls. On the granite
                    the falls were falls on the knees or complete falls in about equal proportions,
                    with about 7 per cent, of falls on the haunches. On the asphalt 43 per cent,
                    were complete falls and 24 per cent, falls on the haunches.</p>
                <p>Watering.—On macadamized roads in Great Britain watering is only good for the
                    road itself when the materials are of a very sili-cious nature and in dry
                    weather. With other materials the effect is to soften the road and increase
                    wear. In and near towns watering is required for the comfort of the inhabitants,
                    but it should not be more than enough to lay the dust without softening the
                    road, and the amount required for this may be greatly reduced by keeping the
                    surface free from mud, and by sweeping oft' the dust when slightly wetted.
                    Pavements are watered to cleanse them as well as to lay the dust, but it must be
                    remembered that both wood and asphalt are more slippery when wet, and that
                    therefore watering should be obviated as far as possible by thorough cleansing.
                    Hydrostatic vans, by improvements in the distributing pipes and regulating
                    valves, water a wide track uniformly with an amount of water which can be
                    regulated at pleasure. Where hydrants exist in connexion with a water supply at
                    high pressure, street watering can be effected by a movable hose and jet, a
                    method much more effective in cleansing the surface, but using a much larger
                    quantity of water. Another method which has been tried, but not much used, is to
                    lay perforated pipes at the back of the kerb on each side of the road, from
                    which jets are thrown upon the surface. The first cost is considerable, and the
                    openings for the jets are liable to choke and get out of order. Deliquescent
                    salts have been used for street watering, by which the surface is kept moist,
                    but at the expense of the moisture in the air. Sea water has the same effect in
                    a less degree.</p>

                <p>Cleansing.—The principal streets of a town are generally cleansed daily, either
                    by hand-sweeping and hand-scraping or by machines. Whitworth’s machine consists
                    of a series of revolving brooms on an endless chain, whereby the mud or dust is
                    swept up an incline into the cart. A less costly and cumbersome machine consists
                    of a revolving brush mounted obliquely, which sweeps a track 6 feet wide and
                    leaves the dust or mud on one side to be gathered up by hand. A horse scraping -
                    machine which delivers the mud at the side is also used, the blades of the
                    scrapers being mounted obliquely and covering a width of 6 feet. For general
                    use, more especially in the country, scraping machines worked by a man from side
                    to side of the road, and scraping a width of about 4 feet, are more
                    convenient.</p>
                <p>All street surfaces suffer from the constant breaking up and disturbance to which
                    they are subjected for the purpose of laying and repairing gas and water pipes.
                    Subways, either under the middle of the road or near the kerbs, in which the
                    pipes may be laid and be always accessible, have often been advocated, and in a
                    few instances have been constructed; but they have not hitherto found general
                    favour.</p>
                <p>Footways.—Gravel is the most suitable material for country or suburban footways;
                    it should be bottomed with a coarser material, well drained, and should be laid
                    with a roller. An inclination towards the kerb of about half an inch in a foot
                    may be given, or the surface may be rounded, to throw off the wet. Where greater
                    cleanliness is desirable and the traffic is not too great a coal-tar concrete
                    similar to that already described, but of smaller materials, makes a good and
                    economical footway. The coating should be 2⅜ or 3 inches thick, composed of two
                    or three layers each well rolled, the lower layer of materials of about 1 j
                    inches gauge, and the upper of a half or a quarter of an inch gauge, with
                    Derbyshire spar, or fine granite chippings over all. Concrete footways require
                    to be carefully made and must be allowed to set thoroughly before they are used.
                    Concrete has a tendency to crack from contraction, especially when in a thin
                    layer, and it is better to lay a footway in sections, with joints at intervals
                    of about 2 yards. Concrete slabs, especially when silicated and constituting
                    artificial stone, make an excellent footway. The material is composed of crushed
                    granite, gravel, or other suitable material, mixed with Portland cement and cast
                    in moulds, and when set saturated with silicate of soda. This paving has proved
                    more durable than York stone flagging, but it is more slippery, especially when
                    made with granite. York stone makes a good and pleasant foot pavement, but is
                    somewhat expensive considering its durability; it is apt to wear unevenly and to
                    scale off when the stone is not of the best quality. It should not be laid of a
                    less thickness than 2 inches; 2⅛ or 3 inches are more usual. The flags should be
                    square jointed, not under-cut at the edges, and should be well bedded and
                    jointed with mortar. Caithness flag is much more durable than York stone and
                    wears more evenly; it is impervious to wet and dries quickly by evaporation. The
                    edges are sawn, and the hardness of the stone renders it difficult to cut it to
                    irregular shapes or to fit openings. Staffordshire blue bricks and bricks made
                    of scoria from iron furnaces are both very durable, though somewhat brittle.
                    Asphalt either laid as mastic or compressed is extensively used for footways;
                    the former is considered inferior in durability to York stone and the latter
                    superior to it. Asphalt should not be laid less than tlireç-fourtlis of an inch
                    thick on 4 inches of cement concrete, and 1 inch of asphalt is desirable where
                    there is great traffic.</p>
                <p>Footways in a street must be retained by a kerbing of granite, York stone,
                    Purbeck, or other stone sufficiently strong to stand the blows from wheels to
                    which it is subjected. It should be at least 4 inches wide and 9 deep and in
                    lengths of not less than 3 feet. A gι∙anite kerb is usually about 12 by 6
                    inches, either placed on edge or laid on the flat. When set on edge a kerb is
                    generally bedded on gravel with a mall; when laid on the flat a concrete bed is
                    desirable.</p>
                <p>In a macadamized street pitched or paved water channels are . required, to
                    prevent the wash of the surface water from undermining the kerb. The pitching
                    consists of cubical blocks of hard stone about 4 inches deep, bedded on sand or
                    mortar, or preferably on a bed of concrete. A paved channel consists of flat
                    stones about 1 foot wide inclining slightly towards the kerb. Moulded bricks and
                    artificial stone are also used both for side channelling and for kerbing. Such
                    an inclination must be given to the channel as will bring the surface water to
                    gullies placed at proper intervals, and the level of the kerbing and
                    consequently of the footway will depend to some extent on the surface drainage
                    as well as on the levels of adjacent houses. To lay out a street satisfactorily
                    the longitudinal and transverse sections must be considered in relation to these
                    matters as well as to the levels of intersecting streets.</p>
