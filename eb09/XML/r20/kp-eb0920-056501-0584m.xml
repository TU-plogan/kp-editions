                <p><label type="entry">RIPARIAN LAWS</label>. By the law of England the property in
                    the bed and water of a tidal river as high as the tide ebbs and flows at a
                    medium spring tide is presumed to be in the crown or a grantee of the crown,
                    generally the lord of a manor, and the bed and water of a non-tidal river are
                    presumed to belong to the person through whose land it flows, or, if it divide
                    two properties, to the riparian proprietors, the rights of each extending to
                    midstream <hi rend="italic">(ad medium fllum aquae).</hi> In order to give
                    riparian rights, the river must flow in a defined channel, or at least above
                    ground. The diminution of underground water collected by percolation does not
                    give a cause of action to the owner of the land in which it collects, though he
                    is entitled to have it unpolluted unless a right of pollution be gained against
                    him by prescription. As a general rule a riparian proprietor, whether on a tidal
                    or a non-tidal river, has full rights of user of his property. The most
                    important limitations of these rights will be found under the headings Fisheries
                    and Navigation Laws. In both these cases the rights of the riparian proprietors
                    are subject to the intervening rights of other persons. These rights vary
                    according as the river is navigable or not, or tidal or not. For instance, all
                    the riparian proprietors might combine to divert a non-navigable river, though
                    one alone could not do so as against the others, but no combination of riparian
                    proprietors could defeat the right of the public to have a navigable river
                    maintained undiverted. It is proposed in this place to consider shortly the
                    rights enjoyed by, and the limitations imposed upon, riparian proprietors, in
                    addition to those falling under the head of fishery or navigation. In these
                    matters English law is in substantial accordance with the law of other
                    countries, most of the rules being deduced from Roman law. Perhaps the main
                    difference is that running water is in Roman law a <hi rend="italic">res
                    communis,</hi> like the air and the sea. In England, owing to the greater value
                    of river water for manufacturing and other purposes, it cannot be said to be
                    common property, even though it may be used for navigation. The effect of this
                    difference is that certain rights, public in Roman law, such as mooring and
                    unloading cargo, bathing and towing, are only acquirable by prescription or
                    custom in England. A hut might lawfully be built on the shore of a tidal river
                    by Roman law; in England such a building would be a mere trespass.</p>
                <p>The principal rights enjoyed by riparian owners as such are the right of increase
                    of property by means of alluvion and the right of use of the water.</p>
                <p>Alluvion is the gradual and imperceptible increase of land by deposit; a sudden
                    and violent changing of the course of a stream by a flood does not change the
                    property. The addition to property <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n585/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0585-0566"/>by alluvion is occasionally of considerable
                    practical importance. In the reign of Charles I. the estate of Lord Berkeley was
                    increased by 300 acres left dry by the Severn. The land was claimed for Vie
                    crown, but judgment was given in favour of Lord Berkeley. If an island be formed
                    in the stream, it belongs to the proprietor to whose land it is nearest; if it
                    be exactly in mid-stream, it belongs to the riparian proprietors equally. The
                    r⅛ht of use of the water of a natural stream cannot be better described than in
                    the words of Lord Kingsdown :—“By the general law applicable to running streams,
                    every riparian proprietor has a right to what may be called the ordinary use of
                    water flowing past his land,—for instance, to the reasonable use of the water
                    for domestic purposes and for his cattle, and this without regard to the effect
                    which such use may have in case of a deficiency upon proprietors lower down the
                    st ream. But, further, he has a right to the use of it for auy purpose, or what
                    may be deemed the extraordinary use of it, provided he does not thereby
                    interfere with the rights of other proprietors, either above or below him.
                    Subject to this condition, he may dam up a stream for the purposes of a mill, or
                    divert the water for the purpose of irrigation. But he has no right to intercept
                    tho regular flow of the stream, if he thereby interferes with the lawful use of
                    the water by other proprietors, and inflicts upon them a sensible injury,”
                    (Miner®. Gilmour, 12 <hi rend="italic">Moore's Privy Council Cases,</hi> 156).
                    The rights of riparian proprietors where the flow of water is artificial rest on
                    a different principle. As the artificial stream is made by a person for his own
                    benefit, any right of another person as a riparian proprietor does not arise at
                    common law, as in the case of a natural stream, but must be established by grant
                    or prescription. The rights of a person nota riparian proprietor who uses land
                    abutting on a river by the licence or grant of the riparian proprietor are not
                    as full as though he were a riparian proprietor, for he cannot be imposed as a
                    riparian proprietor upon the other proprietors without their consent. The effect
                    of this appears to be that he is not entitled to sensibly affect their rights,
                    even by the ordinary as distinguished from the extraordinary use of the
                    water.</p>
                <p>The limitations to which the right of the riparian proprietor is subject may be
                    divided into those existing by common right, those imposed for public purposes,
                    and those established against him by crown grant or by custom or prescription.
                    Under the first head comes the public right of navigation, of anchorage and
                    fishery from boats (in tidal waters), and of taking shell-fish (and probably
                    other fish except royal fish) on the shore of tidal λvaters as far as any right
                    of several fishery does not intervene. Under the second head would fall the
                    right of eminent domain by which the state takes riparian rights for public
                    purposes, compensating the proprietor, the restrictions upon the fishery rights
                    of the proprietor, as by Acts forbidding the taking of fish in close time, and
                    the restrictions on the ground of public health, as by the Rivers Pollution Act,
                    1876. The jurisdiction of the state over rivers in England may be exercised by
                    officers of the crown, as by commissioners of sewers or by the Board of Trade
                    under the Crown Lands Act, 1866. A bridge is erected and supported by the county
                    authorities, and the riparian proprietor must bear any inconvenience resulting
                    from it. An example of an adverse right by crown grant is a Ferry <hi
                    rend="italic">{q.v.)</hi> or a port. The crown, moreover, as the guardian of the
                    realm, has jurisdiction to restrain the removal of the foreshore, the natural
                    barrier of the sea, by its owner in case of apprehended danger to the coast. The
                    rights established against a riparian proprietor by private persons must as a
                    rule be based on prescription or custom, only on prescription where they are in
                    the nature of profits <hi rend="italic">a prendre</hi> (see Prescription). Among
                    such rights are the right to bathe, to land, to discharge cargo, to tow, to dry
                    nets, to beach boats, to take sand, shingle, or water, to have a sea-wall
                    maintained, to pollute the water (subject to the Rivers Pollution Act). In some
                    cases the validity of local riparian customs has been recognized by the
                    legislature. The right to enter on lands adjoining tidal waters for the purpose
                    of watching for and landing herrings, pilchards, and other sea-fish was
                    confirmed to the fishermen of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall by 1 Jac. I. c. 23.
                    The digging of sand on the shore of tidal waters for use as manure on the land
                    was granted to the inhabitants of Devon and Cornwall by 7 Jac. I. c. 18. The
                    public right of taking or killing rabbits in the daytime on any sea bank or
                    river bank in the county of Lincoln, so far as the tide extends, or within one
                    furlong of such bank, was preserved by <hi rend="italic">24 &amp;</hi> 25 Vict.
                    c. 96, § 17. It should be noticed that rights of the public may be subject to
                    private rights. Where the river is navigable, although the right of navigation
                    is common to the subjects of the realm, it may be connected with a right to
                    exclusive access to riparian land, the invasion of which may form the ground for
                    legal proceedings by the riparian proprietor (see Lyon <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    The Fishmongers’ Company, <hi rend="italic">Law Reports—Appeal Cases,</hi> vol.
                    i., 662).</p>
                <p>A freshwater lake appears to be governed by the same law as a non-tidal river.
                    The preponderance of authority is in favour of the right of the riparian
                    proprietors as against the crown.</p>
                <p>Unlawful and malicious injury to sea and river banks, towing paths, sluices,
                    floodgates, milldams, &amp;c., or poisoning fish is a crime under 24 &amp; 25
                    Vict. c. 97.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> The law of Scotland is in general accordance
                    with that of England. One of the principal differences is that in Scotland, if a
                    charter state that the sea is the boundary of a grant, the foreshore is included
                    in the grant, subject to the burden of crown rights for public purposes. Persons
                    engaged in the herring fishery off the coast of Scotland have, by 11 Geo. III.
                    c. 31, the right to use the shore for 100 yards from high-water mark for landing
                    and drying nets, erecting huts, and curing fish. Similar powers were given to
                    those engaged in any white fish fishery by 29 Geo. II. c. 23; but the section of
                    the Act giving these powers was repealed by the Sea Fisheries Act, 1868.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> In the United States the common law’ of
                    England was originally adopted, the State succeeding to the right of the crown.
                    This was no doubt sufficient in the thirteen original States, where rivers of
                    the largest size do not occur, but was not generally followed in later times
                    when it had become obvious that English law was insufficient to meet the case of
                    the vast rivers and lakes of North America. “In Pennsylvania, North Carolina,
                    South Carolina, Iow ’ a, Mississippi, and Alabama, it has been determined that
                    the common law ’ does not prevail, and that the ownership of the bed or soil of
                    all rivers navigable for any useful purpose of trade or agriculture, whether
                    tidal or fresh u <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ater, is in the State” (Bouvier,
                    <hi rend="italic">Law Diet., s.υ.</hi> “River”). The supreme court of the United
                    States in 1857 declared constitutional an Act of Congress of 1845, extending the
                    admiralty jurisdiction of the United States to all public navigable rivers and
                    lakes where commerce is earned on between different States or with foreign
                    nations (The Propeller Genesee Chief <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Fitzhugh, 12 <hi
                    rend="italic">Howard's Reports,</hi> 443). The right of eminent domain has been
                    exercised to a much greater extent than in England in the acquisition of sites
                    for mills under the powers of State legislation in encouragement of trade. Such
                    a course has never been necessary in England (see Angell, <hi rend="italic">Law
                    of Watercourses,</hi> § 478). The law as to subterranean water seems to be still
                    unsettled. Some State decisions have recognized a public right to moor vessels
                    and place cargo on the shore. (J. W+.)</p>
