                    71° 55' W. long., its greatest length from north to south being about 48 miles,
                    and its greatest width from east to west about 35 miles. It is shut in on the
                    east and north by Massachusetts, and on the west by Connecticut, while its
                    southern shores are washed by the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Characteristics.—</hi> The geological formation of the
                    western portion of the State is chiefly that of the Montalban gneiss, which
                    characterizes a great part of southern New England (see geological sketch map of
                    New England, in article New Hampshire, vol. xvii. p. 391), but under the bay and
                    to the east of it is an extensive coal-bearing formation, from which at
                    different times upwards of 750,000 tons of coal have been taken. The only other
                    important deposit is one of magnetic oxide of iron. The climate of Rhode Island,
                    though variable, differs from that of the exposed coast of Massachusetts Bay in
                    the absence of harassing east winds; while the proximity of the southern parts
                    of the State (Newport and vicinity) to the Gulf Stream results in an atmosphere
                    of unusual warmth and moisture, and at the same time comparatively equable. No
                    great extremes, either of heat or of cold, are experienced in the State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The earliest authentic estimate of population
                    is that of 7181 in 1708. The War of Independence (1775-83) had the effect of
                    reducing it from 59,707 in 1774 to 52,347 in 1782. The subsequent United States
                    censuses show steady gains, as follows 1790, 68,825; 1800, 69,122; 1810, 77,031;
                    1820, 83,059; 1830, 97,210; 1840, 108,830; 1850, 147,545; 1860, 174,620; 1870,
                    217,353; 1880, 276,531 (143,501 males, 133,030 females); while a State census in
                    1885 (advance returns) gives 304,419. The census of 1880 showed Rhode Island to
                    be surpassed in aggregate population by all except Colorado, Oregon, Delaware,
                    and Nevada, but in density it was surpassed by none (254'9 per square mile, the
                    average for the whole United States being 13’92). By the same census the number
                    of persons of foreign birth was 73,993, or 26∙8 percent., no State east of Lake
                    Michigan showing <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0543-0524"/>a higher percentage; of these 30,973 (over 41 per
                    cent.) were natives of the United Kingdom or its colonies. About 100,000 of the
                    population are Roman Catholics; ol the remainder, the Baptists (who have been in
                    Rhode Island from its earliest settlement) are most numerous, while the
                    communicants of the Protestant Episcopal church, with the Congrcgationalists and
                    Methodists, have also a large representation.</p>
                <p>Industries.—No portion of the State can be described as exceptionally fertile;
                    and ouly 3 per cent, of the population are engaged in agriculture. The
                    favourable situation of Newport and Providence, at the two extremities of
                    Narragausett Bay, led to the development in the last century of a flourishing
                    trade. This was long ago greatly reduced, and the tonnage of these ports is now
                    chiefly that of a coasting trade. With the final check given to foreign commerce
                    in the war of 1812-14, manufactures gained at once that prominence in the local
                    industries of the State which they have ever since held. The census of 1880
                    returned the total number of persons in Rhode Island engaged in “gainful and
                    reputable” occupations as 116,979, of whom 66,160, or more than 55 per cent.,
                    were classed under the heading “manufactures, mechanics, and mining.” <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mining has long been
                    unrepresented among Rhode Island industries. </p></note> From Samuel Slater’s
                    efforts at Providence and Pawtucket Falls, in 1790-93, may in fact be dated the
                    real development of the cotton manufacturing industry in America, Slater, who
                    had served an apprenticeship in England with a partner of Arkwright, having then
                    been able from memory to set up in Rhode Island the whole set of recently
                    improved spinning machinery. In 1791 only 5858 yards of cotton cloth were made
                    in Providence and vicinity, but in 1810 in Rhode Island 735,319 were made. Two
                    years later, in 1812, there were fifty-three cotton mills within a radius of 30
                    miles of Providence, nearly three-fifths of them being in Rhode Island. The
                    number of cotton mills in Rhode Island was 33 in 1812, 116 in 1S31, and 139 in
                    1870. Owing to the widespread depression in business the number was greatly
                    reduced throughout the country during the next decade, but even in 1880 the
                    number in Rhode Island was surpassed by that of no other State except
                    Massachusetts. According to the census of 1880, the amount of capital invested
                    in the manufacture of cotton goods was $24,609,461; woollen goods $15,410,450;
                    dyeing and finishing textiles, $6,874,254; foundry and machine-shop products,
                    $6,281,707; worsted goods, $6,177,754; jewellery, $5,650,133; slaughtering and
                    meat-packing, $3,876,740; mixed textiles, $2,718,822; rubber and elastic goods,
                    $2,217,000. Thus Rhode Island is second to but one other State—Massachusetts—in
                    its aggregate production of cotton goods; and in the total amount of capital
                    invested in all manufactures it ranks ninth. In each of the five following
                    industries—cotton, woollen, worsted, mixed textiles, and dyeing and finishing—it
                    stands at the head of all the States in amount of production per head of
                    population. In jewellery the yearly product of a single city, Providence,
                    exceeds that of every other city in the country ($5,444,092 in 1880). The same
                    city ranks ninth in the value of its foundry and machine-shop products,
                    $4,522,179; Pawtucket, closely adjoining, adds about $1,600,000.</p>
                <p>Wealth and Finances.—The assessed valuation of the State was—in 1850,
                    $80,508,794; in 1860, $135,337,588; in 1870, $296,965,646; and in 1880, upwards
                    of $420,000,000—a gain of 500 per cent, in thirty years. In aggregate valuation
                    it was surpassed in 1880 by twenty-four States (its population in the same year
                    being exceeded by that of thirty-two States), but in valuation per head it
                    ranked third ($1518’82 in 1880). Notwithstanding the large foreign-born
                    population, the number of persons classed as paupers is very small,—only 553 in
                    1880, as compared with 15,217 in New York. In 1884 thirty-eight savings banks
                    contained deposits to the amount of $51,079,160'66, with 115,752 depositors
                    (more than 40 per cent, of the entire population). The number of other banks in
                    the State was, in 1883, seventy-three, with a capital of $22,330,579’00. The
                    State tax in 1880 amounted to $383,439'23; and in the same year the rate of
                    taxation per head for all purposes ($974) was exceeded only by that of
                    Massachusetts, New York, and California. The debt of the State, held in bonds
                    issued during the war of 1861-65, ’has for the last few years been steadily
                    diminishing. In 1880 it stood at $2,534,500, and in 1884 at $1,372,000.</p>
                <p>Cities and Towns.—The five counties into which Rhode Island is divided contain in
                    all thirty-six towns and cities, of which six lie on the narrow strip bordering
                    the eastern shore of the bay, five on islands in the bay and ocean, and the
                    remaining twenty-five on the mainland, to the west and north-west of the bay. By
                    the State census of 1885 six cities and towns had a population exceeding 10,000
                    :—Providence, 117,607; Pawtucket, 22,873; Newport, 20,339; Lincoln, 17,262;
                    Woonsocket, 16,005; Warwick, 13,281. Only two of these places, Providence and
                    Newport, have hitherto been organized as cities; but a third, Pawtucket (the
                    largest in the country under a town government), is also now (1885) about to be
                    organized under a city charter. The quaint old city of Newport, situated at the
                    southern end of the island (Rhode</p>
                <p>Island) from which the State receives its name, <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The official name of the State is “the State
                    of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.” </p></note> has for many years been
                    nearly stationary as regards the development of its population and industries,
                    but is well known on both sides of the Atlantic for its social attractions. In
                    1880 the “urban” population of Rhode Island constituted 77 per cent, of the
                    total—a percentage surpassed only in the District of Columbia. Yet the growth of
                    manufacturing industries in the State has resulted in building up compact
                    settlements (in not a few instances almost continuous), with little regard to
                    town lines and boundaries. On the Blackstone river are sixteen of these
                    “villages” situated within five different towns; on the Woonas-quatucket river
                    twelve, in four cities and towns; and on the Pawtuxet river and its branches
                    thirty-two, in five towns. In 1875 there were 186 “villages.”</p>
                <p>Education.—It was not until 1828 that the present public school system was
                    established; but, owing largely to the exceptional organizing ability of the
                    first commissioner of public schools, Henry Barnard, a most efficient system was
                    securely built up. From various causes (including the presence of a large
                    foreign-born element), illiteracy is a serious problem in this State, —the
                    percentage unable to write (11’2) being in 1880 higher than in any other
                    Northern State. Imperfect attendance is also a serious difficulty in the
                    mεnufacturing villages. While the number of children registered by the school
                    census of 1880 as of “school age” was 52,273, only 33,504 of these were actually
                    enrolled as pupils in the public schools. Even after counting those who attend
                    private and parochial schools, those " not attending any school” comprise so
                    large a number as 12,279. Under the operation of a newly enacted compulsory law
                    encouraging progress has been made. The public school funds in 1884 amounted to
                    $659,585'50. Educational institutions, other than public, include Brown
                    University, the Friends’ School, and various others at Providence. Brown
                    University was founded in 1764, under the name of Rhode Island College, and was
                    the seventh college established in America.</p>
                <p>Libraries.—The Redwood Library, at Newport, still in existence, incorporated in
                    1747, was the fourth public library founded in New England. The Providence
                    Library was founded only a few years later, and is still perpetuated in the
                    Providence Athenaeum, an admirably conducted shareholders’ library (43,656
                    volumes in 1884). The Brown University Library, founded 1772, had in June 1885
                    more than 62,000 volumes, including several special collections of great rarity
                    and value. There were, moreover, in the same year thirty-two “public libraries”
                    in the State (free to all readers), with a total of about 100,000 volumes. The
                    largest of these (31,650 volumes in 1885) is the Providence Public Library.</p>
                <p>History and Constitution.—The planting of the three scattered and independent
                    settlements (Providence, 1636; Portsmouth, 1638; Newport, 1639) by Roger
                    Williams and others whose views of church polity and doctrine had been found
                    unpalatable to the Massachusetts Puritans, was not in the outset a movement for
                    the establishment of a colony. The need of mutual protection, however, led to
                    their combination; and the first general union of these three towns (together
                    with a fourth, Warwick), was secured in 1647, under the charter of March 14,
                    1643-44. The union effected by this instrument was of the very loosest
                    description, but ιιnder the pressure of causes which threatened the very
                    existence of the colony a new and much more comprehensive charter was obtained
                    in 1663. This extraordinarily liberal instrument constituted the fundamental law
                    of Rhode Island for the next hundred and eighty years, through a succession of
                    remarkable vicissitudes. The charters of Massachusetts and other American
                    colonies were withdrawn in 1686, but the efforts of the royal agent were
                    frustrated in Connecticut and Rhode Island; and in this colony the government
                    was simply committed temporarily to the separate towns which had constituted the
                    colony, the charter government being peacefully resumed three years later, in
                    1689. Rhode Island was hardly free, during the next seventy years, from some
                    form of conflict with the mother country over the question of charter rights;
                    and in the steps which served to precipitate the War of Independence (1775-83),
                    as well as in the war itself, it was among the foremost. In the military
                    operations of this war Nathanael Greene, a Rhode Island officer, ranks easily
                    second to Washington in generalship. Reluctant as Rhode Island was to
                    acknowledge other authority than that of its own colonial charter, even after
                    the close of the war, it did not accede to the constitution of the United States
                    until June 1790, more than a twelvemonth after the new government had gone into
                    operation under Washington as president. Nor did it even then follow the example
                    of the other States in framing a State constitution for the government of its
                    local affairs, but retained its colonial charter of 1663 until almost the middle
                    of the present century. In 1841 and 1842 the dissatisfaction with this mode of
                    government culminated in a series of revolutionary movements; and a convention
                    called by citizens of the State adopted what was known as the “people’s <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n544/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0544-0525"/>Constitution,” under whose provisions it was
                    claimed that Thomas Wilson Dorr was chosen governor. Later in the year 1842 a
                    convention called by the regularly constituted authorities adopted the present
                    constitution, under whose provisions the State government was organized in 1843.
                    The governor (chosen annually) has no veto power. The legislative body, known as
                    the General Assembly, comprises a senate and a house of representatives, each
                    one of the thirty-six cities and towns choosing a single senator. The General
                    Assembly begins its annual sessions in May at Newport, adjourning, after a few
                    days, for a much more extended session at Providence beginning in the following
                    January. The judicial body consists of one supreme court, with subordinate
                    courts for the respective counties, the justices being chosen by vote of the
                    General Assembly. The suffrage is a limited one, a property qualification being
                    required in certain instances. The State is represented in the national Congress
                    by two senators and two representatives. In the quadrennial election of
                    president, Rhode Island has four votes in the “electoral college.” In the Civil
