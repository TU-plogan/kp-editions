                <p><label type="entry">ROLAND</label> Legend of. The main incident of this legend is
                    founded upon an undoubted historical event, —the Spanish expedition of
                    Charlemagne (778). The Frankish king, having crossed the Pyrenees and captured
                    Pamplona, was beaten back from the walls of Saragossa. <note anchored="true"

                    work we gather that at the time of its composition (c. 840) the Roncesvalles
                    disaster was already the subject of popular tradition; for its author, speaking
                    of the Frankish chiefs slain in this battle, says, “quorum, quia vulgata sunt,
                    nomina dicere supersedi.” Yet in its earliest extant form the legend has already
                    worked in the names and traditions of a later age, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    the traitor Ganelon, who probably, as Leibnitz has suggested, represents
                    Wenelon, archbishop of Sens, accused of treason towards Charles the Bald in 859.

                    during the last few years Dümmler <hi rend="italic">(Romania,</hi> ii. 146-148)
                    has discovered what appears to be the epitaph of the above-mentioned Eggihard.
                    This, as G. Paris remarks, renders it highly probable that the similar elegiac
                    verses quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Turpin</hi> (cc. 24, 25), which
                    make Roland thirty-eight years old at the time of his death, are also genuine
                    survivals from the Carolingian era. According to Diimmler’s discovery, the
                    battle of Roncesvalles was fought on 15th August.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Earliest Extant Forms.—</hi> The legend of Roland makes its
                    first appearance in ( <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ) the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Archbishop Turpin</hi> and ( <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chanson de Roland.</hi> The former, according to Paris, may be
                    divided into two parts; of these the first (cc. 1-5), written about 1050, deals
                    with Charlemagne’s conquest of Spain, but contains no allusion to Roland. The
                    latter section, written by a monk of Vienne between 1109 and 1119, gives the
                    main outlines of the familiar legend: Marsilius and Baligant appear (c. 21);
                    Roland fights with the giant Ferracute, Ariosto’s Ferraiι <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Orl. Fur.,</hi> c. 1); then follow the narrative of Ganelon’s treachery (c.
                    21) and punishment (c. 26), the episode of Roland’s horn, Roland’s address to
                    his sword (c. 22), his last prayer, his death (c. 23), and Charles’s vengeance
                    on the Saracens (c. 26). <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="italic">Chanson de Roland,</hi> in its extant version probably composed in
                    England between 1066 and 1095, looks like the expansion of an earlier poem
                    written towards the beginning of the same century.</p>
                <p>It gives the legend in much the same form as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pseudo-Turpin,</hi> but with far more detail and poetic fire. There are,
                    however, a few striking differences between the two accounts. Such deal with the
                    causes and method of Ganelon’s treachery, the personality of Baldwin, and the
                    fate of Archbishop Turpin. Above all, the Latin prose-writer has no second hero
                    in Oliver and knows nothing of Roland’s love for Aude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Additions to the Early Legend.—</hi> The name of Roland was
                    soon transplanted from its native soil in the <hi rend="italic">gestes</hi> of
                    Roncesvalles into almost the whole cycle of later Charlemagne romance; and by
                    weaving these notices of him together we may construct the legendary story of
                    his life. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Enfances Roland</hi> (c. 1200) tells of his
                    parents’ disgrace and his infant valour; in the <hi rend="italic">Chanson
                    diAsρremont</hi> (late 12th century) we read how he became possessed of his
                    famous sword Durendal; <hi rend="italic">Girars de Viane</hi> (c. 1200) recounts
                    his great fight with Oliver and his love for that hero’s sister Aude. Roland
                    plays scarce less prominent a part in <hi rend="italic">Renaud de Montauban</hi>
                    (13th century) and figures in <hi rend="italic">Fierabras</hi> (12th century),
                    <hi rend="italic">Οtinel</hi> (c. 1250), and the <hi rend="italic">Voyage à
                    Jerusalem</hi> (c. 1130). Nicholas of Padua’s <hi rend="italic">Entrée en
                    Espagne</hi> (c. 1320) makes Roland quarrel with Charles and fly to Persia,
                    whence he only returns to aid in the siege of Pamplona and to perish at
                    Roncesvalles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diffusion of the Roland Legend in Literature.—</hi> The immense
                    popularity of the <hi rend="italic">Chanson de Roland</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pseudo-Turpin</hi> may be measured by the influence they have
                    exercised on the literature of nearly every country of western Europe. To the
                    original <hi rend="italic">Chanson de Roland</hi> a poet of perhaps the reign of
                    Philip Augustus added a new ending of some 2000 lines. From this full version
                    are descended the <hi rend="italic">Remaniements</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Roneevaux,</hi> of which so many French MSS. remain. During the 12th century a
                    Swabian priest, Conrad, translated the <hi rend="italic">Chanson</hi> into
                    rhymed German verse. This <hi rend="italic">Rοlandslied</hi> forms the basis of
                    the Stricker’s <hi rend="italic">Karl</hi> (c. 1230), in its turn the foundation
                    for the Roncesvalles section of the so-called <hi rend="italic">Karl Meinet</hi>
                    (early 14th century). In England Taillefer’s singing of a “cantilena Rollandi”
                    prefaced the first Norman charge at Hastings; <note anchored="true"

                    curiously enough, the English <hi rend="italic">Roland</hi> of the 14th century
                    in some places seems to look back for its original to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pseudo-Turpin</hi> rather than to the <hi rend="italic">Chanson de Roland,</hi>
                    which received its final shape in England. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Still more applicable is this remark to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Roland and Vernagou</hi> (c. 1330), and the death of Roland in Caxton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Charles the Grete.</hi> All three works have been edited for the
                    Early English Text Society by Mr Herrtage. </p></note> It was probably from that
                    country that the Roland legend passed to Scandinavia and Iceland. There the
                    battle of Roncesvalles forms the eighth section of the great <hi rend="italic"
                    >Karlamagnu,s Saga</hi> (13th century), which is of critical importance, as it
                    preserves some details not to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Chanson de
                    Roland</hi> as we now have it. Translated into Danish, this work took the form
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Kejser Karl Magnus</hi> (15th century), to this day a
                    popular book in Denmark. The legend penetrated eastward into Hungary and
                    Bohemia; while in the west Roland appears in the Welsh <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mabinogion</hi> and the tales of Ireland. M. Bormans has published Flemish
                    fragments of the Roncesvalles story; and these, which belong to the 13th and the
                    14th century, are based on the <hi rend="italic">Chanson.</hi> In the 16th
                    century the same legend circulated throughout the Low Countries in one of the
                    most popular books of the day. In the 13th century the Spanish “fabulae
                    histrionum,” of which Roderic of Toledo speaks (d. 1247), and which may, on one
                    hypothesis, have been the sources whence the Pseudo-Turpin drew his materials,
                    gave way to a new and more patriotic legend, in which Bernard del Carpio takes
                    the leading place; but three centuries later (1528) Nicolas di Piamonte revived
                    the purer Frankish tradition in the still popular <hi rend="italic">Karlo
                    Magna</hi></p>
                <p>It is, however, on the literature of Italy that the Roland legend has exercised
                    its widest influence. Here the songs, chanted by the early French jongleurs,
                    towards the end of the 12th century made place for the Italianized <hi
                    rend="italic">Remaniements,</hi> till the epoch of Nicholas of Padua (c. 1320),
                    whose gigantic <hi rend="italic">Entrée en Espagne</hi> (with its supplement the
                    <hi rend="italic">Prise de PampehΜe),</hi> though but a mosaic of earlier
                    materials, formed the groundwork of the Tuscan poem, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spagna</hi> (1350-1380), on which the <hi rend="italic">Rotta di
                    Roncievalle</hi> in its turn is founded. Somewhat later than the verse <hi
                    rend="italic">Spagna</hi> came the <hi rend="italic">Spagna</hi> in prose; and
                    the extraordinary popularity of the legend in its new guise made the names of
                    Charlemagne’s paladins familiar down to the age of the Renaissance. We have now
                    reached the era of the great Italian poets Pulci <hi rend="italic">{Morgante
                    Maggiore,</hi> 1481), Boiardo <hi rend="italic">{Orlando InnΜmorato,</hi> 1486),
                    Ariosto <hi rend="italic">{Orlando Furioso,</hi> 1516), and Berni (1541), whose
                    poems, however, with the exception of Pulci’s, are indebted to those of their
                    predecessors for little more than the names of their chief characters and their
                    general plan.</p>

                    the abbey church of St Denis. M. Vétault <hi rend="italic">(Hist. de Ch.,</hi>
                    p. 496) has also figured a Carolingian coin which bears the names of both Roland
                    and Charles. The so-called Roland statues of Germany are most probably
                    symbolical of the judicial and other rights once possessed by the people of
                    those towns where they are to be found. In some cases at least the name seems to
                    have been transferred to what were originally meant to be representations of the
                    first Othos (10th century). The earliest known allusion to a “statua Rolandi”
                    under this name occurs in a privilegium granted by Henry V. to the town of
                    Bremen (1111). The word “Rolandssäule” is perhaps a piece of folk-etymology for
                    an earlier “Rothland-säule” or red-land-pillar, i.e., the before-mentioned
                    figure or pillar, which signified that the state in which it stood had the power
                    of life and death,—in other words, was a Blutgerichtstätte. Grimm suspects a
                    connexion between the Roland statues and those old Teutonic pillars of which the
                    Irminsul destroyed by Charlemagne is the best-known example. <note

                    see Grimm’s <hi rend="italic">Teut. Myth.</hi> (Stally-brass), i. 119.
                    </p></note> These Roland statues are sometimes in the open air, as at Bremen and
                    Magdeburg; or against the town-house, as at Halberstadt; or in the church, as
                    formerly at Göttingen. Sometimes they ride on horseback, as at Haldensleben near
                    Magdeburg; but more generally they are to be found standing upright. They always
                    bear a sword in their right hand and very frequently a shield in their left.
                    They are usually armoured, as at Magdeburg, but are occasionally dressed in more
                    peaceful robes, as at Halle (on the Saale), or both cloaked and armoured, as at
                    Wedel in Holstein and at Bremen. Sometimes they are crowned, as at Wedel and
                    Nordhausen. The heads of the statues differ extremely,—being long-bearded at
                    Erfurt, short-bearded at Wedel, and absolutely smooth-faced at Bremen. At
                    Brandenburg the Roland was ornamented with silver and perhaps with gold. The
                    statues are often of colossal height, that of Belgern (Merseburg) being over 9
                    ells high, exclusive of its pedestal. Perhaps the most famous Roland pillar
                    still remaining is that of Bremen.</p>
