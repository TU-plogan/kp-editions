                <p><label type="entry">RAIL</label> (German <hi rend="italic">Balle,</hi> French <hi
                    rend="italic">Bâle,</hi> Low Latin <hi rend="italic">Ballus),</hi> originally
                    the English name of two birds, distinguished from one another by a prefix as
                    Land-Rail and Water-Rail, but latterly applied in a much wider sense to all the
                    species which are included in the Family <hi rend="italic">Ballidae</hi> of
                    Ornithology.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Land-Rail,</hi> also very commonly known as the
                    Corn-Crake, and sometimes as the Daker-Hen, is the <hi rend="italic">Ballus
                    crex</hi> of Linnaeus and <hi rend="italic">Crex pratensis</hi> of recent
                    authors. Its monotonous grating cry, which has given it its common name in
                    several languages, is a familiar sound throughout the summer nights in many
                    parts of the British Islands; but the bird at that season very seldom shews
                    itself, except when the mower lays bare its nest, the owner of which, if it
                    escape beheading by the scythe, may be seen for an instant before it disappears
                    into the friendly covert of the still standing grass. In early autumn the
                    partridge-shooter not unfrequently flushes it from a clover-field or tangled
                    hedgerow; and, as it rises with apparent labour and slowly flies away to drop
                    into the next place of concealment, if it fall not to his gun, he wonders how so
                    weak-winged a creature can ever make its way to the shores if not to the
                    interior of Africa, whither it is almost certainly bound; for, with
                    comparatively few individual exceptions, the Land-Rail is essentially
                    migratory—nay more than that, it is the <hi rend="italic">Ortygometra</hi> of
                    classical authors —supposed by them to lead the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quail</hi><hi rend="italic">(supra,</hi> p. 146) on its voyages—and in the
                    course of its wanderings has now been known to reach the coast of Greenland, and
                    several times that of North America, to say nothing of Bermuda, in every
                    instance we may believe as a straggler from Europe or Barbary. The Land-Rail
                    needs but a brief description. It looks about as big as a Partridge, but on
                    examination its appearance is found to be very deceptive, and it will hardly
                    ever weigh more than half as much. The plumage above is of a tawny brown, the
                    feathers being longitudinally streaked with blackish brown; beneath it is of a
                    yellowish white; but the flanks are of a light chestnut. The species is very
                    locally distributed, and in a way for which there is at present no accounting.
                    In some dry upland and corn-growing districts it is plentiful; in others, of
                    apparently the same character, it but rarely occurs; and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n240/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0240-0223"/>the same may be said in regard to low-lying marshy
                    meadows, in most of which it is in season always to be heard, while in others
                    having a close resemblance to them it is never met with. The nest is on the
                    ground, generally in long grass, and therein from nine to eleven eggs are
                    commonly laid. These are of a cream-colour, spotted and blotched with light red
                    and grey. The young when hatched are thickly clothed with black down, as is the
                    case in nearly all species of the Family.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Water-Rail,</hi> locally known as the Skiddy or
                    Bill-cock, is the <hi rend="italic">Ballus aquaticus</hi> of Ornithology, and
                    seems to be less abundant than the preceding, though that is in some measure due
                    to its frequenting places into which from their swampy nature men do not often
                    intrude. Having a general resemblance to the Land-Rail, <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Formerly it seems to have been a popular
                    belief in England that the Land-Rail in autumn transformed itself into a
                    Water-Rail, resuming its own characters in spring. The writer has met with
                    several persons who had serious doubts on the subject! </p></note> it can be in
                    a moment distinguished by its partly red and much longer bill, and the darker
                    coloration of its plumage—the upper parts being of an olive brown with black
                    streaks, the breast and belly of a sooty grey, and the flanks dull black barred
                    with white. Its geographical distribution is very wide, extending from Iceland
                    (where it is said to preserve its existence during winter by resorting to the
                    hot springs) to China; and though it inhabits Northern India, Lower Egypt, and
                    Barbary, it seems not to pass beyond the tropical line. It never affects upland
                    districts as does the Land-Rail, but always haunts wet marshes or the close
                    vicinity of water. Its love-note is a loud and harsh cry, not continually
                    repeated as is that of the Land-Rail, but uttered at considerable intervals and
                    so suddenly as to have been termed “explosive.” Besides this, which is peculiar
                    to the cock-bird, it has a croaking call that is frog-like. The eggs resemble
                    those of the preceding, but are more brightly and delicately tinted.</p>
                <p>The various species of Rails, whether allied to the former or latter of those
                    just mentioned, are far too numerous to be here noticed. Hardly any part of the
                    world is without a representative of the genera <hi rend="italic">Crex</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Rallus,</hi> and every considerable country has one or perhaps
                    more of each—though it has been the habit of systematists to refer them to many
                    other genera, the characters of which are with difficulty found. Thus in Europe
                    alone three other species allied to <hi rend="italic">Crex pratensis</hi> occur
                    more or less abundantly; but one of them, the Spotted Rail or Crake, has been
                    made the type of a so-called genus <hi rend="italic">Porzana,</hi> and the other
                    two, little birds not much bigger than Larks, are considered to form a genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Zctpornia.</hi> The first of these, which used not to be uncommon
                    in the eastern part of England, has a very near representative in the Carolina
                    Rail or Sora, <hi rend="italic">Crex Carolina, of</hi> North America, often
                    there miscalled the Ortolan, just as its European analogue, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    porzana,</hi> is in England often termed the Dotterel. But, passing over these
                    as well as some belonging to genera that can be much better defined, and other
                    still more interesting forms of the Family, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphanapteryx</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds, vol. iii. p. 733), Coot (vol. vi.
                    p. 341), Moor-Hen (vol. xvi. p. 808), and Ocydrome (vol. xvii. p. 722), a few
                    words must be said of the more distant group formed by the
                    South-American</hi><hi rend="italic">Hcliornis,</hi> and the African and Indian
                    <hi rend="italic">Podica,</hi> comprising four or five species, to which the
                    name ‘ ‘ Finfoots” has been applied — from the lobes or flaps of skin that
                    fringe their toes. Though for a long while placed among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poclicipcdidie</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Grebe, vol. xi. p. 79), their
                    osteology no less than their habits appear to indicate their alliance with the
                    Rails, if they be not members of the Family</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ralliclae</hi>; but they seem to shew the extreme modification of that type in
                    adaptation to aquatic life. Then again the curious genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mesites</hi> of Madagascar, whose systematic place has been so long in doubt,
                    has been referred by Prof. Alph. Milne-Edwards (rt?i?i. <hi rend="italic">Sc.
                    Naturclle,</hi> ser. 6, vii. art. 2) to the neighbourhood of the Rails, though
                    offering some points of resemblance to the Herons. On the other hand the Jacanas
                    (vol. xiii. p. 531) or <hi rend="italic">Parridse,</hi> which from their long
                    toes were once thought to belong to the Rails, are now generally admitted to be
                    Limicoline, while the genus <hi rend="italic">Aramus</hi> —the Courlan or
                    Limpkin of the Southern United States—still occupies a very undetermined
                    position. On the whole the <hi rend="italic">Rallidae</hi> constitute a group of
                    birds which, particularly as regards their relations to some other remarkable
                    forms, of which the Sun-Bittern, <hi rend="italic">Eurypyga,</hi> and Kagu, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhinochetus,</hi> may especially be named, well deserve greater
                    attention from the systematist, and any ornithologist in want of a subject could
                    hardly find one more likely to reward his labours if he were only to carry them
                    out in a judicious way. Based on the safe ground of anatomy, but due regard
                    being also had to the external characters, habits, and other peculiarities of
                    this multifarious group, a monograph might be produced of surpassing interest,
                    and one that in its bearings on the doctrine of evolution would be likely to
                    prove a telling record. (A. N.)</p>
