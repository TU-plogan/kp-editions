                            hardly have been his father’s brother on account of the dates.

                    on 21st December. John Rennell, who had married Ann Clark in 1738, seems to have
                    fallen into embarrassed circumstances, and to have taken service in the
                    artillery, with which he served in the duke of Cumberland’s campaign in Flanders
                    of 1747-48. The date of his death is uncertain, but he appears never to have
                    rejoined his family. As a boy the son James found a valuable friend in the then
                    vicar of Chudleigh, Gilbert Burrington, by whose advice and assistance he
                    entered the navy in the beginning of 1756. Throughout his Indian career Rennell
                    kept up a regular correspondence with Mr Burrington, and always regarded him
                    with affection and gratitude.</p>
                <p>The earliest of Rennell’s existing letters show him, in March 1758, as an acting
                    midshipman on board the “Brilliant,” 36, Captain Parker, afterwards the famous
                    Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, the elder of two of that name. When attached to the
                    “Brilliant” James Rennell was present at several of those desultory expeditions
                    against the French coast and shipping on which so much strength was squandered
                    in the wars with France. Among these was a landing directed against the works
                    and ships at Cherbourg (August 1758), and two other expeditions to the vicinity
                    of St Malo, which were more futile, and the last of which ended somewhat
                    disastrously. A MS. plan of the Bay of St Cast, where the x־e-embarkation took
                    place (September 11, 1758), executed by James Rennell at the age of sixteen, and
                    probably his first attempt at topographical work, is now before us. It bears the
                    inscription “Plan of St Cas Bay, J.· Rennel feet. 1758. To the Rt. Honble. Lord
                    Howe this plan is dedicated by his obedient humble servant, J. Rennel.” <note

                            indifferently Rennel and Rennell till February 2, 1760, when he says to
                            Mr Burrington :—“You desired that in future I would write my name with a
                            double <hi rend="italic">l.</hi> I shall in the future, but am inclined
                            to think it will be of little use to me.” There is, we believe, here
                            some reference to the clerical relations, whom he at that time thought
                            neglectful. </p></note></p>
                <p>In 1760 Captain Parker, leaving the “Brilliant,” took the “Norfolk” to India, and
                    Rennell was to have gone with him, but through some accident missed his ship and
                    went out in the “America,” 50, Captain Haldane. On reaching India he rejoined
                    Captain Parker, now in command of the “Grafton,” 58, with the fleet engaged in
                    the blockade of Pondicherry, which Coote was besieging on the landward side.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi> for 1830, in a sketch of Rennell’s
                    career, gives an anecdote for which we cannot vouch, finding no allusion to it
                    in his letters. It is to the effect that, some sloops of war belonging to the
                    enemy being moored in shallow water, Rennell asked the use of a boat.
                    Accompanied by one sailor he reconnoitred the sloops, and ascertained what he
                    had surmised to be true, viz., that owing to an unusually high tide it was
                    possible to reach those vessels. This information was acted on with complete
                    success. Whatever amount of truth there may be in this anecdote, we know, at
                    least, from his letters that he took part in the cutting out of the “Baleine”
                    and “Hermione,” the former a 40-gun frigate, the latter an armed Indiaman, both
                    at anchor before Pondicherry, within a half musket-shot of the place, and that
                    he was a volunteer in one of the boat divisions which attacked the “Baleine.”
                    This vessel had no sails bent, and the captors, being exposed for an hour to a
                    very heavy fire from the ramparts, lost severely.</p>
                <p>We do not know what good guidance had first turned the lad’s attention to
                    surveying, but his letters show that he went to India provided with useful books
                    and instruments, and they contain from time to time notices of various surveys
                    executed by him, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of the harbour of Trinconomal¿ (or
                    Trincomalee, as we now call it), and of the bay and roads of Diego Rayes, <note

                            its size and position this is evidently the island now called Rodriguez,
                            about 350 miles north-east of Mauritius. </p></note> whither the East
                    Indian fleet had gone as the rendezvous of an intended attack on Mauritius,
                    which did not come off.</p>
                <p>Captain Parker appears to have been friendly to Rennell, but had little hope of
                    obtaining promotion in the navy for him, and counselled him to try his fortune
                    in the Company’s service. Rennell acquiesced, and in the summer of 1762 went,
                    apparently as a surveyor, on board a Company’s vessel which was despatched on a
                    reconnaissance to Manila and the neighbouring islands. The only trace we have
                    been able to find of this voyage consists in sundry charts and coast-views
                    published by Alexander Dalrymple, a friend of Rennell’s in after days. Such are
                    the Bay of Camorta in the Nicobar Islands, 1762; View of Quedah; Chart of
                    Sambeelan Islands in the Straits of Malacca, 1763; View of Malacca, July, 1762;
                    Chart of Abai Harbour, on north-west of Borneo, 1762.</p>
                <p>Of the expedition we have no particulars, but we gather that Rennell looked back
                    on his treatment and service on board with dissatisfaction, though his
                    performance of the duties assigned him recommended him as a man of merit to the
                    authorities at Fort St George. He had missed a great chance in the navy, for
                    during his absence orders came for the expedition against Manila, which ended in
                    the capture of that place in 1762,—an expedition in which Captain Parker took
                    the “Santissima Trinidad,” a prize of enormous value. Rennell, however, made
                    many friends at Madras, and had several offers of employment, though he did not
                    think himself at liberty to accept any till the return of Captain Parker and his
                    final discharge from the “Grafton’s” books (July 1763). He now obtained the
                    command of a vessel in the Government service, but whilst she lay off Madras,
                    shortly afterwards, a cyclone destroyed every ship save one in the roads, and
                    Rennell’s among them. Fortunately he was on shore when the gale came on; but he
                    lost everything.</p>
                <p>The city of Madura was then being besieged by a British force in combination with
                    one sent by the nawab of the Carnatic; and Mr Palk, governor of Fort St George,
                    employed Rennell <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                            siege of Madura belongs to an obscure passage of Indian history, an
                            account of which must be sought in Nelson’s <hi rend="italic">Manual of
                                Madura</hi> (Madras, 1868), and Bishop Caldwell’s <hi rend="italic"

                            man of great ability, who had been “commander of all the Company’s
                            sepoys” (at Madras), and afterwards governor of Madura for the nawab and
                            the Company, threw off his allegiance in the beginning of 1763. A joint
                            expedition was sent against him, and for a long time had indifferent
                            success. Eventually Marchand, the chief of a French contingent in Yusufs
                            service, betrayed him to the English commandant, and in the latter part
                            of 1764 it is said that he was hanged, whether by order of the Fort St

                    Calymere, and of the Paumben Passage. Shortly afterwards, having gone to
                    Calcutta, he found in Captain Tinker, the officer commanding the king’s squadron
                    there, a gentleman with whom he had been slightly acquainted in the navy. There
                    was evidently something very engaging in Rennell’s manner, aspect, and
                    character, for others as well as Captain Tinker immediately endeavoured to
                    interest in his fortunes the governor of the presidency. This was Henry
                    Vansittart, the successor of Clive, and father of Nicolas Vansittart, who was so
                    long chancellor of the exchequer (1812-1823), and died Lord Bexley. The result
                    was the appointment of Rennell as surveyor of the E. I. Company’s dominions in
                    Bengal,</p>
                <p>“before,” as he writes, “I was scarcely apprised of the matter.” A few days later
                    he received a commission “for practitioner engineer in the citadel erecting at
                    Calcutta near Fort William”— the fortress, in fact, now so well known by the
                    latter name.</p>
                <p>Rennell, in a letter announcing his appointment, calls it that of
                    “surveyor-general,” but this term is not used in the official record, dated
                    April 9, 1764. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Extract
                            from <hi rend="italic">Bengal Public Consultations</hi> of that date

                            it is agreed to appoint Mr James Renall <hi rend="italic">(sic)</hi> in
                            his room, who is recommended to us as a capable person, and by specimens
                            of some surveys made by him which the President now lays before the
                            Board, promises to be a very useful servant.” </p></note> The date of
                    his commission in the corps of engineers, as ensign (or “practitioner engineer,”
                    as the junior rank was termed), is the same. The corps of Bengal Engineers,
                    which after a creditable existence of just about a century was amalgamated with
                    the Royal Engineers in 1862, was then in its infancy. Only four officers appear
                    as having had commissions earlier than James Rennell, though the subsequent
                    introduction of several officers with higher rank eventually placed more than
                    this number over his head.</p>
                <p>Practically, though he was sometimes engaged in works of construction or
                    demolition, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One of his
                            exceptional employments (July 1768) was the demolition of fortifications
                            round Chandernagore, which the French had commenced “expressly contrary
                            to the treaty of Paris.” </p></note> Rennell’s־work as a surveyor
                    occupied the whole of his Indian service, which extended to thirteen years only.
                    In the course of this employment he reduced to order and substantial accurac}'
                    the map of Bengal, and accumulated a great part of the material which he
                    afterwards utilized in the determination of all the important points embraced in
                    the first approximately correct map of India. His merits were highly
                    appreciated, and his rise was rapid. In January 1767 his position was raised to
                    that of surveyor-general, and at the same time he was promoted to captain.</p>
                <p>In their letter to the court of directors, reporting this promotion, the council
                    at Fort William say :—</p>
                <p>“We have appointed Captain Rennell, a young man of distinguished merit in this
                    branch, surveyor-general, and directed him to form one general chart from those
                    already made, and such as are now on hand, as they can be-collected in. This,
                    though attended with great labour, does not prevent his prosecuting his own
                    surveys, the fatigue of which, with the desperate wounds he has lately received
                    in one of them, have already left him but a shattered constitution.’’ <note

                <p>This passage refers to a memorable passage in Rennell’s career, which had nearly
                    proved its tragical termination. Bengal proper was in those early days of the
                    Company’s administration very far from being the tranquil country that we have
                    known it for so many years (except indeed during its partial share in the
                    agitations of 1857, from the mutiny of several regiments within its boundaries).
                    And it was about a year before the promotion just mentioned that Rennell, on one
                    of his surveying campaigns in northern Bengal, met with the adventure in
                    question.</p>
                <p>The districts in that quarter (Purniah, Dinajpur, Rangpur, &amp;c.) were at that
                    time habitually ravaged by bodies of marauders, who had their headquarters in
                    the forest-tracts at the foot of the Himalayas, and beyond British jurisdiction.
                    From these forests they used to issue annually in large bands, plundering and
                    levying exactions far and wide, and returning to their jungle-asylum when
                    threatened with pursuit. A few years before (1763) a large body of them had
                    plundered the city of Dacca. They professed to belong to a religious fraternity
                    and were commonly known as the <hi rend="italic">Sanyasis,</hi> a name under
                    which they are frequently mentioned in the correspondence of Warren Hastings,
                    sometimes as <hi rend="italic">Fakirs.</hi> The affair took place in the
                    semi-independent state of Kucli Behar, near the border of Bhutan. Hearing that a
                    party of native soldiers had been sent to put down one of those bands, which had
                    just taken and plundered the capital of the state, Rennell hastened to join the
                    detachment with his own small escort, and came up with it just after the
                    banditti had received a beating. The next day (21st February 1766) was spent in
                    pursuit of the enemy, and in the afternoon Rennell and two other officers, who
                    had gone forward to reconnoiti’e, found themselves in presence of a large body
                    of the Sanyasis. Their small escort of native horse rode off, and the officers
                    were surrounded. Rennell’s Armenian assistant was killed, his engineer subaltern
                    fought his way clear with a slight wound,</p>
                <p>Rennell himself retreated fighting to the detachment, and was put in a palankin,
                    covered with sabre-wounds. One blow had cut into his right shoulder blade and
                    through several ribs; his left arm was severely cut in three places, and he had
                    other wounds besides. For surgical help lie had to be sent to Dacca, 300 miles
                    off, in an open boat, which he had to direct himself, as he lay on his face,
                    whilst the natives applied onions as a cataplasm to his shoulder. He was long
                    given up, but, under the tender care of his friend Dr Russell, he recovered,
                    though his health was long affected by the loss of blood and severity of the
                    injuries.</p>
                <p>On two later occasions Rennell’s letters speak of his being attacked or waylaid
                    whilst on survey, in one case by irregulars in the employment of the
                    “jemitdars,” <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi> ., “zemindars,” in districts remote
                    from Calcutta, and on another occasion by the “Bootese,” or Bhutias, as we now
                    call them. In a letter dated 30th October 1770 he says in his brief way :—</p>
                <p>“I must not forget to tell you that about a month ago a large leopard jumped at
                    me, and I was fortunate enough to kill him by thrusting my bayonet down his
                    throat. Five of. my men were wounded by him, tour of them very dangerously. You
                    see 1 am a lucky fellow at all times.”</p>
                <p>We gather from this passage that it was common in those days for officers to
                    carry bayonets,—a circumstance which is also set forth in one of the best known
                    portraits of General Wolfe.</p>
                <p>Shortly after this last adventure Rennell was allowed to carry out, with a force
                    under his command, a project that he had formed for the suppression of the
                    banditti in the north. Writing on the 3d March 1771, he speaks of having
                    returned successful from this expedition, after marching 320 miles in fifteen
                    days, which he justly observes was “pretty good travelling in that climate,
                    especially for soldiers.” This did not, however, put an end to the Sanyasis, for
                    they are spoken of by Hastings as still a pest in 1773 and 1774.</p>
                <p>Rennell’s usual residence was at Dacca, though his visits to Calcutta were at
                    least annual. On one of these he married (October 15, 1772) Miss Jane Thackeray,
                    one of the sixteen children of Archdeacon Thackeray, who had been headmaster of
                    Harrow from 1746 to his death in 1760, and who has been called by Dr Butler the
                    “second founder” of the school.Among Dr Thackeray’s descendants are to be
                    counted many distinguished Anglo-Indians; and William Makepeace Thackeray of the
                    Civil Service, the grandfather of the great writer who has made that combination
                    of names familiar and illustrious, was a friend of IIennell’s and the brother of
                    his wife.</p>
                <p>Indian careers were not in those days generally prolonged. Fortunes were reaped
                    more rapidly than in later years, and death likewise mowed with swifter strokes.
                    In the list of Bengal engineers there are thirteen, including Rennell, who
                    received commissions prior to 1770, the earliest in 1761. Of these thirteen,
                    before 1780, six were dead, four had resigned, one had been dismissed, and two
                    only in the year named remained in the service.</p>
                <p>Rennell’s health had been remarkably good up to his encounter with the Sanyasis,
                    but from that time it became permanently deteriorated, and in 1777 he resigned,
                    having attained the rank of major two years earlier (January 1775). In those
                    days no regular pension-system existed; but, when permission for Rennell’s
                    retirement was given, in December 1776, by the governor and council, it was
                    accompanied by the grant of a pension of 500 rupees a month from the Calcutta
                    treasury, till the court’s pleasure should be known. In passing this resolution
                    the board remark that they “think fit to adopt this mode as most satisfactory to
                    Major Rennell, whose fortune will not permit him to leave India without some
                    certainty of support in the decline of life.” <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Rennell, in announcing his marriage to Mr
                            Burlington, speaks of his wife as the “daughter of the late Mr Thackeray
                            who kept Harrow School.” </p></note> It is impossible, in reading this
                    last phrase, to withhold a smile at the proverbial longevity of pensioners, when
                    we remember that the illustrious subject of the resolution drew the allowance
                    for fifty-three years after his retirement. The court of directors, after his
                    arrival in England, conferred a pension of £600 a year in lieu of the Calcutta
                    one.</p>
                <p>Major Rennell and his wife, with a daughter born at St Helena during a stoppage
                    on the way home, reached England, 12th February 1778. For the rest of his long
                    life he lived in London, and for much the greater part of the time in Nassau
                    Street (formerly called Suffolk Street) near the Middlesex Hospital, a quarter
                    then inhabited by gentlefolks, though now quite deserted by fashion.</p>
                <p>When applying in 1776 for permission to retire, Rennell had written—“I desire not
                    to eat the bread of idleness, but rather to make myself as useful as possible,
                    even after my return to England,” and went on to submit a scheme for the
                    utilization of the large mass of geographical material laid up and perishing in
                    the India House. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>MS.

                    geography, and to that enjoyment of the society of his friends to which he often
                    refers in his correspondence as the chief happiness to which he looked forward
                    in his retirement.</p>
                <p>His first publication after his return was <hi rend="italic">A Chart of the Banks
                        and Currents at the Lagullas in South Africa</hi> (1778), accompanied by a
                    memoir. In the same year appeared <hi rend="italic">A Description of the Roads
                        in Bengal and Bahar,</hi> &lt;t <hi rend="italic">·c., printed by order of
                        the Court of Directors.</hi> This is a small 12mo, and only a book of
                    routes. In 1781 came out his <hi rend="italic">Bengal Atlas, containing Maps of
                        the Theatre of War and Commerce on that side of Hindustan, compiled from the
                        original Surveys, icith Tables of Routes and Distances from Calcutta,
                        through the principal Internal Navigations.</hi> This is in folio, and
                    contains twenty-one maps, a work leaving far behind everything in Indian
                    cartography published up to that date. In the same year Rennell read before the
                    Royal Society, to which he had been elected March 8, “An Account of the Ganges
                    and Burrampootur Rivers.”</p>
                <p>These were preliminary flights. His great work on Indian geography was the <hi
                        rend="italic">Memoir of a Map of Hindustan;</hi> and even this was of
                    gradual growth. In its first form, as published in 1783, it contained only pp.
                    xiv and 132. A second edition in 1785 had considerable additions. In 1788 a <hi
                        rend="italic">Memoir</hi> was issued altogether enlarged in scope, and of
                    this again a second edition appeared in 1792, and a third, still enlarged, in
                    1793, which contains pp. cxli + 428 + 51, pp. 820 in all. The work, which thus
                    went through five developments in all, was that which especially established
                    Rennell’s reputation,—though his knowledge and ability were appreciated in
                    London from an early date after his return to Europe, and the continued scries
                    of works which he issued from time to time during some five and thirty years
                    spread and augmented his fame as a geographer. After a brief interval of extreme
                    old age, the series was resumed in the publication of valuable posthumous
                    works.</p>
                <p>But, to return to earlier days, Rennell speedily found a place in the most
                    intelligent circles of society, counting among his friends, as years passed on,
                    not only men of science and literature like Sir Joseph Banks, Sir Everard Home,
                    Bishop Horsley, Sir George Staunton, Dr Robertson the historian, Dean Vincent,
                    Mr Alexander Dalrymple, Mr William Marsden, &amp;c., but also such men as Lord
                    Momington (afterwards the famous Marquis Wellesley), Lord Spencer (first lord of
                    the Admiralty 1794-1801), and Lord Holland. His closest friends appear to have
                    been Sir Joseph Banks, Lord Spencer, and Dr Gillies the historian, and in later
                    years Captain (afterwards Sir Francis) Beaufort.</p>
                <p>In 1791 he received from the Royal Society, at the hands of the president Sir
                    Joseph Banks, the Copley medal, assigned him for his geographical labours, and
                    especially for his paper <hi rend="italic">“On</hi> the Camel’s Rate, as applied
                    to Geographical Purposes.” The following passage, perhaps not quite free from
                    exaggeration, occurs in the president’s address on this occasion: —</p>
                <p>“1 should, rejoice could I say that Britons . . . could boast a general map of
                    their island as well executed as the Major's delineation of Bengal and Bahar, a
                    tract of countries considerably larger in extent than the whole of Great Britain
                    and Ireland; but it would be injustice to the Major’s industry, were I not here
                    to state that the districts he has perambulated and planned exceed probably in
                    extent the whole tract of surveyed country to be found in the maps of the
                    Eurojiean kingdoms put together; while the accuracy of his particular surveys
                    stands yet unrivalled by the most laborious performance of the best county maps
                    this nation has hitherto been able to produce.”</p>
                <p>In 1792 Rennell published <hi rend="italic">The Marches of the British Army in
                        the Peninsula of India during the Campaign of 1790-91, illustrated and
                        explained by a map and other plates</hi>; and in 1794 an 8vo pamphlet
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">War with France the only security of Britain,</hi> by
                    an “Old Englishman.” Some years before this time Rennell had also turned his
                    attention to African geography, in connexion with the African Association, of
                    which he was one of the earliest members. Of this body, which was the
                    progenitor, though not the immediate parent, of the Royal Geographical Society,
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There was an
                            intermediate body called the Raleigh Club, founded in 1826-27, which

                            prevented his joining the club. The society was founded the month after
                            liis death. </p></note> an account may be read in Air Clements Markham’s
                    most interesting record of the fifty years’ work of that society. The
                    association was established in 1788, and sent out several travellers of note.
                    Maps and geographical memoirs from Rennell’s pen were issued on various
                    occasions; and especially were his African labours associated with the name and
                    first journey of Mungo Park. Rennell published in all some five or six
                    dissertations on African geography. And this branch of his work may account,
                    after a fashion, for an odd confusion made in a public report of Livingstone’s
                    burial in Westminster Abbey. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> whose atmosphere in those
                    days was not confined to the same rarefied altitudes as at present, contain
                    occasional papers from Rennell’s hand. We have mentioned the paper on “Camel’s
                    Rate” in 1791; in 1793 we have “Observations on a Current that often prevails to
                    the westward of Seilly, and endangers the safety of ships” (the current in
                    question has since been known by Rennell’s name), in 1809 “On the Effect of
                    Westerly Winds in raising the Level of the British Channel.” In the <hi
                        rend="italic">Archscologia</hi> we find the following:—in vol. xvii. p. 242,
                    “Observations on the Topography of Ancient Babylon,” and in vol. xxi. three
                    dissertations:—(1) p. 92, “On the Voyage and Place of Shipwreck of St Paul”; (2)
                    p. 138, “Concerning the Identity of the Remains at Jerasli, whether they are
                    those of Gerasa or Pella”; (3) p. 501, read May 1S26, when the venerable author
                    was in his <hi rend="superscript">!</hi> eighty-fourth year, “Concerning the
                    place where Julius Caesar landed in Britain.” This does not, we believe, exhaust
                    the list of his occasional writings, and he gave much incidental help to other
                    writers who touched liis own subjects, <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi> to Dean
                    Vincent in his well-known work on the Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients.
                    The detail of these minor works has carried us away from the chronological order
                    of his productions. That which added most largely to the reputation acquired as
                    the geographer of India was his book on the <hi rend="italic">Geographical
                        System of Herodotus,</hi> 4to, with eleven maps (1800). Another great task
                    undertaken by him was a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Comparative Geography
                        of Western Asia.</hi> On this field he had formed a most comprehensive
                    project, too vast indeed for the time of life at which he undertook it, when
                    probably he had already reached threescore. Of this project his Herodotus was
                    indeed itself a portion, and others were his separate publications of a <hi
                        rend="italic">Dissertation on the Topography of the Plain of Troy</hi> (4to,
                    1811), and of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Expeditions of</hi> ,
                        <hi rend="italic">Cxjrus and the Retreat of the Ten Thousand,</hi> and an
                    additional mass of matter, prepared with many years’ labour, and left behind him
                    in a very perfect state of transcription, was published after his death by his
                    daughter, in 2 vols. 8vo, with an atlas (1831).</p>
                <p>Another posthumous work was <hi rend="italic">An Investigation of the Currents of
                        the Atlantic Ocean, and of those which prevail between the Indian Ocean and
                        the Atlantic.</hi> For this work Rennell had examined and collated the logs
                    of a vast number of the ships of war and Indiamen which had traversed those seas
                    during thirty or forty years, re-computing observations, and reducing them to
                    one general system. The results of this toil were left ready for the press, and
                    were published in large charts, with a thin volume of text, under the editorship
                    of Mr John Purdy, in 1832. The first contributions to the scientific knowledge
                    of currents had been Rennell’s papers on the Lagullas, and on the Seilly
                    Currents, and the present work contained nearly all that existed in the
                    generalization of such data till more than twenty years after his death. <note

                            his death, and showing him in old age. There is also the bust by Baily
                            in Westminster Abbey; and an admirable wax relief of him in old age is
                            in the possession of Major Rodd, liis grandson. </p></note> A
                    contemporary, quoted in the work just referred to, said of him :—“In his
                    intercourse with his friends he possesses a remarkable flow of spirits, and
                    abounds with interesting subjects of conversation; at the same time, as to what
                    relates to himself, he is one of the most diffident, unassuming men in the
                    world.”</p>
                <p>One of the obituary notices at the time of his death says that Rennell’s
                    “political and religious feelings are said to have operated in causing him to
                    decline the acceptance of an invitation to become a member of the French
                    National Institute.” This can hardly have had any basis of fact. Rennell, in
                    politics, was always attached to what would be called, in present language, the
                    Liberal party; though his Liberalism, as we may gather from the title of his
                    pamphlet of 1794, and from expressions used in the dedication to Earl Spencer of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Herodotus,</hi> had nothing of that character which loves
                    to disparage those who are jealous for the greatness of England. As a matter of
                    fact lie was elected a foreign associate of the Institute during the peace of
                    Amiens, in 1802, and accepted the honour with unmistakable cordiality and
                    satisfaction, as his reply, which we have seen, testifies. In his eighty-third
                    year a gold medal was awarded to Rennell by the Royal Society of Literature;
                    and, as his infirmities prevented his attendance at their place of meeting, a
                    deputation, headed by the president, visited him for the purpose of presenting
                    it at his own house in Nassau Street.</p>
                <p>When more than eighty-seven years of age Major Rennell slipped from a chair, and
                    broke his thigh. He hardly ever left his bed afterwards, and died 29tli March
                    1830. He was buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey on the 6th April. A tablet
                    to his memory, with a bust, stands in the north-west angle of the nave.</p>
                <p>Mrs Rennell had died in 1810. Three children of the marriage <pb break="no"

                    1846; William, the third, went to India in the Civil Service, and died some
                    years before his father (1819); <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            Acts, by William Rennell, Calcutta, 1807-8.” </p></note> Jane, the
                    eldest, married Captain Rodd, afterwards Yice-Admiral Sir John Tremayne Rodd,
                    K.C.B., and survived both her brothers, dying in 1863. It was through Lady
                    Rodd’s active filial zeal that Rennell’s posthumous works were published,
                    including, besides the two already named, a second edition of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Herodotus.</hi></p>
                <p>What has been said in the enumeration of his writings sufficiently shows how
                    laboriously he worked. But to this great industry were joined in all his works
                    sagacity, excellent judgment, and a love of truth which made him never ashamed
                    to confess a difficulty, and always ready to do justice to other writers. The
                    man whom we find already at fourteen serving as a midshipman in time of war
                    could have grown up with little instruction but what he sought, and found for
                    himself, in the course of his career. On many of the subjects on which he wrote,
                    fresh light has been so abundant that the value of his works as guides has in
                    great measure passed away, yet even now no one can deal with Herodotus or
                    Xenophon without consulting Rennell’s views, directly or indirectly. Obliged to
                    depend, as regards the former, for his text on the inaccurate translation of
                    Beloe, it has been shown that Rennell’s sagacity often discerned the true
                    meaning of the historian when his interpreter had gone astray. What he did for
                    the geography of India, not by his own surveys merely, but by his labour on the
                    often remoulded <hi rend="italic">Memoir,</hi> in coordinating the information
                    gathered during forty years, may be best appreciated by a comparison of the
                    celebrated D’Anville’s <hi rend="italic">Éclaircissemens Géographiques sur la
                        Carte de VInde</hi> (1753) with the final edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Memoir</hi> (1793). Putting aside the great additions to positive knowledge
                    which favoured the later writer, we are mistaken if the perusal of both works
                    will not leave the impression that, in most of the qualities of a geographer,
                    Rennell’s place is not in any respect behind that of the famous Frenchman, for
                    whom he himself always entertained and expressed the deepest respect.</p>
                <p>We conclude with an extract from a tribute to his memory which appeared in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of the day after his funeral in the Abbey:—</p>
                <p>“Another characteristic of this amiable philosopher was the generous facility
                    with which he imparted his stores of learning in conversation. A memory
                    remarkably tenacious, and so well arranged as to be equally ready for the
                    reception or for the distribution of knowledge, made him a depository of facts
                    to which few ever applied in vain; adapting himself to the level of all who
                    consulted him, he had the happy art of correcting their errors without hurting
                    their feelings, and of leading them to truth without convicting them of
                    ignorance.”</p>
                <p>Till Rennell’s time it could hardly be said that England could boast of any
                    geographer of the first class. His pre-eminence in that character is still
                    undisputed, like that of D’Anville in France, and of Ritter in Germany.</p>
                <p>In this sketch of Rennell’s career, use has been made of a mass of letters
                    addressed, during his service in the navy and in India, to the Rev. G.
                    Burlington, kindly lent by Hr C. Langley of Chudleigh; of papers courteously
                    communicated by Rennell’s descendants; of the “Memorials” quoted above; and of
                    India Office records; supplemented by a good deal of other research. (H. Y.)</p>
