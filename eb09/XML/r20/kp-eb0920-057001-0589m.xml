                <p><label type="entry">RITSON</label> Joseph (1752-1803), was the most militant and
                    ill-tempered, and at the same time one of the most learned and accurate, of the
                    antiquaries of the 18th century. Born at Stockton-on-Tees, of a Westmoreland
                    yeoman family, in 1752, he was bred to the law, and settled in London as a
                    conveyancer at the age of twenty-two. Already he had shown eccentricity of
                    temper, had become a fierce apostle of vegetarianism, and a zealous student of
                    antiquities. His first notable publication was in 1782, an attack on Warton’s
                    <hi rend="italic">History of English Poetry.</hi> The fierce and insulting tone
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Observations,</hi> in which Warton was treated as a
                    showy pretender, and charged with cheating and lying to cover his ignorance,
                    made a great sensation in literary circles. In nearly all the small points with
                    which he dealt Ritson was in the right, and his corrections have since been
                    adopted, but the unjustly bitter language of his criticisms roused great anger
                    at the time, much, it would appear, to Ritson’s delight. In the following year
                    Johnson and Steevens were assailed in the same unceremonious fashion for their
                    text of Shakespeare. Bishop Percy was next subjected to a furious onslaught in
                    the preface to a collection of <hi rend="italic">Ancient Songs</hi> (printed
                    1787, dated 1790, published 1792). The only thing that can be said in
                    extenuation of Ritson’s unmatchable acrimony is that he spared no pains himself
                    to ensure accuracy in the texts of old songs, ballads, and metrical romances
                    that he edited. His collection of the Robin Hood ballads is perhaps his greatest
                    single achievement. Scott, who admired his industry and accuracy in spite of his
                    temper, was almost the only man who could get on with him. On one occasion, when
                    he called in Scott’s absence, he spoke so rudely to Mrs Scott that Leyden, who
                    was present, threatened to “thraw his neck” and throw him out of the window.
                    Spelling was one of his eccentricities, his own name being an example: Ritson is
                    short pronunciation for Richardson. He died in 1803.</p>
