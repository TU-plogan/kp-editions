                    drainage in England it was a common species in many districts, but at the
                    present day there are very few to which it can resort for the purpose of
                    reproduction. In such of them as remain, its lively actions, both on the ground
                    and in the air, as well as its loud notes render the Redshank, during the
                    breeding-season, one of the most observable inhabitants of what without its
                    presence would often be a desolate spot, and invest it with a charm for the
                    lover of wild nature. At other times the cries of this bird may be thought too
                    shrill, but in spring the love-notes of the male form what may fairly be called
                    a song, the constantly repeated refrain of which— <hi rend="italic">leero,
                    leero</hi> , <hi rend="italic">leero</hi> (for so it may be syllabled)— rings
                    musically around, as with many gesticulations he hovers in attendance on the
                    flight of his mate; or, with a slight change to a different key, engages with a
                    rival; or again, half angrily and half piteously complains of a human intruder
                    on his chosen ground. The body of the Redshank is almost as big as a Snipe’s,
                    but its longer neck, wings, and legs make it appear a much larger bird. Above,
                    the general colour is greyish-drab, freckled with black, except the lower part
                    of the back and a conspicuous band on each wing, which are white, while the
                    flight-quills are black, thus producing a very harmonious effect. In the
                    breeding-season the back and breast are mottled with dark brown, but in winter
                    the latter is white. The nest is generally concealed in a tuft of rushes or
                    grass, a little removed from the wettest parts of the swamp whence the bird gets
                    its sustenance, and contains four eggs, usually of a rather warmly tinted brown
                    with blackish spots or blotches; but no brief description can be given that
                    would point out their differences from the eggs of other birds, more or less
                    akin, among which, those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lapwing</hi> (vol. xiv. p.
                    308) especially, they are taken and find a ready sale.</p>
                <p>The name Redshank, prefixed by some epithet as Black, Dusky, or Spotted, has also
                    been applied to a larger but allied species— the <hi rend="italic">Totanus
                    fuscus</hi> of ornithologists. This is a much less common bird, and in Great
                    Britain as well as the greater part of Europe it only occurs on its passage to
                    or from its breeding-grounds, which are usually found south of the Arctic
                    Circle, and differ much from those of its congeners—the spot ־ chosen for the
                    nest being nearly always in the midst of forests and, though not in the thickest
                    part of them, often with trees on all sides, generally where a fire has cleared
                    the undergrowth, and mostly at some distance from water. This peculiar habit was
                    first ascertained by Wolley in Lapland in 1853 and the following year. The
                    breeding-dress this bird assumes is also very remarkable, and seems (as is
                    suggested) to have some correlation with the burnt and blackened surface
                    interspersed with white stones or tufts of lichen on which its nest is made—for
                    the head, neck, shoulders, and lower parts are of a deep black, contrasting
                    vividly with the pure white of the back and rump, while the legs become of an
                    intense crimson. At other times of the year the plumage is very similar to that
                    of the common Redshank, and the legs are of the same light orange-red. (A.
