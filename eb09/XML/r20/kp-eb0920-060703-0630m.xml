                    April 1794. He was educated at Hamilton College, New York, where he graduated in
                    1816. He served as a tutor at the college during 1817-18, and then engaged in
                    private study of the Greek classics until 1821, when he went to Andover,
                    Massachusetts, in order to publish an edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad.</hi> There he became a pupil of Moses Stuart, the enthusiastic professor
                    of Biblical studies in the theological seminary, and was made instructor of
                    Hebrew there in 1823. In 1826 he resigned his position at Andover and went to
                    Europe, where he studied Hebreλv under Gesenius at Halle, and also history at
                    Berlin under Neander, remaining in Europe until 1830. In 1828 he married Therese
                    Albertine Luise von Jakob, daughter of an eminent professor of philosophy at
                    Halle. This highly cultured lady was already well known as an authoress under
                    the pseudonym of “Talvj.” She became of great assistance to her husband in his
                    learned pursuits. In 1830 he was again called to Andover as professor
                    extraordinary of Biblical literature, and entered with enthusiasm upon the work
                    of instruction and the publication of scholarly works upon the Bible. In 1831 he
                    founded the <hi rend="italic">Biblical Repository,</hi> a theological review
                    which introduced a new era in theological periodicals in America, and which
                    subsequently passed over into the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Sacra.</hi> In
                    the same year he received the degree of D.D. from Dartmouth College. In 1832 he
                    published a revised edition of Taylor’s translation of Calmet’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionary of the Bible,</hi> and in the ensuing year a popular
                    <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</hi> and a translation of Buttmann’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Greek Grammar</hi> (3d ed., 1851). Such severe literary work
                    deprived him of his health and he was compelled to resign his professorship. He
                    now devoted himself entirely to literary pursuits for some years. In 1834 he
                    published a revised edition of Newcome’s <hi rend="italic">Greek Harmony of the
                    Gospels.</hi> In 1836 he issued a translation of Gesenius’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hebrew Lexicon</hi> and in the same year a <hi rend="italic">Greek and English
                    Lexicon of the New Testament.</hi> These lexicons have been the companions of
                    Biblical students until the present time, having passed through a series of
                    revisions. The <hi rend="italic">Hebrew Lexicon</hi> reached a fifth edition in
                    1854, the <hi rend="italic">Greek Lexicon</hi> a second edition in 1847. They
                    are both now (1885) passing through another revision by his pupils. In 1837
                    Robinson was called to the professorship of Biblical literature in the Union
                    Theological Seminary, New York, in which position he remained until his death,
                    giving it the reputation of his scholarship and the benefits of his great
                    experience in Biblical study and practical skill in instruction. In his letter
                    of acceptance he gave an outline of the field of Biblical study which showed his
                    mastery of the subject and his forecast of its future in America. He accepted
                    this position with the understanding that he should receive leave of absence for
                    some years in order to explore the lands of the Bible. He spent a considerable
                    portion of the year 1838 in these explorations and became the pioneer and father
                    of modern Biblical geography. He published his <hi rend="italic">Biblical
                    Researches</hi> in 1841 in three volumes, simultaneously in Berlin and Boston.
                    His services were recognized by a gold medal from the Royal Geographical Society
                    of London in 1842, the degree of D.D. from the university of Halle in 1842, and
                    the degree of LL.D. from Yale College in 1844. In 1852 he made a second visit to
                    Palestine and published its results in the supplemental volume to the second
                    edition of his <hi rend="italic">Biblical Researches</hi> in 1856. The third
                    edition of the whole work appeared in 1867 in three volumes. Robinson regarded
                    these researches as preliminary to a systematic work on the geography of the
                    Bible; but he was spared only to complete a mere fragment, which was published
                    posthumously under the title of <hi rend="italic">Physical Geography of the Holy
                    Land</hi> in 1865. In 1845 Robinson also issued a <hi rend="italic">Greek
                    Harmony of the Gospels</hi> and in 1846 an <hi rend="italic">English
                    Harmony,</hi> both of which have passed through many editions and have remained
                    the standard text-books in America until the present day. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Greek Harmony</hi> has renewed its life in a revised edition by Professor
                    Riddle in 1885. Besides these more important works he published from time to
                    time a vast number of articles in periodicals, and in 1859 a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoir of the Rev. William Robinson,</hi> his father. Robinson was an ordained
                    minister of the Presbyterian Church, but his voice was seldom heard in the
                    pulpit or in ecclesiastical bodies. In his declining years he was afflicted with
                    an incurable disease of the eyes and other maladies. He died in New York City on
                    27th January 1863.</p>
                <p>Robinson’s work in Biblical geography was both fundamental and monumental. Dean
                    Stanley once said, “Dr Robinson was the first man who saw Palestine with his
                    eyes open to what he ought <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n631/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0631-0608"/>to see”; and Ritter recognizes the “union of the
                    acutest observation of topographical and local conditions with much preparatory
                    study.” He was gifted with great practical sense and unusual accuracy of
                    observation; but hewas extreme in his criticism of the local legends of the Holy
                    Land, and not sufficiently skilled in historic criticism. Although great
                    progress has been made in Biblical geography in the last quarter of this
                    century, yet the work of Robinson is still classical.</p>
