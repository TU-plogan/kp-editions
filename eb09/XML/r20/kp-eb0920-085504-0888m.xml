                    born at York on June 17, 1800, a son of the second earl, who as Sir Lawrence
                    Parsons, Bart., had been a prominent member of the Irish Parliament. Until his
                    father’s death (1841) he was known as Lord Oxmantown. He was M.P. for King’s
                    County from 1821 to 1834, Irish representative peer from 1845, president of the
                    Royal Society from 1848 to 1854, and chancellor of the university of Dublin from
                    1862. From 1827 he devoted himself to the improvement of reflecting telescopes;
                    in 1839 he mounted a telescope of 3 feet aperture at his seat, Birr Castle,
                    Parsonstown; andin 1845 his celebrated 6-foot reflector was finished. Owing to
                    the famine and the disturbed state of the country, which demanded his attention
                    as a large landowner and lieutenant of King’s County, the instrument remained
                    unused for nearly three years, but since 1848 it has been in constant use,
                    chiefly for observations of nebulae, for which it was particularly suited on
                    account of its immense optical power. Lord Rosse died on October 31, 1867.</p>
                <p>The first constructor of reflecting telescopes on a large scale, William
                    Herschel, never published anything about his methods of casting and polishing
                    specula, and he does not appear to have been very successful beyond specula of
                    18 inches diameter, his 4-foot speculum (“the 40-foot telescope”) having been
                    very little used by him (about this question see an interesting discussion
                    between Sir J. Herschel and Robinson in <hi rend="italic">The Athevxeurn,</hi>
                    Nos. 831-36, 1843, which deserves to be rescued from, oblivion). Lord Rosse had
                    therefore no help whatever in working his way from a small beginning to the
                    brilliant results he achieved. Hisspeculum metal is composed of four equivalents
                    of copper and one of tin, a very brilliant alloy, which resists tarnish better
                    than any other compound tried. Chiefly owing to the extreme brittleness of this
                    material, Lord Rosse’s first larger specula were composed of a number of thin
                    plates of speculum metal (sixteen for a 3-foot mirror) soldered on the back of a
                    strong but light framework made of a peculiar kind of brass (2 <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> 75 of copper to 1 of zinc), which has the same
                    expansion as his speculum metal. In Brewster’s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Journal of Science</hi> for 1828 he described his machine for polishing the
                    speculum, which in all essential points remained unaltered afterwards. It
                    imitates the motions made in polishing a speculum by hand by giving both a
                    rectilinear and a lateral motion to the polisher, while the speculum revolves
                    slowly; by shifting two eccentric pins the course of the polisher can be varied
                    at will from a straight line to an ellipse of very small eccentricity, and a
                    true parabolic figure can thus be obtained. The speculum lies face upwards in a
                    shallow bath of water (to preserve a uniform temperature), and the polisher fits
                    loosely in a ring, so that the rotation of the speculum makes it revolve also,
                    but more slowly. Both the grinding and polishing tools are grooved, to obtain a
                    uniform distribution of the emery used in the grinding process and of the rouge
                    employed in polishing, as also to provide for the lateral expansion of the pitch
                    with which the polisher is coated. In September 1839 a 3-foot speculum was
                    finished and mounted on an altazimuth stand similar to HerscheFs; but, though
                    the definition of the images was good (except that the diffraction at the joints
                    of the speculum caused minute rays in the case of a very bright star), and its
                    peculiar skeleton form allowed the speculum to follow atmospheric changes of
                    temperature very quickly, Lord Rosse decided to cast a solid 3-foot speculum.
                    Hitherto it had been felt as a great difficulty in casting specula that the
                    solidification did not begin at one surface and proceed gradually to the other,
                    the common sand mould allowing the edges to cool first, so that the central
                    parts were subject to great straining when their time of cooling came, and in
                    large castings this generally caused cracking. By forming the bottom of the
                    mould of hoop iron placed on edge and closely packed, and the sides of sand,
                    while the top was left open, Lord Rosse overcame this difficulty, and the hoop
                    iron had the further advantage of allowing the gas developed dufing the cooling
                    to escape, thus preventing the speculum from being full of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n889/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0889-0856"/>pores and cavities. This happy invention secured
                    the success of the casting of a solid 3-foot speculum in 1840, and encouraged
                    Lord Rosse to make a speculum of 6 feet diameter, which he also succeeded in
                    doing in 1842. In the beginning of 1845 this great reflector (which up to the
                    present time has remained without a rival) was mounted and ready for work. The
                    instrument has a focal length of 54 feet and the tube is about 7 feet in
                    diameter; owing to these large dimensions it cannot be pointed to every part of
                    the heavens, but can only be moved a short distance from the meridian and very
                    little to the north of the zenith; these restrictions have, however, hardly been
                    felt, as there is almost at any moment a sufficient number of objects within its
                    reach. From 1848 to 1878 it was with but few interruptions employed for
                    observations of nebulae; and many previously unknown features in these objects
                    were revealed by it, especially the remarkable spiral configuration prevailing
                    in many of the brighter nebulae. A special study was made of the nebula of
                    Orion, and the resulting large drawing gives an extremely good representation of
                    this complicated object. Since 1845 others have followed in Lord Rosse’s
                    footsteps and several 3- and 4-foot mirrors have been made, while the
                    development of refracting telescopes has been so rapid that, whereas twenty-five
                    years ago there were no object glasses larger than 15 inches in existence, a
                    30-inch glass has now actually been completed. But, though the refractors
                    surpass the large reflectors in general convenience of use and are very much
                    better adapted to work of precision (micrometer measures), Lord Rosse’s great
                    reflector is still unapproached in light-grasping power, and remains a noble
                    monument of'its maker, who (as beautifully expressed on a memorial tablet in the
                    parish church of Birr) “revealed to mankind by the unrivalled creation of his
                    genius a wider vision of the glory of God.”</p>
                <p>Lord Rosse gave a detailed account of the experiments which step by step had led
                    to the construction of the 3-foot speculum in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1840. In the same publication for 1844 and
                    1850 he communicated short descriptions and drawings of some of the more
                    interesting nebulae, and in the volume for 18G1 he published a paper <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Construction of Specula of 6 feet aperture, and a Selection
                    from the Observations of Nebulae made with them,</hi> with numerous engravings.
                    The accounts of the observations given in these papers were, however, of a very
                    fragmentary character; but in 1879-80 a complete account of them was published
                    by the present earl (“Observations of nebulae and clusters of stars made with
                    the 6-footand 3-foot reflectors at BirrCastlefrom 1848 to 1878”) in the <hi
