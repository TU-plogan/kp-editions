                    1639. The 20th and the two follow<pb break="no"

                    birthday; all that is certain is that he was christened on the 22d. The ceremony
                    was at that time often, though not invariably, performed on the day of birth.
                    Racine belonged to a family of the upper bourgeoisie, which had indeed been
                    technically ennobled some generations earlier and bore the punning arms of a rat
                    and a swan <hi rend="italic">(rat, cygne).</hi> The poet himself subsequently
                    dropped the rat. His family were connected with others of the same or a slightly
                    higher station in La Ferté and its neighbourhood,—the Des Moulins, the Sconins,
                    the Yitarts, all of whom appear in Racine’s life. His mother was Jeanne Sconin.
                    His father, of the same name as himself, was only four-and-twenty at the time of
                    the poet’s birth. He seems to have been a solicitor (; <hi rend="italic"
                    >procureur</hi> ) by profession, and held, as his father, the grandfather of the
                    dramatist, had done, the office of <hi rend="italic">controleur au grenier à
                    sel.</hi> Racine was the eldest child of his parents. Little more than a year
                    afterwards his sister Marie was born and his mother died. Jean Racine the elder
                    married again, but three months later he himself died and the stepmother is
                    never heard of in connexion with the poet or his sister. They were left without
                    any provision, but their grandparents, Jean Racine the eldest and Marie des
                    Moulins, were still living, and took charge of them. These grandparents had a
                    daughter, Agnes, who figures in Racine’s history. She was a nun of Port Royal
                    under the style of Mère de Sainte Thècle, and the whole family had strong
                    Jansenist leanings. Jean Racine the eldest died in 1649, and, apparently as a
                    consequence of this, the poet was sent to the Collège de Beauvais. This (which
                    was the grammar-school of the town of that name, and not the famous Collège de
                    Beauvais at Paris) was intimately connected with Port Royal, and to this latter
                    place Racine was transferred in November 1655. His special masters there were
                    Nicole and Le</p>
                <p>Maître. The latter, in an extant letter written to his pupil during one of the
                    gusts of persecution which Port Royal constantly suffered, speaks of himself as
                    “votre papa”; the manner in which Racine repaid this affection will be seen
                    shortly. It is evident from documents that he was a very diligent student both
                    at Beauvais and Port Royal. He wrote verse both in Latin and French, and his
                    Port Royal odes, which it has been the fashion with the more fanatical admirers
                    of his later poetry to ridicule, are far from despicable. They show the somewhat
                    garrulous nature-worship of the Pléiade tempered by the example of the earlier
                    school of Malherbe. He seems also to have made at least a first draft of his
                    version of the breviary hymns; some, if not most, of a considerable mass of
                    translations from the classics and annotations on them must also date from this
                    time. Racine stayed at Port Royal for three years, and left it, aged nearly
                    nineteen, in October 1658. He was then entered at the Collège d’Harcourt and
                    boarded with his second cousin, Nicolas Vitart, steward of the duke of Luynes.
                    Later, if not at first, he lived in the Hôtel de Luynes itself. It is to be
                    observed that his Jansenist surroundings’ continued with him here, for the duke
                    of Luynes was a severe Port Royalist. It is, however, clear from Racine’s
                    correspondence, which as we have it begins in 1660 and is for some years very
                    abundant and interesting, that he was not at all of an austere disposition at
                    this time. His chief correspondent is a certain young abbé Le Vasseur, who seems
                    to have been by no means seriously given. The letters are full of verse-making
                    and of other diversions; a certain Mademoiselle Lucrèce, who seems to have been
                    both amiable and literary, is very frequently mentioned, neither is she the only
                    one of her sex who appears. Occasionally the liveliness of the letters passes
                    the bounds of strict decency, though there is nothing very shocking in them.</p>
                <p>Those to Madame (or, as the habit of the time called her, Mademoiselle) Yitart
                    are free from anything of this kind, while they are very lively and pleasant. It
                    does not appear that Racine read much philosophy, as he should have done, but he
                    occasionally did some business in superintending building operations at
                    Chevreuse, the duke’s country house. He would seem, however, to have been
                    already given up irrevocably to literature. This by no means suited the views of
                    his devout relations at Port Royal, and he complains in one of his letters that
                    an unlucky sonnet on Mazarin had brought down on him “excommunications sur
                    excommunications.” But he had much more important works in hand than sonnets.
                    The marriage of Louis XIV. ־was the occasion of an ambitious ode, “La Nymphe de
                    la Seine,” which was submitted before publication to Chapelain, the too famous
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Pucelle.</hi> Chapelain’s fault was not
                    ill-nature, and he made many suggestions (including the very pertinent one that
                    Tritons were not usually found in rivers), which Racine duly adopted. Nor did
                    the ode bound his ambitions, for he finished one piece, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amasie,</hi> and undertook another, <hi rend="italic">Les Amours d’Ovide,</hi>
                    for the theatre. The first, however, was rejected by the actors of the Marais,
                    and it is not certain that the other was ever finished or offered to those of
                    the Hôtel de Bourgogne. Racine’s letters show that he was intimate with more
                    than one actress at this time; he also made acquaintance with La Fontaine, and
                    the foundations at any rate of the legendary “society of four” (Boileau, La
                    Fontaine, Molière, and Racine) were thus laid.</p>
                <p>His relations were pretty certainly alarmed by this very pardonable worldliness,
                    though a severe expostulation with him for keeping company with the abominable
                    actors is perhaps later in date. Allusions in a letter to his sister leave
                    little doubt of this. Racine was accordingly disturbed in his easy-going life at
                    Paris. In November 1661 he went to Uzès in Languedoc to live with his uncle the
                    Père Sconin, vicar-general of that diocese, where it was hoped that Sconin would
                    be able to secure a benefice for his nephew. It is certain that he was not slack
                    in endeavouring to do this, but his attempts were in vain, and perhaps the
                    church did not lose as much as the stage gained. Racine was at Uzès for an
                    uncertain time. All that is known is that he was back in Paris before the end of
                    1663. His letters from Uzès to La Fontaine, to Le Vasseur, and others are in
                    much the same strain as before, but there is here and there a marked tone of
                    cynicism in them. One passage in particular, in which he tells how he was
                    disenchanted with a damsel of Uzès, has an unpleasantly Swiftian touch about it.
                    Once back in Paris, he gave himself up entirely to letters with a little
                    courtier-sliip. An ode on the recovery of Louis XIV. from a slight illness
                    probably secured him the promise of a pension, of which he speaks to his sister
                    in the summer of 1664, and on 2 2d August he actually received it. It is
                    uncertain whether this pension is identical with “gratifications” which we know
                    that Racine for some years received and which were sometimes eight and sometimes
                    six hundred livres. It would seem not, as one of these gratifications had been
                    allotted to him the year before he so wrote to his sister. All this shows that
                    he had already acquired some repute as a promising novice in letters, though he
                    had as yet done nothing substantive. The ode in which he thanked the king for
                    his presents, “La Renommée,” is said to have introduced him to Boileau, to whose
                    censorship there is no doubt that he owed much, if not everything; and from this
                    date, November 1663, the familiarity of “the four” undoubtedly existed in full
                    force. Racine was at the time the least distinguished, but he rapidly equalled,
                    if not the merit, the reputation of his friends. Unfortunately it is precisely
                    at this date that his corre<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0222-0205"/>spondence ceases, and it is not renewed till after
                    the close of his brief but brilliant career as a dramatist ( <hi rend="italic"
                    >Esther</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Athalie</hi> excepted). This is the more to
                    be regretted in that the most disputable events of Racine’s life as well as the
                    greater part of his literary work fall within this silent period. His strange
                    behaviour to Molière, his virulent attack on his masters and friends of Port
                    Royal, and the sudden change by which, after the failure of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phèdre</hi> and for no clearly expressed cause, a man of pleasure and an active
                    literary worker became a sober domestic character of almost ostentatiously
                    religious habits, and abstained from almost all but official work, are
                    unillumined by any words of his own. From this time forward the gossip of the
                    period and the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> by his son Louis are the chief
                    sources of information. Unfortunately Louis Racine, though a man of some ability
                    and of unimpeached character, was only six years old when his father died, and
                    had no direct knowledge. Still his account represents family papers and
                    traditions and seems to have been carefully, as it is certainly in the main
                    impartially, written. From other sources—notably Boileau, Brossette, and
                    Yalincourt— a good deal of pretty certainly authentic information is obtainable,
                    and there exists a considerable body of correspondence between Boileau and the
                    poet during the last ten years of Racine’s life.</p>
                <p>The first but the least characteristic of the dramas by which Racine is known,
                    <hi rend="italic">La Thébaide,</hi> was finished by the end of 1663, and on
                    Friday 20th June 1664 it was played by Molière’s company at the Palais Royal
                    theatre. Some editors assert that Molière himself acted in it, but the earliest
                    account of the cast we have, and that is sixty years after date, omits his name,
                    though those of Madeleine Béjard and Mademoiselle de Brie occur. There is a
                    tradition, supported by very little evidence, that Molière suggested the
                    subject; on the other hand, Louis Racine distinctly says that his father wrote
                    most of the play at Uzès before he knew Molière. Racine’s own letters, which
                    cover the period of composition, though not that of representation, give little
                    help in deciding this not very important question, except that it appears from
                    them that the play was designed for the rival theatre, and that “La Déhanchée,”
                    Racine’s familiar name for Mademoiselle de Beauchâteau, with whom he was
                    intimate, was to play Antigone. The play itself is by far the weakest of
                    Racine’s works. He has borrowed much from Euripides and not a little from
                    Rotrou; and in his general style and plan he has as yet struck out no great
                    variation from Corneille. We have very little intelligence about the reception
                    of the piece. It was acted twelve times during the first month, which was for
                    the period a very fair success, and was occasionally revived during the year
                    following.</p>
                <p>This is apparently the date of the pleasant picture of the four friends which La
                    Fontaine draws in his <hi rend="italic">Psyche,</hi> Racine figuring as Acante,
                    “qui aimait extrêmement les jardins, les fleurs, les ombrages.” Various stories,
                    more or less mythical, also belong to this period; the best authenticated of
                    them contributes to the documents for Racine’s unamiable temper. He had
                    absolutely no reason to complain of Chapelain, who had helped him with
                    criticism, obtained royal gifts for him, and, in a fashion, started him in the
                    literary career, yet he helped in composing the lampoon of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chapelain décoiffé.</hi> The sin would not be unpardonable if it stood alone,
                    but unluckily a much graver one followed.</p>
                <p>We have no definite details as to Racine’s doings during the year 1664, but in
                    February 1665 he read at the Hôtel de Nevers before La Rochefoucauld, Madame de
                    la Fayette, Madame de Sévigné, and other scarcely less redoubtable judges the
                    greater part of his second acted play, <hi rend="italic">Alexandre le
                    Grand,</hi> or, as Pomponne (who tells the fact) calls it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parus.</hi></p>
                <p>This was a frequent kind of preliminary advertisement at the time, and it seems,
                    as we find from the rhymed gazettes, to have been successful. It was anxiously
                    expected by the public, and Molière’s company played it on 4th
                    December,—Monsieur, his wife Henrietta of England, and many other distinguished
                    persons being present. The gazetteer Subligny vouches for its success, and the
                    still more certain testimony of the accounts of the theatre shows that the
                    receipts were good and, what is more, steady. But a fortnight afterwards <hi
                    rend="italic">Alexandre</hi> was played, “de complot avec M. Racine,” says La
                    Grange, by the rival actors (who had four days before performed it in private)
                    at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. A vast amount of ink has been spilt on this question,
                    but no one has produced any valid justification for Racine. That the piece
                    failed at the Palais Royal is demonstrably false, and as this is stated in the
                    earliest attempt to excuse Racine, and the only one made in his lifetime, it is
                    pretty clear that his case was very weak. His son simply says that he was
                    “mécontent des acteurs,” which indeed is self-evident. It is certain that
                    Molière and he ceased to be friends in consequence of this proceeding; and that
                    Molière was in fault no one who has studied the character of the two men, no one
                    even who considers the probabilities of the case, will easily believe. If,
                    however, <hi rend="italic">Alexandre</hi> was the occasion of showing the
                    defects of Racine’s character as a man, it raised him vastly in public
                    estimation as a poet. He was now for the first time proposed as a serious rival
                    to Corneille. There is a story, which a credible witness vouches for as Racine’s
                    own, that he read the piece to the author of the <hi rend="italic">Cid</hi> and
                    asked his verdict. Corneille praised the piece highly, but not as a drama, “Il
                    l’assurait qu’il n’était pas propre a la poésie dramatique.” There is no reason
                    for disbelieving this, for the character of Alexander could not fail to shock
                    Corneille, and he was notorious for not mincing his words. Nor can it be denied
                    that Racine might have been justly hurt, though with a man of more amiable
                    temper the slight would hardly have caused the settled antagonism to Corneille
                    which he displayed. The contrast between the two even at this early period was
                    accurately apprehended and put by Saint Evremond in his masterly <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertation sur VAlexandre,</hi> but this was not published for a
                    year or two. To this day it is the best criticism of the faults of Racine,
                    though not, it may be, of the merits, which had not yet been fully seen. It may
                    be added that in the preface of the printed play the poet showed the extreme
                    sensitiveness to criticism which perhaps excuses, and which certainly often
                    accompanies, a tendency to criticize others. These defects of character showed
                    themselves still more fully in another matter. The Port Royalists, as has been
                    said, detested the theatre, and in January 1666 Nicole, their chief writer*,
                    spoke in one of his <hi rend="italic">Lettres sur Visionnaires</hi> of dramatic
                    poets as “empoisonneurs publics.” There was absolutely no reason why Racine
                    should fit this cap on his own head; but he did so, and published immediately a
                    letter to the author. It is very smartly written, and if Racine had contented
                    himself with protesting against the absurd exaggeration of the decriers of the
                    stage there would have been little harm done. But he filled the piece with
                    personalities, telling an absurd story of Mère Angélique Arnauld’s supposed
                    intolerance, drawing a ridiculous picture of Le Maître (a dead man and his own
                    special teacher and friend), and sneering savagely at Nicole himself. The latter
                    made no reply, but two lay adherents of Port Royal took up the quarrel with more
                    zeal than discretion or ability. Racine wrote a second pamphlet as bitter and
                    personal as the first, but less amusing, and was about to publish it when
                    fortunately Boileau, who had been absent from Paris, returned and protested
                    against the publication. It remained accordingly unprinted till after the
                    author’s death, as well as a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0223-0206"/>preface to both which he had prepared with a view
                    to publishing them together. In this respect Boileau was certainly Racine’s good
                    angel, for no one has ventured to excuse the tone of these letters. The best
                    excuse for them is that they represent the accumulated resentment arising from a
                    long course of “excommunications.”</p>
                <p>After this disagreeable episode Racine’s life for ten years and more becomes
                    simply the history of his plays, if we except his liaisons with the actresses
                    Mademoiselle du Parc and Mademoiselle de Champmeslé (which are undoubted, though
                    there is not much to be said about them) and his election to the Academy on 17th
                    July 1673. Mademoiselle du Parc (Marquise de Gorla) was no very great actress,
                    but was very beautiful, and she had previously captivated Molière. Racine
                    induced her to leave the Palais Royal company and join the Hôtel. She died in
                    1668, and long afterwards the infamous Voisin accused Racine of having poisoned
                    her. Mademoiselle de Champmeslé was plain and stupid, but an admirable actress
                    and apparently very attractive in some way, for not merely Racine but Charles de
                    Sévigné and many others adored her. She was cruel to none, but for five years
                    before his marriage Racine seems to have been her <hi rend="italic">amant en
                    titre.</hi> Long afterwards, just before his own death, he heard of her mortal
                    illness and speaks of her to his son without a flash of tenderness.</p>
                <p>The series of his dramatic triumphs began with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andro-maque,</hi> and this play may perhaps dispute with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phèdre</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Athalie</hi> the title of his masterpiece. It
                    is much more uniformly good than <hi rend="italic">Phèdre</hi> , and the
                    character of Hermione is the most personally interesting on the French tragic
                    stage. It is said that the first representation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andromaque</hi> was on 10th November 1667, in public and by the actors of the
                    Hôtel de Bourgogne, but the first contemporary mention of it by the gazettes,
                    prose and verse, is on the 17 th, as performed in the queen’s apartment.
                    Perrault, by no means a friendly critic as far as Racine is concerned, says that
                    it made as much noise as the <hi rend="italic">Cid,</hi> and so it ought to have
                    done. Whatever may be thought of the <hi rend="italic">tragédie pathétique</hi>
                    (a less favourable criticism might call it the “sentimental tragedy”), it could
                    hardly be better exemplified than in this admirable play. A ferocious epigram of
                    Racine’s own (an epigram not unworthy of Martial, and as difficult to comment on
                    to modern ears polite as some of Martial’s own) tells us that some critics
                    thought Pyrrhus too fond of his mistress, and Andromache too fond of her
                    husband, which is not likely to be the present verdict. In the contemporary
                    depreciations is to be found the avowal of its real merit. The interest was too
                    varied, the pathos too close to human nature to content Boileau, and the
                    partisans of Corneille still found Racine unequal to the heroic height of their
                    master’s grandeur. A just criticism will probably hold that these two objections
                    neutralize each other. Both parties agreed in saying that much of the success
                    was due to the actors, another censure which is equivalent to praise. It so
                    happens, too, that, though the four main parts were played by accomplished
                    artists, two at least of them were such as to try those artists severely.
                    Pyrrhus was taken by Floridor, the best tragic actor by common consent of his
                    time, and Orestes by Montfleury, also an accomplished player. But Mademoiselle
                    du Parc, who played Andromache, had generally been thought below, not above, her
                    parts, and Mademoiselle des Oeillets, who played the difficult rôle of Hermione,
                    was old and had few physical advantages. No one who reads <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andromaque</hi> without prejudice is likely to mistake the secret of its
                    success, which is, in few words, the application of the most delicate art to the
                    conception of really tragic passion. Before leaving the play it may be mentioned
                    that it is said to have been in the part of Hermione, three years later, that
                    Mademoiselle de Champmeslé captivated the author. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andromaque</hi> was succeeded, at the distance of not more than a year, by a
                    play which, taken in conjunction with his others, is perhaps the best proof of
                    the theatrical talent of Racine,—the charming comedietta of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Les Plaideurs.</hi> We do not know exactly when it was played, but it was
                    printed on 5th December 1668, and it had succeeded so badly that doubtless no
                    long time passed between its appearance on the stage and in print. For the
                    printing at that time both in France and England made the play <hi rend="italic"
                    >publica maternes,</hi> and therefore in the case of very successful pieces it
                    was put off as long as possible. Many anecdotes are told about the origin and
                    composition of <hi rend="italic">Les Plaideurs,</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wasps</hi> of Aristophanes and the known fact that Racine originally destined
                    it, not for a French company, but for the Italian troupe which was then playing
                    the <hi rend="italic">Commedia dell' Arte</hi> in Paris dispense us from
                    enumerating them. The result is a piece admirably dramatic, but sufficiently
                    literary to shock the <hi rend="italic">profanum vulgus,</hi> which too
                    frequently gives the tone at theatres. It failed completely, the chief favouring
                    voice being, according to a story sufficiently well attested and worthy of
                    belief even without attestation, that of the man who was best qualified to
                    praise and who might have been most tempted to blame of any man then living.
                    Molière, says Yalincourt, the special friend of Racine, said in leaving the
                    house, “Que ceux qui se moquoient de cette pièce meri toi ent qu’on se moquoient
                    d’eux.” But the piece was suddenly played at court a month later; the king
                    laughed, and its fortunes were restored. The truth probably was that the legal
                    profession, which was very powerful in the city of Paris, did not fancy the most
                    severe satire on its ways which had been made public since the <hi rend="italic"
                    >or ça</hi> of the fifth book of Rabelais. It need only be added that, if Louis
                    XIY. admired <hi rend="italic">Les Plaideurs,</hi> Napoleon did not, and
                    excluded it from his travelling library. It was followed by a very different
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Britannicus,</hi> which appeared on 13th December 1669.
                    It was much less successful than <hi rend="italic">Andromaque,</hi> and, whether
                    or not the cabals, of which Racine constantly complains, and which he certainly
                    did nothing to disarm, had anything to do with this, it seems to have held its
                    own but a very few nights. Afterwards it became very popular, and even from the
                    first the exquisite versification was not denied. But there is no doubt that in
                    <hi rend="italic">Britannicus</hi> the defects of Racine, which in his first two
                    plays were excusable on the score of apprenticeship, and in the next two hardly
                    appeared at all, display themselves pretty clearly to any competent critic. The
                    complete nullity of Britannicus and Junie and the insufficient attempt to
                    display the complex and dangerous character of Nero are not redeemed by
                    Agrippina, who is really good, and Burrhus, who is solidly painted as a
                    secondary character. Voltaire calls it “la pièce des connaisseurs,” and the
                    description is—not quite in the sense in which the critic meant it—a very
                    pregnant one. <hi rend="italic">Britannicus</hi> is eminently the piece in which
                    persons of a dilettante turn are seduced by the beauties which do exist to
                    discover those which do not. The next play of Racine has, except <hi
                    rend="italic">Phèdre,</hi> the most curious history of all. “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Bérénice,״</hi> says Fontenelle succinctly, “fut un duel,” and he acknowledges
                    that his uncle was not the conqueror. Henrietta of Orleans proposed (it is said
                    without letting them know the double commission) the subject to Corneille and
                    Racine at the same time, and rumour gives no very creditable reasons for her
                    choice of the subject. Her death, famous for its disputed causes and for
                    Bossuet’s sermon, preceded the performance of the two plays, both of which, but
                    especially Racine’s, were successful. There is no doubt that it is the better of
                    the two, but Chapelle’s not unfriendly criticism in quoting the two lines of an
                    old song—</p>

                <p>“Marion pleure, Marion crie,</p>
                <p>Marion veut qu’on la marie ”—</p>
                <p>is said to have annoyed Racine very much, and it has a most malicious
                    appropriateness. <hi rend="italic">Bajazet,</hi> which was first played on 4th
                    January 1672 (for Racine punctually produced his piece a year), is perhaps
                    better. As a play, technically speaking, it has great merit, but the reproach
                    commonly brought against its author was urged specially and with great force
                    against this by Corneille. It is impossible to imagine anything less Oriental
                    than the atmosphere of <hi rend="italic">Bajazet</hi>; the whole thing is not
                    only French but ephemerally French—French of the day and hour; and its ingenious
                    scenario and admirable style scarcely save it. This charge is equally applicable
                    with the same reservations to <hi rend="italic">Mithridate,</hi> which appears
                    to have been produced on 13th January 1673, the day after the author’s reception
                    at the Academy. It was extremely popular and, as far as style and perfection in
                    a disputable kind go, Racine could hardly have lodged a more triumphant diploma
                    piece. His next attempt, <hi rend="italic">Iphig'enie,</hi> was a long step
                    backwards and upwards in the direction of <hi rend="italic">Andromaque.</hi> It
                    is not that the characters are eminently Greek, but that Greek tragedy gave
                    Racine examples which prevented him from flying in the face of the propriety of
                    character as he had done in <hi rend="italic">Berenice, Bajazet,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Mithridate,</hi> and that he here called in, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Andromaque,</hi> other passions to the aid of the mere sighing and
                    crying which form the sole appeal of these three tragedies. Achilles is a rather
                    pitiful personage, and the grand story of the sacrifice is softened very tamely
                    to suit French tastes; but the parental agonies of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon
                    are truly drawn, and the whole play is full of pathos. It succeeded brilliantly
                    and deservedly, but, oddly enough, the date of its appearance is very uncertain.
                    It was assuredly acted at court in the late summer of 1674, but it does not seem
                    to have been given to the public till the early spring of 1675, the usual time
                    at which Racine produced his work.</p>
                <p>The last and finest of the series of tragedies proper was the most unlucky. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pliedre</hi> was represented for the first time on New-Year’s Day
                    1677 at the Hotel de Bourgogne. Within a week the opposition company or “troupe
                    du roi” launched an opposition <hi rend="italic">Phédre</hi> by Pradon. This
                    singular competition, which had momentous results for Racine, and in which he to
                    some extent paid the penalty of the <hi rend="italic">lex talionis</hi> for his
                    own rivalry with Corneille, had long been foreseen. It has been hinted that
                    Racine had from the first been bitterly opposed by a clique, whom his great
                    success irritated, while his personal character did nothing to conciliate them.
                    His enemies at this time had the powerful support of the duchess of Bouillon,
                    one of Mazarin’s nieces, a woman of considerable talents and imperious temper,
                    together with her brother the duke of Nevers and divers other personages of high
                    position. These persons of quality, guided, it is said, by Madame Deshouliéres,
                    a poetess of merit whom Boileau unjustly depreciated, selected Pradon, a
                    dramatist of little talent but of much facility, to compose a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phédre</hi> in competition with that which it was known that Racine had been
                    elaborating with unusual care. Pradon, perhaps assisted, was equal to the
                    occasion, and it is said that the partisans on both sides did not neglect means
                    for correcting fortune. On her side the duchess of Bouillon is accused of having
                    bought up the front places in both theatres for the first six nights; on his
                    part Racine is said to have repeated an old trick of his and prevailed on the
                    best actresses of the company that played Pradon’s piece to refuse the title
                    part. There is even some ground for believing that Racine endeavoured to prevent
                    the opposition play from being played at all, and that an express order from the
                    king had to be obtained for it. It was of no value, but the measures of the
                    cabal had been so well taken that the finest tragedy of the French classical
                    school was all but driven from the stage, while Pradon’s was a positive success.
                    A war of sonnets and epigrams followed, during which it is said that the duke of
                    Nevers menaced Racine and Boileau with the same treatment which Dryden and
                    Voltaire actually received, and was only deterred by the protection which Conde
                    extended to them.</p>
                <p>The unjust cabal against his piece and the various annoyances to which it gave
                    rise no doubt made a deep impression on Racine. But in the absence of accurate
                    contemporary information it is impossible to decide exactly how much influence
                    they had on the subsequent change in his life. For thirteen years he had been
                    constantly employed on a series of brilliant dramas. He now broke off his
                    dramatic work entirely and in the remaining twenty years of his life wrote but
                    two more plays, and those under special circumstances and of quite a different
                    kind. He had been during his early manhood a libertine in morals and religion;
                    he now married, became irreproachably domestic, and almost ostentatiously
                    devout. No authentic account of this change exists; for that of Louis Racine,
                    which attributes the whole to a sudden religious impulse, is manifestly little
                    more than the theory of a son pious in both senses of the word. Probably all the
                    motives which friends and foes have attributed—weariness of dissipated life,
                    jealousy of his numerous rivals in Mademoiselle de Champmesle’s favour, pique at
                    Pradon’s success, fear of losing still further the position of greatest tragic
                    poet which after Corneille’s <hi rend="italic">Surena</hi> was indisputably his,
                    religious sentiment, and so forth—entered more or less into his action. At any
                    rate what is certain is that he reconciled himself with Arnauld and Port Royal
                    generally, and on 1st June married Catherine de Romanet and definitely settled
                    down to a quiet domestic life, alternated with the duties of a courtier. For his
                    repentance was by no means a repentance in sackcloth and ashes. The drama was
                    not then very profitable to dramatists, but Louis Racine tells us that his
                    father had been able to furnish a house, collect a library of some value, and
                    save 6000 livres. His wife had money, and he had possessed for some time (it is
                    not certain how long) the honourable and valuable post of treasurer of France at
                    Moulins. His annual “gratification” had been increased from 800 to 1500 livres,
                    then to 2000, and in the October of the year of his marriage he and Boileau were
                    made historiographers-royal with a salary of 2000 crowns. Besides all this he
                    had, though a layman, one or two benefices. It would have been pleasanter if
                    Louis Racine had not told us that his father regarded His Majesty’s choice as
                    “an act of the grace of God to detach him entirely from poetry.” Even after
                    allowing for Louis Racine’s religiosity and the conventional language of all
                    times, there is a flavour of hypocrisy about this which is disagreeable, and has
                    shocked even Racine’s most uncompromising admirers. For the historiographer of
                    Louis XIV. was simply his chief flatterer. Before going further it may be
                    observed that very little came of this historiography. The joint incumbents of
                    the office made some campaigns with the king, sketched plans of histories, and
                    left a certain number of materials and memoirs; but they executed no substantive
                    work. Racine, whether this be set down to his credit or not, was certainly a
                    fortunate and apparently an adroit courtier. His very relapse into Jansenism
                    coincided with his rise at court, where Jansenism was in no favour, and the fact
                    that he had been in the good graces of Madame de Montespan did not deprive him
                    of those of Madame de Maintenon. Neither in <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> did he
                    hesitate to reflect upon his former patroness. But a reported sneer of the king,
                    who was sharp-eyed enough, “Cavoie avec Racine se croit bel esprit; Racine avec
                    Cavoie <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n225/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0225-0208"/>se croit courtisan,” makes it appear that his
                    comparatively low birth was not forgotten at Versailles.</p>
                <p>Racine’s first campaign was at the siege of Ypres in 1678, where some practical
                    jokes are said to have been played on the two civilians who acted this early and
                    peculiar variety of the part of special correspondent. Again in 1683, in 1687,
                    and in each year from 1691 to 1693 Racine accompanied the king on similar
                    expeditions. The literary results of these have been spoken of. His labours
                    brought him, in addition to his other gains, frequent special presents from the
                    king, one of which was as much as 1000 pistoles. In 1690 he further received the
                    office of “gentilhomme ordinaire du roi,” which afterwards passed to his son.
                    Thus during the later years of his life he was more prosperous than is usual
                    with poets. His domestic life appears to have been a happy one. Louis Racine
                    tells us that his mother “did not know what a verse ־was,” but Racine certainly
                    knew enough about verses for both. They had seven children. The eldest, Jean
                    Baptiste, ־was born in 1678; the youngest, Louis, in 1692. It has been said that
                    he was thus too young to have many personal memories of his father, but he tells
                    one or two stories which show Racine to have been at any rate a man of strong
                    family affection, as, moreover, his letters prove. Between the two sons came
                    five daughters, Marie, Anne, Elizabeth, Françoise, and Madeleine. The eldest,
                    after showing “vocation,” married in 1699, Anne and Elizabeth took the veil, the
                    youngest two remained single but did not enter the cloister. To complete the
                    notice of family matters—much of Racine’s later correspondence is addressed to
                    his sister Marie, Madame Rivière.</p>
                <p>The almost complete silence in the literary sphere which Racine imposed on
                    himself after the comparative failure, shameful not for himself but for his
                    adversaries, of <hi rend="italic">Phèdre</hi> was broken once or twice even
                    before the appearance of the two exquisite tragedies in which under singular
                    circumstances he took leave of the stage. The most honourable of these was the
                    reception of Thomas Corneille on 2d January 1685 at the Academy in the room of
                    his brother. The discourse which Racine then pronounced turned almost entirely
                    on his great rival, of whom he spoke even more than becomingly. But it was an
                    odd conjunction of the two reigning passions of the latter part of his
                    life—devoutness and obsequiousness to the court—which made him once more a
                    dramatist. Madame de !Maintenon had established an institution, first called the
                    Maison Saint Louis, and afterwards (from the place to which it was transferred)
                    the Maison de Saint Cyr, for the education of poor girls of noble family. The
                    tradition of including acting in education was not obsolete. At first the
                    governess, !Madame de Grinon, composed pieces for representation, but, says
                    Madame de Caylus, a witness at first hand and a good judge, they were
                    “detestable.” Then recourse ־was had to chosen plays of Corneille and Racine,
                    but here there were obvious objections. The favourite herself wrote to Racine
                    that “nos petites filles” had played <hi rend="italic">Andromaque</hi> “a great
                    deal too well.” She asked the poet for a new play suited to the circumstances,
                    and, though Boileau advised him against it, it is not wonderful that he yielded.
                    The result was the masterpiece of <hi rend="italic">Esther,</hi> with music by
                    Moreau, the court composer and organist of Saint Cyr. Although played by
                    schoolgirls and in a dormitory, it had an enormous success, in which it may be
                    charitably hoped that the transparent comparison of the patroness to the heroine
                    had not too much to do. Printed shortly afterwards, it had to suffer a certain
                    reaction, or perhaps a certain vengeance, from those who had not been admitted
                    to the private stage. But no competent judge could hesitate. Racine probably had
                    read and to some extent followed the <hi rend="italic">Aman</hi> of
                    Montchrestien, but he made of it only the use which a proved master in
                    literature has a perfect right to make of his forerunners. The beauty of the
                    chorus, which Racine had restored more probably from a study of the Pléiade
                    tragedy than from classical suggestions, the perfection of the characters, and
                    the wonderful art of the whole piece need no praise. Almost immediately the poet
                    was at work on another and a still finer piece of the same kind, and he had
                    probably finished <hi rend="italic">Athalie</hi> before the end of 1690. The
                    fate of the play, however, was very different from that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Esther.</hi> Some fuss had been made about the worldliness of great court fêtes
                    at Saint Cyr, and the new play, with settings as before by Moreau, was acted
                    both at Versailles and at Saint Cyr with much less pomp and ceremony than <hi
                    rend="italic">Esther.</hi> It was printed in March 1691 and the public cared
                    very little for it. The truth is that the last five-and-twenty years of the
                    reign of Louis XIV. were marked by one of the lowest tides of literary
                    accomplishment and appreciation in the history of France. The just judgment of
                    posterity has ranked <hi rend="italic">Athalie</hi> , if not as Racine’s best
                    work (and there are good grounds for considering it to be this), at any rate as
                    equal to his best. Thenceforward Racine was practically silent, except for four
                    <hi rend="italic">cantiques spirituelles,</hi> in the style and with much of the
                    merit of the choruses of <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athalie.</hi> The general literary sentiment led by Fontenelle (who inherited
                    the wrongs of Corneille, his uncle, and ־whom Racine had taken care to estrange
                    further) was against the arrogant critic and the irritable poet, and they made
                    their case worse by espousing the cause of La Bruyère, whose personalities in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Caractères</hi> had made him one of the best hated men in
                    France, and by engaging in the ancient and modern battle with Perrault. Racine,
                    moreover, was a constant and spiteful epigrammatist, and the unlucky habit of
                    preferring his joke to his friend stuck by him to the last. A savage epigram on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sesostris</hi> of Longepierre, who had done him no harm
                    and was his familiar acquaintance, dates as late as 1695. Still the king
                    maintained him in favour, and so long as this continued he could afford to laugh
                    at Grub Street and the successors of the Hôtel de Rambouillet alike. At last,
                    however, there seems (for the matter is not too clear) to have come a change.
                    Some say that he disobliged Madame de Maintenon, some (and this would be much to
                    his honour, but not exactly in accord with anything else known of him) that,
                    like Vauban and Fénelon, he urged the growing misery of the people. But there
                    seems to be little doubt of the fact of the royal displeasure, and it is even
                    probable that it had some effect on his health. Disease of the liver appears to
                    have been the immediate cause of his death, which took place on 12th April 1699.
                    The king seems to have, at any rate, forgiven him after his death, and he gave
                    the family a pension of 2000 livres. Racine was buried at Port Royal, but even
                    this transaction was not the last of his relations with that famous home of
                    religion and learning. After the destruction of the abbey in 1711 his body was
                    exhumed and transferred to Saint Étienne du Mont, his gravestone being left
                    behind and only restored to his ashes a hundred years later, in 1818. His eldest
                    son was never married; his eldest daughter and Louis Racine have left
                    descendants to the present day.</p>
                <p>A critical biography of Racine is, in more ways than one, an exceptionally
                    difficult undertaking,—not in regard to the facts, which, as will have been
                    seen, are fairly abundant, but as to the construction to be placed on them. The
                    admirers of Racine’s literary genius have made it a kind of religion to defend
                    his character; and strictures on his character, it seems to be thought, imply a
                    desire to depreciate his literary worth. The reader of the above sketch of his
                    life must judge for himself whether Racine is or is net to be ranked with those
                    great men of letters, fortunately the greater number, whose personality is
                    attractive and their foibles at worst excusable. There is no doubt that the
                    general impression given, not merely by the flying anecdotes of the time, but by
                    ascertained facts, is somewhat unfavourable. Racine’s affection for his family
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n226/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0226-0209"/>and liis unbroken friendship for Boileau are the
                    sole points of his life which are entirely creditable to him. His conduct to
                    Molière and to Nicole cannot be excused; his attitude towards his critics and
                    his rivals was querulous and spiteful; his relation to Corneille contrasts
                    strikingly with the graceful position which young men of letters, sometimes by
                    no means his inferiors, have often taken up towards the surviving glories of a
                    past generation; his “conversion,” though there is no just cause for branding it
                    as hypocritical, appears to have been a singularly accommodating one, enabling
                    him to tolerate adultery, to libel his friends in secret, and to flatter
                    greatness unhesitatingly. None of these things perhaps are very heinous crimes,
                    but they are all of the class of misdoing which, fairly or unfairly, mankind are
                    apt to regard with greater dislike than positive misdeeds of a more glaring but
                    less unheroic character.</p>
                <p>The personality of an author is, however, by all the laws of the saner criticism,
                    entirely independent of the rank to be assigned to his work, and, as in other
                    cases, the strongest dislike for the character of Racine as a man is compatible
                    with the most unbounded admiration of his powers as a writer. But here again his
                    injudicious admirers have interposed a difficulty. There is a theory common in
                    France, and sometimes adopted out of it, that only a Frenchman, and not every
                    Frenchman, can properly appreciate Racine. The charm of his verse and of his
                    dramatic presentation is so esoteric and delicate that foreigners cannot hope to
                    taste it. This is of course absurd, and if it were true it would be fatal to
                    Racine’s claims as a poet of the highest rank. Such poets, such writers, are not
                    parochial or provincial, and even the greatest nations are but provinces or
                    parishes in the realm of literature. Homer, Shakespeare, Dante, even Molière,
                    Rabelais, Goethe, are not afraid to challenge the approval of the whole world,
                    and the whole world is not found incom-</p>
                <p>Eetent or unwilling to give it. Nor need Racine in reality avail imself of this
                    unwise pretension. J udged by the common tests of literature he is a consummate
                    artist, but he is scarcely a great poet, for his art, though unsurpassed in its
                    kind, is narrow in range and his poetry is neither of the highest nor of the
                    most genuine.</p>
                <p>He may be considered from two very different points of view,— (1) as a playwright
                    and poetical artificer, and (2) as a dramatist and a poet. From the first point
                    of view there is hardly any praise too high for him. He did not invent the form
                    he practised, and those who, from want of attention to the historical facts,
                    assume that he did are unskilful as well as ignorant. When he came upon the
                    scene the form of French plays was settled, partly by the energetic efforts of
                    the Pléiade and their successors, partly by the reluctant acquiescence of
                    Corneille. It is barely possible that the latter might, if he had chosen, have
                    altered the course of French tragedy; it is nearly certain that Racine could
                    not. But Corneille, though he was himself more responsible than any one else for
                    the acceptance of the single-situation tragedy, never frankly gave himself up to
                    it, and the inequality of his work is due to this. His heart was, though not to
                    his knowledge, elsewhere, and with Shakespeare. Racine, in whom the craftsman
                    dominated the man of genius, worked with a will and without any misgivings.
                    Every advantage which the Senecan tragedy adapted to modern times was capable of
                    he gave it. He perfected its versification; he subordinated its scheme entirely
                    to the one motive which could have free play in it,—the display of a
                    conventionally intense passion; he set himself to produce in verse a kind of
                    Ciceronian correctness. The grammar criticisms of Yaugelas and the taste
                    criticisms of Boileau produced in him no feeling of revolt, but only a
                    determination to play the game according to these new rules with triumphant
                    accuracy. And he did so play it. He had supremely the same faculty which enabled
                    the rhétoriqueurs of the 15th century to execute apparently impossible tours de
                    force in ballades couronnées, and similar tricks. He had besides a real and
                    saving vein of truth to nature, which preserved him from tricks pure and simple.
                    He would be and he was as much a poet as prevalent taste would let him be. The
                    result is that such plays as <hi rend="italic">Phèdre</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andromaque</hi> are supreme in their own way. If the critic will only abstain
                    from thrusting in tierce, when according to the particular rules he ought to
                    thrust in quart, Racine is sure to beat him.</p>
                <p>But there is a higher game of criticism than this, and this game Racine does not
                    attempt to play. He does not even attempt the highest poetry at all. His
                    greatest achievements in pure passion— the foiled desires of Hermione and the
                    jealous frenzy of Phèdre —are cold, not merely beside the crossed love of
                    Ophelia and the remorse of Lady Macbeth, but beside the sincerer if less
                    perfectly expressed passion of Corneille’s Cléopâtre and Camille. In men’s parts
                    he fails still more completely. As the decency of his stage would not allow him
                    to make his heroes frankly heroic, so it would not allow him to make them
                    utterly passionate. He had, moreover, cut away from himself by the adoption of
                    the Senecan model all the opportunities which would have been offered to his
                    remarkably varied talent on a freer stage. It is indeed tolerably certain that
                    he never could have achieved the purely poetical comedy of <hi rend="italic">As
                    You Like It</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Vida cs Sueno,</hi> but the admirable
                    success of <hi rend="italic">Les Plaideurs</hi> makes it at least probable that
                    he might have done something in a lower and a more conventional style. From all
                    this, however, he deliberately cut himself off. Of the whole world which is
                    subject to the poet he took only a narrow artificial and conventional fraction.
                    Within these narrow bounds he did work which no admirer of literary
                    craftsmanship can regard without admiration. But at the same time no one
                    speaking with competence can deny that the bounds are narrow. It would be
                    unnecessary to contrast his performances with his limitations so sharply if
                    those limitations had not been denied. But they have been and are still denied
                    by persons whose sentence carries weight, and therefore it is still necessary to
                    point out the fact of their existence.</p>
                <p>Nearly all Racine’s works are mentioned in the above notice. There is here no
                    room for a bibliographical account of their separate appearances. The first
                    collected edition was in 1675-76, and contained the nine tragedies which had
                    then appeared. The last and most complete which appeared in the poet’s lifetime
                    (1697) was revised by him, and contains the dramas and a few miscellaneous
                    works. Like the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps,</hi> it is in 2 vols. 12mo.
                    The posthumous editions are innumerable and gradually became more and more
                    complete. The most noteworthy are the Amsterdam edition of 1722; that by Abbé
                    cfOlivet, also at Amsterdam, 1743; the Paris quarto of 1760; the edition of
                    Luneau de Boisjermain, Paris and London, 1768; the magnificent illustrated
                    folios of 1805 (Paris); the edition of Germain Gamier with La Harpe’s
                    commentary, 1807; Geoffroy’s of the next year; Aimé Martin’s of 1820; and
                    lastly, the <hi rend="italic">grands écrivains</hi> edition of Paul Mesnard
                    (Paris, 1865-73). This last contains almost all that is necessary for the study
                    of the poet, and has been chiefly used in preparing the above notice. Louis
                    Racine’s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> was first published in 1747. Translations
                    and imitations of Racine are innumerable. In English the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Distressed Mother</hi> of Philips and the <hi rend="italic">Phaedra and
                    Hippolytus</hi> of Smith, both composed more or less under Addison’s influence,
                    are the most noteworthy. (G. SA.)</p>
