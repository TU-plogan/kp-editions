                    Soissons and Rheims, was afterwards attached to the cathedral of Chartres, and
                    became canon of Compiègne. It seems most probable that Roscellinus was not
                    strictly the first to promulgate nominalistic doctrines; but in his exposition
                    they received more definite expression, and, being applied to the dogma of the
                    Trinity, attracted universal attention. The chief opponent of Roscellinus was
                    Anselm of Canterbury, w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ho defended at once the
                    realistic doctrine of universals and the orthodox tradition of the church. It
                    appears from the polemic of Anselm that “the heretics in dialectic” whom he
                    combats denied the substantial reality of universals, asserting, for example,
                    that colour has no real existence except as coloured body. There is no reason,
                    however, to suppose that Roscellinus meant thereby to deny the real existence of
                    attributive differences in things, though Anselm endeavours to involve him in
                    that consequence. But we may conclude from the censure of his pupil Abelard that
                    his reaction against realism had led Roscellinus into rashness of expression. In
                    conformity with his general nominalistic position, Roscellinus taught that
                    whatever exists as a real thing or substance exists as one self-identical whole,
                    and is not susceptible of division into parts. This was the part of his teaching
                    which created so much scandal when applied to the doctrine of the Trinity.
                    Roscellinus maintained that it is merely a habit of speech which prevents
                    outspeaking of the three persons as three substances or three Gods. If it were
                    otherwise, and the three persons were really one substance or thing <hi
                    rend="italic">(fitηa res),</hi> we should be forced to admit that the Father and
                    the Holy Spirit became incarnate along with the Son. Roscellinus seems to have
                    put forward this doctrine in perfect good faith, and to have claimed for it at
                    first the authority of Lanfranc and Anselm. In 1092, however, a council convoked
                    by the archbishop of Rheims condemned his interpretation, and Roscellinus, who
                    was in danger of being lynched by the orthodox populace, recanted his error. As
                    his enforced penitence did not prove lasting, his opinions were condemned by a
                    second council (1094), and he himself fled to England. Forced by a fresh
                    persecution to return to France at a later date, he taught at Tours and
                    Loc-menach in Brittany (where he had Abelard as a pupil), and resided <pb
