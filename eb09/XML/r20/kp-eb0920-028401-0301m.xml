                    points, which was not equalled, much less surpassed, by the greatest rabbis who

                    4to; Soncino, 1487, folio. MSS. of Rashi on the whole Bible are very rare, and
                    even those which are supposed to be such turn out, on examination, to be either
                    incomplete or defective, or both. There lies a precious MS. in Leyden (1 Seal.);
                    but it is a trifle defective in Exodus. St John’s College, Cambridge, possesses
                    a still more ancient and precious MS. (A. 3; dated 1239); but it lacks the
                    Penta-teuch and Ezra(-Nehemiah), and is defective in the end (though, it is
                    true, only in Chronicles, which is not Rashi’s, as mentioned before). But MSS.
                    of Rashi on the Pentateuch, both old and good, abound. There are few libraries
                    in Europe that have not one or two of this commentary. It is to be hoped,
                    therefore, that Dr A. Berliner, who has already edited critically Rashi on the
                    Pentateuch (Berlin, 1866, 8vo), although not on the faith of a sufficient number
                    of MSS., will soon issue a second and superior edition.</p>

                    the learned world that no such master in the Talmud had ever existed before him,
                    and that without his aid and especially his corrections of the text (then only
                    embodied in his commentary), the sea of the Baby-Ionian Talmud could not safely
                    be sailed on. He became now the teacher even of the Jews in the East. He
                    commented on the whole of the Talmud to which Gemara is attached (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mishnah),</hi> except on <hi rend="italic">Nedarim</hi> from
                    leaf 22b to the end, <hi rend="italic">Nazir</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tamid</hi> from begin-ning to end, <hi rend="italic">Baba Bathra</hi> from 29a

                    never been printed apart from the text, and so the first complete edition is
                    that contained in the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of the Babylonian
                    Talmud (Venice, 1520-23, folio). Portions had come out before with parts of the
                    Talmud (Soncino, 1483, and elsewhere later). There are MSS. containing Rashi on
                    isolated Talmudic treatises in various libraries: the Cambridge University
                    Library and British Museum have six each, the Bodleian twelve, the Paris
                    National Library seven.</p>
                <p>C. The <hi rend="italic">Religious Decisions</hi> (פסקים) given by Rashi are to
                    be found in various works, principally in the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siddur</hi> (i. and ii.) and <hi rend="italic">Happardes</hi> (Warsaw, 1870,
                    folio)—called <hi rend="italic">Happardes Haggadol</hi> to distinguish it from
                    the abridgment by R. Shemuel of Bamberg (13th century) called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Likjcute Happardes</hi> (Venice, 1519, 4to) — a work of which Rashi himself
                    seems to have laid the foundation, though other literature on other subjects is
                    now mixed up with it. Of the same nature are אסור והתר (kindly lent to the
                    writer by Dr Merzbacher of Munich) and <hi rend="italic">Hoorah</hi> (only in
                    part printed). Various halakhoth, &amp;c., are also to be found in various
                    mahzorim ( <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Cambridge MS. Add. 667, leaves
                    153-156, and elsewhere), the <hi rend="italic">Shibbole Halleket,</hi> ii. (by
                    R. Sidkiyyaliu b. Abraham Harophe, Cambridge MS. Add. 653).</p>
                <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (פיוטים).—Rashi was no poet by profession and
                    much less by genius; but he had a tenderly feeling heart, and saw the horrors of
                    the first crusade; and he wrote <hi rend="italic">Selihoth</hi> (propitiatory
                    and penitential prayers), which are by no means without their value. One is
                    embodied in the additional service of the day of atonement and begins “<hi
                    rend="italic">Tannoth Saroth</hi>” (Reshal’s <hi rend="italic">Responsa,</hi> §
                    xxix.), and several more, which form the acrostic Shelomoh bar Yishak, are found
                    in the collection of the Selihoth of the Ash-kenazic rite. It is not improbable
                    also that the Aramaic <hi rend="italic">Reshuth</hi> iv. to the Haphtarah in
                    Targum (introduction to the prophetic portion as given in Yonathan b. 'Uzz'iel’s
                    Aramaic paraphrase), which is to be found in the Reuchlinian Codex (De Lagarde,
                    <hi rend="italic">Prophetae chaldaice,</hi> Leipsic, 1872, 8vo, leaf 492), is
                    his. It is much his style, and the acrostic is Shelomoh (and not שמעק). It is
                    also very probable that <hi rend="italic">Reshuth</hi> v. is his. If so, he must
                    have composed it when very young, as several expressions in it testify.</p>
                <p>E. <hi rend="italic">Le'azim</hi> (לעזים).—In his commentaries Rashi, like R.
                    Gersliom before him and others after him, often introduces French words (chiefly
                    verbs and nouns) to give precision to his explanations. Of these <hi
                    rend="italic">Le'azim</hi> there are certainly more than 3000, and they are most
                    valuable to the student of old French. Unfortunately copyists, notably in Italy,
                    and printers subsequently, have often substituted their own vernacular for the
                    original French; there are now even Russian words to be found in Rashi. Four
                    hundred years ago explanations of some of these <hi rend="italic">Le'azim</hi>
                    and of those of Kimhi were offered by the author of <hi rend="italic">Makre
                    Dardeke</hi> (Naples, 1488). Other contributions have followed intermittingly
                    down to the present time (Brothers Bondi in <hi rend="italic">Or Esther,</hi>
                    Dessau, 1812; Dormitzer and Landau in <hi rend="italic">Marpe Lashon,</hi>
                    Odessa, 1865, 12mo). The labours of M. Arsene Darmsteter promise to be
                    exhaustive, and are based on ex-tensive collations, see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Romania,</hi> April 1872, p. 146 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p>
                <p>There is no satisfactory life of Rashi; most recent accounts rest on a <hi
                    rend="italic">Life</hi> by <hi rend="italic">Zunz</hi> (1S22), which has not
                    been reprinted in his collected works. (S. M. S.-S.)</p>
