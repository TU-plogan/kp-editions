                    and his father followed the same profession, marrying Mademoiselle Josephine
                    Carraut, daughter of a brewer in the same city, in 1757. Of this marriage four
                    children were born, two sons and two daughters, of whom Maximilien was the
                    eldest; but in 1767 Madame Derobes-pierre, as the name was then spelt, died, and
                    the disconsolate widower at once left Arras and wandered about Europe until his
                    death at Munich in 1769. The children were taken charge of by their maternal
                    grandfather and aunts, and Maximilien was sent to the college of Arras, whence
                    he was nominated in 1770 by the bishop of his native town to a bursarship at the
                    Collége Louis-le-Grand at Paris. Here he had for fellow-pupils Camille
                    Desmoulins and Stanislas Fréron. Completing his law studies with distinction,
                    and having been admitted an avocat in 1781, Robespierre returned to his native
                    city to seek for practice, and to struggle against poverty. His reputation had
                    already preceded him, and the bishop of Arras, M. de Conzié, appointed him
                    criminal judge in the diocese of Arras in March 1782. This appointment, which he
                    soon resigned, to avoid pronouncing a sentence of death, did not prevent his
                    practising at the bar, and he speedily became known as a careful and painstaking
                    advocate. His argument in the question of the legality of paratonnerres or
                    lightning-conductors, which was widely reported and translated into both English
                    and German, raised his fame as an advocate to its height, and with this success
                    his struggles against poverty were over. He now turned to the pleasures of
                    literature and society and came to be esteemed as one of the best writers and
                    most popular dandies of Arras. In December 1783 he was elected a member of the
                    academy of Arras, whose meetings he attended regularly; and, like all other
                    young Frenchmen with literary proclivities, he began to compete for the <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0625-0602"/>prizes offered by various provincial academies. In
                    1784 he obtained a medal from the academy of Metz for his essay on the question
                    whether the relatives of a condemned criminal should also be punished; but the
                    prize was awarded to Lacretelle aîné, an avocat and journalist at Paris, who
                    triumphed again over his provincial antagonist in the Γarisian press, and who in
                    after days when Robespierre was all-powerful was surprised that he was not sent
                    to the guillotine. An éloge on Gresset, the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vert-Vert</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Méchant,</hi> written for the academy
                    of Amiens in 1785, was not more successful; but Robespierre was compensated for
                    these failures by his great popularity in the society of the Rosati at Arras,—a
                    little society whose members prided themselves on being men of fashion and wit,
                    and spent one evening a week in conviviality and in reading poems, epigrams, and
                    vers de société. There the sympathetic quality of Robespierre’s voice, which
                    afterwards did him such good service in the Jacobin Club, always caused his
                    indifferent verses to be loudly applauded by his friends.</p>
                <p>Such had been the life of the future republican leader up to 1788, when he took
                    part in the discussion as to the λvay in which the states-general should be
                    elected, showing clearly and forcibly in his <hi rend="italic">Adresse à la
                    Nation Artésienne</hi> that, if the former mode of election by the members of
                    the provincial estates was again adopted, the new states-general would not
                    represent the people of France. Necker also perceived this, and therefore
                    determined to make the old royal bailliages and séné-chaussées the units of
                    election. Under this plan the city of Arras was to return twenty-four members to
                    the assembly of the bailliage of Artois, which was to elect the deputies. The
                    corporation claimed the right to a preponderating influence in these city
                    elections, and Robespierre headed the opposition, making himself very
                    conspicuous and drawing up the cahier or table of complaints and grievances, for
                    the guild of the cobblers. Although the leading members of the corporation were
                    elected, their chief opponent succeeded in getting elected with them. In the
                    assembly of the bailliage rivalry ran still higher, but Robespierre had already
                    made his mark in politics; by the <hi rend="italic">A vis aux Habitants de
                    Campagne</hi> (Arras, 1789), which is almost certainly by him, he secured the
                    support of the country electors, and, though but thirty years of age, poor, and
                    without influence, he was elected fifth deputy of the tiers état of Artois to
                    the states-general.</p>
                <p>When the states-general met at Versailles on 5th May 1789, the young deputy of
                    Artois already possessed the one faculty which was to lead him to supremacy: he
                    was a fanatic. As Mirabeau said, “That young man believes what he says; he will
                    go far.” Without the courage and wide tolerance w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi>

                    belief in himself which marks a great man, nervous, timid, and suspicious,
                    Robespierre yet believed in the doctrines of Rousseau with all his heart, and
                    would have gone to death for them; and in the belief that they would eventually
                    succeed and regenerate France and mankind he was ready to work with unwearied
                    patience. While the constituent assembly occupied itself in drawing up an
                    unworkable constitution as the grand panacea, Robespierre turned from the
                    assembly of provincial avocats and wealthy bourgeois to the people of Paris.
                    However, he spoke frequently in the constituent assembly, and often with great
                    success, and was eventually recognized as second only to Pétion de Villeneuve—if
                    second to him—as a leader of the small body of the extreme left,—the thirty
                    voices, as Mirabeau contemptuously called them. It is hardly necessary to
                    examine minutely Robespierre’s speeches and behaviour before 1791, when the
                    death of Mirabeau left the way clear for the influence of his party; but what is
                    noteworthy, as proving the religious cast of his mind and his belief in the
                    necessity of à religion, is that he spoke several times in favour of the lower
                    clergy and laboured to get their pensions increased. When he instinctively felt
                    that his doctrines would have no success in the assembly, he turned to the
                    Jacobin Club, which had consisted originally of the Breton deputies only, but
                    which, after the assembly moved to Paris, began to admit among its members
                    various leaders of the Parisian bourgeoisie. As time went on, many of the more
                    intelligent artisans and petits commerçants became members of the club, and
                    among such men Robespierre found the hearers he sought. They did more than
                    listen to him: they idolized him; the fanatical leader had found fanatics to
                    follow him, and their ultimate supremacy became merely a question of time. As
                    the wealthier bourgeois of Paris and deputies of a more moderate type seceded to
                    the club of ’89 the influence of the old leaders of the Jacobins (Barnave,
                    Duport, Charles de Lameth)diminished; and, when they themselves, alarmed at the
                    progress of the Revolution, founded the club of the Feuillants in 1791, the
                    followers of Robespierre dominated the Jacobin Club. The death of Mirabeau
                    strengthened Robespierre’s influence in the assembly; but in May 1791 he proved
                    his lack of statesmanlike insight and his jealous suspicion of his colleagues by
                    proposing and carrying the motion that no deputies who sat in the constituent
                    could sit in the succeeding assembly. The flight of the king on 2lst June and
                    his arrest at Varennes excited Robespierre’s suspicions, and made him declare
                    himself at the Jacobin Club to be “ni monarchiste ni républicain.” But the
                    vigorous conduct of Lafayette and the National Guard on the Champ de Mars on
                    l7th July 1791 terrified him, for he believed that he was a predestined victim,
                    until he was succoured by Duplay, a cabinetmaker in the Rue St Honoré, and an
                    ardent admirer of his, in whose house he lived (with but two short intervals)
                    till his death. At last came his day of triumph, when on 30th September, on the
                    dissolution of the constituent assembly, the people of Paris crowned Pétion and
                    himself as the two incorruptible patriots.</p>
                <p>On the dissolution of the assembly he returned for a short visit to Arras, where
                    he met with a triumphant reception. In November he returned to Paris, and on
                    18th December made a speech which marks a new epoch in his life. Brissot, the
                    <hi rend="italic">dme politique</hi> of the Girondin party which had been formed
                    in the legislative assembly, urged vehemently that war should be declared
                    against Austria, and the queen was equally urgent in the hope that a victorious
                    army might restore the old absolutism of the Bourbons. Two men opposed the
                    projects of the queen and the Girondins,—Marat and Robespierre: Marat opposed
                    them for statesmanlike reasons (see Marat), and Robespierre on humanitary
                    grounds and because as a follower of Rousseau he disliked war. This opposition
                    from those whom they had expected to aid them irritated the Girondins greatly,
                    and from that moment began the struggle which ended in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >coups Pétat</hi> of 3lst May and 2d June 1793. Guadet accused Robespierre of
                    superstition in believing in a providence, and declared that, as the people’s
                    idol, he ought to ostracize himself for the good of his country. Robespierre
                    persisted in his opposition to the war, and the Girondins, especially Brissot,
                    attacked him so violently that in April 1792 he resigned the post of public
                    prosecutor at the tribunal of Paris, which he had Held since February, and
                    started a journal, <hi rend="italic">Le Défenseur de la Constitution,</hi> in
                    his own defence. It is noteworthy that during the summer months of 1792, in
                    which the fate ,f the Bourbon dynasty was being sealed, neither the Girondins in
                    the legislative assembly nor Robespierre took any active part in overthrowing
                    it. Stronger men with practical instincts of statesmanship, like Danton and <pb

                    who dared to look facts in the face and take the responsibility of doing while
                    others were talking, were the men who made the 10th of August and took the
                    Tuileries. The Girondins, however, were quite ready to take advantage of the
                    accomplished fact; and Robespierre, likewise, though shocked at the shedding of
                    blood, was willing to take his seat on the commune of Paris, which had
                    overthrown Louis XVI., and might check the Girondins. The strong men of the
                    commune were glad to have Robespierre’s assistance, not because they cared for
                    him or believed in him, but because of the help got from his popularity, his
                    reputation for virtue, and his influence over the Jacobin Club and its branches,
                    which spread all over France. He it was who presented the petition of the
                    commune of Paris on lβth August to the legislative assembly, demanding the
                    establishment of a revolutionary tribunal and the summons of a convention. The
                    massacres of September in the prisons, which Robespierre in vain attempted to
                    stop, showed that the commune had more confidence in Billaud than in him. Yet,
                    as a proof of his personal popularity, he was a few days later elected first
                    deputy for Paris to the national convention.</p>
                <p>On the meeting of the convention the Girondins immediately attacked Robespierre;
                    they were jealous of his popularity and knew that his single-hearted fanaticism
                    would never forgive their intrigues with the king at the end of July, and would
                    always be opposed to their plans for raising the duke of Orleans to the throne.
                    As early as 26th September the Girondin Lasource accused him of aiming at the
                    dictatorship; afterwards he was informed that Marat, Danton, and himself were
                    plotting to become triumvirs; and eventually on 29th October Louvet attacked him
                    in a studied and declamatory harangue, abounding in ridiculous falsehoods and
                    obviously concocted in Madame Roland’s boudoir. But Robespierre had no
                    difficulty in rebutting this attack (5th November). All personal disputes,
                    however, gave way by the month of December 1792 before the great question of the
                    king’s trial, and here Robespierre took up a position which is at least easily
                    understood. These are his words spoken on 3d December: “This is no trial; Louis
                    is not a prisoner at the bar; you are not judges; you are—you cannot but be
                    statesmen, and the representatives of the nation. You have not to pass sentence
                    for or against a single man, but you have to take a resolution on a question of
                    the public safety, and to decide a question of national foresight. It is with
                    regret that I pronounce the fatal truth; Louis ought to perish rather than a
                    hundred thousand virtuous citizens; Louis must die, that the country may live.”
                    This great question settled by the king’s execution, the struggle between
                    Robespierre and the Girondins entered upon a more acute stage, and the want of
                    statesmanship among the latter threw upon the side of the fanatical Robespierre
                    Danton and all those strong practical men who cared little for personal
                    questions, and whose only desire was the victory of France in her great struggle
                    with Europe. Had it been at all possible to act with that group of men of genius
                    whom history calls the Girondins, Danton, Carnot, Robert Lindet, and even
                    Billaud-Varenne would have sooner thrown in their lot with them than with
                    Robespierre, whom they thoroughly understood; but the Girondins, spurred on by
                    Madame Roland, refused to have anything to do with Danton. Government became
                    impossible; the federalist idea, which would have broken France to pieces in the
                    very face of the enemy, grew and flourished, and the men of action had to take a
                    decided part. In the month of May 1793 Camille Desmoulins, acting under the
                    inspiration of Robespierre and Danton, published his <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    des Bmssotins</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bmssot devoile;</hi></p>
                <p>Isnard declared· that Paris must be destroyed; Robespierre preached insurrection
                    at the Jacobin Club; and on 3lst May and 2d June the commune of Paris destroyed
                    the Girondin party. For a moment it seemed as if France would avenge them; but
                    patriotism was stronger than federalism. The defence of Lyons only exasperated
                    the men who were working for France, and the armies who were fighting for her,
                    and on 27th July 1793, when the struggle was practically decided, the convention
                    elected Robespierre to the committee of public safety.</p>
                <p>This election marks an important epoch, not only in the life of Robespierre, but
                    in the history of the Revolution. Danton and the men of action had throughout
                    the last two years of the crisis, as Mirabeau had in the first two years, seen
                    that the one great need of France, if she was to see the end of her troubles
                    without the interference of foreign armies, was the existence of a strong
                    executive government. The means for establishing the much-needed strong
                    executive were found in the committee of public safety. The success of this
                    committee in suppressing the Norman insurrection had confirmed the majority of
                    the convention in the expediency of strengthening its powers, and the committee
                    of general security which sat beside it was also strengthened and given the
                    entire management of the internal police of the country. When Danton, who had
                    been a member of the committee from April to lθth July 1793, left it Robespierre
                    was elected; and it was not until then that he became one of the actual rulers
                    of France. Indeed the committee was not finally constituted until the l3th of
                    September, when the last two of the “great” twelve who held office until July
                    1794 were elected. Of these twelve at least seven, Carnot, Billaud-Varenne,
                    Collot d’Herbois, Prieur (of the Marne), Prieur (of the Côte d’Or), Jean Bon
                    Saint-André, and Robert Lindet, were essentially men of action, all of whom
                    despised rather than feared Robespierre owing to his supposed timidity, and were
                    entirely free from his influence. Of the other four Hérault de Séchelles was a
                    professed adherent of Danton; Barère was an eloquent Provençal, who was ready to
                    be the spokesman to the convention of any view which the majority of the
                    committee might adopt; and only Couthon and Saint-Just shared Robespierre’s
                    political enthusiasm for the regeneration of France by the gospel of Rousseau.
                    It is necessary to dwell upon the fact that Robespierre was always in a minority
                    in the great committee in order to absolve him from the blame of being the
                    inventor of the enormities of the Terror, as well as to deprive him of the glory
                    of the gallant stand made against Europe in arms.</p>
                <p>After this examination of Robespierre’s position it is not necessary to
                    investigate closely every act of the great committee during the year which was
                    pre-eminently the year of the Terror; the biographer is rather called upon to
                    examine his personal position with regard to the establishment of the Terror and
                    the fall of the Hébertists and Dantonists, and then to dwell upon the last three
                    months in which he stood almost alone trying to work up an effective
                    counterbalance to the power of the majority of the great committee. The Terror
                    was the embodiment of the idea of Danton, that it was necessary to have resort
                    to extreme measures to keep France united and strong at home in order to meet
                    successfully her enemies upon the frontier. This idea was systematized by the
                    committee of public safety, or rather by two members of it acting for the
                    majority, Billaud-Varenne and Collot d’Herbois, without much consideration as to
                    who were to be the victims. With the actual organization of the Terror
                    Robespierre had little or nothing to do; its two great engines, the
                    revolutionary tribunal and the absolute power in the provinces of the
                    representatives on mission, were in existence before he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n627/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0627-0604"/>joined the committee of public safety, and the
                    laws of the maximum and of the suspects were by no means of his creation. The
                    reason why he is almost universally regarded as its creator and the dominant
                    spirit in the committee of public safety is not hard to discover. Men like
                    Carnot and Billaud-Varenne were not conspicuous speakers in the convention, nor
                    were they the idols of any section of the populace; but Robespierre had a
                    fanatical following among the Jacobins and was admittedly the most popular
                    orator in the convention. His panegyrics on the system of revolutionary
                    government and his praise of virtue led his hearers to believe that the system
                    of the Terror, instead of being monstrous, was absolutely laudable; his pure
                    life and admitted incorruptibility threw a lustre on the committee of which he
                    was a member; and his colleagues offered no opposition to his posing as their
                    representative and reflecting some of his personal popularity upon them so long
                    as he did not interfere with their work. Moreover, he alone never left Paris,
                    whilst all the others, except Barere, were constantly engaged on missions to the
                    armies, the navy, and the provinces. It has been asserted that Robespierre,
                    Couthon, and Saint-Just took upon themselves the direction of “la haute
                    politique,” while the other members acted only in subordinate capacities;
                    undoubtedly it would have suited Robespierre to have had this believed, but as a
                    matter of fact he was in no way especially trusted in matters of supreme
                    importance.</p>
                <p>After this explanation it may be said at once that Robespierre was not the author
                    of the overthrow of the Dantonists and the Hébertists, though he thoroughly
                    agreed with the majority and had no desire to save them, the principles of both
                    parties being obnoxious to him. The Hébertists were communists in the true
                    meaning of the word. They held that each commune should be self-governing, and,
                    while admitting the right of a central authority to levy men and money for the
                    purposes of the state, they believed that in purely internal matters, as well as
                    in determining the mode in which men and money were to be raised, the local
                    government ought to be supreme. This position of the Hébertists was of course
                    obnoxious to the great committee, who believed that success could only be won by
                    their retention of absolute power; and in the winter of 1791-95 it became
                    obvious that the Hébertist party must perish, or its opposition to the committee
                    would grow too formidable owing to its paramount influence in the commune of
                    Paris. Robespierre shared his colleagues’ fear of the Hébertist opinions, and he
                    had a personal reason for disliking that party of atheists and sansculottes,
                    since he believed in the necessity of religious faith, and was too much of a
                    gentleman not to detest their imitation of the grossness that belongs to the
                    lowest class of the populace. In 1792 he had indignantly thrown from him the cap
                    of liberty which an ardent admirer had placed upon his head; he had never
                    pandered to the depraved tastes of the mob by using their language; and to the
                    last day of his life he wore knee-breeches and silk stockings and wore his hair
                    powdered. His position towards the Dantonist party was of a different character.
                    After having seen established the strong executive he had laboured for, and
                    having moved the resolutions which finally consolidated the power of the
                    committee of public safety in September 1793, Danton retired to his country
                    house to enjoy the pleasures of domestic life. But to his retreat came the news
                    of the means the committee used to maintain their supremacy. Danton was not a
                    man who scrupled to shed blood when necessary, but he did not see that this
                    continuous series of sacrifices on the guillotine was necessary; hence he
                    inspired Camille Desmoulins to protest against the Terror in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vieux Cordelier,</hi> the noblest expression of revolutionary
                    thought. Where is this system of terror to end? what is the good of a tyranny
                    comparable only to that of the Roman emperors as described by Tacitus? Such were
                    the questions which Camille Desmoulins asked under Danton’s inspiration. This
                    “moderantism,” as it was called, was as objectionable to the members of the
                    great committee as the doctrines of the Hébertists. Both parties must be
                    crushed. Before the blows at the leaders of those two parties were struck,
                    Robespierre retired for a month (from 13th February to l3th March 1794) from
                    active business in the convention and the committee, apparently to consider his
                    position; but he came to the conclusion that the cessation of the Reign of
                    Terror would mean the loss of that supremacy by which he hoped to establish the
                    ideal of Rousseau, for Danton, he knew, was essentially a practical statesman
                    and laughed at his ideas. He must have considered too that the result of his
                    siding with Danton would probably have been fatal to himself. The result of his
                    deliberations was that he abandoned Danton and co-operated in the attacks of the
                    committee on the two parties. On the l5th of March he reappeared in the
                    convention; on the 19th Hébert and his friends were arrested; and on the 24th
                    they were guillotined. On the 30th of March Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and
                    their friends were arrested, and on the 5th of April they too were
                    guillotined.</p>
                <p>It was not until after the execution of Danton that Robespierre began to develop
                    a policy distinct from that of his colleagues in the great committee, an
                    opposition which ended in his downfall. He began by using his influence over the
                    Jacobin Club to dominate the commune of Paris through his devoted adherents, two
                    of whom, Fleuriot-Lescot and Payan, were elected respectively mayor and
                    procureur of the commune. He also attempted to usurp the influence of the other
                    members of the great committee over the armies by getting his young adherent,
                    Saint-Just, sent on a mission to the frontier. In Paris Robespierre determined
                    to increase the pressure of the Terror: no one should accuse him of moderantism;
                    through the increased efficiency of the revolutionary tribunal Paris should
                    tremble before him as the chief member of the great committee; and the
                    convention should pass whatever measures he might dictate. To secure his aims,
                    Couthon, his other ally in the committee, proposed and carried on the lθth of
                    June the outrageous law of 2 2d Prairial, by which even the appearance of
                    justice was taken from the tribunal, which, as no witnesses were allowed, became
                    a simple court of condemnation. The result of this law was that between the l2th
                    of June and the 28th of July, the day of Robespierre’s death, no less than 1285
                    victims perished on the guillotine at Paris. But before this there had taken
                    place in Robespierre’s life an episode of supreme importance as illustrating his
                    character and his political aims: on the 7th of May he secured a decree from the
                    convention recognizing the existence of the Supreme Being. In His honour a great
                    fête was held on the 8th of June; Robespierre, as president of the convention,
                    walked first and delivered his harangue, and as he looked around him he may well
                    have believed that his position was secured and that he was at last within reach
                    of a supreme power which should enable him to impose his belief on all France,
                    and so ensure its happiness. The majority of the great committee found his
                    popularity—or rather his ascendency, for as that increased his personal
                    popularity diminished—useful to them, since by increasing the stringency of the
                    Terror he strengthened the position of the committee, whilst attracting to
                    himself, as occupying the most prominent position in it, any latent feeling of
                    dissatisfaction at such stringency. Of the issue of a struggle between
                    themselves and Robespierre they had little fear: they controlled the committee
                    of general security through their alliance with its leaders,</p>

                <p>Amar and Vadier; they were certain of obtaining a majority in the convention, for
                    they knew that the chief deputies on the left or the Mountain were Dantonists,
                    who burned to avenge Danton’s death; while they felt sure also that the mass of
                    the deputies of the centre or the Marsh could be hounded on against Robespierre
                    if they were to accuse him of aiming at the dictatorship and pour on him the
                    obloquy of having increased the Terror; and they knew finally that his actual
                    adherents, though devoted to him, were few in number. The devotion of these
                    admirers had been further excited by the news that a half-witted girl, named
                    Cécile Renault, had been found wandering near his house, with a knife in her
                    possession, intending to play the part of Charlotte Corday. She was executed on
                    the 17 th of June, on the very day that Vadier raised a laugh at Robespierre’s
                    expense in the convention by his report on the conspiracy of Catherine Théot, a
                    mad woman, who had asserted that Robespierre was a divinity.</p>
                <p>For a statesman to be laughed at in France is fatal to his power, and Robespierre
                    himself felt that he must strike his blow now or never. Yet he was not
                    sufficiently audacious to strike at once, as Payan and Coffinhal, the ablest of
                    his adherents, would have had him do, but retired from the convention for some
                    weeks, as he had done before the overthrow of the Hébertists and the Dantonists,
                    to prepare his plan of action. This retirement seemed ominous to the majority of
                    the great committee, and they too prepared for the struggle by communicating
                    with the deputies of the Mountain, who were either friends of Danton or men of
                    proved energy like Barras, Frèron, and Tallien. These weeks, the last of his
                    life, Robespierre passed very peacefully, according to his wont all through the
                    Revolution. He continued to live with the Duplays, with whose daughter Éléonore
                    he had fallen in love, and used to wander with her and his favourite dog, a
                    great Danish hound, named Bruant, in the Champs Élysées during the long summer
                    evenings. At last, on the 26th of July, Robespierre appeared for the first time
                    for more than four weeks in the convention and delivered a carefully studied
                    harangue, which lasted for more than four hours, in which he declared that the
                    Terror ought to be ended, that certain deputies who had acted unjustly and
                    exceeded their powers ought to be punished, and that the committees of public
                    safety and general security ought to be renewed. Great was the excitement in the
                    convention: all wondered who were the deputies destined to be punished; all were
                    surprised that the Terror should be imputed as a fault to the very committee of
                    which Robespierre had been a member. The majority of the great committee
                    determined to act promptly. The convention, moved by Robespierre’s eloquence, at
                    first passed his motions; but he was replied to by Cambon the financier,
                    Billaud-Varenne, Amar, and Vadier, and the convention rescinded their decrees
                    and referred Robespierre’s question to their committees. On the following day,
                    the 27th of July, or in the revolutionary calendar the 9th Thermidor, Saint-Just
                    commenced to speak on behalf of the motions of Robespierre, when violent
                    interruptions showed the temper of the convention. Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, and
                    Vadier again attacked Robespierre; cries of “Down with the tyrant !” were
                    raised; and; when Robespierre hesitated in his speech in answer to these
                    attacks, the words “C’est le sang de Danton qui t’étouffe” showed what was
                    uppermost in the minds of the Mountain. The excitement increased, and at five in
                    the afternoon Robespierre, Couthon, and Saint-Just, with two young deputies,
                    Augustin Robespierre and Lebas, the only men in all the convention who supported
                    them, were ordered to be arrested. Yet all hope for Robespierre was not gone; he
                    was speedily rescued from his prison with the other deputies by the troops of
                    the commune and brought to the Hôtel de Ville. There he was surrounded by his
                    faithful adherents, led by Payan and Coffinhal, but the day was past when the
                    commune could overawe the convention; for now the men of action were hostile to
                    the commune, and its chief was not a master of <hi rend="italic">coups
                    dieted.</hi> On the news of the release of Robespierre, the convention had again
                    met, and declared the members of the commune and the released deputies <hi
                    rend="italic">hors de la loi.</hi> The national guards under the command of
                    Barras had little difficulty in making their way to the Hôtel de Ville;
                    Robespierre was shot in the lower jaw by a young gendarme named Merda while
                    signing an appeal to one of the sections of Paris to take up arms for him,
                    though the wound was afterwards believed to have been inflicted by himself; and
                    all the released deputies were again arrested. After a night of agony
                    Robespierre was the next day taken before the tribunal, where his identity as an
                    outlaw was proved, and without further trial he was executed with Couthon and
                    Saint-Just and nineteen others of his adherents on the Place de la Révolution on
                    the lθth Thermidor (28th July) 1794.</p>
                <p>The character of Robespierre when looked upon simply in the light of his actions
                    and his authenticated speeches, and apart from the innumerable legends which
                    have grown up about it, is not a difficult one to understand. A well-educated
                    and accomplished young lawyer, he might have acquired a good provincial practice
                    and lived a happy provincial life had it not been for the Revolution. Like
                    thousands of other young Frenchmen, he had read the works of Rousseau and taken
                    them as gospel. Just at the very time in life when this illusion had not been
                    destroyed by the realities of life, and without the experience which might have
                    taught the futility of idle dreams and theories, he was elected to the
                    states-general. At Paris he was not understood till he met with his audience of
                    fellow-disciples of Rousseau at the Jacobin Club. His fanaticism won him
                    supporters; his singularly sweet and sympathetic voice gained him hearers; and
                    his upright life attracted the admiration of all. As matters approached nearer
                    and nearer to the terrible crisis, he failed, except in the two instances of the
                    question of war and of the king’s trial, to show himself a statesman, for he had
                    not the liberal views and practical instincts which made Mirabeau and Danton
                    great men. His admission to the great committee gave him power, which he hoped
                    to use for the establishment of his favourite theories, and for the same purpose
                    he acquiesced in and even heightened the horrors of the Reign of Terror. It is
                    here that the fatal mistake of allowing a theorist to have power appeared:
                    Billaud-Varenne systematized the Terror because he believed it necessary for the
                    safety of the country; Robespierre intensified it in order to carry out his own
                    ideas and theories. Robespierre’s private life was always respectable: he was
                    always emphatically a gentleman and man of culture, and even a little bit of a
                    dandy, scrupulously honest, truthful, and charitable. In his habits and manner
                    of life he was simple and laborious; he was not a man gifted with flashes of
                    genius, but one who had to think much before he could come to a decision, and he
                    worked hard all his life.</p>
                <p>The great authority for Robespierre’s life is Ernest Hamel’s elaborate <hi
                    rend="italic">Vie de Robespierre,</hi> 3 vols., Paris, 1865-67, in which every
                    fact regarding him is carefully sifted; it is indeed an unqualified defence and
                    eulogy throughout, but, without adopting his particular views, Hamel’s biography
                    is the only one of any value. Consult also for his early life M. Paris’s <hi
                    rend="italic">La Jeunesse de Robespierre.</hi> Tlιe <hi rend="italic">Mémoires
                    de Robespierre</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires de Charlotte
                    Robespierre</hi> are both worthless forgeries. (H. M. S.)</p>
