                    performance of a public duty, are as a general rule admissible in evidence
                    merely on the production from the proper custody of the registers themselves or
                    (in most cases) of examined or certified copies. The extent to which
                    registration is carried varies very much in different countries. For obvious
                    reasons judicial decisions are registered in all countries alike. In other
                    matters no general rule can be laid down, except perhaps that on the whole
                    registration is not as fully enforced in the United Kingdom and the United
                    States as in Continental states. The most important uses of registration occur
                    in the case of judicial proceedings, land, ships, bills of sale, births,
                    marriages, and deaths, companies, friendly and other societies, newspapers,
                    copyrights, patents, designs, trade marks, and professions and occupations. The
                    registration of qualified voters in parliamentary elections in the United
                    Kingdom is treated in a separate section below.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Judicial Proceedings</hi> .—In England registrars are attached
                    to the privy council, the Supreme Court, and the county courts. In the Queen’s
                    Bench Division (except in its bankruptcy jurisdiction) the duty of registrars is
                    performed by the masters. Besides exercising limited judicial authority,
                    registrars are responsible for the drawing ־up and recording of various stages
                    of the proceedings from the petition, writ, or plaint to the final decision.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The antiquity of
                    registration of this kind is proved by the age of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Registrum Brevium,</hi> or register of writs, called by Lord Coke “a most
                    ancient book of the Common Law” (Coke upon Littleton, 159a). </p></note> With
                    them are filed affidavits, depositions, pleadings, &amp;c., when such filing is
                    necessary. The difference between filing and registration is that the documents
                    filed are filed without alteration, while only an epitome is usually registered.
                    The Judicature Act, 1873, created district registries in the chief towns, the
                    district registrar having an authority similar to that of a registrar of the
                    Supreme Court. In the Admiralty Division cases of account are usually referred
                    to the registrar and merchants. The registration in the central office of the
                    supreme court of judgments affecting lands, writs of execution, recognizances,
                    and <hi rend="italic">litespendentes</hi> in England, and the registration in
                    Scotland of abbreviates of adjudications and of inhibitions, are governed by
                    special legislation. All these are among the incumbrances for which search is
                    made on investigating a title. Their satisfaction and discharge is also
                    registered. The Conveyancing Act, 1882, provides for a certificate by the proper
                    officer of the existence or non-existence of entries of judgments, deeds, and
                    other matters or documents made in the central office. The certificate is
                    conclusive in favour of a purchaser. Decisions of criminal courts are said to be
                    recorded, not registered, except in the case of courts of summary jurisdiction,
                    in which, by the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, a register of convictions is
                    kept. Probates of ־wills and letters of administration, which are really
                    judicial decisions, are registered in the principal or district registries of
                    the Probate Division. In Scotland registration'is used for giving a summary
                    remedy on obligations without action by means of the fiction of a judicial
                    decision having been given establishing the obligation. A clause of registration
                    is introduced in deeds importing obligation. The various registers available for
                    this kind, of registraton will be found in Watson, <hi rend="italic">Law Diet.,
                    s.v. “</hi> Registration.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Land.</hi> —Registration in its relation to land is either of
                    title or of assurances. A register of title bears on the face of it the name and
                    description of a plot of land with more or less particularity, the name of the
                    owner, and the charges and easements to which the land is subject. No one can go
                    behind the entry except in case of fraud. A register of assurances or deeds
                    contains only a copy of documents affecting title, or a memorial qr other
                    epitome of such documents, without any authentication of the title as such. Thus
                    a register of title would show that A was owner subject to a mortgage to B, and
                    the purchaser would purchase such a title. A register of assurances would show
                    in the same circumstances that a conveyance had been made to A, and that
                    subsequently A had mortgaged to B, but the purchaser would have to make sure for
                    himself that A and B had the right to convey and mortgage. It will be obvious
                    that the object of registration of deeds is quite different from that of
                    registration of title. The former aims at facilitating the search for
                    incumbrances, the latter at abolishing search by making it unnecessary. The
                    requisites of a registry of title are thus stated by Sir H. Maine ( <hi
                    rend="italic">Early Law and Custom,</hi> 353):—</p>
                <p>“The land registries which have the highest commendation from judicial writers
                    are those of certain small Teutonic communities, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    the state of Htsse-Darmstadt and the Swiss canton of Zurich. I can here give hut
                    a brief description of the mechanism. The land of the community is divided into
                    a number of circumscriptions of no great area. For each of these a central
                    office is established, with a staff of functionaries who are to some extent
                    experts, and at eacli office a register is opened in which separate portions or
                    groups of pages are appropriated to separate masses of land . . . When the
                    register has once been opened, the legal history of every parcel of every area
                    is thenceforward recorded in it, and every transfer or mortgage must be
                    registered in it, under pain of invalidity. Whether a person wishing to sell or
                    mortgage has the right to do so, it is the business of the staff of experts to
                    ascertain. It is absolutely essential to the system that the register should be
                    easily accessible, and the formalities of registration simple and cheap.”</p>
                <p>It will appear on referring to <hi rend="smallcaps">Real Estate</hi> that before
                    the Conquest publicity of transfer was secured by a system of record in the
                    sliire-book or church-book. After the Conquest this publicity, continued for a
                    time in the Domesday survey, from various causes gradually gave way to that
                    secrecy of transfer which is now one of the peculiar features of English law.
                    Publicity was to a certain extent secured by the court rolls in the case of
                    copyhold lands, by the local statutes mentioned below, and by the Act enforcing
                    the registration of rent charges and annuities charged on land (18 Vict. c. 15).
                    There was a tendency in the same direction in those statutes which made the
                    enrolment of deeds necessary for their validity. Such are the Statute of
                    Enrolments, 27 Henry VIII. c. 16, the Mortmain Act, 9 Geo. II. c. 36, the Fines
                    and Recoveries Act, 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 74, under which an estate tail may be
                    barred by an enrolled deed, ard Acts affecting Queen Anne’s Bounty, 1 Geo. I.,
                    st. 2, c. 10, and the Charity Commissioners, 18 &amp; 19 Viet, c. 124. No
                    general registry has as yet been established in England, though many attempts
                    have been made in that direction. The question was debated as far back as the
                    Long Parliament. General Ludlow mentions the characteristic incident “that upon
                    the debate of ‘ registering deeds in each county for want of which, within a
                    certain time fixed after the sale, such sales should be void, and, being so
                    regarded, that lands should not be subject to any incumbrance,’ this word
                    incumbrance was so managed that it took up three months’ time before it could be
                    ascertained by the committee” ( <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> , i. 436). In the
                    reign of Charles II. a registry of deeds was established for the Bedford Level
                    by 15 Car. II. c. 17. I n the reign of Anne registries of deeds and wills were
                    established <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0360-0343"/>for the county of Middlesex (7 Anne c. 20), for
                    the West Riding of Yorkshire (2 &amp; 3 Anne c. 4), and for the East Riding and
                    Kingston-upon-Hull (6 Anne c. 35). Similar provisions were not applied to the
                    North Riding until 8 Geo. II. c. 6. The Yorkshire Acts were consolidated and
                    amended by the Yorkshire Registries Act, 1884. “Under these Acts, all deeds are
                    to be adjudged fraudulent and void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee
                    for valuable consideration, unless a memorial of such deeds be duly registered
                    before the registering of the memorial of the deed under which such subsequent
                    purchaser or mortgagee shall claim” (Williams, <hi rend="italic">Real
                    Property,</hi> pt. i. ch. x.). Priority thus depends upon the date of
                    registration. The Acts do not extend to copyholds, to leaseholds for a term not
                    exceeding twenty-one years, or to chambers in an Inn of Court. The full
                    operation of the Registry Acts has been to a certain extent affected by the
                    doctrines of equity that an equitable mortgage by deposit of deeds is valid
                    without registration, and that notice of a prior unregistered deed is within
                    limits equivalent to registration. “It shall only be in cases where the notice
                    is so clearly proved as to make it fraudulent in the purchaser to take and
                    register a conveyance in prejudice to the known title of another that we will
                    suffer the registered deed to be affected” (Sir William Grant in Wyatt <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Barwell, 19 Vesey’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 438).
                    On this subject the Yorkshire Registries Act, 1884, provides by § 14 that “all
                    priorities given by this Act shall have full effect in all cases except in cases
                    of actual fraud, and all persons claiming thereunder any legal or equitable
                    interests shall be entitled to corresponding priorities, and no such person
                    shall lose any such priority merely in consequence of his having been affected
                    with actual or constructive notice, except in cases of actual fraud. <hi
                    rend="italic">”</hi> The Act provides for an official search of the same nature
                    as that introduced by the Conveyancing Act, 1882, and for the entry of a caveat
                    against registration ·by any person interested. Passing to general registration,
                    a general registry of deeds was recommended by the real property commissioners
                    in 1830. The royal commission of 1854 reported in 1857 in favour of general
                    registration of title. In pursuance of this report the Land Registry Act, 1862
                    (“Lord Westbury’s Act”), was passed. It provided for the optional registration
                    of such titles to freeholds and leaseholds in freeholds as a court of equity
                    should hold to be marketable. It was of little importance in practice on account
                    of its making a marketable title ( <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> such a title as
                    the court would compel an unwilling purchaser to accept) and a definition of
                    boundaries necessary, and of its not giving an indefeasible title in effect,
                    though it does so in name, until there had been dealing with the land for
                    valuable consideration subsequent to registration. The Act is still law as to
                    titles registered under it and not reregistered under the Act of 1875. On the
                    same day as the Land Registry Act was passed the Declaration of Title Act, 1862,
                    under which power is given to any person entitled to apply for the registration
                    of an indefeasible title under the Land Registry Act to apply to the Court of
                    Chancery for a declaration of title, and the court, on proof of a marketable
                    title, is to issue a certificate of title under the seal of the court. The Land
                    Registry Act was condemned by the report of a royal commission in 1870. In 1875
                    some of the recommendations of the commission were adopted in the Land Transfer
                    Act, 1875 (“Lord Cairns’s Act”), the latest general enactment on the subject.
                    The Act of 1875 allows the optional registration of a title less than
                    marketable, and the land certificate delivered to the proprietor is to state
                    whether his title be absolute, qualified, or possessory. Two or more persons may
                    be registered as joint proprietors. No notice of any trust is to appear on the
                    register. To be registered land must be either freehold or leasehold for an
                    unexpired term of at least twenty-one years. Land in Middlesex or Yorkshire
                    registered under the Act ceases to be within the jurisdiction of the local
                    registries. A caution against registration may be lodged by any person
                    interested. The Act established an office of land registry under a registrar
                    appointed by the lord chancellor. There was also a power of creating district
                    registries, if necessary. The Act, like its predecessor, lias been very little
                    used. A compulsory system of registration of title in England has been so
                    universally recognized as expedient that its adoption can only be a question of
                    time. The chief difficulties in the way of a reform are the objection of the
                    landowners to publicity of transactions in land, the expense, greater than in
                    other countries or in the colonies, arising from the complexity of the English
                    law of real property, and, not least, the conservative instincts of the legal
                    profession. One effect of registration will be to much diminish the importance
                    of the legal doctrines of <hi rend="smallcaps">Possession</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Limitation</hi> ( <hi rend="italic">q.v</hi> .). “It is a grave
                    question whether the establishment of titles by long possession is consistent
                    with a complete and efficient system of registration. In Scotland, where there
                    is such a system, there is nothing answering to our Statute of Limitations as
                    regards land” (Pollock, <hi rend="italic">Land Laws,</hi> 169). <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>§ 21 of the Act of 1S75 in
                    fact provides that “a title to any land adverse to or in derogation of the title
                    of the registered proprietor shall not be acquired by any length of possession,"
                    with an exception in favour of an adverse claim where the registered title is
                    possessory only. </p></note></p>
                <p>Another effect will be the recurrence to the primitive legal conception of the
                    transfer of land as a matter of public notoriety. In Ireland a registry of
                    assurances was established by 6 Anne c. 2 (Ir.). 28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. 88
                    constitutes a limited registry of title in the record of title to land which has
                    been the subject of conveyance or declaration by the Landed Estates Court. In
                    Scotland the present system of registration of assurances has existed since the
                    reign of James YI. The Act 1617 c. 16 created a public register for registering
                    within three-score days instruments of sasine as well as reversions and other
                    writs affecting heritable property. The Act established a general register of
                    sasines at Edinburgh and local registers. The latter were abolished by 31 &amp;
                    32 Vict. c. 64. Modern Acts commencing in 1845 and consolidated in 1868 by 31
                    &amp; 32 Vict. c. 101 dispense with sasine and the instrument of sasine. The
                    recording of a conveyance with a warrant of registration indorsed now
                    constitutes infeftment. Either the whole or part of a deed may be registered.
                    Probative leases of thirty-one or more years may be registered under 20 &amp; 21
                    Viet, c. 26. As to entails see <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail.</hi> Writs affecting
                    land held in burgage before 1874 must be registered in the burgh register of
                    sasines (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 94, § 25). The lord clerk register’s duties under
                    the Act of 1617 were transferred to the deputy clerk register by 42 &amp; 43
                    Vict. c. 44 (see Watson, <hi rend="italic">Law Diet., s.vv.</hi> “Deeds,”
                    “Registration”). In most of the British colonies land registration of some kind
                    exists. The Indian Registration Act, 1866, steers a middle course between
                    compulsory and optional registration. The registration of some assurances is
                    compulsory, of others optional. In Australia a system of compulsory registration
                    of title was introduced by Sir R. R. Torrens, and, after having been first
                    adopted by the legislature of South Australia in 1858, has been generally
                    applied by the other Australian colonies since that time. Under the South
                    Australian Act a certificate of title is cancelled and regranted on transfer.
                    Instruments are not effectual until registration and indorsement according to
                    statutory forms. Mortgages have priority according to the date of registration,
                    irrespective of notice. The registrar may demand the deposit of a map. In the
                    United States registration of assurances is universal, but registration of title
                    is not so generally adopted. At the date of writing, a bill for the compulsory
                    registration of title is before the New York legislature. For the purpose of
                    dealing with public lands of the United States a register of the land office is
                    appointed in each land district. Returns from each land office are made to the
                    general land office.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ships</hi> .—The registration of ships in the British empire
                    (other than fishing boats, the registration of which is governed by special
                    legislation) now depends upon the Merchant Shipping Acts. The register is open
                    only to British ships, and not more than sixty-four persons can be registered as
                    owners of any ship. One registered owner may, however, represent the beneficial
                    title of any number of persons. No notice of a trust can be entered on the
                    register. Mortgages must be registered in the statutory form in order to be good
                    against registered transferees and mortgagees. The registrar is generally in the
                    United Kingdom the principal officer of customs for any port, abroad such person
                    as may be named by order in council. The Merchant Shipping Act, 1854,
                    established a “general register and record of seamen” under a registrar-general
                    of seamen. The Merchant Shipping Act, 1872, extended both the name and authority
                    of this officer. Since that Act he has been called the registrar-general of
                    shipping and seamen. Returns of shipping and seamen are transmitted to him by
                    the local registrars. In the United States the registration of ships depends
                    upon a series of Acts of Congress beginning in 1792. See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Revised Statutes,</hi> § 4131. A register of seamen is kept by the shipping

                    every bill of sale is to be registered within seven clear days after the
                    execution thereof, or, if it is executed in any place out of England, then
                    within seven clear days after the time at which it would in the ordinary course
                    of post arrive in England if posted immediately after execution. A bill must be
                    re-registered every five years, if still existing. An affidavit of the time of
                    its execution, of its due execution and attestation, and containing a
                    description of the residence and occupation of the person making the bill and of
                    every attesting witness, must be filed with the registrar within seven days. A
                    transfer or assignment of a registered bill of sale need not be registered. The
                    duties of registrar are performed by a master of the Supreme Court attached to
                    the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice. Provision is made for
                    the transmission of bills of sale made by persons or affecting goods outside the
                    London bankruptcy district to the registrars of the proper county courts. The
                    register may be searched by any person on payment of a fee of one shilling.
                    Similar provisions are contained in the Irish Acts of 1879 and 1883. Bills of
                    sale are unknown in Scotland.</p>

                    rend="italic">kc.,</hi> in the United Kingdom depends upon a large body of
                    statutory law. Baptisms, marriages, and burials are usually registered at the
                    time of their occurrence, births and deaths within a certain time afterwards.
                    The English Act 35 <hi rend="italic">k</hi> 36 Vict. c. 36 forbids the charging
                    of any fee for registration of baptism. The law of registration of births and
                    deaths is consolidated for England by 37 &amp; 38 Yict. c. 88, for Ireland by
                    •43 <hi rend="italic">k</hi> 44 Vict. c. 13. In Scotland it depends upon 17
                    &amp; 18 Vict. c. 80, as amended by later Acts. The registration of marriages in
                    England depends chiefly upon 4 Geo. IV. c. 76, and 6 &amp; 7 Will. IV. c. 85; in
                    Ireland upon 7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 81 (as to Protestants), 26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. 90
                    (as to Roman Catholics); in Scotland upon 17 <hi rend="italic">k</hi> 18 Vict.

                    registrar-general of births, deaths, and marriages; in Scotland the office is
                    held by the deputy clerk-register. In the United States the registration of
                    births, marriages, and deaths is, with a few exceptions such as births and
                    deaths at sea and marriages abroad, the subject of State and not United States
                    legislation. Burials are regulated in England by the Burial Acts, especially the

                    enactments dealing with the subject of this paragraph which extend to the United
                    Kingdom. Those which do so are of a special nature, such as Acts affecting
                    friendly societies and officers and soldiers abroad. A Registration Act
                    embracing the U nited Kingdom is much needed.</p>

                    Companies Acts (most of which apply to the United Kingdom), commercial companies
                    as distinguished from associations of other kinds must be registered. Any
                    company requiring to be registered and not registered is an illegal association,
                    and its members cannot take advantage of the limitation of liability and other
                    benefits conferred by the Acts. The register is under the charge of the
                    registrar-general of joint stock companies or such other registrar as the Board
                    of Trade may appoint. The register must contain (1) the memorandum of
                    association, including the name and objects of the proposed company and the
                    place where its registered office is situate; (2) the articles of association;
                    (3) a list of members and shareholders (or directors where there are no
                    shareholders), and a statement of the amount held by each shareholder, and other
                    particulars; (4) any order of court confirming the reduction of the capital of a
                    company; (5) any contract duly made in writing by which a share is issued
                    otherwise than for cash; (6) proceedings in winding up. No trust is to appear on
                    the register in the case of companies registered in England or Ireland. Every
                    company must keep at its registered office a register of its members, and, if a
                    company not divided into shares, a register of its directors or managers, and,
                    in addition, if a limited company, a register of mortgages and charges affecting

                    milk retailers, and others must be registered in accordance with various

                    their services. In certain other cases registration is not in name necessary,

                    official books and documents as <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> evidence of
                    qualification. Thus the roll of the House of Lords is evidence that a person

                    mentioned the peculiar privilege enjoyed by the Channel Islands: orders in

                <p>Parliamentary Registration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">England.</hi> —Prior to 1832 the right of parliamentary
                    electors was determined at the moment of the tender of the vote at the election,
                    or, in the event of a petition against the return, by a scrutiny, a committee of
                    the House of Commons striking off those whose qualification was held to be
                    insufficient, and, on the other hand, adding those who, having tendered their
                    votes at the poll, with a good title to do so, were rejected at the time. A
                    conspicuous feature of the Reform Act of that year was the introduction of a new
                    mode of ascertaining the rights of electors by means of an entirely new system
                    of published lists, subject to claims and objections, and after due inquiry and
                    revision forming a register of voters. In forming a register the services of
                    overseers, already existing in every parish, were called into requisition. As
                    regards electors in counties, principally freeholders and long-lease-holders and
                    £50 tenant farmers, under the Chandos clause, overseers have no official
                    knowledge of the persons qualified to vote. Their duty towards providing a
                    register of county electors consisted in giving public notice, receiving claims
                    and objections, and making out lists of them and forwarding them to the clerk of
                    the peace. In boroughs their primary duty was to make out lists, their rate
                    books as overseers giving them the׳ knowledge of persons entitled under the
                    Reform Act to vote as £10 rated occupiers, to which subsequent claims were added
                    or objections made. In old boroughs where freemen were entitled, independently
                    of the then new occupation franchise, the town clerk prepared the lists.
                    Barristers were appointed to revise the lists, which eventually formed the
                    register of voters for the ensuing year for counties and boroughs.</p>
                <p>This procedure still forms the basis of registration, but subject to important
                    alterations since made. Although the Act of 1832 was most carefully drawn, its
                    provisions minutely indicating every step to be taken for the formation of a
                    register, accompanied by precise forms, it was found insufficient in practice;
                    and accordingly a Registration Act was passed in 1843 (6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. 15),
                    by which forms of precept were issued by clerks of the peace and town clerks to
                    overseers, telling them in a compendious form what they were to do, and
                    providing them with the necessary forms for all cases. The Representation of the
                    People Act in 1867 introduced very important changes in the franchise,—in
                    counties by introducing an occupation qualification distinct from any previous
                    description of franchise either in county or borough, but having somewhat closer
                    affinity to the £10 occupation in boroughs under the Reform Act of 1832 than to
                    the £50 tenant occupation in counties under that Act. This county franchise was
                    an occupation as owner or tenant of lands or tenements of the rateable value of
                    £12, with the concomitants of rating to the poor rates and payment of rates; but
                    the £12 occupation practically merged within it a large proportion of £50 tenant
                    occupiers. The alterations effected by the Act of 1867 in the borough franchise
                    were much more extensive. In the first })lace, the franchise was given to every
                    inhabitant occupier as owner or tenant of any dwelling house within the borough;
                    but rating and payment of poor rates were made essential conditions of this
                    franchise: part of a house occupied as a separate dwelling, if separately rated,
                    was a sufficient dwelling house to confer the franchise. Notwithstanding the
                    apparent effect of the general enfranchisement of inhabitant occupiers, a very
                    considerable body still depended on the former £10 franchise in consequence of
                    the distinction between residence and inhabitancy. Secondly, the Act gave the
                    franchise to occupiers of lodgings of a yearly value (irrespective of furniture)
                    of £10. A Registration Act of the following year was in several important
                    respects defective. With respect to two of the three new classes enfranchised in
                    1867 many doubts were indeed removed by it. The overseers were required to make
                    out a list of £12 occupiers in counties; on the other hand lodgers in boroughs
                    were required under the Act of 1867 to claim to be registered. But with respect
                    to the third class, the most numerous of all—the inhabitant occupiers in
                    boroughs—the Act contained no direction. Notwithstanding attempts to meet these
                    and various other defects, several years elapsed without any alteration being
                    effected. In the meantime important electoral changes occurred. The alterations
                    effected by the Act of 1867, besides those of qualification, the redistribution
                    of seats, and the representation of minorities, followed by the Ballot Act of
                    1872, were succeeded by the innovation of mixing up regulations for the exercise
                    of parliamentary with the municipal franchise, and led up to the fusion of the
                    registration of the two franchises and the Parliamentary and Municipal
                    Registration Act of 1878, introducing important changes both as regards the
                    definition of the franchise in boroughs and the procedure in relation to
                    registration. As regards the latter the changes recognized the combination of
                    borough registration for the double purpose of parliamentary and municipal
                    registration, and also the more ready preparation of accurate registers
                    irrespective of the combination.</p>

                    elections shall be established in all counties and boroughs throughout the

                    England or Scotland, be entitled to be registered as a voter, and, when
                    registered, to vote at an election for such county, and, if the qualifying

                    registered as a voter and, when registered, to vote at an election for such
                    county or borough.</p>
                <p>A main practical effect of the Act of 1884 was to extend to counties the
                    franchise previously confined to boroughs in respect of inhabitant occupiers of
                    dwelling houses, and in respect of the occupation of lodgings. At the same time
                    the franchise in respect of occupation of lands and tenements (other than a
                    household franchise) was assimilated in boroughs and counties and fixed at £10 a
                    year. Independently of this extension to counties and assimilation of the
                    household and lodger franchise, provision was made for extending the franchise
                    to many cases of the inhabitancy of houses by persons who, in consequence of
                    filling offices or serving others or of the tenure of the house, were deprived
                    of the franchise, not being in law occupiers. This is commonly spoken of as the
                    service franchise. On the other hand restrictions were placed on faggot votes in
                    respect of rent charges. Moreover, a man is not entitled by virtue of the Act to
                    be registered as a county voter in respect of the occupation of any dwelling
                    house, land, or tenement situate in a borough. This Act was shortly followed by
                    the Registration Act, 1885, assimilating the registration law applicable to the
                    borough and county occupation franchises.</p>
                <p>The procedure for the formation of the register, as well in counties as in
                    boroughs, is still very complicated. In counties there are two classes of
                    persons entitled to be registered—the one ownership voters, the other occupation
                    voters. General but detailed instructions are sent by the clerk of the peace to
                    overseers, accompanied by forms and copies of the existing register. On or
                    before the 20th June the overseers publish the ownership portion of the then
                    existing register for the parish, at the same time giving notice in a prescribed
                    form that all persons entitled to be registered in counties in respect of the
                    ownership of property within the parish and not upon the register, or whose
                    qualification or address has changed, who are desirous of having their names
                    inserted in the register, must give notice to the overseers in a prescribed
                    published form by the 20th July. A list of such ownership claimants is published
                    by the end of July. The occupation voters now entitled in counties to be on the
                    register comprise a £10 occupation qualification and principally a household
                    qualification, and also a lodger qualification. The occupation list other than
                    that of lodgers is made out and published by the overseers. They are required to
                    get the information, and as this information cannot be gathered in many cases
                    from the rate books, they may require rated persons to supply them with the
                    names of all inhabitant occupiers of their dwelling houses so that such persons
                    (including chielly the service franchise already mentioned) may be entered in a
                    separate column of the rate book. The lodger list is made out by the overseers
                    from an existing list, if there be one (for in counties there can be no existing
                    list before 1886), and by claims. In cities and boroughs the franchises (where
                    there are no freemen) are chiefly occupation franchises, and the same general
                    system of registration prevails as in counties in relation to the registration
                    or occupation franchises.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the provisions relating to the so-called service franchise
                    already noticed, registration procedure has not been much changed by the
                    legislation of 1884 and 1885, and in counties as well as in boroughs it mainly
                    rests still on the Registration Act of 1843. Overseers receive their precepts in
                    boroughs from the town clerk, as they do in counties from the clerks of the
                    peace, and the town clerk deals with the lists of freemen where that description
                    of franchise exists. As the household occupation and lodger franchises were
                    introduced into boroughs in 1867, the preparation and publication of lists as to
                    occupation franchises rests principally on the same procedure in counties and
                    boroughs.</p>
                <p>Ample facilities are given for fresh and amended claims and for objections made
                    (by any one on the register) to the overseers by the 20th August and published
                    by them in lists; and, where payment of poor rates is essential, not necessarily
                    by the voter, but by some one (as in some occupation franchises it is), a list
                    of persons disqualified is made out and open to inspection. While the actual
                    exercise of the franchise is governed by the duration of the register (which in
                    the absence of special legislation, as adopted for 1868 and for 1885, is in
                    force for the ordinary year, viz., from 1st January), every period of
                    qualification is computed by reference to the 15th July; the qualification must
                    be complete on that day, whether or not it comprises a possession or occupation
                    for a previous definite fixed period. When payment of poor rates is part of a
                    qualification, payment before the 15tli July of rates payable to the 15th
                    January is sufficient. Disqualifications generally refer to their existence at
                    the same date. As regards parochial relief, any relief within twelve months of
                    the 15th July disqualifies. Even with regard to disqualification by office,
                    which may be transitory and disconnected with the qualifying franchise, the
                    existence of the disqualification on the 15th July is a bar to registration.
                    Where a man is registered by virtue of one qualification he cannot be also
                    registered to vote by reason of another in respect of the same property, and a
                    qualification franchise under the Representation of the People Act, 1884,
                    generally overrides another description of qualification; but fine distinctions
                    sometimes exist between inhabitancy and residence in relation to different
                    qualifications affecting the right to be on the register in respect of one
                    description of occupation franchise rather than another. In a borough divided
                    under the Redistribution of Scats Act, 1885, a person cannot be registered in
                    more than one division. The duties of overseers in reference to registration
                    extend from spring to autumn. By the 25tli of August the lists are delivered by
                    them to the clerk of the peace in counties, and in boroughs to the town clerk.
                    Barristers are appointed to revise the lists and hold courts for that purpose
                    (and also for revising the municipal franchise) between the 15th September and
                    31st October, giving notice to the clerks of the peace in counties and town
                    clerks of boroughs, who publish notice of the sittings appointed and attend and
                    deliver the lists, the overseers also attending. They hold open courts (the
                    localities including all polling places in counties) on appointed days, with
                    evening sittings in populous places, with, general powers of adjournment. A
                    right of appeal exists from a revising barrister’s decision on the points of
                    law, by a claimant or objector, to judges of the High Court of Justice. Whether
                    the right of appeal is exercised or not, the lists, as settled and signed by the
                    barrister, are transmitted by him to the clerk of the peace or town clerk as the
                    case may be. The lists are copied and printed in such manner and form that the
                    list of voters for every parish appeals separately and with reference to polling
                    places. By the end of December the printed lists signed by the clerk of the
                    peace are delivered to the sheriff of the county, and signed borough lists are
                    delivered by the town clerk to the returning officer. The register is thus
                    completed, and the book constitutes the register of persons entitled to vote for
                    the county or borough to which it relates at any election which takes place
                    during the year commencing on the 1st January next after such register is
                    made.</p>
                <p>For some years after the passing of the Reform Act, 1832, an elector was allowed,
                    previous to voting, to be interrogated as to the possession of the qualification
                    for which his name was inserted on the register; but since 1843 no inquiry is
                    permitted at the time of polling as to the right of any person to vote, except
                    as to his identity with the name appearing on the register and as to his having
                    already voted; he may be required to give his answers on oath, but without an
                    oath a false answer wilfully made is an indictable misdemeanour. With this
                    exception it is unlawful to require any voter to take an oath in proof of his
                    qualification or right to vote, or to reject any vote tendered by any person
                    whose name is upon the register; and no scrutiny is allowed by or before any
                    returning officer with regard to any vote given or tendered at an election. A
                    great effort, partially successful, was made in 1885 to transfer the cost of
                    forming the register from local to imperial funds. A part of the cost is now
                    borne by the state. The remuneration of revising barristers is paid by the
                    treasury.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.</hi> —In Scotland as in England a system of
                    registration was established in 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. IV. c. 65), aud, passing
                    over amendments on the extension and assimilation of county and burgh franchises
                    by the Representation of the People Act, 1884, establishing a general household
                    qualification in the United Kingdom, the principles of registration adopted in
                    England by the Registration Act, 1885, were applied with some modifications to
                    Scotland by the Registration Amendment (Sccitland) Act, 1885. An annual revision
                    of the register (founded on the valuation roll) is made by appointed officers,
                    with the publication of lists and of names of parties interested making claims
                    and objections. Instead, however, of the duties of publication and primary
                    correction being in the hands of the parish officers, as in England, those
                    duties devolve as before on assessors (aided in burghs by the town clerks), who
                    make up the register. The duties of final revision devolve on the sheriff, who
                    authenticates the register, and it is delivered to the sheriff clerk with the
                    names duly arranged. The principal expenses of registration are provided from
                    local or county sources, with a contribution from imperial funds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ireland</hi> .—In Ireland also the registration of voters was a
                    feature of the reform in parliament effected in 1832, and the same gene;al
                    features as to the formation and amendment of the register prevail as in
                    England. The extension and assimilation of the franchise by the Representation
                    of the People Act, 1884, is carried out by the Parliamentary Registration
                    (Ireland) Act, 1885, on the same lines as before, only adapted to peculiar
                    exigencies. Clerks of poor-law unions have still many of the duties of parochial
                    officers in England. Prominent among recent divergencies is the proviso that
                    temporary eviction for non-payment of rent followed by reinstalment does not
                    disqualify a claim to occupation franchise.</p>

                <p>Revision is made at special sessions before assistant barristers, or, in

                    hands of the sheriff in counties and of the returning officer in boroughs. The
                    expenses of registration are defrayed from local sources, with a contribution
                    from imperial funds.</p>
