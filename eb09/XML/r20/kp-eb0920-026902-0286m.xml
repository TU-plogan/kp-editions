                    adopted in the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Navigationi,</hi> though it
                    is also written Ramnusio, Rhamnusio, Rannusio, &amp;c.—was one of note for
                    literary and official ability during at least four generations. Its original
                    home was in Rimini, and the municipality of that city has within the last few
                    years set up a tablet on the town-hall bearing an inscription which may be thus
                    rendered: “The municipality of Rimini here records the claim of their city to
                    the family of the Ramusios, adorned during the 15th and 16th centuries by the
                    illustrious jurist and man of letters Paolo the elder, who rendered the work of
                    Valturius, our fellow-citizen, into the vernacular; by the physician Girolamo, a
                    most successful student of Oriental tongues, and the first to present Europe
                    with a translation of Avicenna; and by Giovanni Battista, cosmographer to the
                    Venetian republic and secretary to the Council of Ten, who bequeathed to the
                    world that famous collection of voyages and travels, regarded in his own day as
                    a marvellous work, and still full of authority among all civilized nations.״</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Paolo the Elder</hi> (c.1443-1506), the first of those thus
                    commemorated, migrated in 1458 from Rimini to Venice, where he obtained full
                    citizenship, studied law, and became a member of the magistracy, filling the
                    offices of <hi rend="italic">vicano,</hi> of judicial assessor, and of criminal
                    judge under various administrators of the Venetian provinces on the continent.
                    He continued, however, to maintain relations with the Mala-testa princes of his
                    native city, and in 1503 negotiated with them the cession of Rimini to the
                    republic. The wife of Paolo, bearing the singular name of Tomyris Macachio, bore
                    him three sons and four daughters. Paolo died at Bergamo on 19th August 1506 at
                    the age of sixty-three, and Avas buried in S. Agostino at Padua. Paolo was the
                    author of a variety of legal treatises and the like, and also published at
                    Verona in 1483 both a corrected edition and an Italian translation of a once
                    famous book, <hi rend="italic">Valturius, De re militari</hi> , dedicating both
                    to Pandolfo Malatesta of Rimini. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="smallcaps">Girolamo</hi> (1450-1486), younger brother of Paolo, had a
                    notable history. After he had studied medicine at Padua public suspicion was
                    roused against him in connexion with the death of a lady with whom he had had
                    some love passages, and this ran so high that he was fain, by help of his
                    brother Paolo, to whom he transferred his property, to make his escape (about
                    1481-83) to Syria and to take up his abode at Damascus. In 1486 he removed to
                    Beyrout, and died the same year, killed, as the family chronicler relates, by a
                    surfeit of “certain fruit that Ave call <hi rend="italic">armellini</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">albicocche,</hi> but which in that country are known as <hi

                    was frequently issued from the early press. Girolamo’s translation was never

                    1485 (20th June). Having been educated at Venice and at Padua, at an early age
                    he entered the public service (1505), becoming in 1515 secretary of the senate
                    and in 1533 secretary of the Council of Ten. He also served the republic in
                    various missions to foreign states, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to Rome, to
                    Switzerland, and to France, travelling over much of the latter country by
                    special desire of the king, Louis XII. He also on several occasions filled the
                    office of <hi rend="italic">cancellier grande.</hi> In 1524 he married
                    Franceschina, daughter of Francesco Navagero, a noble,—a papal dispensation
                    being required on account of her being cousin to his mother Tomyris. By this
                    lady he had one son, Paolo. In his old age Ramusio resigned the secretaryship
                    and retired to the Villa Ramusia, a property on the river Masanga, in the
                    province of Padua, which had been bestowed on his father in 1504 in recognition
                    of his services in the acquisition of Rimini the year before. The delights of
                    this retreat are celebrated in the poems and letters of several of Gian
                    Battista’s friends. He also possessed a house at Padua in the Strada del
                    Patriarcato, a mansion noted for its paintings and for its collection of ancient
                    sculpture and inscriptions. These, too, are commemorated by various writers. A
                    few days before his death Ramusio removed to this house in Padua, and there
                    died, 10th July 1557, at the age of seventy-tAvo. He was, by his OAvn desire,
                    buried at Venice, in the tomb Avhich he had made for his mother, in Santa Maria
                    dell’ Orto. His Avife’s death had occurred in 1536. In the work called <hi

                    6) there is represented a 16th-century medal of Ramusio, which looks a genuine
                    likeness, and a bronze example of which, without the reverse, <note

                    Library. There Avas a portrait of him, represented as in conversation Avith
                    Andrea Gradenigo, in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio, but in 1577 this perished
                    in a fire, as did also a portrait of his father, Paolo. A professed portrait of
                    Gian Battista by Francesco Grisellini, in the Sala dello Scudo, appears to be,
                    like the companion portrait of Marco Polo, a work of fancy. A public nautical
                    school at Rimini has within the last three years received from the Government
                    the title of the Isti-tuto Ramusio.</p>
                <p>Ramusio Avas evidently a general favourite, as he Avas free from pushing
                    ambition, modest, and ingenuous, and, if it be safe to judge from some of the

                    of him with the strongest affection. He had also a great reputation for
                    learning. Before he was thirty Aldus Manutius the elder dedicated to him his
                    edition of Quintilian (1514); a few years later (1519) Francesco Ardano
                    inscribed to him an edition of Livy, and in 1528 Bernardino Donati did the like
                    with his edition of Macrobius and Censorinus. To Greek and Latin and the modern
                    languages of southern Europe he is said to have added a knowledge of “Oriental
                    tongues,” but there is no e\’idence hoAv far this went, unless Ave accept as

                    unrolling of that great series of discoveries by Portugal and Spain in East and
                    West, and the love of geography thus kindled in him made that branch of
                    knowledge through life his chief study and delight. He is said, with the
                    assistance of friends touched by the same flame, to have opened a school for
                    geography in his house at Venice. And it appears from a letter addressed to him
                    by his friend Andrea Xavagero, that as early as 1523 the preparation of material
                    for his great work had already begun. The task had been suggested and
                    encouraged, as Ramusio himself states in a dedicatory epistle to the famous
                    Girolamo Fracastoro, by that scholar, his lifelong friend; an address to the
                    same personage indeed introduced each of the three volumes, and in the first the
                    writer speaks of his desire to bequeath to posterity, along with his labours, “a
                    testimony to the long and holy friendship that had existed between the two.”
                    They were contemporaries in the strictest sense (Ramusio 1-185-1557,
                    Fracastorius 1483-1553). His correspondence, which was often devoted to the
                    collection of new material for his work, was immense, and embraced many
                    distinguished men. Among those whose names have still an odour of celebrity were
                    Fracastoro, just mentioned, Cardinal Bembo, Damiano de Goez, and Sebastian
                    Cabot; among lesser lights, Vettor Fausto, Daniel Barbaro, Paolo Manuzio, Andrea
                    Xavagero, the cardinals Gasparo Contarini and Gregorio Córtese, and the printer
                    Tommaso Giunti, editor after Ramusio’s death of the <hi rend="italic"

                    Gian Battista, and ־was born on 4tli July 1532. Like his father, he maintained a
                    large correspondence with many persons of learning and note. In 1541 Francesco
                    Contarini, procurator of St Mark’s, brought from Brussels a MS. of
                    Yillehardouin’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Conquest of
                    Constantinople,</hi> which he presented to the Council of Ten. In 1556 they
                    publicly ordered its translation into Latin, and gave the commission to Paolo
                    Rannusio. His father also seems to have taken much interest in the work, for a
                    MS. vernacular translation by him exists in the Marciana. Paolo’s book was not
                    completed till 1573, many years after the father’s death, and was in fact a
                    paraphrase enlarged from other sources, thus, according to Cigogna’s
                    questionable judgment, “converting the dry story of Ville-hardouin into an
                    elegant ( <hi rend="italic">fiorita)</hi> historical work.” It was not published
                    till 1609, nine years after Paolo’s death; nor was it ever really reprinted,
                    though it became the subject of a singular and unintelligible forgery. For
                    Jacopo Gaflarelli, who was sent to Venice to buy books for Richelieu, having
                    apparently procured the “remainder” copies, removed the title and preliminary
                    pages and substituted a fresh title with the date 1634, and a dedication to his
                    master the cardinal. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In

                    service in 1577, and was employed in connexion with various foreign missions. In
                    1601 he published at Lyons the French text of Villehardouin; and, besides an
                    Italian translation of this old historian (who seems thus to have furnished
                    occupation for three generations of Ramusios), he left behind him a <hi

                    in the printing-office (November 1557), which destroyed a part of the material
                    which had been prepared. It had been Ramusio’s intention to publish a fourth
                    volume, containing, as he mentions himself, documents relating to the Andes,
                    and, as appears from one of the prefaces of Giunti, others relating to

                    the first of the kind, though it was, and we may say on the whole continues to
                    be, the best. Even before the invention of the press such collections were
                    known, of which that made by a certain Long John of Ypres, abbot of St Bertin,
                    in the latter half of the 14th century was most meritorious, and afforded in its
                    transcription a splendid field for embellishment by the miniaturists, which was
                    not disregarded. The best of the printed collections before Ramusio’s was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Novus Orbis,</hi> edited at Basel by Simon Grynaeus in 1532,
                    and reissued in 1537 and 1555. This, however, can boast of no disquisitions nor
                    of much editorial judgment. Ramusio’s collection is in these respects far
                    superior, as well as in the variety and fulness of its matter. He spared no
                    pains in ransacking Italy and the Spanish peninsula for contributions, and in
                    translating them when needful into the racy Italian of his day. Several of the
                    pieces are very rare in any other shape than that exhibited in Ramusio’s
                    collection; several besides ofimportance—«.g., the in valuable travels of
                    Barbosa and Pigafetta’s account of Magellan’s voyage—were not publicly known in
                    any complete form till the present century. Of two important articles at least
                    the originals have never been otherwise printed or discovered; one of these is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Summary of all the Kingdoms, Cities, and Nations from the
                    Red Sea to China,</hi> a work translated from the Portuguese, and dating
                    apparently from about 1535; the other, the remarkable Ramusian redaction of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Marco Polo</hi><hi rend="italic">(q. v</hi> .). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Prefatione, Espositione,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dicliiarazionc,</hi> which precede this version of Marco Polo’s book, are the
                    best and amplest examples of Ramusio’s own style as an editor. They are full of
                    good sense and of interesting remarks derived from his large reading and
                    experience, and few pictures in words were ever touched more delightfully than
                    that in which he sketches the return of the Polo family to their native city, as
                    he had received it in the tradition of the Venetian elders.</p>
                <p>There were several editions of the <hi rend="italic">Kavigationi e Viaggi,</hi>
                    and as additions continued to be made to the several volumes a good deal of
                    bibliographical interest attaches to these various modifications. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brunet’s statements on the
                    subject are borrowed, and not quite accurate. The detail in Cigogna seems to be
                    accurate, but it is vague as to the deficiencies of the earlier editions.
                    </p></note> The two volumes (i. and iii.) published in Ramusio’s lifetime do not
                    bear his name on the title-page, nor does it appear in the addresses to his
                    friend Fracastorius with which these volumes begin (as does also the second and
                    posthumous volume). The editions of vol. i. are as follows—1550, 1554, 1563,
                    1588, 1606, 1613. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>All
                    of these are in the British Museum. </p></note> The edition of 1554 contains the
                    following articles which are not in that of 1550,—(1) copious index; (2) “Narr.
                    di un Compagno di Barbosa”; (3) “Information! del Giapan”; (4) “Alii Lettori di
                    Giov. de Barros”; (5) “Capitoli estratti da di Barros.” The edition of 1563 adds
                    to these a preliminary leaf concerning Ramusio, “Tommaso Giunti alii Lettori.”
                    After 1563 there is no change in the contents of this volume, only in the
                    title-page. It should be added that in the edition of 1554 there are three
                    double-page woodcut maps (Africa, India, and India extra Gangern), which do not
                    exist in the edition of 1550, and which are replaced by copper-plate maps in
                    subsequent editions. These maps are often missing. The editions of vol. ii. are
                    as follows—1559, 1574, 1583, 1606. There are important additions in the 1574
                    copy, and still further additions in that of 1583. The additions made in 1574
                    were—(1) “Herberstein, Della Moscovia e della Russia”; (2) “Viaggio in Persia di
                    Caterino Zeno”; (3) “Scoprimento dell’ Isola Frislanda, &amp;c., per due
                    fratelli Zeni”; (4) “Viaggi in Tartaria per alcuni frati Minori”; (5) “Viaggio
                    del Beato Odorico” (two versions). Further additions made in 1583 were—(1)
                    “Navigatione di Seb. Cabota”; (2) at the end 90 if. with fresh pagination,
                    containing ten articles on “Sarmatia, Polonia, Lithuania, Prussia, Livonia,
                    Moscovia, and the Tartars by Aless. Guagnino and Matteo di Miclieovo.” The two
                    latest “editions” of vol. ii. are identical, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from
                    the same type, with a change of title-page only, and a reprint of the last leaf
                    of the preface and of the last leaf of the book. But the last circumstance does
                    not apply to all copies. In one now before the dispersed tribes to the Holy Land

                    complexion, “like an Abyssinian,” lean, dry, and Arab-like, well dressed and
                    well attended, full of pretensions to supernatural cabalistic knowledge, and
                    with enthusiastic ideas about his mission, whilst the Jews regarded him as a
                    veritable Messiah.</p>

                    iii. also contains (omitting maps and figures inserted in the text, or with type
                    on the reverse) a two-page topographical view of Cuzco, a folding map of Terra

                    a two - page map of Sumatra, a two-page pictorial plan of the town of Hochelaga
                    in New France, and a general map of the New World in a hemisphere. Brunet’s
                    statement mentions issues of vol. ii. in 1561, and of vol. iii. in 1613; but
                    these seem to have no existence. It would thus appear that a set of Ramusio, to
                    be as complete as possible, should embrace—for vol. i., 1563 or any subsequent
                    edition; for vol. ii., 1583 or 1606; for vol. iii., 1606.</p>
