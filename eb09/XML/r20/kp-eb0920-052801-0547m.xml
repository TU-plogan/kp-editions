                    almost entirely to the basin of the Rhone, to which it sends its waters by the
                    Saône and its tributary the Azergues, and by the Gier. The watershed between the
                    Rhone and the Loire rises to the west of the department, and from north to south
                    forms four successive groups—the Beaujolais Mountains, the highest peak of which
                    is 3320 feet; the Tarare group; the Lyonnais Mountains (nearly 3000 feet); and
                    Mont Pilat, the highest peak of which belongs to the department of Loire. The
                    lowest point of the department, where it is left by the Rhone, is 460 feet above
                    the level of the sea. The meteorological conditions vary greatly with the
                    elevation and exposure. Snow sometimes lies in the mountains from November to
                    April, whilst at Lyons and in the valleys the mean temperature in winter is 36°
                    Fahr., and in summer 70°, the annual mean being 53°. The average rainfall is
                    somewhat higher than is general over France owing to the amount of the
                    precipitation on the hilly region.</p>
                <p>Of a total area of 689,545 acres, 286,000 are arable, 120,000 are pasture meadow
                    land, 79,000 under vines, 79,000 wood, and 66,000 moorland. From 1874 to 1883
                    the average annual harvests yielded 253,869 quarters of wheat, 7509 of meslin,
                    114,468 of rye, 3035 of barley, and 98,803 of oats. In 1883 there were produced
                    5,390,000 bushels of potatoes, 106,650 bushels of buckwheat, 41,320 tons of
                    beetroot, 12 of hemp seed, and 83 of hemp. Between 1874 and 1883 the average
                    annual yield of the vines was 16,533,956 gallons of wine; in 1883 it was only
                    11,918,084. In 1881 the live stock numbered 12,350 horses, 2000 asses, 600
                    mules, 9000 oxen or bulls, 65,000 cows, 12,500 calves, 49,000 sheep (producing
                    110 tons of wool), 16,000 pigs, 36,000 goats, 8000 beehives (producing 48 tons
                    of honey and 16 tons of wax); 78 cwts. of cocoons were produced in 1882, while
                    in 1883 there were only 47 cwts. The soil of the department is for the most part
                    stony and only moderately fertile. Fruit trees, such as peaches, apricots,
                    walnuts, and chestnuts, grow well, but the wood in general is little more than
                    copse and brushwood. The wealth of the department is mainly derived from its
                    industries. Its transactions with the Bank of France at Lyons in 1882 amounted
                    to £30,398,960—a figure only exceeded by the departments Seine and Nord. The
                    population is principally engaged in the manufacture of chemicals, of machinery,
                    and of silk. In 1881 324 factories, with 18,500 spindles, 700 power-looms, and
                    43,000 hand-looms, were employed in the spinning and weaving of silk; 58 works,
                    with 35,800 hackling and reeling machines, in the preparation of the raw
                    material; 7 works, with 450 spindles, 230 power-looms, and 1250 hand-looms, in
                    the manufacture of mixed goods, and 800 looms in the manufacture of lace; 80
                    dyeworks employ 4000 workmen. In 1879 it was calculated that the turnover for
                    silk articles amounted to £15,000,000 (£5,000,000 for labour and £10,000,000 for
                    the raw material). Lyons (R.v.') is the centre for the silk manufacture and
                    Tarare for that of muslins, velvets, plush, calicoes, and prints, there being 26
                    factories, with 33,000 spindles, 540 power-looms, 4800 hand-looms; 2000 workmen
                    are also employed in the manufacture of counterpanes. In 1882 88,115 tons of
                    iron were produced. The chief workshops for repairing the locomotivesof the
                    Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean line are in this department. There are also
                    foundries of copper, bronze, and bell-metal, as also gold, silver, and steel
                    wire works. The manufacture of gold and silver plate and jewellery has an annual
                    turnover of £320,000, that of edible pastes amounts to £480,000, and that of
                    paper to £54,000. The manufacture of wall papers is only second to that of
                    Paris. In addition there are 15 chemical works, 8 glass works employing 1000
                    workmen with a turnover of £190,000 in 1879, 9 candle works (£268,800), 12 soap
                    works (£102,200), and 700 mills. In 1881 there were in the department 1448
                    industrial establishments, employing 1558 steam engines with an aggregate horse
                    power of 13,077. Coal and anthracite are found (36,169 tons in 1882), as well as
                    argentiferous lead, manganese, and copper pyrites; there are also large stone
                    quarries. The cold mineral spring of Charbonnière, containing bicarbonates,
                    iron, and sulphur, is 19 miles west of Lyons. The means of communication include
                    76 miles of navigable river, 5 of canal (the canal of Givors), 141 miles of
                    Government road, 3685 miles of other roads, and 165 miles of railway connecting,
                    Lyons with Paris, with Roanne by Tarare, with Montbrison, St Étienne, Nîmes,
                    Marseilles, Grenoble, Chambéry, Geneva, Bourg, and Trévoux, Beaujeu with
                    Belleville (on the Lyons and Mâcon line), and Thizy with Cours (two
                    manufacturing towns in the neighbourhood of Tarare on the line from Lyons to
                    Roanne). The population, which owing to the development of industries has
                    doubled since 1801, was 741,470 in 1881—266 per square kilometre, the average in
                    France being 71. There are two arrondissements, Lyons and Villefranche, 29
                    cantons, and 264 communes. Rhône belongs to the diocese of Lyons, is under the
                    jurisdiction of the superior court of Lyons, and is divided between the corps
                    d’armée of Clermont and of Grenoble. The chief towns are Lyons (g.vO; Tarare
                    (13,352); Villeurbane (11,176); Caluire-et-Cuire (9740) and Oullins (7536),
                    suburbs of Lyons; Givors (11,470), a stirring town on the Rhone at the junction
                    of the canal by which coal is brought from St Etienne to the Rhone, with glass
                    works, blast furnaces, foundries, brick and tile works, and potteries; Amplepius
                    (7118); and Cours (6929).</p>
