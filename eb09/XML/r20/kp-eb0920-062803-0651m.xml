                <p><label type="entry">ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</label> the name generally given to
                    that very numerous body of Christians who acknowledge the pope, or bishop of
                    Rome, as head of their church. This name also signifies that the Roman Catholic
                    Church is “Roman in its centre and catholic in its circumference.” The number of
                    Catholics throughout the world is variously estimated, some statisticians
                    placing it as low as 152,000,000, others at 213,518,000, and others at
                    218,000,000. The author of the <hi rend="italic">Katholischer
                    Missions-Atlas</hi> (Rev. O. Werner, S.J.), largely furnished with Propaganda
                    returns, distributes them as follows :—in Europe, 150,684,050; in Asia,
                    8,311,800; in Africa, 2,656,205; in both Americas, 51,422,566; in Australia and
                    adjacent islands, 443,442; total, 213,518,063. But he considers that this
                    calculation gives less than the whole number of Catholics throughout the world,
                    and adds nearly a million more, making the total 214,370,000. Dr Hugo Franz
                    Brachelli, superior of the Austrian Statistical Department, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die Staaten Europα ’ s</hi> for 1884, gives the number of Catholics in Europe

                <p>The supreme pontiff, who traces his succession from St Peter (see Popedom), is
                    regarded by Catholics as “vicar of Christ, head of the bishops, and supreme
                    governor of the whole Catholic Church, of whom the whole world is the territory
                    or diocese.” He is also patriarch of the West, bishop of Rome and its district,
                    and temporal prince over the states of the church known as the Pontifical
                    States—though the exercise of the last prerogative has been in abeyance since
                    the events of 1859 and 1870. The pope has a primacy or supremacy, not only of
                    honour but of power, authority, and immediate jurisdiction, over the universal
                    church. When he is canonically elected, and has given his consent to the
                    election, he possesses, without any other confirmation, authority over the whole
                    church, even though at his election he may not have been either bishop, priest,
                    deacon, or subdeacon, but a simple layman. In the early ages of the church
                    subdeacons were occasionally elected, deacons more frequently, and bishops
                    rarely. In the 11th century Gregory VII., previously known as the deacon
                    Hildebrand, was ordained priest after his election and consecrated bishop later.
                    The first pope invested with the episcopal dignity prior to his election to the
                    pontificate was Formosus, bishop of Porto, elected <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n652/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0652-0629"/>891. From the end of the 13th century it was the
                    ordinary custom to choose the pope from the bishops; and from 1592 to 1775 only
                    three were elected who had not been bishops previously. Clement XIV., Pius V.,
                    and Gregory XVI. were simple priests when elected to the papacy. The cardinals,
                    to whom the election of the pontiff is reserved, generally select one of their
                    own body for this important position. The privilege of consecrating the pope is
                    reserved to the cardinal bishop of Ostia. From the moment of election the pope
                    may perform all acts appertaining to his jurisdiction, such as granting
                    indulgences, issuing censures, giving dispensations, canonizing saints,
                    instituting bishops, creating cardinals, and suchlike. The powers inherent in
                    the priesthood and episcopate, such as the remission of sins, the administration
                    of the sacraments of confirmation, holy orders, &lt;fec., he cannot exercise
                    unless he be ordained and consecrated. Hence the office of sovereign pontiff is
                    a dignity not of order but of jurisdiction. His pronouncements are regarded as
                    infallible when he defines a doctrine regarding faith and morals to be held by
                    the whole church.</p>
                <p>The office of pope is elective (see Conclave), and lasts during the life of the
                    occupant, although he may renounce his dignity. When the election has taken
                    place the fact is made known by the cardinal dean. Many ceremonies follow, such
                    as coronation and taking possession of the cathedral church of Rome, St John
                    Lateran. This latter ceremony is not strictly necessary, for after his
                    coronation the pope enjoys the papal power in all its plenitude; but its object
                    is his enthronization as bishop of the city and diocese of Rome and patriarch of
                    the West. The cardinals are the princes and senators of the church, counsellors
                    of the pontiff, co-operators with him, and vicars in the functions of the
                    pontificate (see Cardinal). To Pope Evaris-tus, fifth successor of St Peter, is
                    attributed the creation of the first <hi rend="italic">titles</hi> or parishes
                    of Rome, the occupants of which were afterwards known as cardinals. At the
                    beginning of the 3d century twenty-five of these titles existed. In the course
                    of time they were increased to fifty and afterwards to seventy. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gerarchia Cattolica</hi> the titles are thus divided: suburban
                    sees (cardinal bishops), 6; titular churches (cardinal priests), 52; and
                    diaconates (cardinal deacons), 16; making a total of 7 4. The cardinalate, in
                    the sense at present attached to it, is different from what it was in earlier
                    ages, being now the highest dignity after the papacy. The greater part of the
                    administration of the church—the chief subject of this article—is directed by
                    the cardinals who are members of congregations, which correspond, in a certain
                    measure, to the political ministries in modern states. These congregations are
                    established in Rome by the sovereign pontiff, and their objects are to inquire
                    into, discuss, and decide the important affairs of the whole church and of the
                    temporal dominions of the holy see. The cardinals are assisted by consultors or
                    prelates, by distinguished ecclesiastics secular and regular, and by other
                    officials appointed by the pope.</p>
                <p>The head of every congregation is a cardinal prefect, though some congregations
                    have the pope as prefect, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the holy office, the
                    apostolic visit, and the consistory. The secretary is ordinarily a prelate; in
                    the holy office he is a cardinal. The acts, decrees, rescripts, and letters
                    issued in the name of a congregation are subscribed generally by the prefect,
                    and always by the secretary. These two officials chiefly regulate the affairs of
                    the congregation and submit to the pope, at periodical audiences, the matters
                    which require his approval. The following are the more important congregations:
                    — inquisition, consistorial, apostolic visit, bishops and regulars, council,
                    residence of bishops, state of regulars, ecclesiastical immunities, propaganda
                    fide, propaganda fide for Oriental affairs, commission for correction of books
                    of the Oriental Church, index, sacred rites, ceremonial, regular discipline,
                    indulgences and relics, examination of bishops, <hi rend="italic">fabbrica</hi>
                    of St Peter’s, extraordinary ecclesiastical affairs and studies. The
                    congregation of the <hi rend="italic">Holy Roman Inquisition</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Holy Office</hi> (see Inquisition) occupies the first place in
                    regard to the quality of the matters of which it treats, as well as from its
                    antiquity. Its object is the extirpation of heresies. It was formally
                    established by Innocent III. (1198-1216), on the suggestion of St Dominic. The
                    following class of cases falls within its judgment :—crimes of heresy and
                    heretical blasphemy, simultaneous polygamy, robbery of the sacred particles
                    accompanied by insult offered to the same, solicitations <hi rend="italic">ad
                    turpia</hi> with abuse of sacramental confession, affected sanctity, contempt of
                    sacred images, divination and sorcery, retention and reading of heretical books,
                    &amp;c. This congregation also proceeds against any one who, having been
                    baptized, returns to paganism; against any one who celebrates mass or hears
                    confessions, not being a priest; against false witnesses who depose in causes of
                    faith, &lt;fcc. Its authority extends, in matters of faith, over every person of
                    whatsoever grade, condition, or dignity, whether bishops, magistrates, or
                    communities, and no local or personal privilege exempts from its jurisdiction.
                    Bishops, according to the council of Trent, being subject to the pope only, the
                    Inquisition may institute inquiries, but may not pronounce sentence, this being
                    reserved to the pontiff. <hi rend="italic">Consistorial,</hi> instituted by
                    Sixtus V., 1587, considers and judges on matters appertaining to the erection of
                    new metropolitan or cathedral churches, or their limits; instances of bishops
                    who desire to resign their churches; matters relating to chapters and the
                    confirmation or exclusion of subjects elected by them to metropolitan,
                    episcopal, or monastic dignities; the examination of coadjutors; presentations
                    or nominations of bishops made by sovereign princes and republics; concession of
                    rights to the pallium; retention of dignities and major benefices incompatible
                    with episcopal rights, and suchlike. The <hi rend="italic">Apostolic Visit</hi>
                    insists on the observance of that decree of the council of Trent which enjoins,
                    as a duty, that every bishop shall visit in person or by means of a delegate the
                    churches, pious institutions, &lt;fcc., in his diocese. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bishops and Regulars</hi>: this congregation has to do chiefly with the
                    government of monasteries and with complaints from the inmates of these against
                    bishops. It examines new institutions and their constitution; the founding of
                    new monasteries for both sexes, and the removal of subjects from one monastery
                    to another; questions regarding the alienation of the ecclesiastical property of
                    regulars; differences between ordinaries, parish priests, and regulars; and a
                    variety of questions of a similar nature. The <hi rend="italic">Council</hi>:
                    the fathers of the council of Trent, anticipating that doubts might arise
                    concerning the interpretation of the doctrines and decrees published therein,
                    besought Pius IV. to provide in the most fitting manner for such contingencies.
                    This the pontiff did in approving and solemnly confirming the-council in the
                    bull <hi rend="italic">Benedictus Deus</hi> (1563), interdicting, under severe
                    penalties, any person whatsoever, secular or ecclesiastic, from publishing
                    commentaries, glosses, &amp;c., or any interpretation whatsoever, upon the
                    decrees of the council of Trent, it being enacted that all controversies,
                    questions, and doubts should be submitted to the congregation of the council.
                    The object of this congregation, therefore, is the interpretation of these
                    doctrines and decrees. The congregation of <hi rend="italic">Residence of
                    Bishops</hi> may be considered as auxiliary to that of the council. It treats of
                    the questions which concern the bishops’ obligation to reside in their own
                    dioceses, —-a most important matter treated of in the council of Trent. Even in

                    beneficiaries having care of souls should reside in their respective dioceses.
                    Innocent X. forbade cardinals to depart from Rome or its district—that is. a
                    radius of 40 miles—without licence from the pope. The <hi rend="italic">State of
                    Regulars</hi> was instituted for enforcing on religious orders and congregations
                    the observance of their special rules and constitutions. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesiastical Immunities</hi> treats of controversies concerning the liberty
                    and independence of ecclesiastical jurisdiction and its violations, and
                    prescribes that the immunities due to churches be respected. This congregation
                    receives appeals of causes which in the first instance were brought before the
                    episcopal courts. The various concordats entered into between Governments and
                    the holy see have diminished the number of causes which come under the judgment
                    of this congregation. For <hi rend="italic">Propaganda Eide,</hi> see

                    provides for the affairs of the Eastern Church, was created by Pius IX. in a
                    brief dated 6th January 1862. It depends upon the cardinal prefect of
                    Propaganda, but has its own secretary, consultors, and officials. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Commission for the Correction of Books of the Omental Church</hi>
                    took its origin from a report made by Philip IV. of Spain to Urban VIII. in
                    1631, to the effect that the United Greeks inhabiting the Spanish dominions,
                    especially Sicily, complained that schismatics had printed an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euchologium,</hi> or liturgy of the mass, filled with errors, and he begged the
                    pontiff to provide a remedy for the evil and its consequences. The correction of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Euxholo-gium</hi> was decreed, and a special
                    congregation—now called commission—composed of five cardinals, assisted by
                    bishops and ecclesiastics of the Oriental Church, was appointed to correct the
                    books of the Oriental Church, and to publish a correct <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euchologium.</hi> The office of the congregation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Index</hi> is to examine printed books and works contrary to faith or morals,
                    and to compile an index or list, which is published at intervals, of the works
                    the reading of which is prohibited. The method now followed in the examination
                    and condemnation of books, especially by Catholic authors, was fixed by Benedict
                    XIV. A consultor examines the suspected work, and reports at a meeting of the
                    congregation what it contains contrary to faith, good morals, ecclesiastical
                    jurisdiction, &amp;c. An examination of these passages is made, and it is
                    determined by vote—the cardinals having the decisive vote—whether the book shall
                    be prohibited or corrected. The congregation of <hi rend="italic">Sacred
                    Rites</hi> was instituted by Sixtus V. in 1587, in order that in all the
                    churches of Rome and the world, and in the pontifical chapel, in masses, divine
                    offices, and everything else regarding divine worship, the ancient ceremonies
                    may be rigorously followed; that if any primitive rite have fallen into disuse
                    it may be restored to its ancient splendour or reformed; that the pontificals,
                    rituals, ceremonials, and all books of sacred rites may be emended and renewed;
                    and that the divine offices of the saints may be examined. Particular attention
                    is likewise given by this congregation to all things concerning the canonization
                    of saints, the celebration of their feasts, so that all may be done in an
                    orderly manner, correctly, and according to the traditions of the fathers. Hence
                    this congregation decides controversies on all these and on cognate matters. Its
                    most serious work consists in processes for the beatification and canonization
                    of the servants of God, the honours paid to saints, and the recognition of
                    martyrdoms suffered for the Catholic faith. Its first cause in this line was
                    that of the twenty-three minor observants martyred in Japan in the pontificate
                    of Urban VIII. One of the rules established by this pope for the recognition of
                    saints enjoins that, except by licence of the congregation, no one can proceed
                    to any act of canonization, beatification, or declaration of martyrdom until
                    fifty years after the death of the subject. The congregation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ceremonial</hi> investigates and watches over the exact fulfilment
                    of the sacred liturgy, and regulates and decides questions and doubts regarding
                    formalities, pre-eminence amongst cardinals, prelates, and others, as well as
                    certain sacred ceremonies in pontifical functions.</p>
                <p>The work of the church in the world is directed immediately by the bishops, who
                    receive their jurisdiction from the pope. The power inherent in the episcopal
                    character and order is received from God directly and immediately. When
                    established in a diocese by the pope, the bishop, in virtue of his title,
                    receives the power of governing and of taking cognizance of all spiritual causes
                    which regard his flo.k, whether laymen or ecclesiastics, with the exception of
                    what is specially reserved to the head of the church, and he possesses and
                    exercises these prerogatives under the jurisdiction of and in dependence on the
                    pope. The bishops in the Catholic Church at the present time are <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gerarchia C ιttolicα,</hi> March 1885) thus divided: (a)
                    patriarchal sees, of the Latin rite, 7; of the Oriental rite, 5; (6)
                    archiépiscopal sees, of the Latin rite, immediately subject to the holy see, 14;
                    with ecclesiastical provinces, 137; Oriental rite, with ecclesiastical
                    provinces, 3; subject to patriarchates, 21; (t∙) episcopal sees, Latin rite,
                    immediately subject to the holy see, 86; suffragans in ecclesiastical provinces,
                    579; Oriental rite, immediately subject to the holy see, 2; suffragans in
                    ecclesiastical provinces, 8; subject to patriarchates, 41; (c∕) sees <hi
                    rend="italic">mdlius diosceseos,</hi> 17. The titles dependent on the sacred
                    congregation of Propaganda are—apostolic delegations, 7; vicariates apostolic,
                    123; prefectures apostolic, 35. The total of these hierarchical titles amounts
                    to 1085, and, including the 74 cardinalitial titles, to 1159. The vacant titles
                    of all kinds amount to 107, and thus the whole hierarchy of the Catholic Church
                    in March 1885 reached the total of 1266. Priests, placed in the second degree of
                    the ecclesiastical hierarchy, who are generally divided into parish priests and
                    curates or assistants, are immediately under the direction of the bishops and
                    administer directly to the people. Their primary office is the offering of the
                    sacrifice of the mass. They also preach, bless, and administer baptism, penance,
                    communion, and extreme unction. Their functions are numerous and important, and
                    they constitute the working force of the church in its direct relations with its
                    members throughout the world. Priests of religious orders exercise like
                    functions, save those properly parochial.</p>
                <p>The Oriental churches in communion with the holy see, holding the same belief and
                    the same principle of authority as the Latin Church, have their own special
                    rites, discipline, and liturgical language. These are chiefly the Greek,
                    Melchite, Bulgarian, Ruthenian, Maronite, Syro-Chaldaic, Coptic, Armenian, and
                    Roumanian rites. The Greek Oriental rite is admitted by the pure Greeks, the
                    Slavs (in the Slav language), the Melchites of Syria (in Arabic), the Roumanians
                    (in the Roumanian tongue), and the Georgians (in their own language). The
                    Georgian Greek rite has no hierarchy, and many Georgians in Russia have passed
                    to the Latin or Armenian rites. The Greek and Slav languages are approved by the
                    church as ritual languages; Arabic is only tolerated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Creeks in Communion. —</hi> These are found at present in
                    Constantinople, in the mission of Malgara in Thrace, and consist of about sixty
                    families, having one bishop and about ten priests. Ijι this rite marriage is
                    permitted to clerics previous to the reception of sacred orders; but there is a
                    tendency to abolish the practice. In Greece nearly 30,000 Greeks have followed
                    the Latin rite, and these have seven bishops and about a hundred priests. The
                    mass of St Basil is celebrated by the Greeks ten times a year,—on the three
                    vigils of Christmas, the Epiphany, Easter, Holy Thursday, the Feast of St Basil,
                    and the first five Sundays of Lent. After St Basil, St John Chrysostom
                    abbreviated this mass and gave it the <pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Melchites.—</hi> The Melchites (see Melchites) have the Greek
                    rite in the Arab language. They are found scattered throughout Syria, Palestine,
                    and Egypt, and have one patriarch and ten bishops ruling over from 70,000 to
                    80,000 souls. Their clergy are, for the most part, regular, following the rule
                    of St Basil, and are divided into three congregations, —that of San Salvatore
                    near Saida (Sidon) in Lebanon, with about 300 persons who mostly have the care
                    of souls; the second, of St John the Baptist', is at Scieur in Lebanon, with
                    thirty members; and the third is the congregation of Aleppo, at St George in
                    Lebanon, with forty members between priests and brothers. A small group of
                    secular clergy is attached to the patriarchate. Besides these there are about
                    forty secular married priests throughout the dioceses. The patriarchal residence
                    is Damascus, which has two bishops-vicars,—one in Damascus, the other in Egypt.
                    The ten dioceses are Tyre, Hauran, Saida or Sidon, Ptolemais, Beyrout, Zakle,
                    Baalbec, Emessa, Aleppo, and Tripoli. Thus there are twelve bishops in all.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bulgarians.—</hi> The United Bulgarians have the same Greek
                    rite, with the mass in the Slav language. Their origin dates from 1860, when
                    many prelates and people passed over to the Catholic Church. At present (188δ)
                    their numbers are somewhat diminished, amounting to about 9000 souls. They have
                    one archbishop, who resides in Constantinople, a vicar-apostolic for Thrace, who
                    resides in Adrianople, and another vicar-apostolic for Macedonia, who resides in
                    Salonica. The Turkish Government officially recognizes them as Catholics. They
                    are spread amongst the villages in Turkey and especially in Macedonia. Besides
                    these there are in the diocese of Philippopolis about 15,000 Bulgarian Catholics
                    who have embraced the Latin rite. These are administered by a vicar-apostolic of
                    the order of Capuchins.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iiuthenians.—</hi> The Ruthenians attribute their conversion to
                    Christianity to St Methodius (860) and his brother St Cyril. The Ruthenian rite
                    is Greek in the vicinity of Greece and Latin in the countries of western Europe.
                    The Slav is the language used in both rites. The Ruthenians are numerous in
                    eastern and western Galicia, in Poland, and in Hungary. In Russia they have two
                    dioceses. In Galicia they number about 2,600,000 with 2000 priests; in Hungary
                    the two dioceses of Eperies and Munkacs count half a million of Catholics. In
                    Galicia they have one metropolitan (Lemberg) and two bishops, in Hungary two
                    bishops, and in Crisio one, with about 200 priests in these three dioceses. They
                    have a Greek Ruthenian college at Rome and another in Vienna.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Maronites.—</hi> The greater number of the Maronites (&lt;∕.r.)
                    are in Lebanon, where the patriarch resides; others are in Syria, in Egypt, and
                    in Cyprus. The patriarchal title is Antioch; the archbishops are those of
                    Aleppo, Archis, Berito, Damascus, Tyre and Sidon, and Tripoli; the bishops of
                    Cyprus, Heliopolis, and Gibail and Botri. The Maronites of Alexandria are
                    administered by a procurator of the patriarch. The population of these dioceses
                    is nearly 400,000. The number of regular priests is about 1200, of secular
                    priests about 600. In Mount Lebanon there are seventy-five convents of men and
                    women. Five colleges or seminaries depend upon the patriarch and four others on
                    the archbishops. In these seminaries the clerics learn Arabic, Syriac, Latin,
                    French, and Italian. The language used in the mass and in the offices of the
                    church is Syriac, that spoken by the people is Arabic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Syro-Chaldxans.—</hi> The Oriental Syrians are called,
                    ecclesiastically, Chaldeans. This name comprises, not only the inhabitants of
                    Chaldea, but also those of Assyria, Mesopotamia, and a part of Persia. To
                    distinguish them from those having other rites equally Syrian, they were
                    exclusively termed Chaldeans by Pope Eugenius IV. (1431-1447). Previous to the
                    council of Florence (1438) they were called Orientals or Syro-Orientals. The
                    Catholic Chaldeans have a patriarch who for a long period has had his residence
                    at Mosul (Mesopotamia), and has the title of patriarch of Babylonia with
                    archiépiscopal jurisdiction over the city of Baghdad. There are five
                    archdioceses—Amida or Diarbekir in Mesopotamia, Seert in Assyria, Salmas and
                    Adorbigana in Persia, Kerkuk (Carcha) in Parthic Assyria, and Amadia in
                    Kurdistan. The dioceses are Mardin and Gezira in Mesopotamia, Zaku in
                    Assyria-Media, Sena in Persia, Bassorah on the Persian Gulf, and Acri and Zebari
                    in the mountains of Kurdistan. The number of secular clergy in the patriarchate,
                    archdioceses, and dioceses approximates 200. There is a congregation of Antonian
                    monks, having the title of S. Hor-misdas, who have an abbot-general, five houses
                    or convents, forty priests, and a hundred monks. The other religious houses bear
                    the names of Mother of God, St George, St Abraham, and St James. The largest
                    number of Catholics is in the diocese of Mosul with Baghdad, 25,000. In all
                    there are over 90,000 Catholics. The language of the mass and church office is
                    Syro-Chaldaic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Copts.—</hi> The Coptic rite prevails throughout all Egypt. At
                    one time there was a liturgy of Lower and another of Upper Egypt. In the former
                    the Memphitic dialect was in use and the Theban dialect in the latter. But as
                    the patriarchs of Alexandria were Greeks they, followed by several churches in
                    Egypt, changed the liturgy into the</p>
                <p>Greek language; and after the schism in the 5th century the liturgy became
                    Coptic, as the patriarchs were Copts. There are three liturgies in use at
                    present—that of St Basil, that of St Gregory Nazianzen, and that of St Mark,
                    rearranged by St Cyril of Alexandria. The Theban dialect is no longer used; but
                    the Memphitic still prevails, and in it the offices of the church are recited.
                    The Catholic population is only about 6000, with twenty-two priests, one bishop,
                    and a vicar-apostolic, whose residence is at Cairo.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Armenians.—</hi> The Armenians (see Armenian Church) regard St
                    Gregory the Illuminator as their apostle. Pope Benedict XIV. instituted the
                    patriarchate of Cilicia in 1742, and Pius VIII. in 1830 instituted the Armenian
                    Catholic primacy in Constantinople. In 1867 Pius IX. united Cilicia with the
                    primacy of Constantinople, so that the patriarch now bears the title of Cilicia
                    and has his residence in Constantinople. Turkey, Russia, Asia Minor, Armenia
                    (Greater and Lesser), Mesopotamia, Syria, and Egypt have Armenian Catholics, who
                    altogether number 100,000 at the present time (1885). There are ten archbishops
                    and bishops and over 350 priests. They also possess religious orders, the
                    Mechitarists of Venice and of Vienna, and have an Armenian college at Rome and
                    an Armenian seminary at Bzommar in Mount Lebanon. The liturgical language is
                    literary Armenian, and they have a special rite and liturgy. The people speak
                    vulgar Armenian and Turkish. There is an institute of Armenian sisters of the
                    Immaculate Conception at Constantinople to attend to the education of young
                    girls, especially those newly converted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roumanians.—</hi> As early as the council of Florence the
                    Roumanian metropolitan of Moldavia subscribed the decree of union; but the time
                    had not yet come for an actual union with Rome. In 1700, under the metropolitan
                    Theophilus and his successor Athanasius I., the great national synod of Alba
                    Julia (Fogaras) was held, in which the bishop, the archpriests, and all the
                    clergy of the Roumanian Church of Transylvania “freely and spontaneously by the
                    impulse of God” concluded a union with the Roman Catholic Church. This
                    declaration was signed by the metropolitan, by fifty-four archpriests <hi
                    rend="italic">(protoρapas'),</hi> and by 1561 priests. Historians say that
                    200,000 families were united to Rome on that day. Some afterwards again fell
                    away, but there is at present a great movement prevailing amongst these towards
                    union. The United Catholics are chiefly in Transylvania and Hungary and number
                    about a million and a half, with from 1500 to 1600 priests. In 1854 Pius IX.
                    erected into an ecclesiastical province the United Roumanian Church with an
                    archbishopric, Alba Julia (Fogaras), and three bishoprics. To the diocese of
                    Grosswardein in Hungary was added that of Lugos in the Banat and that of
                    Armenopolis (Samos-Ujvar), which constitute a flourishing ecclesiastical
                    province. For the education of the clergy four places for students were given by
                    Pius IX. in the Greek college at Rome, and they have sixteen places in the
                    central seminary of Budapest. They have two seminaries, one in the metropolitan
                    diocese, with fifty and another at Armenopolis with sixty students. In the
                    diocese of Armenopolis the number of souls is 647,666, with 486 parishes and a
                    monastery. In the archdiocese of Alba Julia the number is 361,000, with 729
                    parishes and 706 priests. At Grosswardein and Lugos the number of Catholics is
                    less. The rite in use is the Greek, but the language is the Roumanian. This is
                    the only rite which employs the vulgar tongue. (P. L. C.)</p>

                    c. 7), although it gave Roman Catholic citizens in the main complete civil and
                    religious liberty, at the same time left them under certain disabilities,
                    trifling in comparison with those under which they laboured before 1829. Nor did
                    the Act affect in any way the long series of old statutes directed against the
                    assumption of authority by the Roman see in England. The earliest of these which
                    is still law is the Statute of Provisors of 1351 (25 Edw. III. st. 4). Most of
                    what has been already stated <pb break="no"

                    position of nonconformity may be applied to the Roman Catholic faith. The effect
                    of 2 and 3 Will. IV. c. 115 is to place Roman Catholic schools, places of
                    worship and education, and charities, and the property held therewith, under the
                    laws applying to Protestant nonconformists. The Toleration Act does not apply to
                    Roman Catholics, but legislation of a similar kind, especially the Relief Act of
                    1791 (31 Geo. III. c. 32), exempts the priest from parochial offices, such as
                    those of churchwarden and constable, and from serving in the militia or on a
                    jury, and enables all Roman Catholics scrupling the oaths of office to exercise
                    the office of churchwarden and some other offices by deputy. The priest is,
                    unlike the nonconformist minister, regarded as being in holy orders. He cannot,
                    therefore, sit in the House of Commons, but there is nothing to prevent a peer
                    who is a priest from sitting and voting in the House of Lords. If a priest
                    becomes a convert to the Church of England he need not be re-ordained. The
                    remaining law affecting Roman Catholics may be classed under the following five
                    heads.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Office.</hi> There are certain offices still closed to
                    Roman Catholics. By the Act of Settlement a Papist or the husband or wife of a
                    Papist cannot be king or queen. The Act of 1829 provides that nothing therein
                    contained is to enable a Roman Catholic to hold the office of guardian and
                    justice of the United Kingdom, or of regent of the United Kingdom; of lord
                    chancellor, lord keeper, or lord commissioner of the great seal of Great Britain
                    or Ireland or lord lieutenant of Ireland; of high commissioner to the General
                    Assembly of the Church of Scotland, or of any office in the Church of England or
                    Scotland, the ecclesiastical courts, cathedral foundations, and certain
                    colleges. The disability in the case of the lord chancellor of Ireland was
                    removed by statute in 1867, with necessary limitations as to ecclesiastical
                    patronage, and the office has been held twice since that date by the late Lord
                    O’Hagan. The Act of 1829 preserved the liability of Roman Catholics to take
                    certain oaths of office, but these have been modified by later legislation (see
                    29 and 30 Vict. c. 19; 30 and 31 Vict. c. 75; 31 and 32 Vict. c. 72).
                    Legislation has been in the direction of omitting words which might be supposed
                    to give offence to Roman Catholics. (2) <hi rend="italic">Title.</hi> The Act of
                    1829 forbids the assumption by any person, other than the person authorized by
                    law, of the name, style, or title of an archbishop, bishop, or dean of the
                    Church of England. The Ecclesiastical Titles Act, 1851, went further and forbade
                    the assumption by an unauthorized person of a title from any place in the United
                    Kingdom, whether or not such place were the seat of an archbishopric, bishopric,
                    or deanery. This Act was, however, repealed in 1867, but the provisions of the
                    Act of 1829 are still in force. (3) <hi rend="italic">Religious Orders.</hi> It
                    was enacted by the Act of 1829 that “every Jesuit and every member of any other
                    religious order, community, or society of the Church of Rome bound by monastic
                    or religious vows” was, within six months after the commencement of the Act, to
                    deliver to the clerk of the peace of the county in which he should reside a
                    notice or statement in the form given to the schedule to the Act, and that every
                    Jesuit or member of such religious order coming into the realm after the
                    commencement of the Act should be guilty of a misdemeanour and should be
                    banished from the United Kingdom for life (with an exception in favour of
                    natural-born subjects duly registered). A secretary of state, being a
                    Protestant, was empowered to grant licences to Jesuits, &amp;c., to come into
                    the United Kingdom and remain there for a period not exceeding six months. An
                    account of these licences was to be laid annually before parliament. The
                    admission of any person as a regular ecclesiastic by any such Jesuit, &amp;c.,
                    was made a misdemeanour, and the person so admitted was to be banished for life.
                    Nothing in the Act was to extend to religious orders of females. These
                    provisions exist <hi rend="italic">in posse</hi> only, and have, it is believed,
                    never been put into force. (4) <hi rend="italic">Superstitwus Uses.</hi> Gifts
                    to superstitious uses are void both at common law and by statute. It is not easy
                    to determine what gifts are to be regarded as gifts to superstitious uses. Like
                    contracts contrary to public policy, they depend to a great extent for their
                    illegality upon the discretion of the court in the particular case. The Act of
                    23 Hen. VIII. c. 10 makes void any assurance of lands to the use (to have obits
                    perpetual) or the continual service of a priest for ever or for threescore or
                    fourscore years. The Act of 1 Edw. VI. c. 14 (specially directed to the
                    suppression of chantries) vests in the crown all money paid by corporations and
                    all lands appointed to the finding or maintenance of any priest or any
                    anniversary or obit or other like thing, or of any light or lamp in any church
                    or chapel maintained within five years before 1547. The Act may still be of
                    value in the construction of old grants, and in affording examples of what the
                    legislature regarded as superstitious uses. Gifts which the courts have held
                    void on the analogy of those mentioned in the Acts of Henry VIII. and Edward VI.
                    are a devise for the good of the soul of the testator, a bequest to certain
                    Roman Catholic priests that the testator may have the benefit of their prayers
                    and masses, a bequest in trust to apply a fund to circulate a book teaching the
                    supremacy of the pope in matters of faith, a bequest to maintain a taper for
                    evermore before the image of Our Lady. The court may compel discovery of a
                    secret trust for superstitious uses. Since 2 and 3 Will. IV. c. 115 gifts for
                    the propagation of the Roman Catholic faith are not void as made to
                    superstitious uses. It should be noticed that the doctrine of superstitious uses
                    is not confined to the Roman Catholic religion, though the question has
                    generally arisen in the case of gifts made by persons of that religion. The
                    Roman Catholic Charities Act, 1860, enables the court to separate a lawful
                    charitable trust from any part of the estate subject to any trust or provision
                    deemed to be superstitious. It also provides that in the absence of any written
                    document the usage of twenty years is to be conclusive evidence of the
                    application of charitable trusts. (5) <hi rend="italic">Patronage.</hi> A Roman
                    Catholic cannot present to a benefice, prebend, or other ecclesiastical living,
                    or collate or nominate to any free school, hospital, or donative (3 Jac. I. c.
                    5). Such patronage is by the Act vested in the universities, Oxford taking the
                    city of London and twenty-five counties in England and Wales, mostly south of
                    the Trent, Cambridge the remaining twenty-seven. The principle is affirmed in
                    subsequent Acts (1 Will, and Mary, sess. 1, c. 26; 12 Anne, st. 2, c. 14; 11
                    Geo. II. c. 17). If the right of presentation to an ecclesiastical benefice
                    belongs to any office under the crown, and that office is held by a Roman
                    Catholic, the archbishop of Canterbury exercises the right for the time being
                    (10 Geo. IV. c. 7, s. 17). No Roman Catholic may advise the crown as to the
                    exercise of its ecclesiastical patronage (⅛., s. 18). A Roman Catholic, if a
                    member of a lay corporation, cannot vote in any ecclesiastical appointment <hi
                    rend="italic">{ib.,</hi> s. 15). Grants and devises of advowsons, &amp;c., by
                    Roman Catholics are void, unless for valuable consideration to a Protestant
                    purchaser (11 Geo. II. c. 17, s. 5). Where a <hi rend="italic">quare
                    impedit</hi> is pending before any court, the court may compel the patron to
                    take an oath that there is no secret trust for the benefit of a Roman Catholic.
