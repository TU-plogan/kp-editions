                    (1573-1613), the greatest satirist of France, was born at Chartres on the 21st
                    December 1573. His father, Jacques Regnier, was a bourgeois of good means and
                    position; his mother, Simonne Desportes, was the sister of the poetical Abbé
                    Desportes, one of the most distinguished of the disciples of Ronsard. Desportes,
                    who was richly beneficed and in great favour at court, seems to have been
                    regarded at once as Mathurin Regnier’s natural protector and patron, and the boy
                    himself, with a view to his following in his uncle’s steps, was tonsured at nine
                    years old. It appears that Jacques Regnier, at any rate for a time, encouraged
                    his son to imitate his uncle in poetry also, though he afterwards changed his
                    views. The boy was somewhat early introduced to general society of the jovial
                    kind, for his father built a tennis court at the end of his garden which became
                    semipublic and was much frequented. The poet’s enemies said that his father had
                    been a common gaming-house keeper, and that the court was built with the ruins
                    of some church property; but this seems to be mere scandal. Little is known of
                    his youth, and it is chiefly conjecture which fixes the date of his visit to
                    Italy in the suite of the Cardinal de Joyeuse in 1586. Others give 1583 and
                    1593, but the former date is certainly too early, and the latter probably too
                    late. Indeed the greatest uncertainty exists as to the dates and incidents of
                    Regnier’s short life, and his biographers hitherto have chiefly busied
                    themselves in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n365/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0365-0348"/>upsetting each others’ facts without supplying
                    fresh details of an authentic character. It is commonly said that the poet,
                    finding Joyeuse an inactive or unwilling patron, transferred his services to
                    Philippe de Bethune, Sully’s brother, who went as ambassador to Rome in 1601;
                    but this seems doubtful, for one of the very few positive documents concerning
                    Régnier speaks of him as still in Joyeuse’s service a year later. What is
                    generally certain is that during the greater part of his youth he lived partly
                    in Paris and partly in Italy, after a somewhat idle and very dissipated fashion.
                    He early began the practice of satirical writing, and the enmity which existed
                    between his uncle Desportes and the j poet Malherbe gave him occasion to attack
                    the latter in some of his very best verses. It has been generally said that
                    Regnier obtained full possession of a canonry at Chartres, to the reversion of
                    which he had been appointed when a child, in 1604, and a singular legend is told
                    of the immediate circumstances; but the formal registry of admission signed by
                    himself is extant, and is dated 1609, a further instance of the uncertainty
                    which prevails respecting him. In 1606 Desportes died, leaving nothing to
                    Regnier, though they seem to have been on excellent terms to the last. The poet
                    was even disappointed of the succession to Desportes’s abbacies, but he obtained
                    a pension (the amount as usual variously stated at 2000 and 6000 livres)
                    chargeable upon one of them, by the influence of the Marquis de Coeuvres,
                    afterwards Maréchal d’Estrées, the brother of Henry IV.’s Gabrielle. He also
                    became a great favourite with his bishop, Philippe Hurault, at whose abbacy of
                    Royaumont Regnier spent much time in the later years of his life. On the other
                    hand the death of Henry IV. deprived him of his last hope of great preferments,
                    and appears to have considerably soured his temper. He did not long survive the
                    king. His life had always been one of dissipation, or, to speak frankly,
                    debauchery, and in the autumn of 1613 he went to Rouen to put himself under the
                    care of a quack doctor. An apparent cure was followed by a feast at which the
                    patient drank his physician’s health too freely in strong Spanish wine, and died
                    of pleurisy or fever at his hotel, the Écu d’Orléans, on the 13th October. His
                    body was disembowelled and the entrails deposited in the parish church, that of
                    St Marie Mineure, the other remains being carried to Royaumont and buried
                    there.</p>
                <p>Such is the meagre amount of positive knowledge respecting one of the greatest
                    poets of France. Nor can it be said that llegnier’s literary history is quite
                    accurately ascertained, though it is less dubious than his personal. The period
                    immediately preceding and following his death was a period of numerous
                    collections of licentious and satirical poems, some published, some still
                    remaining in manuscript. Gathered from these there has been a floating mass of
                    epigrams, &amp;c., attributed to llegnier, few of which are certainly authentic,
                    and most of which do no particular credit to his memory. On these editors of his
                    works have exercised freely the light of acceptance or rejection, so that it is
                    very rare to find two editions of Regnier which exactly agree in contents. His
                    acknowledged or undoubted work, however, is that on which his fame rests, and it
                    falls into three classes :—regular satires in alexandrine couplets, serious
                    poems in various metres, and satirical or jocular epigrams and light pieces,
                    which often, if not always, exhibit considerable licence of language. This
                    latter class is, however, much the least important in every way. The real
                    greatness of Regnier consists in the vigour and polish of his satires,
                    contrasted and heightened as that vigour is with the exquisite feeling and
                    melancholy music of some of his minor poems. In the latter Regnier is a disciple
                    of Ronsard (whom he defended brilliantly against Malherbe), without the
                    occasional pedantry, the affectation, or the undue fluency of the Pléiade, but
                    in the satires he had hardly any master (Vauquelin de la Fresnaye and Agrippa
                    d’Aubigné, who preceded him in point of composition, did not publish their
                    satires until later) except the ancients. He has sometimes followed Horace
                    closely, hut always in an entirely original spirit. His vocabulary is varied and
                    picturesque, but is not marred by the maladroit classicism of some of the
                    Ronsardists. His verse is extraordinarily forcible and nervous, but what
                    distinguishes him especially from most satirists is the way in which he gets the
                    better of what may be called the commonplaces of satire, and to a great extent
                    at any rate avoids the tendency of all French poetry to run into types. His keen
                    and accurate knowledge of human nature and even his purely literary qualities
                    extorted the admiration of Boileau— usually the severest of critics in regard to
                    all poets of the ¡!receding age except Malherbe. Regnier, moreover, in respect
                    of !Malherbe has himself displayed remarkable independence and acuteness of
                    literary criticism, and the famous passage in which he satirizes the poet of
                    Caen contains the best denunciation of the merely “correct” theory of poetry
                    that has ever been written. Lastly, Regnier had a most unusual descriptive
                    faculty, and the vividness of what may be called his narrative satires was not
                    approached in France for at least two centuries after his death. All his merits
                    are displayed in the masterpiece entitled <hi rend="italic">Macctte ou
                    VHypocrisie déconcertée</hi> , but <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> hardly any one
                    of the sixteen satires which he has left falls below j even a very high
                    standard. In general it may bo said that Regnier is the last poet who shows the
                    poetic faculties of the French tongue before the classical reforms of the 17tli
                    century had cramped and curtailed them, and that he shows these faculties in
                    something like perfection.</p>
                <p>The first edition of Regniei’s satires appeared in 1G08 published by Gabriel
                    Bnon. There was another in 1609, and another in 1012. The author had also
                    contributed to two collection <hi rend="italic">.·.—Les Muses Gaillardes</hi> in
                    1009 and <hi rend="italic">Le Temple d'Apollon</hi> in 1611. In the year of hi*
                    death (1613) a completer collection appeared, and another in 1610. The chief
                    editions of the 18th ci ntnry are that of Urossette (1729), which supplies the
                    standard commentary on Regifur, and that of Lenglet Dufresnoy (1733). Recently
                    the poet has been frequently and carefully reprinted. The editions of Prosper
                    Poitevin in I860, of M. de Barthélemy in 1862, and of M. Courbet in 1875 may be
                    specially mentioned. The last, printed after the originals in italic type, and
                    well edited, is perhaps the best, as M. de Barthélémy’* is the tullest, of
                    recent copies.</p>
