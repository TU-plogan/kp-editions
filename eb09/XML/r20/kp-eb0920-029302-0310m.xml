                    where he afterwards remained as a privat-docent. In 1814 he obtained the prize
                    offered by the academy of Gottingen for the best treatment <pb break="no"

                    from the abolition of trade guilds might be removed. His memoir, greatly
                    enlarged, was published in 1816 under the title <hi rend="italic">Ueber</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">das Zunftxoesen xtnd die Foi gen seiner A ufhebung.</hi> He was
                    then favourable to the continued existence of trade corporations on a reformed
                    basis, but afterwards abandoned this view. In the same year appeared his <hi
                    rend="italic">Primx lineae historic ]*)litices.</hi> In .1818 he became
                    professor at Erlangen. He competed successfully in 1820 for a prize offered by
                    the academy of Haarlem for the best essay on the causes of poverty; and in the
                    same year he published a translation, characterized by Roscher as “free, but
                    very good,” of Storch’s <hi rend="italic">Cours d’Économie Politique,</hi> with
                    notes and additions of his own. In 1822 he was called to the chair of political
                    economy at Heidelberg, where the rest of his life was spent, in the main, in
                    teaching and research. He took some part, however, in public affairs: in 1837 he
                    was nominated a member of the first chamber of the duchy of Baden, and did good
                    service in that capacity; and in 1851 he was one of the commissioners sent to
                    England on the part of the Zollverein to study the Industrial Exhibition. A
                    result of this mission was his account of the agricultural implements exhibited
                    at London <hi rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi rend="italic">landwirthschaftlichen
                    Gerathe</hi><hi rend="italic">der Londoner</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ausstellung,</hi> 1853). He was elected a corresponding member of the French
                    Institute in 1856. After a useful and honourable career he died at Heidelberg on
                    18th March 1870.</p>
                <p>His principal work is the <hi rend="italic">Lchrbuch dcr politischen
                    Oelconomic</hi> (1826-37), an encyclopaedia of the economic knowledge of his
                    time, written with a special view to the guidance of practical men. The
                    doctrines are, in the main, those of Smith and Say; hut they are treated in an
                    independent manner, and the conclusions of his predecessors are modified,
                    especially by giving larger scope to the action of the state. The three volumes
                    are respectively occupied with (1) political economy, properly so called, or the
                    theory of wealth, (2) administrative science ( <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volksxmrthschaftspolitik),</hi> and (3) finance. The two last he recognizes as
                    necessarily admitting of variations in accordance with the special circumstances
                    of different countries, whilst the first is more akin to the exact sciences, and
                    is in many respects capable of being treated, or at least illustrated,
                    mathematically. This threefold division marks his close relation to the older
                    German cameralistic writers, with whose works he was familiarly acquainted. It
                    is a consequence in part of his conformity to their method and his attention to
                    administrative applications that his treatise was found peculiarly adapted for
                    the use of the official class, and long maintained its position as their special
                    textbook. He was the economic teacher, says Roscher, of the well-governed middle
                    states of Germany from 1815 to 1848. The book has passed through many editions;
                    in that of 1870 by Adolf Wagner it was transformed into a new book.</p>
                <p>In the earlier part of his scientific life Rau tended strongly towards the
                    relative point of view and an historical method in economics. But, though in his
                    great work he kept clear of the exaggerated abstraction of the Ricardians and
                    rejected some of their <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> assumptions, he never
                    joined the historical school. To the end he occupied a somewhat indeterminate
                    position with respect to that school; on the whole, however, he more and more
                    subordinated historical investigation to immediate practical interests, and in
                    his economic politics moved in the direction of limiting rather than extending
                    the sphere of state action. His general merits are thoroughness of treatment,
                    accuracy of statement, and balance of judgment; he shows much industry in the
                    collection and skill in the utilization of statistical facts; and his exposition
                    is orderly and clear. Roscher finds in his earlier works a <hi rend="italic"
                    >spirituel</hi> charm which disappears in the later.</p>
                <p>Besides the publications already mentioned, he was author of the following:— <hi
                    rend="italic">Ueber den Luxus,</hi> 1817; <hi rend="italic">Ansichten der
                    Staatswirth-schaft 'init besonderer Beziehung auf Deutschland,</hi> 1820; <hi
                    rend="italic">Malthus und Say iiber die Ursachen der jetzigen
                    Handelsstockung,</hi> 1821; <hi rend="italic">Gruxidriss der Kameralwissenschaft
                    oder Wirthschaftslchre,</hi> 1823; <hi rend="italic">Ueber die
                    Kameralwissenschaft, Entwickelung ihres JVesens und ihrer Theile,</hi> 1825; <hi
                    rend="italic">Ueber die Landwirthschaft der Bheinpfalz,</hi> 1830; an academic
                    oration <hi rend="italic">De vi naturae in rempublica.m,</hi> 1831; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte des Pfluges,</hi> 1845.</p>
                <p>Rau founded in 1834 the <hi rend="italic">Archiv der politischen Oekonomie und
                    Polizeiwissenschaft,</hi> in which he wrote a number of articles, afterwards
                    issued in separate form: amongst them may be named, those on the debt of Bauen,
                    on the accession of Baden to the Zollverein, on the crisis of the Zollverein in
                    the summer of 1852, on the American banks, on the new English poor law, on
                    List’s national system of political economy, and on the minimum size of a
                    peasant property. This enumeration will give an idea of the extent and variety
                    of his researches.</p>
