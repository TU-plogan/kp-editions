                <p><label type="entry">RADCLIFFE</label><hi rend="smallcaps">Ann Ward</hi>
                    (1764-1823), novelist, was born in London on 9th July 1764. She was the author
                    of three novels unsurpassed of their kind in English literature, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Romance of the Forest</hi> (1791), <hi rend="italic">The
                    Mysteries of Udolpho</hi> (1794), <hi rend="italic">The Italian</hi> (1797). The
                    interval of three years between the successive publications is noticeable; works
                    so elaborate, intricate, and closely interwoven could not be written in a hurry.
                    The second of the three novels is the one commonly associated with Mrs
                    Radcliffe’s name, but the preference is probably due to the title; each is an
                    improvement on its predecessor, and the last is considerably the best on the
                    whole in style as well as in plot and character. She wrote two other novels
                    before any of these, the <hi rend="italic">Castles of Atldin and Dunbayne</hi>
                    (1789) and the <hi rend="italic">Sicilian Romance</hi> (1790), but they
                    attracted no special attention and deserve none, although in them she works with
                    the same romantic materials—dreadful castles, wild adventures, terrible
                    characters. One other was written after the famous three, but not published till
                    1826, three years after her death— <hi rend="italic">Gaston de Blondeville</hi>
                    , interesting as an elaborate study of costume and scenery, and valuable as a
                    monument of her accurate archaeological learning, but comparatively tedious as a
                    story, though not without passages in her best style. The circumstances that
                    turned Mrs Radcliffe to literature are not recorded in the meagre memoir
                    published under her husband’s direction. Her maiden name was Ward, and her
                    parents, who are described as “persons of great respectability, though engaged
                    in trade,” in London, had literary relations. Her husband was an Oxford graduate
                    and proprietor and editor of the <hi rend="italic">English Chronicle.</hi> After
                    <hi rend="italic">The Italian</hi> she gave up writing for publication, and was
                    reported to have been driven mad by the horrors of her own creations. This was
                    purely mythical. It appears that she never saw the Italian scenery which she
                    depicts with such minuteness, and never left England but once, in the summer of
                    1794, after the completion of her <hi rend="italic">TJdolpho.</hi> A record of
                    the tour was published in the following year, along with descriptions of a visit
                    to the English Lakes, the beauties of which she was one of the first to
                    celebrate. Of scenery, as might be judged from her novels, where the
                    descriptions are often felt as a tedious impediment, Mrs Radcliffe was an
                    enthusiastic amateur, and made driving tours with her husband every other summer
                    through the English counties. She died in February 1823.</p>
                <p>As a novelist Mrs Radcliffe deserves a much higher place than is accorded to her
                    in general estimation. Critics familiar with her works, from Sir Walter Scott
                    downwards, have shown themselves fully alive to the difference; but the general
                    public confound her with puerile and extravagant imitators, who have vulgarized
                    her favourite “properties” of rambling and ruinous old castles, dark, desperate,
                    and cadaverous villains, secret passages, vaults, trapdoors, evidences of deeds
                    of monstrous crime, sights and sounds of mysterious horror. She deserves at
                    least the credit of originality, but apart from this there are three respects in
                    which none of her numerous imitators approach her,—ingenuity of plot, fertility
                    of incident, and skill in devising apparently supernatural occurrences capable
                    of explanation by human agency and natural coincidence. Except in her last and
                    posthumously published work she never introduces the really supernatural, and,
                    whether or not we agree with Sir Walter Scott that this limitation was a mistake
                    in art, it must at least be acknowledged to impose a heavier burden on the
                    author’s ingenuity. Her imitators found it easier to follow Horace Walpole in
                    this point. Some of the tragic situations in <hi rend="italic">The Italian</hi>
                    are worked out with a vivid power of imagination which it would be hard to
                    parallel in English literature outside the range of the Elizabethan drama, with
                    the minor celebrities of which Mrs Radcliffe may fairly challenge
                    comparison.</p>
