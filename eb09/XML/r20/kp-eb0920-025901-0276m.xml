                    resplendent. In the oldest times the headman of any petty tribe was called rhjh
                    from the fact of his being conspicuous for the number of golden ornaments with
                    which he was decked out. Then raja became the common designation for a king,
                    whether of a small tribe or of a large state. The constitution of all states was
                    monarchical, mostly hereditary, occasionally also electoral, but in no case
                    absolute, for the people had a voice in the government. On the other hand, the
                    king was greatly hampered in his action by his duties towards the priestly
                    caste. Even in that later stage of Indian civilization which we find portrayed
                    in the code of Manu the king appears as subordinate to the priest, though his
                    prerogative is in all other respects paramount, especially in the matter of
                    revenue. Theoretically this system has been continued ever since; but
                    practically the rdj d’s powers have been gradually extended, some of them being
                    distributed by him at his pleasure among various officials, who were rewarded,
                    not by regular salaries, but by grants and the profits of oppression. <note

                    thus appears that the title is, strictly speaking, only applicable to Hindu
                    potentates, but in practice it is not unfrequently used to indicate a ruling
                    chief irrespective of his nationality or creed.</p>
                <p>The rights and privileges assigned to rfijfis by treaty and usage are manifold
                    and varied. But all rAjfis are precluded from waging war against an external foe
                    save with the permission of the British Government, and so none can be said to
                    be independent in the fullest sense of the word. At the same time there are
                    several princes in India who titularly hold that status, in so far, that is, as
                    they possess the right to administer their kingdom according to their own
                    notions of justice and equity; but even in these instances, and they are few,
                    British residents are attached to the various courts, charged to advise in the
                    interests of good government and righteous dealing. Such officers seldom fail to
                    secure a powerful influence, and it is not often that their counsel is
                    disregarded or their representations pass unheeded. More than this, when
                    flagrant injustice occurs the British Government is occasionally compelled to
                    interfere, and instances are not wanting when a raja has been deposed,
                    notwithstanding a clause in his treaty forbidding the intervention of the
                    British Government in the affairs of his state. Such cases, which are not
                    frequent, are justified by political necessity. In many instances native chiefs
                    are allowed by treaty to maintain a military force, but at the present time the
                    troops principally serve to gratify the cravings of Eastern potentates for the
                    outward and visible signs of power.</p>
                <p>Rdj4s of lesser note retain a semblance of power so far as concerns questions of
                    minor importance, but in grave cases involving issues of life and death the
                    officer attached to the court reviews and, should it be necessary, modifies or
                    reverses the decrees which may be passed. Chieftains in this category do not
                    even enjoy the appearance of independence, though in many instances they are
                    allowed to keep a body of military retainers.</p>
                <p>Other r&amp;jds are merely large and wealthy landholders with no sovereign rights
                    or privileges, resembling in many respects the territorial magnates of Great
                    Britain; while in some instances the term is simply a title of distinction
                    unconnected with the possession of land or power.</p>
                <p>Scarcely less complex and varied are the conditions which regulate succession to
                    the rAj ships of India: in some instances adoption is admitted, in other cases
                    collateral succession is accepted, while again there are occasions when the
                    customs of the family are a potent factor in the choice of an heir. It might
                    have been supposed perhaps that the salute could be fairly taken as indicative
                    of the status of the chief to whom it is assigned; but in reality such an
                    assumption would be most misleading, for not unfrequently the number of guns was
                    fixed in bygone years, and the lapse of time has made numerous and essential
                    changes in the status of the various chieftains. So much is this the case that
                    it has never been settled authoritatively what chiefs are entitled to claim the
                    Western prefix of “highness.”</p>
