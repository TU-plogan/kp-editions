                    gymnasium of Leitmeritz, after which he became a student of medicine at Prague.
                    He finished his medical studies at Vienna, graduating there in 1828. Soon after
                    he became assistant to Wagner, the professor of pathological anatomy, and
                    succeeded him in 1834 as prosector, being at the same time made extraordinary
                    professor. It was not until ten years later (1844) that he reached the rank of
                    full professor. To his duties as a teacher he added in 1847 the onerous office
                    of medico-legal anatomist to the city, and in 1863 an influential office in the
                    ministry of education and public worship, wherein he had to advise on all
                    routine matters of medical teaching, including patronage. A seat in the upper
                    house of the reichsrath rewarded his public labours in 1867, and on his
                    retirement from all his offices in 1874 he was made a commander of the Order of
                    Leopold. He joined the Imperial Academy of</p>
                <p>Sciences as a member in 1848, and became its president in 1869. He was president
                    also of the medical society of the Austrian capital and an honorary member of
                    many foreign societies. On his retirement at the age of seventy his colleagues
                    celebrated the occasion by a function in the aula of the university, where his
                    bust was unveiled. In his leave-taking speech he said that work had always been
                    a pleasure to him and pleasures mostly a toil. His death in 1878 elicited many
                    genuine expressions of affection and of esteem for his upright character. Two of
                    his sons became professors at Vienna, one of astronomy and another of medicine,
                    while a third gained distinction on the lyric stage.</p>
                <p>With Rokitansky’s name is associated the second great period of the medical
                    school of Vienna, its first success having been identified with the liberal
                    patronage of it by Maria Theresa and with the fame of Van Swieten, whom the
                    empress had attracted thither from Leyden. The basis of its second reputation
                    was morbid anatomy, together with the precision of clinical diagnosis dependent
                    thereon, and associated with the labours of Rokitansky’s lifelong friend Skoda.
                    The anatomical vogue had begun under Wagner while Rokitansky was still a
                    student; but it reached its highest point while the latter was assistant in the
                    dead-house and afterwards prosector and professor. The enthusiasm for the
                    post-mortem study of disease brought one very serious consequence at the outset,
                    in the enormous increase of the death-rate from puerperal fever in the lying-in
                    wards of the general hospital. A comparison between the slight mortality in the
                    wards that were afterwards reserved for the training of midwives and the
                    excessive mortality in those set apart for the training of students proved that
                    the cause was the conveyance of cadaveric poison from the dead-house by the
                    hands of the latter. The precautions introduced after 1847 succeeded in removing
                    that grave reproach from the study of morbid anatomy. Another and more lasting
                    consequence of the assiduous pursuit of post-mortem study, counterbalancing
                    somewhat the advantage of a more precise and localized diagnosis, was the loss
                    of faith in the power of drugs to remedy the textural changes—the so-called
                    “nihilism” of the Vienna school. The immediate outcome of Rokitansky’s close
                    application to the work of the dead-house was his <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der
                    pathologischen Anatomie</hi> (1842-46), in 3 vols., of which the first was
                    published last. The value of the work lies in the second and third volumes,
                    containing succinct descriptions of the visible changes and abnormalities in the
                    several organs and parts of the body. Whenever Rokitansky touched the vital
                    problems of general pathology, as he did in the postponed first volume, he
                    revealed a metaphysical bent, which was strong in him behind all his undoubted
                    powers of outward observation and accurate description. Being a few years too
                    soon to profit by the microscopic movement which led to the cellular pathology,
                    he endeavoured to reconcile the old humoral doctrine with his anatomical
                    observations, and to read a new meaning into the doctrine of the various
                    dyscrasias. The third and last edition of his <hi rend="italic">Handbuch</hi>
                    was published from 1855 to 1861. In 1862 he entered into possession of a new
                    pathological institute, in which he found means, for the first time, to display
                    his extensive collection of specimens in a museum. Although he had no direct
                    share in the newer developments of pathology, he was far from indifferent or
                    reactionary towards them; indeed the laboratories and chairs for microscopic and
                    experimental pathology and for pathological chemistry were warmly encouraged and
                    aided by him.</p>
                <p>Next to his <hi rend="italic">Handbuch,</hi> of which the Syd. Soc. published an
                    English translation in 4 vols., 1849-52, his most important writings were four
                    memoirs in the <hi rend="italic">Denkschriften</hi> of the Vienna Academy of
                    Sciences (on the Anatomy of Goitre, Cysts, Diseases of Arteries, and Defects in
                    the Septa of the Heart), the last as late as 1875. Other papers of less
                    importance brought up the total of his writings to thirty-eight, including three
                    addresses of a philosophical turn, on “Freedom of Inquiry” (1862), “The
                    Independent Value of Knowledge” (1867), and “The Solidarity of Animal Life"
                    (1869).</p>
