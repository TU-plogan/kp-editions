                    mentioned by Wyntown in his <hi rend="italic">Scottish Chronicle,</hi> written
                    about 1420:</p>

                    to Fordun’s <hi rend="italic">Scotichroηicon</hi> about 1450:</p>
                <p>“Hoc in tempore [1266] de exheredatis et bannitis surrexit et caput erexit ille

                    are many signs. Just one passage must be quoted as of special importance because
                    closely followed by Grafton, Stow, and Camden. It is from Mair’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Majoris Bmtanniae tam Angliae quam Scotiae,</hi> which
                    appeared in 1521.</p>
                <p>“Circa haec teuιpora [Ricardi Primi], ut auguror, Robertus Hudus Anglus et Parvus

                <p>In the Elizabethan era and afterwards mentions abound; see the works of
                    Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Drayton, Warner, Munday, Camden, Stow, Braithwaite,
                    Fuller, «fee.</p>
                <p>Of the ballads themselves, <hi rend="italic">Robin Hood and the Monk</hi> is
                    possibly as old as the reign of Edward II.; <hi rend="italic">Robin Hood and the
                    Potter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Robyn and Gandelyn</hi> are certainly not
                    later than the 15th century. Most important of all is <hi rend="italic">A Lytell
                    Geste of Robyn Hode,</hi> which perhaps was first printed about 1490, although
                    the earliest extant complete copy belongs to about 1520. This is evidently
                    founded on older ballads; we read in <hi rend="italic">The Seconde Eytte,</hi>
                    11. 176 and 177:</p>
                <p>“He wente hym forthe full mery syngynge,</p>
                <p>As men have told in tale.”</p>
                <p>In fact it does for the Robin Hood cycle what a few years before Sir Thomas
                    Malory had done for the Arthurian romances,—what in the 6th century b.c.
                    Pisistratus is said to have done for the Homeric poems.</p>
                <p>These are the facts about him and his balladry. Of conjectures there is no end.
                    He has been represented as the last of the Saxons,—as a Saxon holding out
                    against the Norman conquerors so late as the end of the 12th century (see
                    Thierry’s <hi rend="italic">Harman Conquest,</hi> and compare <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ivanhoe).</hi> Others maintain that he was a follower of Simon de Montfort. A
                    third theory associates him with the earl of Lancaster of Edward II.’s time:
                    Hunter believed that he could identify him with a certain Robin Hood mentioned
                    in the Exchequer accounts of this reign.</p>
                <p>For our part, we are not disinclined to believe that the Robin Hood story has
                    some historical basis, however fanciful and romantic the superstructure. We
                    parallel it with the Arthurian story, and hold that, just as there was probably
                    a real Arthur, however different from the hero of the trouvères, so there was a
                    real Hood, however now enlarged and disguised by the accretions of legend. That
                    Charlemagne and Richard I. of England became the subjects of romances does not
                    prevent our believing in their existence; nor need Hood’s mythical life deprive
                    him of his natural one. Sloth in Langland’s poem couples him, as we have seen,
                    with Randle, earl of Chester; and no one doubts this nobleman’s existence
                    because he had “rymes” made about him. We believe him to have been the third
                    Randle (see Bishop Percy’s Folio MS., ed. Hales and Furnivall, i. 260). And
                    possibly enough Hood was contemporary with that earl, who “flourished” in the
                    reigns of Richard I., John, and Henry III. Wyntown and Major, as we have seen,
                    assign him to that period. It is impossible to believe with Hunter that he lived
                    so late as Edward II.’s reign. This would leave no time for the growth of his
                    myth; and his myth was, as is evident from what we have already said and quoted,
                    full grown in the first half of the 14th century.</p>
                <p>But, whether he lived or not, and whenever he lived, it is certain that many
                    mythical elements are contained in his story. Both his name and his exploits
                    remind us of the woodland spirit Robin Goodfellow and his merry pranks. He is
                    fond of disguising himself, and devoted to fun and practical jokes. And the
                    connexion of the May games with him points to a fusion with some older memory,
                    —with some sun-god. In fact, the outlaw would seem to have become a centre
                    around which gathered and settled older traditions of men and of spirits and of
                    gods. Folklore that was rapidly perishing thus gave itself a new consistency and
                    life. The name Robin (a French form from Rob, which is of course a short form
                    for Robert) would serve both for “the shrewd and knavish sprite”—the German
                    Knecht Ruprecht (see Grimm’s <hi rend="italic">Teut. Myth.,</hi> p. 504, trans.
                    Stallybrass)—and for the bandit (see “Roberdes Knaues” in the Prologue of <hi
                    rend="italic">Piers the Plowman,</hi> 1. 44 and the note in Warton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist, of Eng. Poet.,</hi> ii. 95, ed. 1840). The name Hood is
                    still a common enough surname, of which the earlier shape is Odo (see “Houdart,”
                    »fee., in Larchey’s <hi rend="italic">Diet, des Homs)</hi>; notice too the name
                    Hudson. But it also reminds one of the German familiar spirit Hudekin, or
                    possibly of the German Witikind (see Wright’s <hi rend="italic">Essays on the
                    Middle Ages,</hi> ii. 207). How certain it is that the Robin Hood story
                    attracted to it and appropriated other elements is illustrated by its subsequent
                    history,— its history after the 14th century. Thus later on we find it connected
                    with the Morris dance; but the Morris dance was not known in England before the
                    16th century, or late in the 15th. And the form of the story was greatly
                    modified in the beginning of the 17th century to suit the ideas of the age. It
                    was then that a peer was imported into it, and the yeoman of the older version
                    was metamorphosed into the earl of Huntingdon, for whom in the following century
                    Stukeley discovered a satisfactory pedigree! At last, with the change of times,
                    the myth ceased growing. Its rise and development and decay deserve a more
                    thorough study than they have yet received.</p>
                <p>What perhaps is its greatest interest as we first see it is its expression of the
                    popular mind about the close of the Middle Ages. Robin Hood is at that time the
                    people’s ideal as Arthur is that of the upper classes. He is the ideal yeoman as
                    Arthur is the ideal knight. He readjusts the distribution of property: he robs
                    the rich and endows the poor. He is an earnest worshipper of the Virgin, but a
                    bold and vigorous hater of monks and abbots. He is the great sportsman, the
                    incomparable archer, the lover of the greenwood and of a free life, brave,
                    adventurous, jocular, open-handed, a protector of women. Observe his
                    instructions to Little John :—</p>
                <p>“Loke ye do no housbonde lιanno That tylleth with his plough.</p>
                <p>No more ye shall no good y eman That walketh by grene wode shawe,</p>
                <p>Ne no knyght ne no squyer That wolde be a good felawe.</p>

                <p>And we are told</p>
                <p>“Robin loved our dere lady</p>
                <p>For doute of dedely synne;</p>
                <p>Wolde he never do company h&lt;arme</p>
                <p>That ony woman was ynue.”</p>
                <p>See also Drayton’s <hi rend="italic">Polyolbioη,</hi> Song xxvi. The story is
                    localized in Barnsdale and Sherwood, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> between
                    Doncaster and Nottingham.</p>
                <p>The best collections of the Robin Hood poems are those of Ritson (8vo, 1795) and
                    Gutch (2d ed., 1847), and of Professor Child in the 5th volume of his invaluable
                    <hi rend="italic">English and Scotch Ballads.</hi> The versions in the Percy
                    Folio MS. are unhappily mutilated; but they should be consulted, for they are
                    all more or less unique, and that on “Robin Hoode his death” is of singular
                    interest. The literary and artistic value of the Robin Hood ballads cannot be
                    pronounced consider*</p>
