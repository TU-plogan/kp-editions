                    Estate).</hi> That is to say, it is a ¡)resent interest subject to an existing
                    estate in possession called the particular estate, which must determine before
                    the estate in expectancy can become an estate in possession. A remainder or
                    reversion is in strictness confined to real estate, whether legal or equitable,
                    though a similar interest may exist in personalty. The particular estate and the
                    remainder or reversion together make up the whole estate over which the granter
                    has power of disposition. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Compare the life-rent and fee of Scotch law. </p></note> Accordingly a
                    remainder or reversion limited on an estate in fee simple is void. The
                    difference between a remainder and a reversion, stated as simply as possible, is
                    that the latter is that undisposed-of part of the estate which after the
                    determination of the particular estate will fall into the possession of the
                    original grantor or his representative, while a remainder is that part of the
                    estate which under the same circumstances will fall into the possession of a
                    person other than the original grantor or his representative. A reversion in
                    fact is a special instance of a remainder, distinguishable from it in two
                    important respects :—(1) a reversion arises by operation of law on every grant
                    of an estate where the whole interest is not parted with, whereas a remainder is
                    created by express words; (2) tenure exists between the reversioner and the
                    tenant of the particular estate, but not between the latter and the
                    remainderman. Accordingly rent service is said to be an incident of a reversion
                    but not of a remainder, and a reversioner could distrain for it at common law
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rent).</hi> A reversion may be limited upon any number
                    of remainders, each of them as it falls into possession becoming itself a
                    particular estate. Thus A may grant an estate for life or for years to B, with
                    remainder to C, with remainder to D, with a reversion or ultimate remainder to
                    himself. A remainder or reversion may be alienated either by deed or by will. A
                    conveyance by the tenant of a particular estate to the remainderman or
                    reversioner is called a surrender; a conveyance by the remainderman or
                    reversioner to the tenant is a release.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Remainder.</hi> —Remainders are either vested or contingent.
                    “An estate is vested in interest when there is a present fixed right of future
                    enjoyment. An estate is contingent when a right of enjoyment is to accrue on an
                    event which is dubious and uncertain. A contingent remainder is a remainder
                    limited so as to depend on an event or condition which may never happen or be
                    performed, or which may not happen or he performed till after the determination
                    of the preceding estate” (Fearne, <hi rend="italic">Contingent Remainders,</hi>
                    2, 3). Contingent remainders are of two kinds, those limited to uncertain
                    persons and those limited on uncertain events. A grant by A to B for life,
                    followed by a remainder in fee to the heir of C is an example of a contingent
                    remainder. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A contingent
                    remainder amounting to a freehold cannot be limited on a particular estate less
                    than a freehold. </p></note> Until the death of C he can have no heir. If C die
                    during the lifetime of B, the contingent remainder of his heir becomes vested;
                    if C survive B, the remainder is at common law destroyed owing to the
                    determination of the particular estate, for every remainder must have a
                    particular estate to support it. In the case of a contingent remainder, it must
                    become vested during the continuance of the particular estate or at the instant
                    of its determination. This rule of law no doubt arose from the disfavour shown
                    by the law to contingent remainders on their first introduction. They were not
                    firmly established even when Littleton wrote in the reign of Edward IV. (see
                    Williams, <hi rend="italic">Real Property,</hi> pt. ii. ch. ii.). The
                    inconveniences resulting from this liability of contingent remainders to
                    destruction were formerly overcome by the device of appointing trustees to
                    preserve contingent remainders at law. Equitable contingent remainders, it
                    should be noticed, were indestructible, for they were supported by the legal
                    estate. In recent times the matter has been dealt with by Act of Parliament. By
                    8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 106, § 8, a contingent remainder is rendered capable of
                    taking effect notwithstanding the determination by forfeiture, surrender, or
                    merger of any preceding estate of freehold in the same manner as if such
                    determination had not happened. The case of determination by any other means is
                    met by 40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. 33. The Act provides that a contingent remainder
                    which would have been valid as a springing or shifting use or executory devise
                    or other limitation had it not had a sufficient estate to sup!!ort it as a
                    contingent remainder is, in the event of the particular estate determining
                    before the contingent remainder vests, to be capable of taking effect as though
                    the contingent remainder had originally been created as a springing or shifting
                    use or executory devise or other executory limitation. It will accordingly only
                    be good if the springing use, <hi rend="italic">kc.</hi> (for which see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Trust),</hi> would be good. If the springing use be void as a
                    breach of the rule against perpetuities (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Real
                    Estate),</hi> the remainder will likewise be void. It may be noticed that, apart
                    from this Act, there is some uncertainty as to the application of the rule
                    against perpetuities to remainders. The better opinion is that it applies to
                    equitable remainders and to legal remainders expectant upon an estate for life
                    limited to an unborn person. In the latter case the rule as applied to
                    contingent remainders is somewhat different from that affecting executory
                    interests. The period is different, the remainder allowing the tying up of
                    property for a longer time than the executory interest. There is also the
                    further difference that the rule dpes not affect a contingent remainder if it
                    become vested befdre the determination of the particular estate. An executory
                    interest is void if it may transgress the rule, even though it do not actually
                    do so. The subject of remainders would not be complete without a reference to
                    the famous rule in “Shelley’s Case” (1 Coke’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 93
                    b). The rule is that when the ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate
                    of freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited, either
                    mediately or immediately, to his heirs or the heirs of his body, in such a case
                    the word “heirs” is a word of limitation and not of purchase; that is to say,
                    the estate of the ancestor is not a life or other freehold estate with remainder
                    to the heirs or heirs of the body, but an estate in fee or an estate tail
                    according to circumstances. The rule is a highly technical one, and has led to
                    much litigation and in many cases without a doubt to the defeat of a testator’s
                    intentions. It is said to have had its origin in the wish of the law to preserve
                    to the lords their right of wardship, which would have been ousted by the heir
                    taking as purchaser and not as successor.</p>
                <p>The State laws of the United States affecting remainders will be found in
                    Washburn, <hi rend="italic">Real Property,</hi> vol. ii. bk. ii. ch. iv. § 7. As
                    a general rule contingent remainders have been rendered of little practical
                    importance by enactments that they shall take effect as executory devises or
                    shall not determine on determination of the particular estate. The rule in
                    “Shelley’s Case” is the common law where it is not repealed by statute. The
                    prevailing spirit of legislation in the States is unfavourable to its
                    continuance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reversion.</hi> —Unlike remainders, all reversions are present
                    or vested estates. The law of reversion, like that of remainder, has been
                    considerably modified by statute. It was formerly considered that on the grant
                    of the reversion the tenant should have the opportunity of objecting to the
                    substitution of a new landlord. It was therefore necessary that he should attorn
                    tenant to the purchaser. Without such attornment the grant was void, unless
                    indeed attornment were compelled by levying a fine. The necessity of attornment
                    was abolished by 4 &amp; 5 Anne c. 16. Its only use at present seems to be in
                    the case of mortgage. A mortgagor in possession sometimes attorns tenant to the
                    mortgagee in order that the latter may treat him as his tenant and distrain for
                    his interest as rent. The legal view that rent was incident to the reversion led
                    at common law to a destruction of the rent by destruction of the reversion. This
                    would of course chiefly happen in the case of an under-tenant and his immediate
                    reversioner, if the intermediate became merged in the superior reversion. To
                    obviate this difficulty it was provided by 8 &amp; 9 Yict. c. 106, § 9, that, on
                    surrender or merger of a reversion expectant on a lease, the rights under it
                    should subsist to the reversion conferring the next vested right. The question
                    as to what covenants run with the reversion is one of the most difficult in law.
                    The rule of common law seems to have been that covenants ran with the land but
                    not with the reversion, that is to say, the benefit of them survived to a new
                    tenant but not to a new landlord. The effect of the Act of 32 Hen. VIII. c. 34,
                    and of the Conveyancing Act, 1881 (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. 41, §§ 10, 11, «58), has
                    been to annex to the reversion as a general rule the benefit of the rent and the
                    lessee’s covenants and the burden of the lessor’s covenants. Merely collateral
                    covenants, however, do not run with the reversion, but are regarded as personal
                    contracts between lessor and lessee. At common law on the severance of a
                    reversion a grantee of part of the reversion could not take advantage of any
                    condition for re-entry, on the ground that the condition was entire and not
                    severable. This doctrine was abolished by one of Lord St Leonard’s Acts in 1859.
                    The Conveyancing Act, 1881, § 12, now provides in wider terms than those of the
                    Act of 1859 that on severance of the reversion every condition capable of
                    apportionment is to be apportioned. In order to guard against fraudulent
                    concealment of the death of a <hi rend="italic">cestui qua</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">vie,</hi> or person for whose life any lands are held by
                    another, it was provided by 6 Anne c. 18 that on application to the Court of
                    Chancery by the person entitled in remainder, reversion, or expectancy, the <hi
                    rend="italic">cestui que vie</hi> should be produced to the court or its
                    commissioners, or in default should be taken to be dead. The purchase of a
                    reversionary interest might formerly have been set aside in a court of equity on
                    the ground of inadequacy of price. This rule of equity no longer exists. It was
                    enacted by 31 Vict. c. 4 (which extends to the United Kingdom) that no purchase
                    made <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> of a reversionary interest in real or
                    personal estate shall be set aside merely on the ground of under-value. The Act
                    does not affect those cases in which the courts relieve against such purchases
                    on the ground of fraud or duress—the cases, for instance, of exorbitant bargains
                    made by money-lenders with expectant heirs. In Scotland reversion is generally
                    used in a sense approaching that of the equity of redemption of English law. A
                    reversion is either legal, as in an adjudication, or conventional, as in a
                    wadset. Reversions are registered under the system established by the Act 1617
                    c. 16 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Registration).</hi></p>
                <p>In the United States the Act of 32 Hen. VIII. c. 34 “is held to be in force in
                    Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Connecticut, but was never in force
