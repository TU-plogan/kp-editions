                <p>Renaissance is a term which lias recently come into i) use to indicate a
                    well-known but indefinite space of time and a certain phase in the development
                    of the European races. On the one hand it denotes the transition from that
                    period of history which we call the Middle Ages to that which we call !Modern.
                    On the other hand it implies those changes in the intellectual and moral
                    attitude of the Western nations by which the transition was characterized. If we
                    insist upon the literal meaning of the word, the Renaissance was a re-birth; and
                    it is needful to inquire of what it was the re-birth. The metaphor of
                    Renaissance may signify the entrance of the European nations upon a fresh stage
                    of vital energy in general, implying a fuller consciousness and a freer exercise
                    of faculties than had belonged to the mediaeval period. Or it may mean the
                    resuscitation of simply intellectual activities, stimulated by the revival of
                    antique learning and its application to the arts and literatures of modern
                    peoples. Upon our choice between these two interpretations of the word depend
                    important differences in any treatment of the subject. The former has the
                    disadvantage of making it difficult to separate the Renaissance from other
                    historical phases—the Reformation, for example—with which it ought not to be
                    confounded. The latter has the merit of assigning a specific name to a limited
                    series of events and group of facts, which can be distinguished for the purpose
                    of analysis from other events and facts with which they are intimately but not
                    indissolubly connected. In other words, the one definition of Renaissance makes
                    it denote the whole change which came over Europe at the close of the Middle
                    Ages. The other confines it to what was known "by our ancestors as the Revival
                    of Learning. Yet, when we concentrate attention on the recovery of antique
                    culture, we become aware that this was only one phenomenon or symptom of a far
                    wider and more comprehensive alteration in the conditions of the European races.
                    We find it needful to retain both terms, Renaissance and Revival of Learning,
                    and to show the relations between the series of events and facts which they
                    severally imply. The Revival of Learning must be regarded as a function of that
                    vital energy, an organ of that mental evolution, which brought the modern world,
                    with its new conceptions of philosophy and religion, its re-awakened arts and
                    sciences, its firmer grasp on the realities of human nature and the world, its
                    manifold inventions and discoveries, its altered political systems, its
                    expansive and progressive forces, into being. Important as the Revival of
                    Learning undoubtedly was, there are essential factors in the complex called the
                    Renaissance with which it can but remotely be connected. When we analyse the
                    whole group of phenomena which have to be considered, we perceive that some of
                    the most essential have nothing or little to do with the recovery of the
                    classics. These are, briefly speaking, the decay of those great fabrics, church
                    and empire, which ruled the Middle Ages both as ideas and as realities; the
                    appearance of full-formed nationalities and languages; the enfeeblement of the
                    feudal system throughout Europe; the invention and application of paper, the
                    mariner’s compass, gunpowder, and printing; the exploration of continents beyond
                    the ocean; and the substitution of the Copernican for the Ptolemaic system of
                    astronomy. Europe in fact had been prepared for a thorough-going metamorphosis
                    before that new ideal of human life and culture which the Revival of Learning
                    brought to light had been made <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n398/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0398-0381"/>manifest. It had recovered from the confusion
                    consequent upon the dissolution of the ancient Roman empire. The Teutonic tribes
                    had been Christianized, civilized, and assimilated to the previously Latinized
                    races over whom they exercised the authority of conquerors. Comparative
                    tranquillity and material comfort had succeeded to discord and rough living.
                    Modern nationalities, defined as separate factors in a common system, were ready
                    to cooperate upon the basis of European federation. The ideas of universal
                    monarchy and of indivisible Christendom, incorporated in the Holy Roman Empire
                    and the Roman Church, had so far lost their hold that scope was offered for the
                    introduction of new theories both of state and church which would have seemed
                    visionary or impious to the mediaeval mind. It is therefore obvious that some
                    term, wider than Revival of Learning, descriptive of the change which began to
                    pass over Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries, lias to be adopted. That of
                    Renaissance, Rinascimento, or Renascence is sufficient for the purpose, though
                    we have to guard against the tyranny of what is after all a metaphor. We must
                    not suffer it to lead us into rhetoric about the deadness and the darkness of
                    the Middle Ages, or hamper our inquiry with preconceived assumptions that the
                    re-birth in question was in any true sense a return to the irrecoverable pagan
                    past. Nor must we imagine that there was any abrupt break with the Middle Ages.
                    On the contrary, the Renaissance was rather the last stage of the Middle Ages,
                    emerging from ecclesiastical and feudal despotism, developing what was original
                    in mediaeval ideas by the light of classic arts and letters, holding in itself
                    the promise of the modern world. It was therefore a period and a process of
                    transition, fusion, preparation, tentative endeavour. And just at this point the
                    real importance of the revival of learning may be indicated. That rediscovery of
                    the classic past restored the confidence in their own faculties to men striving
                    after spiritual freedom; revealed the continuity of history and the identity of
                    human nature in spite of diverse creeds and different customs; held up for
                    emulation master-works of literature, philosophy, and art; provoked inquiry;
                    encouraged criticism; shattered the narrow mental barriers imposed by mediaeval
                    orthodoxy. Humanism, a word which will often recur in the ensuing paragraphs,
                    denotes a specific bias which the forces liberated in the Renaissance took from
                    contact with the ancient world,—the particular form assumed by human self-esteem
                    at that epoch,—the ideal of life and civilization evolved by the modern nations.
                    It indicates the endeavour of man to reconstitute himself as a free being, not
                    as the thrall of theological despotism, and the peculiar assistance he derived
                    in this effort from Greek and Roman literature, the <hi rend="italic">litter¿v
                    humaniores,</hi> letters leaning rather to the side of man than of divinity.</p>
                <p>I It is now apparent in what sense the Renaissance has</p>
                <p>־ to be treated in this article. It will be considered as implying a
                    comprehensive movement of the European intellect and will toward
                    self-emancipation, toward re-assertion of the natural rights of the reason and
                    the senses, toward the conquest of this planet as a place of human occupation,
                    and toward the formation of regulative theories both for states and individuals
                    differing from those of mediaeval times. The revival of learning will be treated
                    as a decisive factor in this process of evolution on a new plan. To exclude the
                    Reformation and the Counter-Reformation wholly from the survey is impossible, as
                    will appear more plainly in the sequel. These terms indicate moments in the
                    whole process of modern history which were opposed, each to the other, and both
                    to the Renaissance; and it is needful to bear in mind that they have,
                    scientifically speaking, a quite separate existence. Yet if the history of
                    Europe in the 16th century of our era came to be written with the brevity with
                    which we write the history of Europe in the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> it would be difficult at the distance of time implied by that
                    supposition to distinguish the Italian movement of the Renaissance in its origin
                    from the German movement of the Reformation. Both would be seen to have a common
                    starting-point in the reaction against long dominant ideas which were becoming
                    obsolete, and also in the excitation of faculties which had during the same
                    period been accumulating energy.</p>
                <p>The Renaissance, if we try to regard it as a period, was essentially the
                    transition from one historical stage to another. It cannot therefore be confined
                    within strict chronological limits. This indecision inherent in the nature of a
                    process which involved neither a political revolution nor the promulgation of a
                    new religious creed, but was a gradual metamorphosis of the intellectual and
                    moral state of Europe, is further augmented by the different epochs at which the
                    several nations were prepared to bear their share in it. England, for example,
                    was still feudal and mediaeval when Italy had socially and mentally entered on
                    the modern stadium. A brother of the Black Prince banqueted with Petrarch in the
                    palace of Galeazzo Visconti. That is to say, the founder of Italian humanism,
                    the representative of Italian despotic state-craft, and the companion of
                    Froissart’s heroes met together at a marriage feast. The memories which these
                    names evoke prove how impossible it is to fix boundaries in time for a movement
                    which in 1368 had reached nearly the same point in Italy as it afterwards
                    attained at the close of the 16th century in England. The Renaissance must
                    indeed be viewed mainly as an internal process whereby spiritual energies latent
                    in the Middle Ages were developed into actuality and formed a mental habit for
                    the modern world. The process began in Italy, and gradually extended to the
                    utmost bounds of Europe, producing similar results in every nation, and
                    establishing a common civilization.</p>
                <p>There is one date, however, which may be remembered with advantage as the
                    starting-point in time of the Renaissance, after the departure from the Middle
                    Ages had been definitely and consciously made by the Italians. This is the year
                    1453, when Constantinople, chosen for his capital by the first Christian emperor
                    of Rome, fell into the hands of the Turk. One of the survivals of the old world,
                    the shadow of what had been the Eastern empire, now passed suddenly away. Almost
                    at the same date that visionary revival of the Western empire, which had imposed
                    for six centuries upon the imagination of mediaeval Europe, hampering Italy and
                    impeding the consolidation of Germany, ceased to reckon among political
                    actualities; while its more robust rival, the Roman Church, seemed likely to
                    sink into the rank of a petty Italian principality. Three lights of mediaeval
                    Christendom, the Eastern empire, the Holy Roman empire, and the papacy, at this
                    point of time severally suffered extinction, mortal enfeeblement, and profound
                    internal transformation. It was demonstrated by the destruction of the Eastern
                    and the dotage of the Western empire, and by the new papal policy which Nicholas
                    V. inaugurated, that the old order of society was about to be superseded.
                    Nothing remained to check those centrifugal forces in state and church which
                    substituted a confederation of rival European powers for the earlier ideal of
                    universal monarchy, and separate religious constitutions for the previous
                    Catholic unity. At the same time the new learning introduced by the earlier
                    humanists awakened free thought, encouraged curiosity, and prepared the best
                    minds of Europe for speculative audacities from which the schoolmen would have
                    shrunk, and which soon expressed themselves in acts of cosmopolitan importance.
                    The new learning had been <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0399-0382"/>received gladly. Its vast significance was hardly
                    understood. Both secular and spiritual potentates delighted in the beauty and
                    fascination of those eloquent words which scholars, poets, and critics
                    uttered—“words indeed, but words which drew armed hosts behind them !”</p>
                <p>If we look a little forward to the years 1492-1500, we obtain a second date of
                    great importance. In these years the expedition of Charles VIII. to Naples
                    opened Italy to ' French, Spanish, and German interference. The leading nations
                    of Europe began to compete for the prize of the peninsula, and learned meanwhile
                    that culture which the Italians had perfected. In these years the secularization
                    of the papacy was carried to its final point by Alexander VI., and the
                    Reformation became inevitable. The same period w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                    as marked by the discovery of America, the exploration of the Indian seas, and
                    the consolidation of the Spanish nationality. It also witnessed the application
                    of printing to the diffusion of knowledge, the revolution effected in military
                    operations by the use of gunpowder, and the revolution in cosmology which
                    resulted from the Copernican discovery. Thus, speaking roughly, the half century
                    between 1450 and 1500 may be termed the culminating point of the Renaissance.
                    The transition from the mediaeval to the modern order was now secured if not
                    accomplished, and a Rubicon had been crossed from which no retrogression to the
                    past was possible. Looking yet a little farther, to the years 1527 and 1530, a
                    third decisive date is reached. In the first of these years happened the sack of
                    Rome, in the second the pacification of Italy by Charles V. under a Spanish
                    hegemony. The age of the Renaissance was now closed for the land which gave it
                    birth. The Reformation had taken firm hold on northern Europe. The
                    Counter-Reformation was already imminent.</p>
                <p>It must not be imagined that so great a change as that implied by the Renaissance
                    w <hi rend="superscript">T</hi> as accomplished without premonitory symptoms and
                    previous endeavours. In the main we mean by it the recovery of freedom for the
                    human spirit after a long period of bondage to oppressive ecclesiastical and
                    political orthodoxy,—a return to the liberal and practical conceptions of the
                    world which the nations of antiquity had enjoyed, but upon a new and enlarged
                    platform. This being so, it was inevitable that the finally successful efforts
                    after self-emancipation should have been anticipated from time to time by
                    strivings within the ages that are known as dark and mediaeval. It is therefore
                    part of the present inquiry to pass in review some of the claimants to be
                    considered precursors of the Renaissance. First of all must be named the Frank
                    in whose lifetime the dual conception of universal empireand universal church,
                    divinely appointed, sacred, and inviolable, began to control the order of
                    European society. Charles the Great lent his forces to the plan of resuscitating
                    the Roman empire at a moment when his own power made him the arbiter of western
                    Europe, when the papacy needed his alliance, and when the Eastern empire had
                    passed ·under the usurped regency of a female. He modelled a spurious Roman
                    empire, which was surnamed “Holy,” in consequence of the diplomatic contract
                    struck by him with the bishop of Rome, and in obedience to the prevailing
                    theological beliefs of Latin Christianity. The Holy so-called Roman but
                    essentially Teutonic empire owed such substance as the fabric possessed to
                    Frankish armies and the sinews of the German people. As a structure composed of
                    divers ill-connected parts it fell to pieces at its builder’s death, leaving
                    little but the incubus of a memory, the fascination of a mighty name, to
                    dominate the mind of mediaeval Europe. As an idea, the empire grew in visionary
                    power, and remained one of the cliief obstacles in the way of both Italian and
                    German national coherence. Real force was not in it, but rather in that
                    counterpart to its unlimited pretensions, the church, which had evolved it from
                    barbarian night, and which used her own more vital energies for undermining the
                    rival of her creation. Charles the Great, having proclaimed himself successor of
                    the Csesars, was obscurely ambitious of imitating the August! also in the sphere
                    of letters. He caused a scheme of humanistic education to be formulated, and
                    gave employment at his court to rhetoricians, of whom Alcuin was the most
                    considerable. But very little came of the revival of learning which Charles is
                    supposed to have encouraged; and the empire he restored was accepted by the
                    mediaeval intellect in a crudely theological and vaguely mystical spirit. We
                    should, however, here remember that the study of Roman law, which was one
                    important precursory symptom of the Renaissance, owed much to mediaeval respect
                    for the empire as a divine institution. This, together with the municipal
                    Italian intolerance of the Lombard and Frankish codes, kept alive the practice
                    and revived the science of Latin jurisprudence at an early period.</p>
                <p>Philosophy attempted to free itself from the trammels s of theological orthodoxy
                    in the hardy speculations of <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> some schoolmen,
                    notably of Scotus Erigena and Abelard. | These innovators found, however, small
                    support, and were <hi rend="italic">j</hi> defeated by opponents who used the
                    same logical weapons with authority to back them. Nor were the rationalistic
                    opinions of the Averroists without their value, though the church condemned
                    these deviators from her discipline as heretics. Such mediteval materialists,
                    moreover, had but feeble hold upon the substance of real knowledge. Imperfect
                    acquaintance with authors whom they studied in Latin translations made by Jews
                    from Arabic commentaries on Greek texts, together with almost total ignorance of
                    natural laws, condemned them to sterility. Like the other schiomachists of their
                    epoch, they fought with phantoms in a visionary realm. A similar judgment may be
                    passed upon those Paulician, Albigensian, Paterine, and Epicurean dissenters
                    from the Catholic creed who opposed the phalanxes of orthodoxy with frail
                    imaginative weapons, and alarmed established orders in the state by the audacity
                    of their communistic opinions. Physical science struggled into feeble life in
                    the cells of Gerbert and Roger Bacon. But these men were accounted magicians by
                    the vulgar; and, while the one eventually assumed the tiara, the other was
                    incarcerated in a dungeon. The schools meanwhile resounded still to the
                    interminable dispute upon abstractions. Are onlyuniversals real, or has each
                    name a corresponding entity? From the midst of the Franciscans who had
                    persecuted Roger Bacon because he presumed to know more than was consistent with
                    human humility arose John of Parma, adopting and popularizing the mystic
                    prophecy of Joachim of Flora. The reign of the Father is past; the reign of the
                    Son is passing; the reign of the Spirit is at hand. Such was the formula of the
                    Eternal Gospel, which, as an unconscious forecast of the Renaissance, has
                    attracted retrospective students by its felicity of adaptation to their
                    historical method. Yet we must remember that this bold intuition of the abbot
                    Joachim indicated a monastic reaction against the tyrannies and corruptions of
                    the church, rather than a fertile philosophical conception. The Fraticelli
                    spiritualists, and similar sects who fed their imagination with his doctrine,
                    expired in the flames to which Fra Dolcino, Longino,and Margharitawere
                    consigned. To what extent the accusations of profligate morals brought against
                    these reforming sectarians were justified remains doubtful; and the same
                    uncertainty rests upon the alleged iniquities of the Templars. It is only
                    certain that at this epoch the fabric of Catholic faith was threatened with
                    various forms of prophetic and Oriental <pb break="no"

                    grasp at something simpler, purer, and less rigid than Latin theology afforded.
                    Devoid of criticism, devoid of sound learning, devoid of a firm hold on the
                    realities of life, these heresies passed away without solid results and were
                    forgotten.</p>
                <p>We are too apt to take for granted that the men of the Middle Ages were immersed
                    in meditations on the other <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> world, and that their
                    intellectual exercises were confined to , abstractions of the schools,
                    hallucinations of the fancy, allegories, visions. This assumption applies indeed
                    in a broad sense to that period which was dominated by intolerant theology and
                    deprived of positive knowledge. Yet there are abundant signs that the native
                    human instincts, the natural human appetites, remained unaltered and alive
                    beneath the crust of orthodoxy. In the person of a pope like Boniface VIII.
                    those ineradicable forces of the natural man assumed, if we may trust the
                    depositions of ecclesiastics well acquainted with his life, a form of brutal
                    atheistic cynicism. In the person of an emperor, Frederick IL, they emerged
                    under the more agreeable garb of liberal culture and Epicurean scepticism.
                    Frederick dreamed of remodelling society upon a mundane type, which anticipated
                    the large toleration and cosmopolitan enlightenment of the actual Renaissance.
                    But his efforts were defeated by the unrelenting hostility of the church, and by
                    the incapacity of his contemporaries to understand his aims. After being forced
                    in his lifetime to submit to authority, he was consigned by Dante to hell.
                    Frederick’s ideal of civilization was derived in a large measure from Provence,
                    where a beautiful culture had prematurely bloomed, filling southern Europe with
                    the perfume of poetry and gentle living. Here, if anywhere, it seemed as though
                    the ecclesiastical and feudal fetters of the Middle Ages might be broken, and
                    humanity might enter on a new stage of joyous unimpeded evolution. This was,
                    however, not to be. The church preached Simon de Montfort’s crusade, and
                    organized Dominic’s Inquisition; what Quinet calls the “Renaissance sociale par
                    1’Amour” was extirpated by sword, fire, famine, and pestilence. Meanwhile the
                    Provençal poets had developed their modern language with incomparable richness
                    and dexterity, creating forms of verse and modes of emotional expression which
                    determined the latest mediaeval phase of literature in Europe. The naturalism of
                    which we have been speaking found free utterance now in the fabliaux of
                    jongleurs, lyrics of minnesingers, tales of trouvères, romances of Arthur and
                    his knights,—compositions varied in type and tone, but in all of which sincere
                    passion and real enjoyment of life pierce through the thin veil of chivalrous
                    mysticism or of allegory with which they were sometimes conventionally draped.
                    The tales of Lancelot and Tristram, the lives of the troubadours and the
                    Wachtlieder of the minnesingers, sufficiently prove with what sensual freedom a
                    knight loved the lady whom custom and art made him profess to worship as a
                    saint. We do not need to be reminded that Beatrice’s adorer had a wife and
                    children, or that Laura’s poet owned a son and daughter by a concubine, in order
                    to perceive that the mystic passion of chivalry was compatible in the Middle
                    Ages with commonplace matrimony or vulgar illegitimate connexions. But perhaps
                    the most convincing testimony to the presence of this ineradicable naturalism is
                    afforded by the Latin songs of wandering 3 students, known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carmina Burana,</hi> written by the self-styled Goliardi. In these
                    compositions, remarkable for their facile handling of mediaeval Latin rhymes and
                    rhythms, the allegorizing mysticism wdiich envelops chivalrous poetry is
                    discarded. Love is treated from a frankly carnal point of view. Bacchus and
                    Venus go hand in hand, as in the ancient ante-Christian age. The open-air
                    enjoyments of the wood, the field, the dance upon the village green, are sung w
                    <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ith juvenile lightheartedness. No grave note,
                    warning us that the pleasures of this earth are fleeting, that the visible world
                    is but a symbol of the invisible, that human life is a probation for the life
                    beyond, interrupts the tinkling music as of castanets and tripping feet which
                    gives a novel charm to these unique relics of the 13th century. Goliardic poetry
                    is further curious as showing how the classics even at that early period were a
                    fountainhead of pagan inspiration. In the taverns and low places of amusement
                    haunted by those lettered songsters, on the open road and in the forests trodden
                    by their vagrant feet, the deities of Greece and Rome were not in exile, but at
                    home within the hearts of living men. Thus, while Christendom was still
                    ]ireoccupied with the crusades, two main forces of the Renaissance, naturalism
                    and enthusiasm for antique modes of feeling, already brought their latent
                    potency to light, prematurely indeed and precociously, yet with a promise that
                    was destined to be kept.</p>
                <p>When due regard is paid to these miscellaneous evidences of intellectual and
                    sensual freedom during the Middle Ages, it will be seen that there were by no
                    means lacking elements of native vigour ready to burst forth. What was wanting w
                    <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as not vitality and licence, not audacity of
                    speculation, not lawless instinct or rebellious impulse. It was rather the right
                    touch on life, the right feeling for human independence, the right way of
                    approaching the materials of philosophy, religion, scholarship, and literature,
                    that failed. The courage that is born of knowledge, the calm strength begotten
                    by a positive attitude of mind, face to face with the dominant overshadowing
                    Sphinx of theology, were lacking. We may fairly say that natural and untaught
                    people had more of the just intuition that was needed than learned folk trained
                    in the schools. But these people were rendered licentious in revolt or impotent
                    for salutary action by ignorance, by terror, by uneasy dread of the doom
                    declared for heretics and rebels. The massive vengeance of the church hung over
                    them, like a heavy sword suspended in the cloudy air. Superstition and stupidity
                    hedged them in on every side, so that sorcery and magic seemed the only means of
                    winning power over nature or insight into mysteries surrounding human life. The
                    path from darkness to light was lost; thought w׳as involved in allegory; the
                    study of nature had been perverted into an inept system of grotesque and pious
                    parable-mongering; the pursuit of truth had become a game of wordy dialectics.
                    The other world with its imagined heaven and hell haunted the conscience like a
                    nightmare. However sweet this world seemed, however fair the flesh, both world
                    and flesh were theoretically given over to the devil. It was not worth while to
                    master and economize the resources of this earth, to utilize the goods and
                    ameliorate the evils of this life, while every one agreed, in theory at any
                    rate, that the present was but a bad prelude to an infinitely worse or
                    infinitely better future. To escape from these preoccupations and prejudices
                    except upon the path of conscious and deliberate sin was impossible for all but
                    minds of rarest quality and courage; and these were too often reduced to the
                    recantation of their supposed errors no less by some secret clinging sense of
                    guilt than by the church’s iron hand. Man and the actual universe kept on
                    reasserting their rights and claims, announcing their goodliness and
                    delightfulness, in one way or another; but they were always being thrust back
                    again into Cimmerian regions of abstractions, fictions, visions, spectral hopes
                    and fears, in the midst of which the intellect somnambulistically moved upon an
                    unknown way.</p>

                <p>It is just at tliis point that the Revival of Learning intervened to determine
                    the course of the Renaissance. Medieval students possessed a considerable
                    portion of the Latin ' classics, though Greek had become in the fullest sense of
                    the phrase a dead language. Rut what they retained of ancient literature they
                    could not comprehend in the right spirit. Between them and the text of poet or
                    historian hung a veil of mysticism, a vapour of misapprehension. The odour of
                    unsanctity clung around those relics of the pagan past. Men bred in the cloister
                    and the lecture-room of the logicians, trained in scholastic disputations,
                    versed in allegorical interpretations of the plainest words and most apparent
                    facts, could not find the key which might unlock those stores of wisdom and of
                    beauty. Petrarch first opened a new method in scholarship, and revealed what we
                    denote as humanism. In his teaching lay the twofold discovery of man and of the
                    world. For humanism, which was the vital element in the Revival of Learning,
                    consists mainly of a just perception of the dignity of man as a rational,
                    volitional, and sentient being, born upon this earth with a right to use it and
                    enjoy it. Humanism implied the rejection of those visions of a future and
                    imagined state of souls as the only absolute reality, which had fascinated the
                    imagination of the Middle Ages. It involved a vivid recognition of the
                    goodliness of man and nature, displayed in the great monuments of human power
                    recovered from the past. It stimulated the curiosity of latent sensibilities,
                    provoked fresh inquisition into the groundwork of existence, and strengthened
                    man’s selfesteem by knowledge of what men had thought and felt and done in ages
                    when Christianity was not. It roused a desire to reappropriate the whole
                    abandoned provinces of mundane energy, and a hope to emulate antiquity in works
                    of living loveliness and vigour. The Italians of the 14th century, more
                    precocious than the other European races, were ripe for this emancipation of
                    enslaved intelligence. In the classics they found the food which was required to
                    nourish the new spirit; and a variety of circumstances, among which must be
                    reckoned the pride of a nation boasting of its descent from the Populus Romanus,
                    rendered them apt to fling aside the obstacles that had impeded the free action
                    of the mind through many centuries. Petrarch not only set his countrymen upon
                    the right method of studying the Latin classics, but he also divined the
                    importance of recovering a knowledge of Greek literature. To this task Boccaccio
                    addressed himself; and he was followed by numerous Italian enthusiasts, who
                    visited Byzantium before its fall as the sacred city of a new revelation. The
                    next step was to collect MSS., to hunt out, copy, and preserve the precious
                    relics of the past. In this work of accumulation Guarino and Filelfo, Aurispa
                    and Poggio, took the chief part, aided by the wealth of Italian patricians,
                    merchant-princes, and despots, who were inspired by the sacred thirst for
                    learning. Learning was then no mere pursuit of a special and recluse class. It
                    was fashionable and it was passionate, pervading all society with the fervour of
                    romance. For a generation nursed in decadent scholasticism and stereotyped
                    theological formulae it was the fountain of renascent youth, beauty, and
                    freedom, the shape in which the Helen of art and poetry appeared to the ravished
                    eyes of mediaeval Faustus. It was the resurrection of the mightiest spirits of
                    the past. “I go,” said Cyriac of Ancona, the indefatigable though uncritical
                    explorer of antiquities, “I go to awake the dead !” This was the enthusiasm,
                    this the vitalizing faith, which made the work of scholarship in the 15th
                    century so highly strung and ardent. The men who followed it knew that they w
                    <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ere restoring humanity to its birthright after the
                    expatriation of ten centuries. They were instinctively aware that the effort was
                    for liberty of action, thought, and conscience in the future. This conviction
                    made young men leave their loves and pleasures, grave men quit their
                    counting-houses, churchmen desert their missals, to crowd the lecture rooms of
                    philologers and rhetoricians. When Greek had been acquired, !MSS. accumulated,
                    libraries and museums formed, came the age of printers and expositors. Aldus
                    Manutius in Italy, Froben in Basel, the Etiennes in Paris, committed to the
                    press what the investigators had recovered. Nor were there wanting at the same
                    time men who dedicated their powers to Hebrew and Oriental erudition, laying,
                    together with the Grecians, a basis for those Biblical studies which advanced
                    the Reformation. Meanwhile the languages of Greece and Rome had been so
                    thoroughly appropriated that a final race of scholars, headed by Politian,
                    Pontano, Valla, handled once again in verse and prose both antique dialects, and
                    thrilled the ears of Europe with new-made pagan melodies. The church itself at
                    this epoch lent its influence to the prevalent enthusiasm. Nicholas 'V. and Leo
                    X., not to mention intervening popes who showed themselves tolerant of
                    humanistic culture, were heroes of the classical revival. Scholarship became the
                    surest path of advancement to ecclesiastical and political honours. Italy was
                    one great school of the new learning at the moment when the German, French, and
                    Spanish nations were invited to her feast.</p>
                <p>It will be well to describe briefly, but in detail, what! this meeting of the
                    modern with the ancient mind effected <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> over the
                    whole field of intellectual interests. In doing! so, we must be careful to
                    remember that the study of the classics did but give a special impulse to
                    pent-up energies which were bound in one way or another to assert their
                    independence. Without the Revival of Learning the direction of those forces
                    would have been different; but that novel intuition into the nature of the world
                    and man which constitutes what we describe as Renaissance must have emerged. As
                    the facts, however, stand before us, it is impossible to dissociate the
                    rejection of the other world as the sole reality, the joyous acceptance of this
                    world as a place to live and act in, the conviction that “the proper study of
                    mankind is man,” from humanism. Humanism, as it actually appeared in Italy, was
                    positive in its conception of the problems to be solved, pagan in its contempt
                    for mediaeval mysticism, invigorated for sensuous enjoyment by contact with
                    antiquity, yet holding in itself the germ of new religious aspirations,
                    profounder science, and sterner probings of the mysteries of life than had been
                    attempted even by the ancients. The operation of this humanistic spirit has now
                    to be traced.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that Italian literature owed little at the outset to the revival of
                    learning. The the <hi rend="italic">Canzoniere,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decameron</hi> were works of monumental art, deriving neither form nor
                    inspiration imme-, diately from the classics, but applying the originality of
                    Italian genius to matter drawn from previous mediaeval sources. Dante showed
                    both in his epic poem and in his lyrics that he had not abandoned the sphere of
                    contemporary thought. Allegory and theology, the vision and the symbol, still
                    determine the form of masterpieces which for perfection of workmanship and for
                    emancipated force of intellect rank among the highest products of the human
                    mind. Yet they are not mediaeval in the same sense as the song of Roland or the
                    Arthurian cycle. They proved that, though Italy came late into the realm of
                    literature, her action was destined to be decisive and alterative by the
                    introduction of a new spirit, a firmer and more positive grasp on life and art.
                    These qualities she owed to her material prosperity, to her freedom from
                    feudalism, to her secularized church, her commercial nobility, her political
                    independence in a federation of small states. Petrarch <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0402-0385"/>and Boccaccio, though they both held the mediaeval
                    doctrine that literature should teach some abstruse truth beneath a veil of
                    fiction, differed from Dante ·in this that their poetry and prose in the
                    vernacular abandoned both allegory and symbol. In their practice they ignored
                    their theory. Petrarch’s lyrics continue the Provençal tradition as it had been
                    reformed in Tuscany, with a subtler and more modern analysis of emotion, a purer
                    and more chastened style, than his masters could boast. Boccaccio’s tales, in
                    like manner, continue the tradition of the fabliaux, raising that literary
                    species to the rank of finished art, enriching it with humour, and strengthening
                    its substance by keen insight into all varieties of character. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Canzoniere</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi>
                    distinguish themselves from mediaeval literature, not by any return to classical
                    precedents, but by free self-conscious handling of human nature. So much had to
                    be premised in order to make it clear in what relation humanism stood to the
                    Renaissance, since the Italian work of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio is
                    sufficient to indicate the re-birth of the spirit after ages of apparent
                    deadness. Had the Revival of Learning not intervened it is probable that the
                    vigorous efforts of these writers alone would have inaugurated a new age of
                    European culture. Yet, while noting this reservation of judgment, it must also
                    be remarked that all three felt themselves under some peculiar obligation to the
                    classics. Dante, mediaeval as his temper seems to us, chose Virgil for his
                    guide, and ascribed his mastery of style to the study of Virgilian poetry.
                    Petrarch and Boccaccio were, as we have seen, the pioneers of the new learning.
                    They held their writings in the vernacular cheap, and initiated that contempt
                    for the mother tongue which was a note of the earlier Renaissance. It may
                    further be observed that Giovanni Villani, the first chronicler who used Italian
                    for the compilation of a methodical history, tells us how he was impelled to
                    write by musing on the ruins of Rome and thinking of the vanished greatness of
                    the Latin race. We have therefore to recognize this fact that the four greatest
                    writers of the 14th century, while the Revival of Learning was yet in its
                    cradle, each after his own fashion acknowledged the vivifying touch upon their
                    spirit of the antique genius. They seem to have been conscious that they could
                    not give the desired impulse to modern literature and art without contact with
                    the classics; and, in spite of the splendour of their achievements in Italian,
                    they found no immediate followers upon that path.</p>
                <p>! The fascination of pure study was so powerful, the Italians at that epoch were
                    so eager to recover the past, ’that during the 15th century we have before our
                    eyes! the spectacle of this great nation deviating from the course of
                    development begun in poetry by Dante and Petrarch, in prose by Boccaccio and
                    Villani, into the channels of scholarship and antiquarian research. The language
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Canzoniere</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi>
                    was abandoned for revived Latin and discovered Greek. Acquisition supplanted
                    invention; imitation of classical authors suppressed originality of style. The
                    energies of the Italian people were devoted to transcribing codices, settling
                    texts, translating Greek books into Latin, compiling grammars, commentaries,
                    encyclopaedias, dictionaries, epitomes, and epliemerides. During this century
                    the best histories—Bruno’s and Poggio’s annals of Florence, for example—were
                    composed in Latin after the manner of Livy. The best dissertations, Landino’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Camaldunenses,</hi> Valla’s <hi rend="italic">De
                    Voluptate,</hi> were laboured imitations of Cicero’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tusculans.</hi> The best verses, Pontano’s elegies, Politian’s hexameters, were
                    in like manner Latin; public orations upon ceremonial occasions were delivered
                    in the Latin tongue; correspondence, official and familiar, was carried on in
                    the same language; even the fabliaux received, in Poggio’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Facetiae</hi> , a dress of elegant</p>
                <p>Latinity. The noticeable barrenness of Italian literature at this period is
                    referable to the fact that men of genius and talent devoted themselves to
                    erudition and struggled to express their thoughts and feelings in a speech which
                    was not natural. Yet they were engaged in a work of incalculable importance. At
                    the close of the century the knowledge of Greece and Rome had been
                    reappropriated and placed beyond the possibility of destruction; the chasm
                    between the old and new world had been bridged; mediaeval modes of thinking and
                    discussing had been superseded; the staple of education, the common culture
                    which has brought all Europe into intellectual agreement, was already in
                    existence. Humanism was now an actuality. Owing to the uncritical veneration for
                    antiquity which then prevailed, it had received a strong tincture of pedantry.
                    Its professors, in their revolt against the Middle Ages, made light of
                    Christianity and paraded paganism. What was even worse from an artistic point of
                    view, they had contracted puerilities of style, vanities of rhetoric,
                    stupidities of wearisome citation. Still, at the opening of the 16th century, it
                    became manifest what fruits of noble quality the Revival of Letters was about to
                    bring forth for modern literature. Two great scholars, Lorenzo de’ Medici and
                    Politian, had already returned to the practice of Italian poetry. Their work is
                    the first absolutely modern work,—modern in the sense of having absorbed the
                    stores of classic learning and reproduced those treasures in forms of simple,
                    natural, native beauty. Boiardo occupies a similar position by the fusion of
                    classic mythology with chivalrous romance in his <hi rend="italic">Orlando
                    Innamorato.</hi> But the victor’s laurels were reserved for Ariosto, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Orlando Furioso</hi> is the purest and most perfect extant example
                    of Renaissance poetry. It was not merely in what they had acquired and
                    assimilated from the classics that these poets showed the transformation
                    effected in the field of literature by humanism. The whole method and spirit of
                    mediaeval art had been abandoned. That of the Cinque Cento is positive, defined,
                    mundane. The deity, if deity there be, that rules in it, is beauty. Interest is
                    confined to the actions, passions, sufferings, and joys of human life, to its
                    pathetic, tragic, humorous, and sentimental incidents. Of the state of souls
                    beyond the grave we hear and are supposed to care nothing. In the drama the
                    pedantry of the Revival, which had not injured romantic literature, made itself
                    perniciously felt. Rules were collected from Horace and Aristotle. Seneca was
                    chosen as the model of tragedy; Plautus and Terence supplied the groundwork of
                    comedy. Thus in the plays of Rucellai, Trissino, Sperone, and other tragic
                    poets, the nobler elements of humanism, considered as a revelation of the world
                    and man, obtained no free development. Even the comedies of the best authors are
                    too observant of Latin precedents, although some pieces of Macliiavelli,
                    Ariosto, Aretino, Cecclii, and Gelli are admirable for vivid delineation of
                    contemporary manners.</p>
                <p>The relation of the plastic arts to the revival of learning is similar to that
                    which has been sketched in the case of poetry. Cimabue started with work which
                    owed nothing directly to antiquity. At about the same time Niccola Pisano
                    studied the style of sculpture in fragments of Graeco-Roman marbles. His manner
                    influenced Giotto, who set painting on a forward path. Fortunately for the
                    unimpeded expansion of Italian art, little was brought to light of antique
                    workmanship during the 14th and 15th centuries. The classical stimulus came to
                    painters, sculptors, and architects chiefly through literature. Therefore there
                    was narrow scope for imitation, and the right spirit of humanism displayed
                    itself in a passionate study of perspective, nature, and the nude. Yet we find
                    in the writings of Ghiberti and Alberti, we notice in the master <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n403/mode/1up"

                    Brunelleschi and Donatello, how even in the 15th century the minds of artists
                    were fascinated by what survived of classic grace and science. Gradually, as the
                    race became penetrated with antique thought, the earlier Christian motives of
                    the arts yielded to pagan subjects. Gothic architecture, which had always
                    flourished feebly on Italian soil, was supplanted by a hybrid Roman style. The
                    study of Vitruvius gave strong support to that pseudo-classic manner which, when
                    it had reached its final point in Palladio’s work, overspread the whole of
                    Europe and dominated taste during two centuries. But the perfect plastic art of
                    Italy, the pure art of the Cinque Cento, the painting of Raphael, Da Vinci,
                    Titian, and Correggio, the sculpture of Donatello, Michelangelo, and Sansovino,
                    the architecture of Bra-man te, Omodco, and the Venetian Lombardi, however much
                    imbued with the spirit of the classical revival, takes rank beside the poetry of
                    Ariosto as a free intelligent product of the Renaissance. That is to say, it is
                    not so much an outcome of studies in antiquity as an exhibition of emancipated
                    modern genius fired and illuminated by the masterpieces of the past. It
                    indicates a separation from the Middle Ages, inasmuch as it is permanently
                    natural. Its religion is joyous, sensuous, dramatic, terrible, but in each and
                    all of its many-sided manifestations strictly human. Its touch on classical
                    mythology is original, rarely imitative or pedantic. The art of the Renaissance
                    was an apocalypse of the beauty of the world and man in unaffected spontaneity,
                    without side thoughts for piety or erudition, inspired by pure delight in
                    loveliness and harmony for their own sakes.</p>
                <p>In the fields of science and philosophy humanism wrought ' similar important
                    changes. Petrarch began by waging relentless war against the logicians and
                    materialists of his own day. "With the advance made in Greek studies scholastic
                    methods of thinking fell into contemptuous oblivion. The newly aroused curiosity
                    for nature encouraged men like Alberti, Da Vinci, Toscanelli, and Da Porta to
                    make practical experiments, penetrate the working of physical forces, and invent
                    scientific instruments. Anatomy began to be studied, and the time w <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> as not far distant when Titian should lend his pencil
                    to the epoch-making treatise of Vesalius. The Middle Ages had been satisfied
                    with absurd and visionary notions about the world around them, while the body of
                    man was regarded with too much suspicion to be studied. Now the right method of
                    interrogating nature with patience and loving admiration was instituted. At the
                    same time the texts of ancient authors supplied hints which led to discoveries
                    so far-reaching in their results as those of Copernicus, Columbus, and Galileo.
                    In philosophy, properly so-called, the humanistic scorn for mediaeval dulness
                    and obscurity swept away theological metaphysics as valueless. But at first
                    little beyond empty rhetoric and clumsy compilation was substituted. The ethical
                    treatises of the scholars are deficient in substance, while Ficino’s attempt to
                    revive Platonism betrays an uncritical conception of his master’s drift. It was
                    something, however, to have shaken off the shackles of ecclesiastical authority;
                    and, even if a new authority, that of the ancients, was accepted in its stead,
                    still progress was being made toward sounder methods of analysis. This is
                    noticeable in Pomponazzo’s system of materialism, based on the interpretation of
                    Aristotle, but revealing a virile spirit of disinterested and unprejudiced
                    research. The thinkers of southern Italy, Telesio, Bruno, and Campanella, at
                    last opened the two chief lines on which modern speculation has since moved.
                    Telesio and Campanella may be termed the predecessors of Bacon. Bruno was the
                    precursor of the idealistic schools. All three alike strove to disengage their
                    minds from classical as well as ecclesiastical authority, proving that the
                    emancipation of the will had been accomplished. It must be added that their
                    writings, like every other product of the Renaissance, except its purest poetry
                    and art, exhibit a hybrid between mediaeval arid modern tendencies. Childish
                    ineptitudes are mingled with intuitions of maturcst wisdom, and seeds of future
                    thought germinate in the decaying refuse of past systems.</p>
                <p>Humanism in its earliest stages was uncritical. It absorbed the relics of
                    antiquity with omnivorous appetite, and with very imperfect sense of the
                    distinction between worse and better work. Yet it led in process of time to
                    criticism. The critique of literature began in the lecture room of Politian, in
                    the printing-house of Aldus, and in the school of Vittorino. The critique of
                    Roman law started, under Politian’s auspices, upon a more liberal course than
                    that which had been followed by the powerful but narrow-sighted glossators of
                    Bologna. Finally, in the court of Naples arose that most formidable of all
                    critical engines, the critique of established ecclesiastical traditions and
                    spurious historical documents. Valla by one vigorous effort destroyed the False
                    Decretals and exposed the Donation of Constantine to ridicule, paving the way
                    for the polemic carried on against the dubious pretensions of the papal throne
                    by scholars of the Reformation. A similar criticism, conducted less on lines of
                    erudition than of persiflage and irony, ransacked the moral abuses of the church
                    and played around the very foundations of Christianity. This was tolerated with
                    approval by men who repeated Leo X.’s witty epigram: “What profit has not that
                    fable of Christ brought us !” The same critical and philosophic spirit working
                    on the materials of history produced a new science, the honours of which belong
                    to Machiavelli. He showed, on the one side, how the history of a people can be
                    written with a recognition of fixed principles, and at the same time with an
                    artistic feeling for personal and dramatic episodes. On the other side, he
                    addressed himself to the analysis of man considered as a political being, to the
                    anatomy of constitutions and the classification of governments, to the study of
                    motives underlying public action, the secrets of success and the causes of
                    failure in the conduct of affairs. The unscrupulous rigour with which he applied
                    his scientific method, and the sinister deductions he thought himself justified
                    in drawing from the results it yielded, excited terror and repulsion.
                    Nevertheless, a department had been added to the intellectual empire of mankind,
                    in which fellow-workers, like Guicciardini at Florence, and subsequently Sarpi
                    at Venice, were not slow to follow the path traced by Machiavelli.</p>
                <p>The object of the foregoing paragraphs has been to show in what way the positive,
                    inquisitive, secular, exploratory spirit of the Renaissance, when toned and
                    controlled by humanism, ¡penetrated the regions of literature, art, philosophy,
                    and science. It becomes at this point of much moment to consider how social
                    manners in Italy were modified by the same causes, since the type developed
                    there was in large measure communicated together with the new culture to the
                    rest of Europe. The first subject to be noticed under this heading is education.
                    What has come to be called a classical education was the immediate product of
                    the Italian Renaissance. The universities of Bologna, Padua, and Salerno had
                    been famous through the Middle Ages for the study of law, physics, and medicine;
                    and during the 15th and 16th centuries the two first still enjoyed celebrity in
                    those faculties. But at this period no lecture-rooms were so crowded as those in
                    which professors of antique literature and language read passages from the poets
                    and orators, taught Greek, and commented upon the systems of philosophers. The
                    mediaeval curriculum offered no defined place for the new learning of the
                    Revival, which I had indeed no recognized name. Chairs had therefore to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n404/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0404-0387"/>be founded under the title of rhetoric, from which
                    men like Chrysoloras and Guarino, Filelfo and Politian, expounded orally to
                    hundreds of eager students from every town of Italy and every nation in Europe
                    their accumulated knowledge of antiquity. One mass of Greek and Roman erudition,
                    including history and metaphysics, law and science, civic institutions and the
                    art of war, mythology and magistracies, metrical systems and oratory,
                    agriculture and astronomy, domestic manners and religious rites, grammar and
                    philology, biography and numismatics, formed the miscellaneous subject matter of
                    this so-styled rhetoric. Notes taken at these lectures supplied· young scholars
                    ־with hints for further exploration; and a certain tradition of treating antique
                    authors for the display of general learning, as well as for the elucidation of
                    their texts, came into vogue, which has determined the method of scholarship for
                    the last three centuries in Europe. The lack of printed books in the first
                    period of the Revival, and the comparative rarity of Greek erudition among
                    students, combined with the intense enthusiasm aroused for the new gospel of the
                    classics, gave special value to the personal teaching of these professors. They
                    journeyed from city to city, attracted by promises of higher pay, and allured by
                    ever-growing laurels of popular fame. Each large town established its public
                    study, academy, or university, similar institutions under varying designations,
                    for the exposition of the <hi rend="italic">litterse humaniores.</hi> The
                    humanists, or professors of that branch of knowledge, became a class of the
                    highest dignity. They were found in the chanceries of the republics, in the
                    papal curia, in the council chambers of princes, at the headquarters of
                    condottieri, wherever business had to be transacted, speeches to be made, and
                    the work of secretaries to be performed. Furthermore, they undertook the charge
                    of private education, opening schools which displaced the mediaeval system of
                    instruction, and taking engagements as tutors in the families of despots,
                    noblemen, and wealthy merchants. The academy established by Yittorino da Feltre
                    at Mantua under the protection of Gian Francesco Gonzaga for the training of
                    pupils of both sexes, might be chosen as the type of this Italian method. His
                    scholars, who were lodged in appropriate buildings, met daily to hear the master
                    read and comment on the classics. They learned portions of the best authors by
                    heart, exercised themselves in translation from one language to another, and
                    practised composition in prose and verse. It was Yittorino’s care to see that,
                    while their memories were duly stored ־with words and facts, their judgment
                    should be formed by critical analysis, attention to style, and comparison of the
                    authors of a decadent age with those who were acknowledged classics. During the
                    hours of recreation suitable physical exercises, as fencing, riding, and
                    gymnastics, were conducted under qualified trainers. From this sketch it will be
                    seen how closely the educational system which came into England during the
                    reigns of the Tudors, and which has prevailed until the present time, was
                    modelled upon the Italian type. English youths who spend their time at Eton
                    between athletic sports and Latin verses, and who take an Ireland with a first
                    class in “Greats” at Oxford, are pursuing the same course of physical and mental
                    discipline as the princes of Gonzaga or Montefeltro in the 15 th century.</p>
                <p>1 The humanists effected a deeply penetrating change</p>
                <p>;· in social manners. Through their influence as tutors, professors, orators, and
                    courtiers, society was permeated by a fresh ideal of culture. To be a gentleman
                    in Italy meant at this epoch to be a man acquainted with the rudiments at least
                    of scholarship, refined in diction, capable of corresponding or of speaking in
                    choice phrasesj open to the beauty of the arts, intelligently interested in
                    archaeology, taking for his models of conduct the great men of antiquity rather
                    than the saints of the church. He was also expected to prove himself an adept in
                    physical exercises and in the courteous observances which survived from
                    chivalry. The type is set before us by Castiglione in that book upon the
                    courtier which went the round of Europe in the 16 th century. It is further
                    emphasized in a famous passage of the <hi rend="italic">Orlando Innamorato</hi>
                    where Boiardo compares the Italian ideal of an accomplished gentleman with the
                    coarser type admired by nations of the north. To this point the awakened
                    intelligence of the Renaissance, instructed by humanism, polished by the fine
                    arts, expanding in genial conditions of diffused wealth, had brought the
                    Italians at a period when the rest of Europe was comparatively barbarous.</p>
                <p>This picture has undoubtedly a darker side. Humanism, in its revolt against the
                    Middle Ages, was, as we have seen already, mundane, pagan, irreligious,
                    positive. The Renaissance can, after all, be regarded only as a period of
                    transition, in which much of the good of the past was sacrificed while some of
                    the evil was retained, and neither the bad nor the good of the future was
                    brought clearly into fact. Beneath the surface of brilliant social culture
                    lurked gross appetites and savage passions, unrestrained by mediaeval piety,
                    untutored by modern experience. Italian society exhibited an almost unexampled
                    spectacle of literary, artistic, and courtly refinement crossed by brutalities
                    of lust, treasons, poisonings, assassinations, violence. A succession of worldly
                    pontiffs brought the church into flagrant discord with the principles of
                    Christianity. Steeped in pagan learning, emulous of imitating the manners of the
                    ancients, used to think and feel in harmony with Ovid and Theocritus, and at the
                    same time rendered cynical by the corruption of papal Rome, the educated classes
                    lost their grasp upon morality. Political honesty ceased almost to have a name
                    in Italy. The Christian virtues were scorned by the foremost actors and the
                    ablest thinkers of the time, while the antique virtues were themes for rhetoric
                    rather than moving-springs of conduct. This is apparent to all students of
                    Machiavelli and Guicciardini, the profoundest analysts of their age, the
                    bitterest satirists of its vices, but themselves infected with its incapacity
                    for moral goodness. Not only were the Italians vitiated; but they had also
                    become impotent for action and resistance. At the height of the Renaissance the
                    five great powers in the peninsula formed a confederation of independent but
                    mutually attractive and repellent states. Equilibrium was maintained by
                    diplomacy, in which the humanists played a foremost part, casting a network of
                    intrigue over the nation which helped in no small measure to stimulate
                    intelligence and create a common medium of culture, but which accustomed
                    statesmen to believe that everything could be achieved by wire-pulling. Wars
                    were conducted on a showy system by means of mercenaries, who played a safe game
                    in the field and developed a system of bloodless campaigns. Meanwhile the people
                    grew up unused to arms. When Italy between the years 1494 and 1530 became the
                    battlefield of French, German, and Spanish forces, it was seen to what a point
                    of helplessness the political, moral, and social conditions of the Renaissance
                    had brought the nation.</p>
                <p>It was needful to study at some length the main phenomena of the Renaissance in
                    Italy, because the history of that phase of evolution in the other Western races
                    turns almost entirely upon points in which they either adhered to or diverged
                    from the type established there. Speaking broadly, what France, Germany, Spain,
                    and England assimilated from Italy at this epoch was in the first place the new
                    learning, as it was then called. This implied the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0405-0388"/>new conception of human life, the new interest in
                    the material universe, the new method of education, and the new manners, which
                    we have seen to be inseparable from Italian humanism. Under these forms of
                    intellectual eulightenment and polite culture the renascence of the human spirit
                    had appeared in Italy, where it was more than elsewhere connected with the study
                    of classical antiquity. But that audacious exploratory energy which formed the
                    motive force of the Renaissance as distinguished from the Revival of Learning
                    took, as we shall see, very different directions in the several nations who now
                    were sending the flower of their youth to study at the feet of Italian
                    rhetoricians.</p>
                <p>The Renaissance ran its course in Italy with strange indifference to
                    consequences. The five great powers, held in equilibrium by Lorenzo de’ Medici,
                    dreamed that the peninsula could be maintained <hi rend="italic">in statu
                    quo</hi> by diplomacy. The church saw no danger in encouraging a pseudopagan
                    ideal of life, violating its own principle of existence by assuming the policy
                    of an aggrandizing secular state, and outraging Christendom openly by its acts
                    and utterances. Society at large was hardly aware that an intellectual force of
                    stupendous magnitude and incalculable explosive power had been created by the
                    new learning. Why should not established institutions proceed upon the customary
                    and convenient methods of routine, while the delights of existence were
                    augmented, manners polished, arts developed, and a golden age of epicurean ease
                    made decent by a state religion which no one cared to break with because no one
                    was left to regard it seriously? This was the attitude of the Italians when the
                    Renaissance, which they had initiated as a thing of beauty, began to operate as
                    a thing of power beyond the Alps.</p>
                <p>Germany was already provided with universities, seven of which had been founded
                    between 1348 and 1409. In these haunts of learning the new studies took root '
                    after the year 1440, chiefly through the influence of travelling professors,
                    Peter Luder and Samuel Karoch. German scholars made their way to Lombard and
                    Tuscan lecture-rooms, bringing back the methods of the humanists. Greek, Latin,
                    and Hebrew erudition soon found itself at home on Teutonic soil. Like Italian
                    men of letters, these pioneers of humanism gave a classic turn to their
                    patronymics; unfamiliar names, Crotus Rubeanus and Pierius Grsecus, Capnion and
                    Lupambulus Ganymedes, GScolampadius and Melanchthon, resounded on the Rhine. A
                    few of the German princes, among whom Maximilian, the prince cardinal Albert of
                    Mainz, Frederick the Wise of Saxony, and Eberhard of Wiirtemberg deserve
                    mention, exercised a not insignificant influence on letters by the foundation of
                    new universities and the patronage of learned men. The cities of Strasburg,
                    Nuremberg, Augsburg, Basel, became centres of learned coteries, which gathered
                    round scholars like Wimpheling, Brant, Peutinger, Schedel, and Pirckheimer,
                    artists like Dürer and Holbein, printers of the eminence of Froben. Academies in
                    imitation of Italian institutions came into existence, the two most conspicuous,
                    named after the Rhine and Danube, holding their headquarters respectively at
                    Heidelberg and Vienna. Crowned poets, of whom the most eminent was Conrad Geltes
                    Protucius (Pickel!), emulated the fame of Politian and Pontano. Yet, though the
                    Renaissance was thus widely communicated to the centres of German intelligence,
                    it displayed a different character from that which it assumed in Italy. Gothic
                    art, which was indigenous in Germany, yielded but little to southern influences.
                    Such work as that of Dürer, Yischer, Cranach, Schöngauer, Holbein, consummate as
                    it was in technical excellence, did not assume Italian forms of loveliness, did
                    not display the paganism of the Latin races. The modi fication of Gothic
                    architecture by pseudo-Roman elements of style was incomplete. What Germany
                    afterwards took of the Palladian manner was destined to reach it on a circuitous
                    route from France. In like manner the new learning failed to penetrate all
                    classes of society with the rapidity of its expansion in Italy, nor was the new
                    ideal of life and customs so easily substituted for the mediaeval. The German
                    aristocracy, as AEneas Sylvius had noticed, remained for the most part
                    barbarous, addicted to gross pleasures, contemptuous of culture. The German
                    dialects were too rough to receive that artistic elaboration under antique
                    influences which had been so facile in Tuscany. The doctors of the universities
                    were too wedded to their antiquated manuals and methods, too satisfied with
                    dulness,, too proud of titles and diplomas, too anxious to preserve
                    ecclesiastical discipline and to repress mental activity, for a genial spirit of
                    humanism to spread freely. Not in Cologne or Tübingen but in Padua and Florence
                    did the German pioneers of the Renaissance acquire their sense of liberal
                    studies. And when they returned home they found themselves encumbered with
                    stupidities, jealousies, and rancours. Moreover, the temper of these more
                    enlightened men was itself opposed to Italian indifference and immorality; it
                    was pugnacious and polemical, eager to beat down the arrogance of monks and
                    theologians rather than to pursue an ideal of sesthetical self-culture. To a
                    student of the origins of German humanism it is clear that something very
                    different from the Renaissance of Lorenzo de’ Medici and Leo X. was in
                    preparation from the first upon Teutonic soil. Far less plastic and form-loving
                    than the Italian, the German intelligence was more penetrative, earnest,
                    disputative, occupied with substantial problems. Starting with theological
                    criticism, proceeding to the stage of solid studies in the three learned
                    languages, German humanism occupied the attention of a widely scattered sect of
                    erudite scholars; but it did not arouse the interest of the whole nation until
                    it was forced into a violently militant attitude by Pfefferkorn’s attack on
                    Reuchlin. That attempt to extinguish honest thought prepared the Reformation;
                    and humanism after 1518 was absorbed in politico-religious warfare.</p>
                <p>The point of contact between humanism and the Reformation in Germany has to be
                    insisted on; for it is just here that the relation of the Reformation to the
                    Renaissance in general makes itself apparent. As the Renaissance had its
                    precursory movements in the medieval period, so the German Reformation was
                    preceded by Wickliffe and Huss, by the discontents of the Great Schism, and by
                    the councils of Constance and Basel. These two main streams of modern progress
                    had been proceeding upon different tracks to diverse issues, but they touched in
                    the studies stimulated by the Revival, and they had a common origin in the
                    struggle of the spirit after self-emancipation. Johann Reuchlin, who entered the
                    lecture-room of Argyro-poulos at Rome in 1482, Erasmus of Rotterdam, who once
                    dwelt at Venice as the house guest of the Aldi, applied their critical knowledge
                    of Hebrew and of Greek to the elucidation and diffusion of the Bible. To the
                    Germans, as to all nations of that epoch, the Bible came as a new book, because
                    they now read it for the first time with eyes opened by humanism. The touch of
                    the new spirit which had evolved literature, art, and culture in Italy sufficed
                    in Germany to recreate Christianity. This new spirit in Italy emancipated human
                    intelligence by the classics; in Germany it emancipated the human conscience by
                    the Bible. The indignation excited by Leo X.’s sale of indulgences, the moral
                    rage stirred in Northern hearts by papal abominations in Rome, were external
                    causes which precipitated the schism between Teutonic and <pb break="no"

                    the same energy of resuscitated life as the Renaissance, assisted by the same
                    engines of the printing-press and paper, using the same apparatus of
                    scholarship, criticism, literary skill, being in truth another manifestation of
                    the same world-movement under a diverse form, now posed itself as an
                    irreconcilable antagonist to Renaissance Italy. It would be difficult to draw
                    any comparison between German and Italian humanists to the disparagement of the
                    former. Reuchlin was no less learned than Pico; Melanchthon no less humane than
                    Ficino; Erasmus no less witty, and far more trenchant, than Petrarch; Ulrich von
                    Hutten no less humorous than Folengo; Paracelsus no less fantastically learned
                    than Cardano. But the cause in which German intellect and will were enlisted was
                    so different that it is difficult not to make a formal separation between that
                    movement which evolved culture in Italy and that which restored religion in
                    Germany, establishing the freedom of intelligence in the one sphere and the
                    freedom of the conscience in the other. The truth is that the Reformation was
                    the Teutonic Renaissance. It was the emancipation of the reason on a line
                    neglected by the Italians, more important indeed in its political consequences,
                    more Aveighty in its bearing on rationalistic developments than the Italian
                    Renaissance, but none the less an outcome of the same ground-influences. We have
                    already in this century reached a point at which, in spite of stubborn
                    Protestant dogmatism and bitter Catholic reaction, we can perceive how the
                    ultimate affranchisement of man will be the work of both.</p>
                <p>The German Reformation Avas incapable of propagating <hi rend="superscript"
                    >:</hi> itself in Italy, chiefly for the reason that the intellectual forces
                    which it represented and employed had already found specific outlet in that
                    country. It Avas not in the nature of the Italians, sceptical and paganized by
                    the Revival, to be keenly interested about questions which seemed to revive the
                    scholastic disputes of the Middle Ages. It was not in their external conditions,
                    suffering as they were from invasions, enthralled by despots, to use the
                    Reformation as a lever for political revolution. Yet Avhen a tumultuary army of
                    so-called Lutherans sacked Rome in 1527 no sober thinker doubted that a new
                    agent had appeared in Europe Avhich Avould alter the destinies of the peninsula.
                    The Renaissance Avas virtually closed, so far as it concerned Italy, Avhen
                    Clement VII. and Charles V. struck their compact at Bologna in 1530. This
                    compact proclaimed the principle of monarchical absolutism, supported by papal
                    authority, itself monarchically absolute, which influenced Europe until the
                    outbreak of the Revolution. A reaction immediately set in both against the
                    Renaissance and the Reformation. The council of Trent, opened in 1545 and closed
                    in 1563, decreed a formal purgation of the church, affirmed the fundamental
                    doctrines of Catholicism, strengthened the papal supremacy, and inaugurated that
                    movement of resistance Avhich is knoAAm as the Counter-Reformation. The complex
                    onward effort of the modern nations, expressing itself in Italy as Renaissance,
                    in Germany as Reformation, had aroused the forces of conservatism. The four main
                    instruments of the reaction Avere the papacy, Avhich had done so much by its
                    sympathy with the revival to promote the humanistic spirit it now dreaded, the
                    strength of Spain, and tAvo Spanish institutions planted on Roman soil—the
                    Inquisition and the Order of Jesus. The principle contended for and established
                    by this reaction was absolutism as opposed to freedom—monarchical absolutism,
                    papal absolutism, the suppression of energies liberated by the Renaissance and
                    Reformation. The partial triumph of this principle Avas secure, inasmuch as the
                    majority of established poAvers in church and state felt threatened bv the
                    revolutionary opinions afloat in Europe. Renaissance and Reformatioi were,
                    moreover, already at strife. Both too Avere spiritua and elastic tendencies
                    toAvard progress, ideals rather thai solid organisms.</p>
                <p>The part played by Spain in this period of history wa determined in large measure
                    by external circumstance The Spaniards became one nation by the conquest o
                    Granada and the union of the crowns of Castile ant Aragon. The Avar of national
                    aggrandizement, being ii its nature a crusade, inflamed the religious enthusiasm
                    o the people. It Avas folloAved by the expulsion of Jews ant Moors, and by the
                    establishment of the Inquisition on! solid basis, Avith powers formidable to the
                    freedom of al Spaniards from the peasant to the throne. These fact explain the

                    and help us to understam Avhy their brilliant achievements in the field of
                    culture during the 16th century Avere speedily folloAved by stag nation. It will
                    be Avell, in dealing Avith the Renaissance in Spain, to touch first upon the

                    are mainl; noticeable as proving that certain coteries in Spain wer Avilling to
                    accept the Italian Renaissance. But the rea force of the people Avas not in this
                    courtly literary style It expressed itself at last in the monumental Avork of
                    <hi rend="italic">Do¡ Quixote,</hi> which places Cervantes beside Rabelais,
                    Ariosto and Shakespeare as one of the four supreme exponents o the Renaissance.
                    The affectations of decadent chivaln disappeared before its humour; the
                    lineaments of a nobh nation, animated by the youth of modern Europe emerging
                    from the Middle Ages, were portrayed in its enduring pic tures of human
                    experience. The Spanish drama, mean Avhile, untrammelled by those false canons
                    of pseudo classic taste which fettered the theatre in Italy ant afterAvards in
                    France, rose to an eminence in the hands o: Lope de Vega and Calderon Avhich
                    only the English, ant the English only in the masterpieces of three or four play
                    Avrights, can rival. Camoeus, in the <hi rend="italic">Lusiad,</hi> if we may
                    here group Portugal with Spain, was the first modern poel to compose an epic on
                    a purely modern theme, vying Avitl: Virgil, but not bending to pedantic rules,
                    and breathing the spirit of the age of heroic adventures and-almost fabu lous
                    discoveries into his melodious numbers. What has chiefly to be noted regarding
                    the achievements of the Spanish race in arts and letters at this epoch is then
                    potent national originality. The revival of learning pro duced in Spain no
                    slavish imitation as it did in Italy, nc formal humanism, and, it may be added,
                    very little ol fruitful scholarship. The Renaissance here, as in England,
                    displayed essential qualities of intellectual freedom, delight in life,
                    exultation over rediscovered earth and man. Tin note of Renaissance Avork in
                    Germany Avas still Gothic This we feel in the penetrative earnestness of Dürer,

                    pregnancy of the Faust legend, the almost stolid mastery of Holbein. It lay not

                    Ages, for this reason mainly that what we call mediaeval was to a very large
                    extent Teutonic. But on the Spanish peninsula, in the masterpieces of Velazquez,
                    Cervantes, Camoens, Calderon, we emerge into an atmosphere of art, definitely
                    national, distinctly modern, where solid natural forms stand before us
                    realistically modelled, with light and shadow on their rounded outlines, and
                    where the airiest creatures of the fancy take shape and weave a dance of
                    rhythmic, light, incomparable intricacy. The Spanish Renaissance would in itself
                    suffice, if other witnesses were wanting, to prove how inaccurate is the theory
                    that limits this movement to the revival of learning. Touched by Italian
                    influences, enriched and fortified by the new learning, Spanish genius walked
                    firmly forward on its own path. It was only crushed by forces generated in the
                    nation that produced it, by the Inquisition and by despotic Catholic
                    absolutism.</p>
                <p>In the history of the Renaissance, Spain and Portugal represent the exploration
                    of the ocean and the colonization of the other hemisphere. The voyages of
                    Columbus and Vespucci to America, the rounding of the Cape by Diaz and the
                    discovery of the sea road to India by Vasco da Gama, Cortes’s conquest of Mexico
                    and Pizarro’s conquest of Peru, marked a new era for the human race and
                    inaugurated the modern age more decisively than any other series of events has
                    done. It has recently been maintained that modern European history is chiefly an
                    affair of competition between confederated states for the possession of lands
                    revealed by Columbus and Da Gama. Without challenging or adopting this
                    speculation, it may be safely affirmed that nothing so pregnant of results has
                    happened as this exploration of the globe. To say that it displaced the centre
                    of gravity in politics and commerce, substituting the ocean for the
                    Mediterranean, dethroning Italy from her seat of central importance in traffic,
                    depressing the eastern and elevating the western powers of Europe, opening a
                    path for Anglo-Saxon expansiveness, forcing philosophers and statesmen to regard
                    the Occidental nations as a single group in counterpoise to other groups of
                    nations, the European community as one unit correlated to other units of
                    humanity upon this planet, is truth enough to vindicate the vast significance of
                    these discoveries. The Renaissance, far from being the re-birth of antiquity
                    with its civilization confined to the Mediterranean, with its Hercules’ Pillars
                    beyond which lay Cimmerian darkness, was thus effectively the entrance upon a
                    quite incalculably wider stage of life, in which mankind at large has since
                    enacted one great drama, i While Spanish navies were exploring the ocean, and
                    Spanish paladins were overturning empires, Charles V. headed the reaction of
                    Catholicism against reform. Stronger as king of Spain than as emperor, for the
                    empire was little but a name, he lent the weight of his authority to that system
                    of coercion and repression which enslaved Italy, desolated Germany with war, and
                    drowned the Low Countries in blood. Philip II., with full approval of the
                    Spanish nation, pursued the same policy in an even stricter spirit. He was
                    powerfully assisted by two institutions, in which the national character of
                    Spain expressed itself, the Inquisition and the Society of Jesus. Of the former
                    it is not needful to speak here. But we have to observe that the last great
                    phenomenon of the Spanish Renaissance was Ignatius Loyola, who organized the
                    militia by means of which the church worked her Counter-Reformation. His motto,
                    <hi rend="italic">Perinde ac cadaver</hi> , expressed that recognition of
                    absolutism which papacy and monarchy demanded for their consolidation.</p>
                <p>The logical order of an essay which attempts to show how Renaissance was
                    correlated to Reformation and Counter-Reformation has necessitated the treatment
                    of</p>
                <p>Italy, Germany, and Spain in succession; for these three 1 nations were the three
                    main agents in the triple process to * be analysed. It was due to their specific
                    qualities, and to <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> the diverse circumstances of
                    their external development, <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> that the re-birth of
                    Europe took this form of duplex action <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> on the
                    lines of intellectual and moral progress, followed by reaction against mental
                    freedom. We have now to speak of France, which earliest absorbed the influence
                    of the Italian revival, and of England, which received it latest. The
                    Renaissance may be said to have begun in France with Charles VIII.’s expedition
                    to Naples, and to have continued until the extinction of the house of Valois.
                    Louis XII. and Francis I. spent a considerable portion of their reigns in the
                    attempt to secure possession of the Italian provinces they claimed. Henry II.’s
                    queen was Catherine of the Medicean family; and her children, Charles IX. and
                    Henry III., were Italianated Frenchmen. Thus the connexion between France and
                    Italy during the period 1494-1589 was continuous. The French passed to and fro
                    across the Alps on military and peaceful expeditions. Italians came to France as
                    courtiers, ambassadors, men of business, captains, and artists. French society
                    assumed a strong Italian colouring, nor were the manners of the court very
                    different from those of an Italian city, except that externally they remained
                    ruder and less polished. The relation between the crown and its great
                    feudatories, the military bias of the aristocracy, and the marked distinction
                    between classes which survived from the Middle Ages, rendered France in many
                    vital points unlike Italy. Yet the annals of that age, and the anecdotes
                    retailed by Brantome, prove that the royalty and nobility of France had been
                    largely Italianized.</p>
                <p>It is said that Louis XII. brought Fra Giocondo of Verona back with him to
                    France, and founded a school of architects. But we need not have recourse to
                    this legend for the explanation of such Italian influences as were already
                    noticeable in the Renaissance buildings on the Loire. Without determining the
                    French style, Italian intercourse helped to stimulate its formation and
                    development. There are students of the 15th century in France who resent this
                    intrusion of the Italian Renaissance. But they forget that France was bound by
                    inexorable laws of human evolution to obey the impulse which communicated itself
                    to every form of art in Europe. In the school of Fontainebleau, under the
                    patronage of Francis I., that Italian influence made itself distinctly felt; yet
                    a true French manner had been already formed, which, when it was subsequently
                    applied at Paris, preserved a marked national quality. The characteristic of the
                    style developed by Bullant, De 1’Orme, and Lescot, in the royal or princely
                    palaces of Chenonceaux, Chambord, Anet, Ecouen, Fontainebleau, the Louvre, and
                    elsewhere, is a blending of capricious fancy and inventive richness of
                    decoration with purity of <hi rend="superscript">!</hi> outline and a large
                    sense of the beauty of extended masses. Beginning with the older castles of
                    Touraine, and passing onward to the Tuileries, we trace the passage from the
                    mediaeval fortress to the modern pleasure house, and note how architecture
                    obeyed the special demands of that new phenomenon of Renaissance civilization,
                    the court. In the general distribution of parts these monumental buildings
                    express the peculiar conditions which French society assumed under the influence
                    of Francis I. and Diane de Poitiers. In details of execution and harmonic
                    combinations they illustrate the precision, logic, lucidity, and cheerful spirit
                    of the national genius. Here, as in Lombardy, a feeling for serene beauty
                    derived from study of the antique has not interrupted the evolution of a style
                    indigenous to France and eminently characteristic of the French temperament.</p>

                    Primaticcio, Del Sarto, and Da Vinci are the most famous. But their example was
                    not productive of a really great school of French painting. It was left for the
                    Poussins and Claude Lorraine in the next century, acting under mingled Italian
                    and Flemish influences, to embody the still active spirit of the classical
                    revival. These three masters were the contemporaries of Corneille, and do not
                    belong to the Renaissance period. Sculpture, on the contrary, in which art, as
                    in architecture, the mediaeval French had been surpassed by no other people of
                    Europe, was practised with originality and power in the reigns of Henry II. and
                    Francis I. Ponzio and Cellini, who quitted Italy for France, found themselves
                    outrivailed in their own sphere by Jean Goujon, Cousin, and Pilon. The
                    decorative sculpture of this epoch, whether combined with architecture or
                    isolated in monumental statuary, ranks for grace and suavity with the best of
                    Sansovino’s. At the same time it is unmistakably inspired by a sense of beauty
                    different from the Italian,—more piquant and pointed, less languorous, more
                    mannered perhaps, but with less of empty rhythmical effect. All this while, the
                    minor arts of enamelling, miniature, glass-painting, goldsmith’s work,
                    jewellery, engraving, tapestry, wood-carving, pottery, &amp;c., were cultivated
                    with a spontaneity and freedom which proved that France, in the middle point
                    between Flanders and Italy, was able to use both influences without a sacrifice
                    of native taste. It may indeed be said in general that what is true of France is
                    likewise true of all countries which felt the artistic impulses of the
                    Renaissance. Whether we regard Spain, the Netherlands, or Germany at this epoch,
                    we find a national impress stamped upon the products of the plastic and the
                    decorative arts, notwithstanding the prevalence of certain forms derived from
                    the antique and Italy. It was only at a later period that the formalism of
                    pseudo-classic pedantry reduced natural and national originality to a dead
                    unanimity.</p>
                <p>French literature was quick to respond to Renaissance influences. De Comines, the
                    historian of Charles VIII.’s expedition to Naples, differs from the earlier
                    French chroniclers in his way of regarding the world of men and affairs. He has
                    the perspicuity and analytical penetration of a Venetian ambassador. Villon, his
                    contemporary, may rather be ranked, so far as artistic form and use of knowledge
                    are concerned, with poets of the Middle Ages, and in particular with the
                    Goliardi. But he is essentially modern in the vividness of his self-portraiture,
                    and in what we are wont to call realism. Both De Comines and Villon indicate the
                    entrance of a new quality into literature. The Rhétoriqueurs, while protracting
                    mediaeval traditions by their use of allegory and complicated metrical systems,
                    sought to improve the French language by introducing Latinisms. Thus the Revival
                    of Learning began to affect the vernacular in the last years of the 15tlx
                    century. Marot and his school reacted against this pedantry. The Renaissance
                    displayed itself in their effort to purify the form and diction of poetry. But
                    the decisive revolution was effected by Ronsard and his comrades of the Pléiade.
                    It was their professed object to raise French to a level with the classics, and
                    to acclimatize Italian species of verse. The humanistic movement led these
                    learned writers to engraft the graces of the antique upon their native
                    literature, and to refine it by emulating the lucidity of Petrarch. The result
                    of their endeavour was immediately apparent in the new force added to French
                    rhythm, the new pomp, richness, colouring, and polish conferred upon poetic
                    diction. French style gradually attained to fixity, and the alexandrine came to
                    be recognized as the standard line in poetry. D’Aubigné’s invective and
                    Regnier’s satire, at the close of the 16th century, are as modern as Voltaire’s.
                    Meanwhile the drama was emerging from the mediaeval mysteries; and the classical
                    type, made popular by Garnier’s genius, was elaborated, as in Italy, upon the
                    model of Seneca and the canons of the three unities. The tradition thus formed
                    was continued and fortified by the illustrious playwrights of the 17th century.
                    Translation from Greek and Latin into French progressed rapidly at the
                    commencement of this period. It was a marked characteristic of the Renaissance
                    in France to appropriate the spoils of Greece and Rome for the profit of the
                    mother tongue. Amyot’s <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Daphnis and Chloe</hi> rank among the most exquisite examples of beautiful
                    French prose. Prose had now the charm of simplicity combined with grace. To
                    mention Brantôme is to mention the most entertaining of gossips. To speak of
                    Montaigne is to speak of the best as well as the first of essayists. In all the
                    literary work which has been mentioned, the originality and freshness of the
                    French genius are no less conspicuous than its saturation with the new learning
                    and with Italian studies. But the greatest name of the epoch, the name which is
                    synonymous with the Renaissance in France, has yet to be uttered. That, of
                    course, is Rabelais. His incommensurable and indescribable masterpiece of
                    mingled humour, wisdom, satire, erudition, indecency, profundity, levity,
                    imagination, realism, reflects the whole age in its mirror of hyper-Aristophanic
                    farce. What Ariosto is for Italy, Cervantes for Spain, Erasmus for Holland,
                    Luther for Germany, Shakespeare for England, that is Rabelais for France. The
                    Renaissance cannot be comprehended in its true character without familiarity
                    with these six representatives of its manifold and many-sided inspiration.</p>
                <p>The French Renaissance, so rich on the side of arts and letters, was hardly less
                    rich on the side of classical studies. The revival of learning has a noble
                    muster-roll of names in France: Turnèbe, the patriarch of Hellenistic studies;
                    the Etiennes of Paris, equalling in numbers, industry, and learning their
                    Venetian rivals; the two Scaligers; impassioned Dolet; eloquent Muret; learned
                    Cujas; terrible Calvin; Ramus, the intrepid antagonist of Aristotle; De Thou and
                    De Bèze; ponderous Casaubon; brilliant young Saumaise. The distinguishing
                    characteristics of French humanism are vivid intelligence, critical audacity and
                    polemical acumen, perspicuity of exposition, learning directed in its
                    applications by logical sense rather than by artistic ideals of taste. Some of
                    the names just mentioned remind us that in France, as in Germany and Holland,
                    the Reformation was closely connected with the revival of learning. Humanism has
                    never been in the narrow sense of that term Protestant; still less has it been
                    strictly Catholic. In Italy it fostered a temper of mind decidedly averse to
                    theological speculation and religious earnestness. In Holland and Germany, with
                    Erasmus, Reuchlin, and Melanchthon, it developed types of character, urbane,
                    reflective, pointedly or gently critical, which, left to themselves, would not
                    have plunged the north of Europe into the whirlpool of belligerent reform. Yet
                    none the less was the new learning, through the open spirit of inquiry it
                    nourished, its vindication of the private reason, its enthusiasm for republican
                    antiquity, and its proud assertion of the rights of human independence, linked
                    by a strong and subtle chain to that turbid revolt of the individual
                    consciousness against spiritual despotism draped in fallacies and throned upon
                    abuses. To this rebellion we give the name of Reformation. But, while the
                    necessities of antagonism to papal Rome made it assume at first the form of
                    narrow and sectarian opposition, it marked in fact a vital struggle of the
                    intellect towards truth and freedom, involving future results of scepticism and
                    rationalistic audacity from which its earlier champions <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n409/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0409-0392"/>would have shrunk. It marked, moreover, in the
                    condition of armed resistance against established authority which was forced
                    upon it by the Counter-Reformation, a firm resolve to assert political liberty,
                    leading in the course of time to a revolution with which the rebellious spirit
                    of the Revival was sympathetic. This being the relation of humanism in general
                    to reform, French learning in particular displayed such innovating boldness as
                    threw many of its most conspicuous professors into the camp at war with Rome.
                    Calvin, a French student of Picard origin, created the type of Protestantism to
                    which the majority of French Huguenots adhered. This too was a moment at which
                    philosophical seclusion was hardly possible. In a nation so tumultuously
                    agitated one side or the other had to be adopted. Those of the French humanists
                    who did not proclaim Huguenot opinions, found themselves obliged with Muretus to
                    lend their talents to the Counter-Reformation, or to suffer persecution for
                    heterodoxy, like Dolet. The church, terrified and infuriated by the progress of
                    reform, suspected learning on its own account. To be an eminent scholar was to
                    be accused of immorality, heresy, and atheism in a single indictment; and the
                    defence of weaker minds lay in joining the Jesuits, as Heinsius was fain to do.
                    France had already absorbed the earlier Renaissance in an Italianizing spirit
                    before the Reformation made itself felt as a political actuality. This fact,
                    together with the strong Italian bias of the Valois, serves to explain in some
                    degree the reason why the Counter-Reformation entailed those fierce entangled
                    civil wars, massacres of St Bartholomew, murders of the Guises, regicides,
                    treasons, and empoisonments that terminated with the compromise of Henry IV. It
                    is no part of the present subject to analyse the political, religious, and
                    social interests of that struggle. The upshot was the triumph of the
                    Counter-Reformation, and the establishment of its principle, absolutism, as the
                    basis of French government, it was a French king who, when the nation had been
                    reduced to order, uttered the famous word of absolutism, “L’Etat, c’est
                    moi.”</p>
                <p>The Renaissance in the Low Countries, as elsewhere, had its brilliant age of arts
                    and letters. During the Middle Ages the wealthy free towns of Flanders
                    flourished under conditions not dissimilar to those of the Italian republics..
                    They raised miracles of architectural beauty, which were • modified in the 15th
                    and 16th centuries by characteristic elements of the new style. The Van Eycks,
                    followed by Memling, Metsys, Mabuse, Lucas van Leyden, struck out a new path in
                    the revival of painting and taught Europe the secret of oil-colouring. But it
                    was reserved for the 17th century to witness the flower and fruit time of this
                    powerful art in the work of Porbus, Rubens, and Vandyck, in the Dutch schools of
                    landscape and home-life, and in the unique masterpieces of Rembrandt. We have a
                    right to connect this later period with the Renaissance, because the distracted
                    state of the Netherlands during the 16th century suspended, while it could not
                    extinguish, their aesthetic development. The various schools of the 17th
                    century, moreover, are animated with the Renaissance spirit no less surely than
                    the Florentine school of the 15th or the Venetian of the 16th. The animal vigour
                    and carnal enjoyment of Rubens, the refined Italianizing beauty of Vandyck, the
                    mystery of light and gloom on Rembrandt’s panels, the love of nature in
                    Ruysdael, Cuyp, and Van Hooghe, with their luminously misty skies, silvery
                    daylight, and broad expanse of landscape, the interest in common life displayed
                    by Terburg, Van Steen, Douw, Ostade, and Teniers, the instinct for the beauty of
                    animals in Potter, the vast sea spaces of Vanderveldt, the grasp on reality, the
                    acute intuition into character in portraits, the scientific study of the world
                    and man, the robust sympathy with natural appetites, which distinguish the whole
                    art of the Low Countries, are a direct emanation from the Renaissance.</p>
                <p>The vernacular in the Netherlands profited at first but little by the impulse
                    which raised Italian, Spanish, French, and English to the rank of classic
                    languages. But humanism, first of all in its protagonist Erasmus, afterwards in
                    the long list of critical scholars and editors, Lipsius, Heinsius, and Grotius,
                    in the printers Elzevir and Plantin, developed itself from the centre of the
                    Leyden university with massive energy, and proved that it was still a motive
                    force of intellectual progress. In the fields of classical learning the students
                    of the Low Countries broke new ground chiefly by methodical collection,
                    classification, and comprehensive criticism of previously accumulated stores.
                    Their works were solid and substantial edifices, forming the substratum for
                    future scholarship. In addition to this they brought philosophy and scientific
                    thoroughness to bear on studies which had been pursued in a more literary
                    spirit. It would, however, be uncritical to pursue this subject further; for the
                    encyclopaedic labours of the Dutch philologers belong to a period when the
                    Renaissance was overpast. For the same reason it is inadmissible to do more than
                    mention the name of Spinoza here.</p>
                <p>The Netherlands became the battlefield of Reformation and Counter-Reformation in
                    even a stricter sense than France. Here the antagonistic principles were plainly
                    i posed in the course of a struggle against foreign despotism.</p>
                <p>I The conflict ended in the assertion of political independence as opposed to
                    absolute dominion. Europe in large measure owes the modern ideal of political
                    liberty to that spirit of stubborn resistance which broke the power of Spain.
                    Recent history, and in particular the history of democracy, claims for its
                    province the several stages whereby this principle was developed in England and
                    America, and its outburst in the frenzy of the French Revolution. It is enough
                    here to have alluded to the part played by the Low Countries in the genesis of a
                    motive force which may be described as the last manifestation of the Renaissance
                    striving after self-emancipation.</p>
                <p>The insular position of England, combined with the nature of the English people,
                    has allowed us to feel the vibration of European movements later and with less
                    of shock than any of the Continental nations. Before a wave of progress has
                    reached our shores we have had the opportunity of watching it as spectators, and
                    of considering how we shall receive it. Revolutions have passed from the
                    tumultuous stages of their origin into some settled and recognizable state
                    before we have been called upon to cope with them. It was thus that England took
                    the influences of the Renaissance and Reformation simultaneously, and almost at
                    the same time found herself engaged in that struggle with the
                    Counter-Reformation which, crowned by the defeat of the Spanish Armada,
                    stimulated the sense of nationality and developed the naval forces of the race.
                    Both Renaissance and Reformation had been anticipated by at least a century in
                    England. Chaucer’s poetry, which owed so much to Italian examples, gave an early
                    foretaste of the former. Wickliffe’s teaching was a vital moment in the latter.
                    But the French wars, the Wars of the Roses, and the persecution of the Lollards
                    deferred the coming of the new age; and the year 1536,</p>
                <p>I when Henry VIII. passed the Act of Supremacy through Parliament, may be fixed
                    as the date when England entered definitively upon a career of intellectual
                    development abreast with the foremost nations of the Continent. The
                    circumstances just now insisted on explain the specific character of the English
                    Renaissance. The Reformation had been adopted by consent of the king, lords, and
                    commons; and this change in the state religion, though it was not confirmed
                    without reaction, agitation, and blood<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n410/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0410-0393"/>shed, cost the nation comparatively little
                    disturbance. Humanism, before it affected the bulk of the English people, had
                    already permeated Italian and French literature. Classical erudition had been
                    adapted to the needs of modern thought. The hard work of collecting, printing,
                    annotating, and translating Greek and Latin authors had been accomplished. The
                    masterpieces of antiquity had been interpreted and made intelligible. Much of
                    the learning popularized by our poets and dramatists was derived at second hand
                    from modern literature. This does not mean that England was deficient in ripe
                    and sound scholars. More, Colet, Ascham, Cheke, Camden were men whose
                    familiarity with the classics was both intimate and easy. Public schools and
                    universities conformed to the modern methods of study; nor were there wanting
                    opportunities for youths of humble origin to obtain an education which placed
                    them on a level with Italian scholars. The single case of Ben Jonson
                    sufficiently proves this. Yet learning did not at this epoch become a marked
                    speciality in England. There was no class corresponding to the humanists. It
                    should also be remembered that the best works of Italian literature were
                    introduced into Great Britain together with the classics. Phaer’s <hi

                    only a few examples—placed English readers simultaneously in possession of the
                    most eminent and representative works of Greece, Rome, and Italy. At the same
                    time Spanish influences reached them through the imitators of Guevara and the
                    dramatists; French influences in the versions of romances; German influences in
                    popular translations of the Faust legend, <hi rend="italic">Eulenspiegel,</hi>
                    and similar productions. The authorized version of the Bible had also been
                    recently given to the people,—so that almost at the same period of time England
                    obtained in the vernacular an extensive library of ancient and modern authors.
                    This was a privilege enjoyed in like measure by no other nation. It sufficiently
                    accounts for the richness and variety of Elizabethan literature, and for the
                    enthusiasm with which the English language was cultivated.</p>
                <p>Speaking strictly, England borrowed little in the region of the arts from other
                    nations, and developed still less that was original. What is called Jacobean
                    architecture marks indeed an interesting stage in the transition from the Gothic
                    style. But, compared with Italian, French, Spanish, German, and Flemish work of
                    a like period, it is both timid and dry. Sculpture was represented in London for
                    a brief space by Torrigiani; painting by Holbein and Antonio More; music by
                    Italians and Frenchmen of the Chapel Royal. But no Englishmen rose to European
                    eminence in these departments. With literature the case was very different. Wyat
                    and Surrey began by engrafting the forms and graces of Italian poetry upon the
                    native stock. They introduced the sonnet and blank verse. Sidney followed w <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> ith the sestine and terza rima and with various
                    experiments in classic metres, none of which took root on English soil. The
                    translators handled the octave stanza. Marlowe gave new vigour to the couplet.
                    The first period of the English Renaissance was one of imitation and
                    assimilation. Academies after the Italian type were founded. Tragedies in the
                    style of Seneca, rivalling Italian and French dramas of the epoch, were
                    produced. Attempts to Latinize ancestral rhythms, similar to those which had
                    failed in Italy and France, were made. Tentative essays in criticism and
                    dissertations on the art of poetry abounded. It seemed as though the Renaissance
                    ran a risk of being throttled in its cradle by superfluity of foreign and
                    pedantic nutriment. But the natural vigour of the English genius resisted
                    influences alien to itself, and showed a robust capacity for digesting the
                    varied diet offered to it. As there was nothing despotic in the temper of the
                    ruling classes, nothing oppressive in English culture, the literature of that
                    age evolved itself freely from the people. It w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as
                    under these conditions that Spenser gave his romantic epic to the world, a poem
                    which derived its allegory from the Middle Ages, its decorative richness from
                    the Italian Renaissance, its sweetness, purity, harmony, and imaginative
                    splendour from the most poetic nation of the modern world. Under the same
                    conditions the Elizabethan drama, which in its totality is the real exponent of
                    the English Renaissance, came into existence. This drama very early freed itself
                    from the pseudo-classic mannerism which imposed on taste in Italy and France.
                    Depicting feudalism in the vivid colours of an age at war with feudal
                    institutions, breathing into antique histories the breath of actual life,
                    embracing the romance of Italy and Spain, the mysteries of German legend, the
                    fictions of poetic fancy and the facts of daily life, humours of the moment and
                    abstractions of philosophical speculation, in one homogeneous amalgam instinct
                    with intense vitality, this extraordinary birth of time, with Shakespeare for
                    the master of all ages, left a monument of the Renaissance unrivalled for pure
                    creative power by any other product of that epoch. To complete the sketch, we
                    must set Bacon, the expositor of modern scientific method, beside Spenser and
                    Shakespeare, as the third representative of the Renaissance in England. Nor
                    should Raleigh, Drake, Hawkins, the semi-buccaneer explorers of the ocean, be
                    omitted. They, following the lead of Portuguese and -Spaniards, combating the
                    Counter-Reformation on the seas, <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> opened for
                    England her career of colonization and planta-, tion. All this while the
                    political policy of Tudors and , I Stewarts tended towards monarchical
                    absolutism, while the Reformation in England, modified by contact with <hi
                    rend="superscript">1</hi> the Low Countries during their struggles, was
                    narrowing; into strict reactionary intolerance. Puritanism indicated a revolt of
                    the religious conscience of the nation against! the arts and manners of the
                    Renaissance, against the <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> encroachments of
                    belligerent Catholicism, against the corrupt and Italianated court of James I.,
                    against the absolutist pretensions of his son Charles. In its final
                    manifestation during the Commonwealth, Puritanism won a transient victory over
                    the mundane forces of both Reformation and Renaissance, as these had taken shape
                    in England. It also secured the eventual triumph of constitutional independence.
                    Milton, the greatest humanistic poet of the English race, lent his pen and moral
                    energies during the best years of his life to securing that principle on which
                    modern political systems at present rest. Thus the geographical isolation of
                    England, and the comparatively late adoptif^n by the English of matured Italian
                    and German influences, give peculiar complexity to the phenomena of Reformation
                    and Renaissance simultaneously developed on our island. The period of our
                    history between 1536 and 1642 shows how difficult it is to separate these two
                    factors in the re-birth of Europe, both of which contributed so powerfully to
                    the formation of modern English nationality.</p>
                <p>It has been impossible to avoid an air of superficiality,: and the repetition of
                    facts known to every schoolboy, in ] this sketch of so complicated a subject as

                    upon literary and artistic ideals. The purpose of this article has been to show
                    that, wffiile the Renaissance implied a new way of regarding the material world
                    and human nature, a new conception of man’s destiny and <pb break="no"

                    intellectual perceptions penetrating every sphere of thought and energy, it also
                    involved new reciprocal relations between the members of the European group of
                    nations. The Renaissance closed the Middle Ages and opened the modern era,—not
                    merely because the mental and moral ideas which then sprang into activity and
                    owed their force in large measure to the revival of classical learning were
                    opposed to mediaeval modes of thinking and feeling, but also because the
                    political and international relations specific to it as an age were at variance
                    with fundamental theories of the past. Instead of empire and church, the sun and
                    moon of the mediaeval system, a federation of peoples, separate in type and
                    divergent in interests, yet bound together by common tendencies, common culture,
                    and common efforts, came into existence. For obedience to central authority was
                    substituted balance of power. Henceforth the hegemony of Europe attached to no
                    crown imperial or papal, but to the nation which was capable of winning it, in
                    the spiritual region by mental ascendency, and in the temporal by force.</p>
                <p>That this is the right way of regarding the subject appears from the events of
                    the first two decades of the 16th century, those years in which the humanistic
                    revival attained its highest point in Italy. Luther published his i theses in
                    1517, sixty-four years after the fall of Constantinople, twenty-three years
                    after the expedition of Charles VIII. to Naples, ten years before the sack of
                    Rome, at a moment when France, Spain, and England had only felt the influences
                    of Italian culture but feebly. From that date forward two parties wrestled for
                    supremacy in Europe, to which may be given the familiar names of Liberalism and
                    Conservatism, the party of progress and the party of established institutions.
                    The triumph of the former was most signal among the Teutonic peoples. The Latin
                    races, championed by Spain and supported by the Papacy, fought the battle of the
                    latter, and succeeded for a time in rolling back the tide of revolutionary
                    conquest. !Meanwhile that . liberal culture which had been created for Europe by
                    the Italians before the contest of the Reformation began continued to spread,
                    although it was stifled in Italy and Spain, retarded in France and the Low
                    Countries, well nigh extirpated by wars in Germany, and diverted from its course
                    in England by the counter-movement of Puritanism. The <hi rend="italic">auto da
                    f'es</hi> of Seville and Madrid, the flames to which Bruno, Dolet, and Paleario
                    were flung, the dungeon of Campanella and the seclusion of Galileo, the massacre
                    of St Bartholomew and the faggots of Smithfield, the desolated plains of Germany
                    and the cruelties of Alva in the Netherlands, disillusioned Europe of those
                    golden dreams which had arisen in the earlier days of humanism, and which had
                    been so pleasantly indulged by Rabelais. In truth the Renaissance was ruled by
                    no <hi rend="italic">Astraea redux,</hi> but rather by a severe spirit which
                    brought not peace but a sword, reminding men of sternest duties, testing what of
                    moral force and j tenacity was in them, compelling them to strike for the old
                    order or the new, suffering no lukewarm halting between two opinions. That, in
                    spite of retardation and retrogression, the old order of ideas should have
                    yielded to the new all over Europe,—that science should have won firm
                    standing-ground, and political liberty should have struggled through those
                    birth-throes of its origin,—was in the nature of things. Had this not been, the
                    Renaissance or re-birth of Europe would be a term without a meaning.</p>
