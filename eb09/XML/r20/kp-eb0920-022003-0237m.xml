                    Peninsular War was at his right hand, first as aide-de-camp and then as military
                    secretary. He specially distinguished himself at the storming of Badajoz, being
                    the first to mount the breach, and it was to him that the governor delivered up
                    his sword. During the short period of the Bourbon rule in 1814 and 1815 he was
                    secretary to the English embassy at Paris. On the renewal of the war he again
                    became aide-de-camp and military secretary to the duke of Wellington. At
                    Waterloo he lost his right arm by a shot, but he quickly gained the facility of
                    writing with his left hand, and on the conclusion of the war resumed his duties
                    as secretary to the embassy at Paris. From 1818 to 1826 he sat in the House of
                    Commons as member for Truro. In 1819 he was appointed secretary to the duke of
                    Wellington as master-general of the ordnance, and from 1827 till the death of
                    the duke in 1852 was military secretary to him as commander-in-chief. He was
                    then appointed master-general of the ordnance, and shortly afterwards was raised
                    to the House of Lords as Baron Raglan. In 1854 he was appointed to the command
                    of the English troops sent to the Crimea. Here the advantage of his training
                    under the duke of Wellington was seen in the soundness of his military tactics,
                    but the trying ־« ’ inter campaign in the Crimea also brought into prominence
                    defects perhaps traceable to his long connexion with the formalities and uniform
                    regulations of military offices in peace time. At the same time the hampering
                    influence of a divided command must be taken into account, and it ought not to
                    be forgotten that, if his advice had been adopted by the French at the
                    beginning, Sebastopol would very probably have fallen in a few weeks after the
                    landing of the allies. His suggestion was to march straight upon the north side
                    of Sebastopol, but after the battle of Alma on 20th September the plan was
                    abandoned, and the south side was reached by the desperate expedient of a
                    perilous flank march. For the hardships and sufferings of the English soldiers
                    in the terrible Crimean winter o« <hi rend="superscript">7</hi> ing to a failure
                    in the commissariat, both as regards food'and clothing, Lord Raglan and his
                    staff were at the time severely censured by the press and the Government; but,
                    while Lord Raglan was possibly to blame in representing matters in a too
                    sanguine light, it afterwards appeared that the chief neglect rested with the
                    home authorities. The monotony of the siege was broken by the battles of
                    Balaclava on 26th October and of Inkermann on 5th November, in which the
                    accurate and rapid decision of Lord Raglan changed impending disasters into
                    brilliant victories. During the trying ’ « <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> inter
                    of 1854-55 the suffering he « ’ as compelled to witness, the censures, in great
                    part unjust, which he had to endure, and all the manifold anxieties of the siege
                    seriously undermined his health, and he died of dysentery on 28th June 1855.</p>
