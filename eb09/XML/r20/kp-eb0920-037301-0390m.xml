                    untiring researches of Scheltema and other Dutchmen, notably by C. Vosmaer,

                    Rembrandt’s high position in European art rests on the originality of his mind,
                    the power of his imagination, his profound sympathy with his subjects, the
                    boldness of his system of light and shade, the thoroughness of his modelling,
                    his subtle colour, and above all on the intense humanity of the man. He was
                    great in conception and in execution, a poet as well as a painter, an idealist
                    and also a realist; and this rare union is the secret of his power. From his
                    dramatic action and mastery of expression Rembrandt has been well called “the
                    Shakespeare of Holland.” To understand aright his position in art, we must
                    consider rapidly his surroundings and note the influences which affected him; we
                    shall thus find what he had in common with his time and understand better how
                    far he was really a new power, an original genius.</p>
                <p>It must be borne in mind that in the beginning of the 17tli century Holland had
                    risen to great power. Though not yet formally free from the Spanish yoke, she
                    had broken the fetters by the heroic efforts of the former generation, and had
                    entered on her grand career of national enterprise. Science and literature
                    flourished in her universities, poetry and the stage were favoured by her
                    citizens, and art found a home not only in the capital but in the provincial
                    towns. It was a time also of new ideas. Old conventional forms in religion,
                    philosophy, and art had fallen away, and liberty was inspiring new conceptions.
                    It is with those of art that we have to deal. Here there were no church
                    influences at work to fetter the painter in the choice and treatment of his
                    subject, no academies to prescribe rules.</p>
                <p>Left to himself, therefore, the artist painted the life of the people among whom
                    he lived and the subjects which interested them. It was thus a living history
                    that he painted,—scenes from the everyday life and amusements of the people,
                    often mean and vulgar it must be confessed, the civic rulers, the regents of the
                    hospitals and the heads of the guilds, and the civic guards who defended their
                    towns. So also with the religious pictures which were produced under the
                    influence of these environments. The dogmas and legends of the Church of Rome
                    were no longer of interest to such a nation; but the Bible was read and studied
                    with avidity, and from its page the artist drew directly the scenes of the
                    simple narrative. The Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha were the sources
                    from which, without any interference of Jesuit inquisitors, he drew his
                    inspiration. This change had been coming on steadily since the Reformation, a
                    change that implied a growing freedom from trammels and a larger and more human
                    view of the subjects treated. Perhaps the earliest trace of this new aspect of
                    Bible story is to be found in the pictures painted in Rome about the beginning
                    of the 17 th century by Adam Elsheimer of Frankfort, who had undoubtedly a great
                    influence on the Dutch painters studying in Italy. These in their turn carried
                    back to Holland the simplicity and the picturesque effect which they found in
                    Elsheimer’s work. Among these, the precursors of Rembrandt, may be mentioned
                    Moeyaert, Ravesteyn, Lastman, Pinas, Honthorst, and Bramer. Influenced doubtless
                    by these painters, Rembrandt determined to work out his own ideas of art on
                    Dutch soil, resisting apparently every inducement to visit Italy. Though an
                    admirer of the great Italian masters, he yet maintained his own individuality in
                    the most marked manner. It is strange that we have no evidence that he ever met
                    his greatest Dutch rival, the brillant Frans Hals, his senior by some fifteen
                    years.</p>
                <p>Rembrandt was born in the house No. 3 Weddesteg, on the rampart at Leyden
                    overlooking the Rhine. The house belonged to his father Gerrit Harmen van Rijn,
                    a well-to-do miller, and still exists, but the windmill is no more. He was the
                    fourth son, and, as the older boys had been sent to trade, his parents resolved
                    that he should enter a learned profession. With this view he was sent to the
                    High School at Leyden; but the boy soon manifested his dislike of the prospect
                    and determined to be a painter. Accordingly he was placed for three years under
                    Swanenburch, a connexion of the Van Rijn family. This master was a painter of no
                    great merit, but he enjoyed some reputation from his having studied in Italy.
                    His next master was Lastman of Amsterdam, a painter of very considerable power.
                    In Lastman’s works we can trace the germs of the colour and sentiment of his
                    greater pupil, though his direct influence cannot have been great, as it is said
                    by Orlers that Rembrandt remained with him only six months, after which time he
                    returned to Leyden, about 1623. During the early years of his life at Leyden
                    Rembrandt seems to have devoted himself entirely to studies, painting and
                    etching the people around him, the beggars and cripples, every picturesque face
                    and form he could get hold of. Life, character, and above all light were the
                    aims of these studies. His mother was a frequent model, and we can trace in her
                    features the strong likeness to her son, especially in the portraits of himself
                    at an advanced age. So far as we know there is no likeness of his father, who
                    died about 1632. The last portrait of his mother is that of the Belvidere
                    Gallery of Vienna, painted the year before her death in 1640. One of his sisters
                    also frequently sat to him, and Bode suggests that she must have accompanied him
                    to Amsterdam and kept house for him till he married. This conjecture rests <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0391-0374"/>on the number of portraits of the same young woman
                    painted in the early years of his stay in Amsterdam and before he met his bride.
                    Then, again, in the many portraits of himself painted in his early life we can
                    see with what zeal he set himself to master every form of expression, now grave
                    now gay, at one time with a smile at another with a frown,—how thoroughly he
                    learned to model the human face not from the outside but from the inner man.
                    Careful in detail and thorough in work, these studies were the foundation of his
                    later triumphs. Dr Bode gives fifty as the number of the portraits of himself,
                    most of them painted in youth and in old age, the times when he had leisure for
                    such work.</p>
                <p>Rembrandt’s earliest pictures Avere painted in the last four years of his stay at
                    Leyden, from 1627 to 1631. Bode mentions about nine pictures as known to belong
                    to these years, chiefly paintings of single figures, as St Paul in Prison and St
                    Jerome; but now and then compositions of several, as Samson in Prison and
                    Presentations in the Temple. The prevailing tone of all these pictures is a
                    greenish-grey, the effect being somewhat cold and heavy. The gallery at Cassel
                    gives us a typical example of his studies of the heads of old men, firm and hard
                    in workmanship and full of detail, the effects of light and shade being
                    carefully thought out. His work was now attracting the attention of the lovers
                    of art in the great city of Amsterdam; and, urged by their calls, he removed
                    about 1631 to live and die there. His life lias few incidents and these only
                    personal, for he lived among the simple burgher citizens, moving in an excellent
                    circle of men of science, divines, poets, artists, and friends of art. At one
                    bound he leaped into the position of the first portrait painter of the city, and
                    received numerous commissions. During the early years of his residence there are
                    at least forty known portraits from his hand, firm and solid in manner and staid
                    in expression. It. has been remarked that the fantasy in which he indulged
                    through life was reserved only for the portraits of himself and his immediate
                    connexions. The excellent painter Thomas De Keyser was then in the height of his
                    power, and his influence is to be traced in some of Rembrandt’s smaller
                    portraits. Pupils also now flocked to his house in the Bloemgracht, among them
                    Gerard Douw, who was nearly of his own age. The first important work executed by
                    Rembrandt in Amsterdam is Simeon in the Temple, of the Hague Museum, a fine
                    early example of his treatment of light and shade and of his subtle colour. The
                    concentrated light falls on the principal figure, his favourite way of arresting
                    attention, while the background is full of mystery. The surface is smooth and
                    enamelled, and all the details are carefully wrought out, while the action of
                    light on the mantle of Simeon shows how soon he had felt the magical effect of
                    the play of colour. Between the small Simeon of 1631 and the life-sized Lesson
                    in Anatomy of 1632 there is a great difference. In the latter we have the first
                    of the great portrait subjects, —Tulp the anatomist, the early friend of
                    Rembrandt, discoursing to his seven associates, who are ranged with eager heads
                    round the foreshortened body. The subject was not new, for it had been treated
                    in former years by the Mierevelds, A. Pietersen, and others, for the Hall of the
                    Surgeons. But it was reserved for Rembrandt to make it a great picture by the
                    grouping of the expressive portraits and by the completeness of the conception.
                    The colour is quiet and the handling of the brush timid and precise, while the
                    light and shade are somewhat harsh and abrupt. But it is a marvellous picture
                    for a young man of twenty-five, and it is generally accepted as the first
                    milestone in the career of the painter, and as marking a new departure.</p>
                <p>In the forty long years of Rembrandt’s incessant activity as an artist about
                    seven hundred pictures are known to have come from his own hand. It is therefore
                    clearly impossible within the space at our disposal to notice more than the
                    prominent ’ works in their order. Besides the Pellicorne family portraits of
                    1632, we have the caligra-phist Coppenol of the Cassel Gallery, interesting in
                    the first place as an early example of Rembrandt’s method of giving permanent
                    interest to a portrait by converting it into a picture. He invests it with a
                    sense of life by a momentary expression as Coppenol raises his head towards the
                    spectator while he is mending a quill. The same motive is to be found in the
                    Shipbuilder, 1633 (of Buckingham Palace), who looks up from his work with a
                    sense of interruption at the approach of his <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> wife.
                    But the worthy Coppenol, “the Phoenix of the Pen,” has another charm for us; he
                    was one of Rembrandt’s earliest friends in his new abode and remained true to
                    the end, being painted thrice and etched twice by the artist, the last of whose
                    portrait etchings (1661) was <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Coppenol of large size.
                    The two small pictures of the Philosopher of the Louvre date from 1633, delicate
                    in execution and full of mysterious effect. The year 1634 is especially
                    remarkable as that of his marriage with Saskia van Ulenburgh, a beautiful,
                    fair-haired Frisian maiden of good connexions. Till her death in 1642 she was
                    the centre of his life and art, and lives for us in many a canvas as well as in
                    her own portraits. On her the painter lavished his magical power, painting her
                    as the Queen Artemisia or Bathsheba, and as the wife of Samson,—ahvays proud of
                    her long fair locks, and covering her with pearls and gold as precious in their
                    play of colour as those of the Indies. A joyous pair as we see them in the
                    Dresden Gallery, Saskia sitting on his knee while he laughs gaily, or
                    promenading together in a fine picture of 1636, or putting the last touches of
                    ornament to her toilette, for thus Bode interprets the so-called Burgomaster
                    Pancras and his Wife. These were his happy days when he painted himself in his
                    exuberant fantasy, and adorned himself, at least in his portraits, in scarfs and
                    feathers and gold chains. Saskia brought him a marriage portion of forty
                    thousand guilders, a large sum for those times, and she brought him also a large
                    circle of good friends in Amsterdam. She bore him four children, Rum-bartus and
                    two girls successively named Cornelia after his beloved mother, all of whom died
                    in infancy, and Titus, named after Titia a sister of Saskia. We have several
                    noble portraits of Saskia, a good type of the beauty of Holland, all painted
                    with the utmost love and care, at Cassel (1633), at Dresden (1641), and a
                    posthumous one (1643) at Berlin. But the greatest in workmanship and most
                    pathetic in expression seems to us, though it is decried by Bode, that of
                    Antwerp (1641), in which it is impossible not to trace declining health and to
                    find a melancholy presage of her death, which took ])lace in 1642. Then truly
                    Avent out the light of Rembrandt’s life.</p>
                <p>Returning to Rembrandt’s work, Ave find one of the greatest portraits of 1634 to
                    be the superb full length portrait of Martin Daey, Avhich with that of !Madame
                    Daey, painted according to Vosmaer some years later, formed one of the ornaments
                    of the Van Loon collection at Amsterdam. Both <hi rend="smallcaps">iioav</hi>
                    belong to Baron Gustave de Rothschild. From the firm detailed execution of this
                    portrait one turns with Avonder to the broader handling of the Old Woman, aged
                    eighty-three, in the National Gallery, of the same year, remarkable for the
                    effect of reflected light and still more for the sympathetic rendering of
                    character.</p>
                <p>The life of Samson supplied many subjects in these early days. The so-called
                    Count of Gueldres Threatening his Father-in-law of the Berlin Gallery has been
                    restored to its proper signification by M. Kolloff, who finds it to be Samson.
                    It is forced and violent in its action. But the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0392-0375"/>greatest of this series, and one of the prominent
                    pictures of Rembrandt’s work, is the Marriage of Samson of the Dresden Gallery,
                    painted in 1638. Here Rembrandt gives the rein to his imagination and makes the
                    scene live before us. Except the bride (Saskia), who sits calm and grand on a
                    dais in the centre of the feast, with the full light again playing on her
                    flowing locks and wealth of jewels, all is animated and full of bustle. Samson,
                    evidently a Rembrandt of fantasy, leans over a chair propounding his riddle to
                    the Philistine lords. In execution it is a great advance on former subject
                    pictures; it is bolder in manner, and we have here signs of his approaching love
                    of warmer tones of red and yellow. It is also a fine example of his magic play
                    of colour.</p>
                <p>The story of Susannah also occupied him in these early years, and he returned to
                    the subject in 1641 and 1653. The Bather of the National Gallery may also be
                    another interpretation of the same theme. In all of these pictures the woman is
                    coarse in type and lumpy in form, though the modelling is soft and round, the
                    effect which Rembrandt always strove to gain. Beauty of form was outside his
                    art. But the so-called Danae (1636) at St Petersburg is a sufficient reply to
                    those who decry his nude female forms. As flesh painting it glows with colour
                    and life, and the blood seems to pulsate under the warm skin. In the picturesque
                    story of Tobit Rembrandt found much to interest him, as we see in the beautiful
                    small picture of the Arenberg collection at Brussels. Sight is being restored to
                    the aged Tobias, while with infinite tenderness his wife holds the old man’s
                    hand caressingly. The momentary action is complete, and the picture goes
                    straight to the heart. In the Berlin Gallery he paints the anxiety of the
                    parents as they wait the return of their son. In 1637 he painted the fine
                    picture now in the Louvre of the Flight of the Angel; and the same subject is
                    grandly treated by him, apparently about 1645, in the picture exhibited in the
                    winter exhibition at Burlington House in 1885. Reverence and awe are shown in
                    every attitude of the Tobit family. A similar lofty treatment is to be found in
                    the Christ as the Gardener appearing to Mary of 1638 (Buckingham Palace).</p>
                <p>We have now arrived at the year 1640, the threshold of his second manner, which
                    extended to 1654, the middle age of Rembrandt. During the latter part of the
                    previous decade we find the shadows more transparent and the blending of light
                    and shade more perfect. There is a growing power in every part of his art. The
                    coldness of his first manner had disappeared, and the tones were gradually
                    changing into golden-brown. He had passed through what Bode calls his
                    “Sturm-und-Drang” period of exaggerated expression, as in the Berlin Samson, and
                    had attained to a truer, calmer form of dramatic expression, of which the
                    Manoali of Dresden is a good example (1641). Whether it was that he was getting
                    tired of painting commissioned portraits, that he was independent of them, or
                    that he aimed at higher flights, it is certain that these portraits painted “to
                    order” became more rare about this time, and that those which we have are
                    chiefly friends of his circle, such as the Mennonite Preacher (C. C. Ansloo) and
                    the Gilder (Le Doreur), a fine example of his golden tone, formerly in the Morny
                    collection and now in America. His own splendid portrait (1640) in the National
                    Gallery illustrates the change in his work. It describes the man well,—strong
                    and robust, with powerful head, firm and compressed lips and determined chin,
                    with heavy eye-bro\vs, separated by a deep vertical furrow, and with eyes of
                    keen penetrating glance,—altogether a self-reliant man that would carry out his
                    own ideas, careless whether his popularity waxed or waned. The fantastic
                    rendering of himself has disappeared; he seems more conscious of his dignity and
                    position. He has now many friends and pupils, and numerous commissions, even
                    from the stadtholder; lie has bought a large house in the Breedstraat, in which
                    during the next sixteen years of his life lie gathered his large collection of
                    paintings, engravings, armour, and costume which figure afterwards in his
                    inventory. His taste was wide and his purchases large, for he was joint owner
                    with picture dealers of paintings by Giorgione and Palma Veccliio, while for a
                    high-priced Marc-antonio Raimondi print he gave in exchange a fine impression of
                    his Christ Healing the Sick, which has since been known as the Hundred Guilder
                    Print. The stadt-liolder was not a prompt payer, and an interesting
                    correspondence took place between Rembrandt and Constantin Huygens, the poet and
                    secretary of the prince. The Rembrandt letters which have come down to us are
                    few, and these are therefore of importance. Rembrandt puts a high value on the
                    picture, which he says had been painted “with much care and zeal,” but he is
                    willing to take what the prince thinks proper; while to Huygens he sends a large
                    picture as a present for his trouble in carrying through the business. There is
                    here no sign of the grasping greed with which he has been charged, while his
                    unselfish conduct is seen in the settlement of the family affairs at the death
                    of his mother in 1640.</p>
                <p>The year 1642 is remarkable for the great picture formerly known as the Night
                    Watch, but now more correctly as the Sortie of the Banning Cock Company, another
                    of the landmarks of Rembrandt’s career, in which twenty-nine life-sized civic
                    guards are introduced issuing pell-mell from their club house. Such guilds of
                    arque-busiers had been painted admirably before by Ravesteyn and notably by
                    Frans Hals, but Rembrandt determined to throw life and animation into the scene,
                    which is full of bustle and movement. One can almost hear the beating of the
                    drum and the barking of the dog. The dominant colour is the citron yellow
                    uniform of the lieutenant, wearing a blue sash, while a Titian-like red dress of
                    a musketeer, the black velvet dress of the captain, and the varied green of the
                    girl and drummer, all produce a rich and harmonious effect. The background has
                    become dark and heavy by accident or neglect, and the scutcheon on which the
                    .names are painted is scarcely to be seen.</p>
                <p>But this year of great achievement was also the year of his great loss, for
                    Saskia died in 1642, leaving Rembrandt her sole trustee for her son Titus, but
                    with full use of the money till he should marry again or till the marriage of
                    Titus. The words of the will express her love for her husband and her confidence
                    in him. With her death his life was changed. Bode has remarked that there is a
                    pathetic sadness in his pictures of the Holy Family,—a favourite subject at this
                    period of his life. All of these he treats with the naive simplicity of Reformed
                    Holland, giving us the real carpenter’s shop and the mother watching over the
                    Infant reverently and lovingly, with a fine union of realism and idealism. It is
                    true indeed that the circumstances of his time and country made it impossible
                    for him to attempt to realize the ancient forms of Hebrew life, or to revive the
                    bye-past race of Judaea. He was content, as the old Italians were, with the
                    types around him. The street in which he lived swarmed with Dutch and Portuguese
                    Jews, and many a Jewish rabbi sat to him. He accepted their turbans and local
                    dress as characteristic of the people. But in his religious pictures it is not
                    the costume we look at; what strikes us is the profound perception of the
                    sentiment of the story, making them true to all time and independent of local
                    circumstance. A notable example of this feeling is to be found in the Woman
                    Taken in Adultery of the National Gallery, painted in 1644 in the manner of the
                    Simeon of the Hague.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n393/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0393-0376"/>
                <p>Beyond the ordinary claims of art, it commands our attention from the grand
                    conception of the painter who here as in other pictures and etchings has
                    invested Christ with a majestic dignity which recalls Leonardo and no other. A
                    similar lofty ideal is to be found in his various renderings of the Pilgrims at
                    Emmaus, notably in the Louvre picture of 1648, in which, as Mrs Jameson says,
                    “he returns to those first spiritual principles which were always the dowry of
                    ancient art. Here we have before us a countenance pale and tender, meek and
                    lowly of heart, adorned only with holiness and a glorified life.” From the same
                    year we have the Good Samaritan of the Louvre, the story being told with intense
                    pathos. The helpless suffering of the wounded man, the curiosity of the boy on
                    tiptoe, the excited faces at the upper window, are all conveyed with masterly
                    skill. In these two last pictures we find a broader touch and freer handling,
                    while the tones pass into a dull yellow and brown with a marked predilection for
                    deep rich red. Whether it was that this scheme of colour found no favour with
                    the Amsterdamers, who, as Hoogstraten tells us, could not understand the Sortie,
                    it seems certain that Rembrandt was not invited to take any leading part in the
                    celebration of the congress of Westphalia of this year (1648), a year famous in
                    Dutch history for the European declaration of the independence of Holland, and
                    in Dutch art as the subject of Terburg’s picture in the National Gallery and of
                    Van der Heist’s famous Banquet of the Civic Guard at Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>Rembrandt touched no side of art without setting his mark on it, whether in still
                    life, as in his dead birds or the Slaughtered Ox of the Louvre, or in his
                    drawings of elephants and lions, all of which are instinct with life. But at
                    this period of his career we come upon a branch of his art on which he left,
                    both in etching and in painting, the stamp of his genius, viz., landscape.
                    Roeland Roghman, but ten years his senior, evidently influenced his style, for
                    the resemblance between their works is so great that, as at Cassel, there has
                    been confusion of authorship. Hercules Seghers also was much appreciated by
                    Rembrandt, for at his sale eight pictures by this master figure in the
                    inventory, and Vosmaer discovered that Rembrandt had worked on a plate by
                    Seghers and had added figures to an etched Flight into Egypt. The earliest pure
                    landscape known to us from Rembrandt’s hand is the Winter Scene of Cassel
                    (1646), silvery and delicate. As a rule in his painted landscape he aims at
                    grandeur and poetical effect, as in the Repose of the Holy Family of 1647 (till
                    recently called the Gipsies), a moonlight effect, clear even in the shadows. The
                    Canal of Lord Lansdowne, and the Mountain Landscape with the Approaching Storm,
                    the sun shining out behind the heavy clouds, are both conceived and executed in
                    this spirit. A similar poetical vein runs through the Castle on the Hill of
                    Cassel, in which the beams of the setting sun strike on the castle while the
                    valley is sunk in the shades of approaching night. More powerful still is the
                    weird effect of Lord Lansdowne’s Windmill, with its glow of light and darkening
                    shadows. In all these pictures light with its magical influences is the theme of
                    the poet-painter. From the number of landscapes by himself in the inventory of
                    his sale, it would appear that these grand works were not appreciated by his
                    contemporaries. The last of the landscape series dates from 1655 or 1656, the
                    close of the middle age or manhood of Rembrandt, a period of splendid power. In
                    the Joseph Accused by Potiphar’s Wife of 1654 we have great dramatic vigour and
                    perfect mastery of expression, while the brilliant colour and glowing effect of
                    light and shade attest his strength. To this period also belongs the great
                    portrait of himself in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge.</p>
                <p>But evil days were at hand. The long-continued wars and civil troubles had worn
                    out the country. Trade and commerce languished, and in Amsterdam hundreds of
                    houses were empty. Rembrandt’s brothers had suffered, and money was scarce. His
                    own and doubtless Saskia’s means were tied up in his house and in his large
                    collection of valuable pictures, and we find Rembrandt borrowing considerable
                    sums of money on the security of his house to keep things going. Perhaps, as
                    Bode suggests, this was the reason of his extraordinary activity at this time.
                    Then, unfortunately, in this year of 1654, we find Rembrandt involved in the
                    scandal of having a child by his servant Hendrickie Jaghers or Stoffels, as
                    appears by the books of the Reformed Church at Amsterdam. He recognized the
                    child and gave it the name of Cornelia after his muchloved mother, but there is
                    no proof that he married the mother, and the probability is against such a
                    marriage, as the provisions of Saskia’s will would in that case have come into
                    force, and her fortune would have passed at once to her son Titus. Hendrickie
                    seems to have continued to live with him, for we find her claiming a chest as
                    her property at his sale in 1658. Doubtless she is the peasant girl of Rasdorf
                    to whom Houbraken says Rembrandt was married. Sad as the story is, Hendrickie
                    has an interest for us. Bode asserts that in his art there was always a woman in
                    close relationship to Rembrandt and appearing in his work—his mother, his
                    sister, and then Saskia. Are there any traces of Hendrickie? What if the little
                    servant maid of ten years, painted about 1645 (Dulwich Gallery), and again in
                    the Demidoff picture of the same year, in which the girl is painted in the red
                    dress of a Dutch orphan, in both cases smiling and leaning over a window, were
                    the maidservant of his house in 1654? The ages would correspond. Bode suggests
                    that the beautiful portrait of the Lady in the Salon Carré of the Louvre and the
                    Amor and Cupid of the same gallery may represent Hendrickie and her child. Both
                    pictures belong to this date, and by their treatment are removed from the
                    category of Rembrandt’s usual portraits. But if this is conjecture, we get
                    nearer to fact when we look at the picture exhibited at Burlington House in 1883
                    to which tradition has attached the name of “Rembrandt’s Mistress.” At a glance
                    one can see that it is not the mere head of a model, as she lies in bed raising
                    herself to put aside a curtain as if she heard a well-known footstep. It is
                    clearly a woman in whom Rembrandt had a personal interest. The date is clearly
                    165 , the fourth figure being illegible; but the brilliant carnations and
                    masterly touch connect it with the Potiphar’s Wife of 1654 and the Jaghers
                    period. It is painful to turn from this attempt to trace the life of Rembrandt
                    in his work to the sadder side of the story. In 1656 his financial affairs
                    became more involved, and the Orphans’ Chamber transferred the house and ground
                    to Titus, though Rembrandt was still allowed to take charge of Saskia’s estate.
                    Nothing, however, could avert the ruin of the painter, who was declared bankrupt
                    in July 1656, an inventory of all his property being ordered by the Insolvency
                    Chamber. The first sale took place in 1657 in the Keizerskroon hotel, Thomas
                    Jacobz Haring, a well-known name in connexion with Rembrandt’s art, being
                    auctioneer; and the second, at which the larger part of the etchings and
                    drawings were disposed of, in 1658—“collected by Rembrandt himself with much
                    love and care,” says the catalogue. The sum realized, under 5000 guilders, was
                    but a fraction of their value. The time was unfavourable over the whole of
                    Europe for such sales, the renowned collection of Charles I. of England having
                    brought but a comparatively small sum in 1653. Driven thus from his house,
                    stripped of everything he possessed even to his table linen, Rembrandt took a
                    modest lodging in the same Keizerskroon hostelry</p>

                <p>(the amounts of his bills are in record), apparently without friends and thrown
                    entirely on himself. But there was no failure here, for this dark year of 1656
                    stands out prominently as one in which some of his greatest works were produced,
                    as, for example, John the Baptist Preaching in the Wilderness, belonging to Lord
                    Dudley, and Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph, of the Cassel Gallery. It is
                    impossible not to respect the man who, amid the utter ruin of his affairs, could
                    calmly conceive and carry out such noble work. Yet even in his art one can see
                    that the tone of his mind was sombre. Instead of the brilliancy of 1654 we have
                    for two or three years a preference for dull yellows, reds, and greys, with a
                    certain measure of uniformity of tone. The handling is broad and rapid, as if to
                    give utterance to the ideas which crowded on his mind. There is less caressing
                    of colour for its own sake, even less straining after vigorous effect of light
                    and shade. Still the two pictures just named are among the greatest works of the
                    master. To the same year belongs the Lesson in Anatomy of Johann Deyman, another
                    of the many men of science with whom Bembrandt was closely associated. The
                    subject is similar to the great Tulp of 1632, but his manner and power of colour
                    had advanced so much that Sir Joshua Reynolds, in his visit to Holland in 1781,
                    was reminded by it of Michelangelo and Titian. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This picture has had a strange history. It
                    had suffered by fire and was sold to a Mr Chaplin of London in 1841, was
                    exhibited in Leeds in 1868, and again disappeared, ultimately to be found in the
                    magazines of the South Kensington Museum as a doubtful Rembrandt. The patriotism
                    of some Dutch lovers of art restored it to its native country; and it now hangs,
                    a magnificent fragment, in the Museum of Amsterdam. </p></note> Vosmaer ascribes
                    to the same year, though Bode places it later, the famous portrait of Jan Six,
                    the future burgomaster, consummate in its ease and character, as Six descends
                    the steps of his house drawing on his glove. The connexion between Rembrandt and
                    the great family of Six was long and close, and is honourable to both. Jan
                    married a daughter of Tulp the anatomist, one of Rembrandt’s earliest friends.
                    In 1641 the mother of Six, Anna Wymer, had been painted with consummate skill by
                    Rembrandt, who also executed in 1647 the beautiful etching of Six standing by a
                    window reading his tragedy of “Medea,” afterwards illustrated by his friend. Now
                    he paints his portrait in the prime of manhood, and in the same year of gloom
                    paints for him the masterly John the Baptist. Six, if he could not avert the
                    disaster of Rembrandt’s life, at least stood by him in the darkest hour, when
                    certainly the creative energy of Rembrandt was in full play. The same period
                    gives us the Master of the Vineyard, and the Adoration of the Magi of Buckingham
                    Palace.</p>
                <p>After the sale of the house in the Breedstraat Rembrandt retired to the
                    Rosengracht, an obscure quarter at the west end of the city. Vosmaer thinks he
                    has traced the very house, but some doubts have been thrown on this discovery by
                    De Roever. We are now drawing to the splendid close of his career in his third
                    manner, in which his touch became broader, his impasto more solid, and his
                    knowledge more complete. Hastening on by quicker steps, we may mention the Old
                    Man with the Grey Beard of the National Gallery (1657), and the Bruyningh, the
                    Secretary of the Insolvents’ Chamber, of Cassel (1658), both leading up to the
                    great portraits of the Syndics of the Cloth Hall of 1661. Nearly thirty years
                    separate us from the Lesson in Anatomy, years of long-continued observation and
                    labour. The knowledge thus gathered, the problems solved, the mastery attained,
                    are shown here in abundance. Rembrandt returns to the simplest gamut of colour,
                    but shows his skill in the use of it, leaving on the spectator an impression of
                    absolute enjoyment of the result, unconscious of the means. The plain burghers
                    dealing with the simple concerns of their guild arrest our attention as if they
                    were the makers of history. They live for ever.</p>
                <p>In his old age Rembrandt continued to paint his own portrait as assiduously as in
                    his youthful and happy days. About twenty of these portraits are known, a
                    typical one being found in the National Gallery. All show the same self reliant
                    expression, though broken down indeed by age and the cares of a hard life. There
                    is in Stockholm a large and unfinished picture which, if painted by Rembrandt,
                    belongs to the late years of his life (etched by Waltner, <hi rend="italic">Gaz.
                    des Beaux-Arts</hi> , Nov. 1874). It is catalogued as the Oath of John Ziska,
                    certainly a strange subject for Rembrandt. Bode accepts the more natural
                    interpretation of Prof. Anton Springer, viz., the Feast of Judas Maccabaeus, and
                    ascribes the picture to an earlier date than that given by Vosmaer. Havard,
                    however, after careful examination, attributes the work to Carel Fabritius.</p>
                <p>About the year 1663 Rembrandt painted the (so-called) Jewish Bride of the Van der
                    Hoop Gallery and the Family Group of Brunswick, the last and perhaps the most
                    brilliant works of his life, bold and rapid in execution and marvellous in the
                    subtle mixture and play of colours in which lie seems to revel. The woman and
                    children are painted with such love that the impression is conveyed that they
                    represent a fancy family group of the painter in his old age. This idea received
                    some confirmation from the supposed discovery that he left a widow Catherine Van
                    Wyck and two children, but this theory falls to the ground, for De Roever has
                    shown <hi rend="italic">(Oud Holland,</hi> 1883) that Catherine was the widow of
                    a marine painter Theunisz Blanckerhoff, who died about the same time as
                    Rembrandt. The mistake arose from a miscopying of the register. The subject of
                    these pictures is thus more mysterious than ever.</p>
                <p>In 1668 Titus, the only son of Rembrandt, died, leaving one child, and on 8th
                    October 1669 the great painter himself passed away, leaving two children, and w
                    <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as buried in the Wester Kerk. He had outlived his
                    popularity, for his manner of painting, as we know from contemporaries, was no
                    longer in favour with a people who preferred the smooth trivialities of Van der
                    Werff and the younger Mieris, the leaders of an expiring school.</p>
                <p>We must give but a short notice of Rembrandt’s achievements in etching. Here he
                    stands out by universal confession as first, excelling all by his unrivalled
                    technical skill, his mastery of expression, and the lofty conceptions of many of
                    his great pieces, as in the Death of the Virgin, the Christ Preaching, the
                    Christ Healing the Sick (the Hundred Guilder Print), the Presentation to the
                    People, the Crucifixion, and others. So great is his skill simply as an etcher
                    that one is apt to overlook the nobleness of the etcher’s ideas and the depth of
                    his nature, and this tendency has been doubtless confirmed by the enormous
                    difference in money value between “states” of the same })late, rarity giving in
                    many cases a fictitious worth in the eyes of collectors. The points of
                    difference between these states arise from the additions and changes made by
                    Rembrandt on the plate.; and the prints taken off by him have been subjected to
                    the closest inspection by Bartsch, Gersaint, Wilson, Daulby, DeClaussin, C.
                    Blanc, Willsliire, Seymour Haden, Middleton, and others, who have described them
                    at great length and to whom the reader is referred. The classification of
                    Rembrandt’s etchings adopted till lately was the artificial one of treating them
                    according to the subject, as Biblical, portrait, landscape, and so on; and to
                    Vosmaer must bo ascribed the credit of being the first to view Rembrandt’s
                    etched work, as he has done his work in painting, in the more scientific and
                    intei’esting line of chronology. This method has been developed by Mr Seymour
                    Haden and Mr Middleton, and is now universally accepted. But even so recently as
                    1873 M. C. Blanc, in his fine work <hi rend="italic">L'Oeuvre complet clc
                    Rembrandt,</hi> still adheres to the older and less intelligent arrangement,
                    resting his preference on the frequent absence of dates on the etchings and more
                    strangely still on the equality of the work. Mr Seymour Haden’s reply is
                    conclusive, “that the more important etchings which may be taken as types are
                    dated, and that, the style of the etchings at different periods of Rembrandt’s
                    career being fully as marked as that of his paintings, no more difficulty
                    attends the classification <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n395/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0395-0378"/>of one than of the other.” Indeed M. Vosmaer
                    points out in his I life of Rembrandt that there is a marked parallelism between
                    I Rembrandt’s painted and etched work, his early work in both cases! being timid
                    and tentative, while he gradually gains strength and ' character both with the
                    brush and the graver’s tools. M. ׳ Yosmaer’s scheme of chronological order has
                    doubtless been! challenged in some respects, but it gave the deathblow to the
                    older system. Mr Seymour Haden has started the theory that many of the etchings
                    ascribed to Rembrandt up to 1640 were the work of his pupils, and seems to make
                    out his case, though it may be carried too far. He argues (in his monograph on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Etched Work of Rembrandt,</hi> 1877) that Rembrandt’s real
                    work in etching began | after Saskia’s death, when he assumes that Rembrandt
                    betook himself to Elsbroek, the country house of his “powerful friend” Jan j
                    Six. But it must be remembered that the future burgomaster was then but a young
                    student of twenty-four, a member of a great family it is true, but unmarried and
                    taking as yet no share in! public life. That Rembrandt was a frequent visitor at
                    Elsbroek, and that the Three Trees and other etchings may have been pro-j duced
                    there, may be admitted without requiring us to believe that: he had left
                    Amsterdam as his place of abode. The great period of his etching lies between
                    1639 and 1661, after which the old painter! seems to have renounced the needle.
                    In these twenty years were produced his greatest works in portraiture,
                    landscape, and Bible story. They bear the impress of the genius of the man.</p>
