                    and 36° 28' N. lat. and 27° 40' and 28° 15' E. long., about 10 miles south of
                    Cape Alepo. Its length is about 45 niiles from north-east to south-west, its
                    greatest breadth 22 miles, and its area nearly 424 square miles.</p>
                <p>The island is diversilied in its surface, and is traversed from north to south by
                    an elevated mountain range, the highest point of which, named in ancient times
                    Atabyris or Atabyrium, and still called Atairo, rises to an elevation of 4560
                    feet. It commands a view of the elevated coast of Asia Minor towards the north,
                    and of the Archipelago, studded with its numerous islands, on the north-west;
                    while on the south-west is seen Mount Ida in Crete, often veiled in clouds, and
                    on the south and south-east the vast expanse of waters which wash the African
                    shore. The rest of the island is occupied in great part by ranges of moderately
                    elevated hills, on which are found extensive woods of ancient pines, planted by
                    the hand of nature. These forests were formerly very thick, but they are now
                    greatly thinned by the Turks, who cut them down and take no care to plant others
                    in their place. Beneath these hills the surface of the island falls lower, and
                    several hills in the form of amphitheatres extend their bases as far as the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>Rhodes was famed in ancient times for its delightful climate, and it still
                    maintains its former reputation. The air is pure and salubrious, and it is said
                    that there is hardly a day throughout the year in which the sun is not visible.
                    The winds are liable to little variation; they blow from the west, often with
                    great violence, for nine months in the year, and at other times from the north;
                    and they moderate the summer heats, which are chiefly felt during the months of
                    July and August, when the hot winds blow from the coast of Anatolia.</p>
                <p>Rhodes, in addition to its fine climate, is blessed with a fertile soil, and
                    produces a variety of the finest fruits and vegetables. Numerous streams and
                    rivulets, which take their rise in the central range, water the surrounding
                    plains and valleys of the island. The inhabitants have a great taste for
                    gardens; and around the villages are extensive cultivated fields and orchards,
                    containing fig, pomegranate, and orange trees. On the sloping hills carob-trees,
                    and others both useful and agreeable, still grow abundantly; the vine also holds
                    its place, and produces a species of wine which was highly valued by the
                    ancients, though it seems to have degenerated greatly in modern times. The
                    valleys afford rich pastures, and the plains produce every species of grain; the
                    wheat is of an excellent quality; and, but for the extortions of its barbarian
                    rulers, the island might be the seat of agriculture as well as commerce, and
                    might export large quantities of corn.</p>
                <p>The commerce of the island has been of late years increasing at a rapid rate.
                    Many British manufactures are imported by indirect routes, through Smyrna,
                    Constantinople, Beyrout, and other places. Cotton stuffs, calicoes, and grey
                    linen are among the goods most in demand. It is not so much, however, the
                    peasantry of the island who use these British goods, for they prefer their own
                    homemade stuffs; but they are exported to the neighbouring coast of Anatolia,
                    between Budrum and Adalia, and thence conveyed into the interior. The expansion
                    of the trade has been very much owing to the establishment of steam navigation
                    direct to the island, which is now visited regularly by French and Austrian
                    steamers, as well as by some from England to Smyrna.</p>
                <p>The only town of any importance in the island is the capital, Rhodes, which
                    stands at the north-east extremity. It rises in an imposing manner from the sea,
                    on a gentle slope in the form of an amphitheatre. It is surrounded with walls
                    and towers, and defended by a large moated castle of great strength. These
                    fortifications are all the work of the Knights of St John. Above them rise the
                    domes and minarets of the mosques, and the tufted stems of the palm trees, which
                    adorn this like most other Oriental towns. The interior of the city does not
                    correspond to its outward appearance. No trace exists of the splendour of the
                    ancient city, with its regular streets, well-ordered plan, and numerous public
                    buildings. The modern city of Rhodes is in general the work of the Knights of St
                    John, and has altogether a mediaeval aspect, the streets being for the most part
                    narrow and winding, though the houses, as well as the public edifices, are in
                    general solidly built of stone, and present at almost every step some memorial
                    of the past in the escutcheons and coats of arms with which they are adorned.
                    The picturesque fortifications also by which 'the city is surrounded remain
                    almost unaltered as they were in the 15th century, and it has been remarked by
                    numerous travellers that scarcely any city of western Europe has preserved its
                    mediaeval aspect so unchanged as this last refuge of European civilization in
                    the East. The principal buildings which remain are the church of St John, which
                    is become the principal mosque; the hospital, whence the charity of the knights
                    was liberally dispensed to the faithful from all quarters of the world, and
                    which has been transformed into public granaries; the palace of the grand
                    master, now the residence of the pasha; and the senate-house, which still
                    contains some marbles and ancient columns. Of the streets, the best and widest
                    is a long street which is still called the Street of the Knights. It is
                    perfectly straight, and formed of old houses, on which remain the armorial
                    bearings of the members of the order. On some of these buildings are still seen
                    the arms of the popes and of some of the royal and noble houses of Europe.</p>
                <p>The only relics of classical antiquity are the numerous inscribed altars and
                    bases of statues, as well as architectural fragments, which are found scattered
                    in the courtyards and gardens of the houses in the extensive suburbs which now
                    surround the town, the whole of which were comprised within the limits of the
                    ancient city. The foundations also of the moles that separate the harbours are
                    of Hellenic work, though the existing moles were erected by the Knights of St
                    John.</p>
                <p>Rhodes has at present two harbours. The least of these lies towards the east, and
                    its entrance is obstructed by a barrier of rocks, so as to admit the entrance of
                    but one ship at a time. It is sufficiently sheltered, but by the negligence of
                    the Turks the sand has been suffered to accumulate until it has been gradually
                    almost choked up. The other harbour is larger, and also in a bad condition; here
                    frigates of thirty guns may anchor, and are sheltered from the west <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n545/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0545-0526"/>winds, though they are exposed to the north and
                    north-east winds. The two harbours are separated by a mole which runs obliquely
                    into the sea. At the eastern entrance is the fort of St Elmo, with a lighthouse;
                    but the light is very feeble, and visible only a few miles.</p>
                <p>History.—The numerous poetical legends current among the Greeks with respect to
                    Rhodes bear testimony to the importance which it attained in very early times.
                    Of these the most familiar is that celebrated by Pindar in one of the most
                    beautiful of his odes (Ok vii.), according to which the island was raised from
                    the depths of the sea by Helios, the god of the sun, who always continued to be
                    its tutelary deity, and whose image is found upon all its coins. The poet as
                    usual derives its name from a nymph Rhoda, but there is no doubt that it was
                    really derived from f&gt;6Sοv, a rose, the symbol that invariably accompanies
                    the head of Helios on its coins. Another set of legends connected it with the
                    Telchines, a mythical people celebrated for their skill as workers in bronze and
                    other metals, while another version of the same tale represented these Telchines
                    as themselves expelled by the Heliadae, who became the first introducers of
                    civilization. It is not improbable that both traditions had some reference to
                    the Phoenicians, who may well have been the first to establish settlements in an
                    island that lay so directly on their way to the Aegean. But the first record
                    that can claim anything like an historical character is that of the occupation
                    of the island by a body of Doric emigrants from the Peloponnesus, who founded
                    the three cities of Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus, which long continued to divide
                    the island among them, and together with those of Cos, Cnidus, and Halicarnassus
                    formed the Doric Hexapolis or league of six cities. These cities, like the more
                    important Ionic confederacy, had a common sanctuary on the Triopian Promontory
                    near Cnidus, but they do not appear to have formed a political union, though the
                    distinct predominance in them all of the Doric element would naturally lead to a
                    community of interest as well as of feeling. Nothing is known of their history
                    for several centuries, during which they appear to have developed a remarkable
                    amount of maritime power and enterprise, and became the founders of numerous
                    colonies in distant parts of the Mediterranean, including Gela in Sicily, as
                    well as Rhoda on the coast of Spain, and Salapia on the Adriatic coast of Italy.
                    Towards the east also they were the recognized founders of Corydallaand Phaselis
                    in Lyciaand Soli in Cilicia.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these evidences of early prosperity and power, we meet with very
                    scanty notices of the Rhodian cities in the first</p>
                <p>Eeriod of Greek history. After the Persian War they appear to ave passed into the
                    condition of tributaries to Athens, and were compelled as such to join in the
                    Athenian expedition to Sicily, but in 412 B.C. they deserted the Athenian cause
                    and joined that of the Peloponnesians. It was shortly after this (in 408) that
                    they adopted a resolution which became the foundation of their future greatness,
                    the inhabitants of the three cities having agreed to abandon their homes and
                    found a new city on the site which has ever since continued to be the capital of
                    the island.</p>
                <p>The architect was Hippodamus of Miletus, who had planned and embellished the
                    Piraeus at Athens; and the new city soon became one of the most splendid in the
                    world, adorned with magnificent buildings and exquisite works of art. When Conon
                    and his fleet restored the Athenian power by his victory off Cnidus (394 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), Rhodes again embraced the victorious cause; but her
                    fidelity during the subsequent contests was not very great. Sparta afterwards
                    received the allegiance of the island; and in the Social War (357-5) it joined
                    the alliance against Athens, and, with the assistance of the Carian monarch
                    Mausolus, succeeded in achieving independence. But, finding the power of that
                    king dangerous to their liberties, the Rhodians once more sued for the Athenian
                    protection, which they obtained through the eloquence of Demosthenes. But
                    neither they nor the rest of Greece could resist the overwhelming power of
                    Macedonia, though Memnon, a Rhodian, was one of the ablest generals under the
                    last Persian king, and attempted to check the career of Alexander. Rhodes
                    received a Macedonian garrison; but it was expelled after the death of
                    Alexander, and a resolute resistance was begun to the Macedonian power. This
                    formed one of the most illustrious periods in the history of the island. The
                    capital was besieged in 304 b. c. by Demetrius Poliorcetes, with a large army
                    and a complete train of the artillery of that age. Although a breach was
                    effected in the walls, the desperate valour of the defenders foiled all the
                    attempts to carry it by assault, and cost the besiegers the lives of some of
                    their generals and a great number of their soldiers. This heroic resistance
                    obtained for the Rhodians great renown; and the period which followed was one of
                    the most brilliant in the history of the city. They enjoyed the friendship of
                    Rome, and obtained possession of some of the adjacent islands and coasts,
                    including a considerable district on the mainland which was known as the Rhodian
                    I’eraea. For arts as well as arms the island was then renowned; the Rhodian
                    laws, especially on maritime affairs, were reckoned the best in antiquity, and
                    many of them adopted into the Roman code. Aescliines, who had contended in
                    eloquence with the greatest of orators, opened a school of rhetoric here, which
                    became the parent of a new school of oratory, regarded by the ancients as
                    possessing a Graeco-Asiatic character. Protogenes embellished the city λvith his
                    paintings, and Chares of Lindus with the celebrated colossal statue. The
                    Colossus, erroneously supposed to have occupied a position striding over the
                    entrance to the harbour, stood for fifty-six years, till an earthquake
                    prostrated it in 224 b.c. Its enormous fragments continued to excite wonder in
                    the time of Pliny, and were not removed till 656 A.n., when Rhodes was conquered
                    by the Saracens, who sold the remains for old metal to a dealer who employed
                    nine hundred camels to carry them away. Besides this not less than three
                    thousand statues are said to have adorned the city, which was said by Strabo to
                    surpass all others in beauty and ornamental character. Being the sovereigns of
                    the seas, the Rhodians by their fleets rendered good service to Rome, with w <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> hom they were in alliance, and retained their
                    independence for a long time. The severest blow they suffered was from Cassius
                    in 42 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> who plundered the island even to the bare
                    temple walls in the nominal cause of liberty, for it had embraced the side of
                    Caesar. Under the empire the liberty of Rhodes was repeatedly permitted and
                    withdrawn according to the caprice of the sovereign; but ultimately it became a
                    part of the Roman empire, and, after its partition, of the Eastern, till 616
                    a.d., when Chosroes the Persian obtained possession of it for a short time. It
                    was subsequently conquered by Moawiyah, one of Othman’s generals; but, recovered
                    by the Byzantine empire, it proved the last of their Asiatic possessions that
                    succumbed to the infidel. In 1308 it was granted by the emperor Emmanuel to the
                    Knights of St John, who soon after resisted a siege by the sultan Othman. They
                    strengthened the natural advantages of the place by skilful fortifications, and
                    by discipline and equipments made themselves nearly a match for the superior
                    numbers of the Turks. Nor did the knights restrict their efforts to
                    self-defence; they conquered Smyrna, and established an outpost there in 1344,
                    and at a later period formed a league against the common enemy of Christendom.
                    But in 1401 Smyrna was taken by Timur; in 1480 Mohammed II. besieged Rhodes with
                    a vast train of artillery; and, though then averted by the courage of its few
                    defenders, the downfall of the place could not long be delayed. The last and
                    most famous siege of Rhodes took place in 1522, when, after a desperate
                    resistance for four months to the overwhelming numbers of the Ottomans, the
                    knights, being left unassisted by all the European pow <hi rend="superscript"
                    >τ</hi> ers, capitulated on honourable terms, and evacuated the island. On the
                    first day of 1523 »Villiers de Lisle Adam, the grandmaster, embarked the last of
                    the small band, carrying away all the property of the order, and leaving the
                    ruins of their city to the enemy. The knights subsequently settled in Malta,
                    where they also gained great renown. Rhodes has since been in the possession of
                    the Turks, and is now the residence of the pasha of the Archipelago. The sites
                    of Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus, which in the most ancient times were the
                    principal tow <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ns of the island, are clearly
                    marked, and the first of the three is still occupied by a small town with a
                    mediaeval castle, both of them dating from the time of the knights, though the
                    castle occupies the site of the ancient acropolis, of the w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> alls of which considerable remains are still visible.
                    There are no ruins of any importance on the site of either Ialysus or Camirus,
                    but excavations at the latter place have produced valuable and interesting
                    results in the way of ancient vases and other antiquities, which are now in the
                    British Museum.</p>
                <p>The population of the island is estimated at about 27,000, of whom 6000 are
                    Turks, 3000 Jews, and the remainder Greeks. Of these nearly 20,000 are cortained
                    in the city and its suburbs; the rest of the island is very thinly peopled,
                    though numerous small villages are scattered over its whole extent.</p>
                <p>A large mass of matter relating to the ancient history and institutions of Rhodes
                    are collected by Meursius in his dissertation <hi rend="italic">(Opera,</hi>
                    vol. iii.)∙, the present condition of the island, and the objects of interest
                    still visible there, are fully described by Ross <hi rend="italic">(Reisen auf
                    den Griechischen Inseln,</hi> vol. iii., Stuttgart, 1840) and Newton <hi
                    rend="italic">(Travels and Discoveries in the Levant,</hi> vol. i., London,
                    1865). The inscriptions that have been discovered there, which are very
                    numerous, have unfortunately been published in a very irregular manner, and are
                    scattered through a number of works, many of them not easy of access. By far the
                    most complete collection of all that relates to the ancient condition of the
                    island, as well as its history and antiquities, will be found in a treatise by
                    Mr C. Torr, entitled <hi rend="italic">Rhodes in Ancient Times,</hi> which is
                    passing through the Cambridge University Press while this article has been in
                    preparation. (E. II. B.)</p>
