                    Byron, the “memory Rogers” of the general reader, has a unique reputation among
                    English men of letters. Not only was he a poet of sufficient mark to be hailed
                    by Byron—with perverse but sincere admiration— as one of the few men of genuine
                    weight in an age of <pb break="no"

                    the most celebrated entertainer of celebrities in London. From 1803, when he
                    removed from his chambers in the Temple, till the last year of his long life,
                    his house, 22 St James’s Place, was the common meeting-ground of men of
                    distinction in every walk of life. Hence, though his poems are no longer read
                    except by the student, his name is kept alive in the letters and diaries of
                    associates whose works are more permanent than his own,—kept alive, too, not
                    merely as that of a cultured Amphitryon but as that of a conversational wit
                    whose tart sayings are worthy of record.</p>
                <p>He was born at Newington Green (London) on 30th July 1763, the son of a wealthy
                    London banker, and related on the mother’s side to the celebrated Nonconformist
                    divines Philip and Matthew Henry. Dr Price, the Unitarian, Burke’s antagonist,
                    was the family pastor and a frequent visitor at his father’s house. The
                    influence of this writer’s philosophy can be traced in Rogers’s poems. Rogers
                    was educated at the famous Nonconformist academy at Newington Green, where Defoe
                    had been a pupil a hundred years before. Attention to English studies had been a
                    distinct object in this school from its foundation, and Rogers, his youthful
                    ambition awakened, rushed into print as an essayist in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gentleman's Magazine</hi> at the age of eighteen. His main desire then was
                    to be a preacher like Dr Price; but he yielded to his father’s advice and
                    entered the paternal bank. But he was far from abandoning his love for
                    literature. He read Gray and Goldsmith on his way to the bank, and in 1786
                    proved his admiration for these exemplars in a volume containing some pretty
                    imitations of Goldsmith and a wildly apostrophic <hi rend="italic">Ode to
                        Superstition</hi> after the manner of Gray. This volume contains one of the
                    few passages of his that are often quoted—</p>
                <p>“There ’s such a charm in melancholy,</p>
                <p>I would not, if I could, be gay.”</p>
                <p>Following Gray’s example, the youthful poet took great pains with his verses,
                    and, after nine years’ maturing, published in 1792 a more elaborate and more
                    successful bid for poetic laurels, <hi rend="italic">The Pleasures of
                        Memory.</hi> This poem may be regarded as the last blaze of the poetic
                    diction of the 18th century before its final extinction. We see here carried to
                    the extremest pitch the theory of elevating and refining familiar themes by
                    abstract treatment and noble imagery. So simple an act as that of trying to
                    remember a half-forgotten fact or fancy is elaborately and beautifully compared
                    to the search of an impatient mother for a child lost in a forest. The common
                    organ-grinder becomes “the blithe son of Savoy,” and as such is presented in a
                    most romantic situation as an object for refined sympathy. The good familiar
                    creature memory itself is transfigured into a gracious personification of most
                    benignant and wide-reaching power. In this art of “raising a subject,” as the
                    18th century phrase was, the <hi rend="italic">Pleasures of Memory</hi> is much
                    more perfect than Campbell’s <hi rend="italic">Pleasures of Hope,</hi> published
                    a few years later in imitation. Byron’s criticism is complete,—“there is not a
                    vulgar line in the poem.” This is the acme of positive praise for the
                    fashionable serious poetry of the 18th century: when this can be said of a poet,
                    he has reached the perfection of its ideal of poetic diction. In this poem the
                    characters of the school can be analysed in cold blood, for there is not much
                    excitement in laboured reflexions on the pleasures of memory. Human interest is
                    at a minimum in such frigid exercises; it is almost entirely an affair of
                    diction. The chief feeling excited is astonishment at the pains taken by the
                    poet to provide thick and showy wrappages for such starveling little children of
                    thought.</p>
                <p>It was six years before Rogers was ready with another of his elaborate poems,—
                        <hi rend="italic">An Epistle to a Emend</hi> (1798). This has at least the
                    advantage of some personal interest. It describes the poet’s ideal of a
                    comfortable life, and may be put side by side with Pomfret’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Choice</hi> for literary comparison, and with the poet’s own life for fifty
                    years afterwards. Although for conventional poetic reasons Rogers establishes
                    his ideal house in the country instead of in St James’s Place, still the
                    principles of living are the same which afterwards regulated his real life and
                    were carried out with easy steady perseverance. “It is the design of this
                    Epistle to illustrate the virtue of True Taste; and to show how little she
                    requires to secure not only the comforts but even the elegancies of life. True
                    Taste is an excellent Economist.” Rogers illustrated this maxim in proceeding to
                    surround himself with rare and beautiful works of art and letters, and to make
                    his house the centre for all that was most distinguished and agreeable in London
                    society. Many persons in his time spent ten times as much in the pursuit of a
                    similar object without one-tenth of the success. “I believe,” Mrs Norton wrote,
                    “no man ever was so much attended to and thought of who had so slender a fortune
                    and such calm abilities. His God was Harmony; and over his life Harmony presided
                    sitting on a lukewarm cloud.” When he moved to St James’s Place in 1803 he
                    withdrew from active concern in the bank, contenting himself with a moderate
                    income as a sleeping partner; and so careful a manager was he of this income
                    that he was able not only to entertain and to buy choice things—his collection,
                    which seems to have contained hardly a particle of rubbish, fetching &lt;£50,000
                    when sold after his death—but also to extend generous help to struggling men of
                    letters. It was Rogers who came to Sheridan’s relief in his last days when he
                    was deserted by his titled friends; Moore and Campbell received help in need
                    from him, as munificent as it was delicately offered; and he was always ready to
                    befriend much less distinguished merit in distress. It was perhaps
                    characteristic of a man so cautious, equable, and dispassionate that his wit had
                    a depreciating turn and was often exercised with calm insolence at the expense
                    of fussy pretence. But that the man was on the whole of a kindly and lovable
                    nature was shown by an incident late in his life. His popularity was put to the
                    test of misfortune by the robbery of his bank. Most of the money was recovered,
                    but upon the news of the misfortune several men of wealth and title came forward
                    with large offers of assistance.</p>
                <p>Although the laureateship was pressed upon Rogers by the prince consort on
                    Wordsworth’s death in 1850, he had not been a prolific poet during his long life
                    of cultured leisure and social enjoyment. He continued his practice of writing
                    little and writing slowly. Fourteen years intervened between the <hi
                        rend="italic">Epistle</hi> and the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Voyage of Columbus</hi> in 1812. In method this poem was a compromise
                    between the old school of reflective poetry and the new school of narrative. The
                    story of Columbus was the theme, but the story was not told: it was only
                    indicated in a series of reflexions on its most striking moments. The experiment
                    helped forward the literary movement; the new school through Byron took the
                    hint, and <hi rend="italic">The Giaour,</hi> though interpenetrated with a more
                    vigorous life, was avowedly written on the model of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Columbus,</hi> and dedicated to Rogers. In his next poem, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Jacqueline,</hi> which was published in the same volume with Byron’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Lara</hi> in 1814, much to the benefit of the wits of the
                    time, Rogers may be said to have gone over to the new school, adopting their
                    four-accent measure and showing his skill, which was considerable, in pure
                    narrative. His reflective poem on <hi rend="italic">Human Life,</hi> though
                    published in 1819, can hardly be described as a reversion, for he had been
                    engaged on it off and on for twelve years. It is <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n645/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0920-0645-0622"/>much the best of his meditative poems, as
                    elegant and finished in diction as the <hi rend="italic">Memory,</hi> and much
                    more incisive in thought and touching in sentiment. His last, longest, and most
                    interesting published work was <hi rend="italic">Italy,</hi> the first
                    instalment of which was published in 1821 and the last in 1834. It is said that,
                    when the publisher complained that the public would not buy <hi rend="italic"
                        >Italy,</hi> Rogers affirmed that lie “would make them buy it”; and, calling
                    in the aid of Turner and Stothard, he produced the sumptuous illustrated edition
                    at a cost of £15,000. Apart from these adventitious charms <hi rend="italic"
                        >Italy</hi> has much greater general interest than any other of Rogers’s
                    poems, and is likely to be read for long, if only as a traveller’s companion.
                    The style is studiously simple; the blank verse has quite an Elizabethan
                    flavour, and abounds in happy lines; the reflexions have a keen point; and the
                    incidental stories are told with admirable brevity and effect. Passages of prose
                    are interspersed, wrought with the same care as the verses, and the notes are
                    models of interesting detail concisely put.</p>
                <p>For the last five years of his life Rogers, who had been extremely active till
                    his eighty-eighth year, was confined to his chair in consequence of a fall in
                    the street. He died in London on 18th December 1855, in his ninety-third year.
                    Only very fragmentary records are preserved of the brilliant gatherings at
                    breakfast and dinner in his house. Fragments are to be gleaned in the diaries of
                    Byron, Moore, Sydney Smith, and others. <hi rend="italic">Recollections</hi> of
                    his table-talk were published in 1856, and a volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Recollections</hi> of celebrities in 1857. A complete <hi rend="italic"
                        >Life</hi> is understood (1885) to be in preparation, with Mr P. W. Clayden
                    as editor. Mr Hayward’s essay is the most complete account of Rogers hitherto
                    published. (w. M.)</p>
