                    warmth experienced is considerable; but it becomes intolerable when the hand is
                    held at the same distance <hi rend="italic">abeyve</hi> the ball. Even this rude
                    form of experiment is sufficient to show that two processes of cooling are
                    simultaneously at work,—one which apparently leads to the loss of heat in all
                    directions indifferently, another which leads to a special loss in a vertical
                    direction upwards. If the experiment is made in a dark room, into which a ray of
                    sunlight is admitted so as to throw a shadow of the ball on a screen, we see
                    that the column of air above the ball also casts a distinct shadow. It is, in
                    fact, a column of air very irregularly heated by contact with the ball, and
                    rising, in obedience to hydrostatic laws, in the colder and denser air around
                    it. This conveyance of heat by the motion of the heated body itself is called
                    <hi rend="italic">convection;</hi> the process by which heat is lost
                    indifferently in all directions is called <hi rend="italic">radiation.</hi>
                    These two processes are entirely different in their nature, laws, and mechanism;
                    but we have to treat of both in the present article.</p>
                <p>2. To illustrate how the third method by which heat can be transferred, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">conduction</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat,</hi> vol. xi. p.
                    577), is involved in this process, let the cannon ball (which for this purpose
                    should be a large one) be again heated and at once immersed in water until it
                    just ceases to be luminous in the dark, and then be immediately hung up in the
                    air. After a short period it again becomes red-hot all over, and the phenomenon
                    then proceeds precisely as before, except that the surface of the ball does not
                    become so hot as it was before being plunged in the water. This form of
                    experiment, which requires that the interior shall be very considerably cooled
                    before the surface ceases to be self-luminous, does not succeed nearly so well
                    with a copper ball as with an iron one, on account of the comparatively high
                    conductivity of copper. In fact, even when its surface is covered with
                    lamp-black, to make the loss by radiation as great as possible, the difference
                    of temperature between the centre and the surface of a very hot copper
                    ball—which is only an inch or two in diameter—is inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>3. In conduction there is passage of heat from hotter to colder parts of the same
                    body; in convection an irregularly heated fluid becomes hydrostatically
                    unstable, and each part carries its heat with it to its new position. In both
                    processes heat is conveyed from place to place. But it is quite otherwise with
                    radiation. That a body cools in consequence of radiation is certain; that other
                    bodies which absorb the radiation are thereby heated is also certain; but it
                    does not at all follow that what passes in the radiant form is heat. To return
                    for a moment to the red-hot cannon ball. If, while the hand is held below it, a
                    thick but dry ])late of rock-salt is interposed between the ball and the hand
                    there is no perceptible diminution of warmth, and the temperature of the salt is
                    not perceptibly raised by the radiation which passes through it. When a piece
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n230/mode/1up"

                    burning-glass it can be employed to inflame tinder by concentrating the sun’s
                    rays, and the lens does the work nearly as rapidly as if it had been made of
                    glass. It is certainly not what we ordinarily call “heat” which can be
                    transmitted under conditions like these. Radiation is undoubtedly a transference
                    of energy, which was in the form commonly called heat in the radiating body, and
                    becomes heat in a body which absorbs it; but it is transformed as it leaves the
                    first body, and retransformed when it is absorbed by the second. Until the
                    comparatively recent full recognition of the conservation and transformation of
                    energy it was almost impossible to form precise ideas on matters like this; and,
                    consequently, we find in the writings even of men like Prévost and Sir J. Leslie
                    notions of the wildest character as to the mechanism of radiation. Leslie,
                    strangely, regarded it as a species of “pulsation” in the air, in some respects
                    analogous to sound, and propagated with the same speed as sound. Prévost, on the
                    other hand, says, “Le calorique est un fluide discret; chaque élément de
                    calorique suit constamment la même ligne droite, tant qu’aucun obstacle ne
                    l’arrête. Dans un espace chaud, chaque point est traversé sans cesse en tout
                    sens uar des filets de calorique.”</p>
                <p>4. The more intensely the cannon ball is heated the more luminous does it become,
                    and also the more nearly white is the light which it gives out. So well is this
                    known that in almost all forms of civilized speech there are terms corresponding
                    to our <hi rend="italic">“</hi> red-hot,” <hi rend="italic">“</hi> white-hot,”
                    &amp;c. As another instance, suppose a powerful electric current is made to pass
                    through a stout iron wire. The wire becomes gradually hotter, up to a certain
                    point, at which the loss by radiation and convection just balances the gain of
                    heat by electric resistance. And as it becomes hotter the amount of its
                    radiation increases, till at a definite temperature it becomes just visible in
                    the dark by red rays of low refrangibility. As it becomes still hotter the whole
                    radiation increases; the red rays formerly given off become more luminous, and
                    are joined by others of higher refrangibility. This process goes on, the whole
                    amount of radiation still increasing, each kind of visible light becoming more
                    intense, and new rays of light of higher refrangibility coming in, until the
                    whole becomes white, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi> ., gives off all the more
                    efficient kinds of visible light in much the same relative proportion as that in
                    which they exist in sunlight. When the circuit is broken, exactly the same
                    phenomena occur in the reverse order, the various kinds of light disappearing
                    later as their refrangibility is less. But the radiation continues, growing
                    weaker every instant, even after the whole is dark. This simple observation
                    irresistibly points to the conclusion that the so-called “radiant heat” is
                    precisely the same phenomenon as “light,” only the invisible rays are still less
                    refrangible than the lowest red, and that our sense of sight is confined to rays
                    of a certain definite range of refrangibility, while the sense of touch comes in
                    where sight fails us. Sir W. Herschel in 1798, by placing the bulb of a
                    thermometer in the solar spectrum formed by a flint-glass prism, found that the
                    highest temperature was in the dark region outside the lowest visible red,—a
                    result amply verified at the time by others, though warmly contested by
                    Leslie.</p>
                <p>5. This striking conclusion is not without close analogies in connexion with the
                    other senses, especially that of hearing. Thus it has long been known that the
                    <hi rend="italic">“</hi> range of hearing” differs considerably in different
                    individuals, some, for instance, being painfully affected by the chirp of a
                    cricket, which is inaudible to others whose general hearing is quite as good.
                    Extremely low notes, on the other hand, of whose existence we have ample
                    dynamical evidence, are not heard by any one <hi rend="italic">;</hi> when
                    perceived at all they are <hi rend="italic">felt.</hi></p>
                <p>6. We may now rapidly run over the principal facts characteristic of the
                    behaviour of visible rays (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Light),</hi> and point out
                    how far each has been found to characterize that of so-called “radiant heat”
                    under similar conditions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Rectilinear propagation: an opaque screen which is
                    placed so as to intercept the sun’s light intercepts its heat also, whether it
                    be close to the observer, at a few miles from him (as a cloud or a mountain), or
                    240,000 miles off (as the moon in a total eclipse). ( <hi rend="italic">b</hi> )
                    Speed of propagation: this must be of the same order of magnitude, at least, for
                    both phenomena, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 186,000 miles or so per second; for
                    the sun’s heat ceases to be perceptible the moment an eclipse becomes total, and
                    is perceived again the instant the edge of the sun’s disk is visible, (c)
                    Reflexion: the law must be exactly the same, for the heat-producing rays from a
                    star are concentrated by Lord Rosse’s great reflector along with its light. (
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> ) Refraction: when a lens is not achromatic its
                    principal focus for red rays is farther off than that for blue rays; that for
                    dark heat is still farther off. Herschel’s determination of the warmest region
                    of the spectrum (§ 4 above) is another case in point. ( <hi rend="italic"
                    >e)</hi> Oblique radiation: an illuminated or a self-luminous surface appears
                    equally bright however it is inclined to the line of sight. The radiation of
                    heat from a hot blackened surface (through an aperture which it appears to fill)
                    is sensibly the same however it be inclined (Leslie, Fourier, Mellon!). (/)
                    Intensity: when there is no absorption by the way the intensity of the light
                    received from a luminous point-source is inversely as the square of the
                    distance. The same is true of dark heat. But this is not a new analogy; it is a
                    mere consequence of <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> rectilinear propagation, <hi
                    rend="italic">(g)</hi> Selective absorption: light which has been sifted by
                    passing through one plate of blue glass passes in much greater percentage
                    through a second plate of the same glass, and in still greater percentage
                    through a third. The same is true of radiant heat, even when the experiment is
                    made with uncoloured glass; for clear glass absorbs certain colours of dark heat
                    more than others (De Laroche, Melloni). <hi rend="italic">(h)</hi> Interference
                    bands, whether produced by two mirrors or by gratings, characterize dark heat as
                    well as light; only they indicate longer waves (Fizeau and Foucault), <hi
                    rend="italic">(i)</hi> Polarization and double refraction: with special
                    apparatus, such as plates of mica split by heat into numerous parallel films,
                    the polarization of dark heat is easily established. When two of these bundles
                    are so placed as to intercept the heat, an unsplit film of mica interposed
                    between them allows the heat to pass, or arrests it, as it is made to rotate in
                    its own plane (Forbes), <hi rend="italic">(j)</hi> By proper chemical
                    adjustments photographs of a region of the solar spectrum beyond the visible red
                    have been obtained (Abney). We might mention more, but those given above, when
                    considered together, are conclusive. In fact <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">(i)</hi> alone would almost settle the question.</p>
                <p>7. But there is a superior as well as an inferior limit of visible rays. Light
                    whose period of vibration is too small to produce any impression on the optic
                    nerve can be degraded by fluorescence (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Light)</hi> into
                    visible rays, and can also be detected by its energetic action on various
                    photographic chemicals. In fact photographic portraits can be taken in a room
                    which appears absolutely dark to the keenest eyesight. By one or other of these
                    processes the solar spectrum with its dark lines and the electric arc with its
                    bright lines have been delineated to many times the length of their visible
                    ranges. The electric arc especially gives (in either of these ways) a spectrum
                    of extraordinary length; for we can examine it, as we can <hi rend="italic"
                    >not</hi> examine sunlight, before it has suffered any sensible absorption.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n231/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0231-0214"/>
                <p>8. Thus radiation is one phenomenon, and (as we shall find) the spectrum of a <hi
                    rend="italic">black body</hi> (a conception roughly realized in the carbon poles
                    of an electric lamp) is continuous from the longest possible wave-length to the
                    shortest which it is hot enough to emit. These various groups of rays, however,
                    are perceived by us in very different ways, whether by direct impressions of
                    sense or by the different modes in which they effect physical changes or
                    transformations. The only way as yet known to us of treating them all alike is
                    to convert their energy into the heat-form and measure it as such. This we can
                    do in a satisfactory manner by the thermo-electric pile and galvanometer.</p>
                <p>9. Of the history of the gradual development of the theory of radiation we can
                    give only the main features. The apparent concentration of cold by a concave
                    mirror, which had been long before observed by Porta, was rediscovered by
                    Pictet, and led to the extremely important enunciation of the Law of Exchanges
                    by Prévost in 1791. As we have already seen, Prévost’s idea of the nature of
                    radiation was a corpuscular one, no doubt greatly influenced in this direction
                    by the speculations of Lesage (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Atom).</hi> But the
                    value of his theory as a concise statement of facts and a mode of co-ordinating
                    them is not thereby materially lessened. We give his own statements in the
                    following close paraphrase, in which the italics are retained, from sect. ix. of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Du Calorique Rayonnant</hi> (Geneva, 1809).</p>
                <p>“1. Free caloric is a radiant fluid. And because caloric becomes free at the
                    surfaces of bodies <hi rend="italic">every point of the surface of a body is a

                    fifth consequences [above], and they might thus be subjected to a new test. It
                    is scarcely necessary to point out here the precautions requisite to guard
                    against illusory results of all kinds in this matter.”</p>
                <p>10. There the matter rested, so far as theory is concerned, for more than half a
                    century. Leslie and, after him, many others added fact by fact, up to the time
                    of De la Provostaye and Desains, whose experiments pointed to a real improvement
                    of the theory in the form of specialization. But, though such experiments
                    indicated, on the whole, a proportionality between the radiating and absorbing
                    powers of bodies and a diminution of both in the case of highly reflecting
                    surfaces, the anomalies frequently met with (depending on the then unrecognized
                    colour-differences of various radiations) prevented any grand generalization.
                    The first real step of the general theory, in advance of what Prévost had
                    achieved, and it was one of immense import, was made by Balfour Stewart in 1858.
                    Before we take it up, however, we may briefly consider Prévost’s statements,
                    putting aside his erroneous views as to the nature of heat; and we must also
                    introduce some results of the splendid investigations of Sadi Carnot (1824),
                    which cast an entirely new light on the whole subject of heat.</p>
                <p>11. Prévost’s leading idea was that all bodies, whether cold or hot, are
                    constantly radiating heat. This of itself was a very great step. It is
                    distinctly enunciated in the term “exchange” which he employs. And from the way
                    in which he introduces it it is obvious that he means (though he does not
                    expressly say so) that the radiation from a body depends on its own nature and
                    temperature alone, and is independent altogether of the nature and temperature
                    of any adjacent body. This also was a step in advance, and of the utmost value.
                    It will be seen later that Prévost was altogether wrong in his assumption of the
                    geometrical rate of adjustment of differences of temperature,—a statement
                    originally made by Newton, but true only approximately, and even so for very
                    small temperature differences alone. Newton in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Queries</hi> to the third book of his <hi rend="italic">Optics</hi> distinctly
                    recognizes the propagation of heat from a hot body to a cold one by the
                    vibrations of an intervening medium. But he says nothing as to bodies of the
                    same temperature.</p>
                <p>12. To Carnot we owe the proposition that <hi rend="italic">the thermal motivity
                    of a system cannot he increased by internal actions.</hi> A system in which all
                    the parts are at the same temperature has no thermal motivity, for bodies at
                    different temperatures are required in order to work a heat-engine, so as to
                    convert part of their heat into work. Hence, if the contents of an enclosure
                    which is impervious to heat are at any instant at one and the same temperature,
                    no changes of temperature can take place among them. This is certainly true so
                    far as our modes of measurement are concerned, because the particles of matter
                    (those of a gas, for instance) are excessively small in comparison with the
                    dimensions of any of our forms of apparatus for measuring temperatures.
                    Something akin to this statement has often been assumed as a direct result of
                    experiment: <hi rend="italic">a number of bodies</hi><hi rend="italic">(of any
                    kinds</hi> ) <hi rend="italic">within the same impervious enclosure</hi> , <hi
                    rend="italic">which contains no source of heat</hi> , <hi rend="italic">will
                    ultimately acquire the same temperature.</hi> This form is more general than
                    that above, inasmuch as it involves considerations of dissipation of energy.
                    Either of them, were it strictly true, would suffice for our present purpose.
                    But neither statement can be considered as rigorously true. We may employ them,
                    however, in our reasoning as true in the statistical sense; but we must not be
                    surprised if we should find that the assumption of their rigorous truth may in
                    some special cases lead us to theoretical results which are inconsistent with
                    experimental facts,— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if we should find that
                    deviations from an average, which are on far too minute a scale to be directly
                    detected by any of our most delicate instruments, may be seized upon and
                    converted into observable phenomena by some of the almost incomparably more
                    delicate systems which we call individual particles of matter.</p>
                <p>13. The next great advance was made by Balfour Stewart. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Trans. Ii. S. E.,</hi>
                    1858; see also <hi rend="italic">Phil. Mag.,</hi> 1863, i. p. 354. </p></note>
                    The grand novelty which he introduced, and from which all his varied results
                    follow almost intuitively, is the idea of <hi rend="italic">the absolute
                    uniformity</hi><hi rend="italic">(qualitative as well as quantitative)</hi> of
                    the radiation at all points, and in all directions, within an enclosure
                    impervious to heat, when thermal equilibrium has once been arrived at. (So
                    strongly does he insist on this point that he even states that, whatever be the
                    nature of the bodies in the enclosure, the radiation there will, when
                    equilibrium is established, be that of a black body at the same temperature. He
                    does not expressly say that the proposition will still be true even if the
                    bodies can radiate, and therefore absorb, one definite wave-length only; but
                    this is a legitimate deduction from his state<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n232/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0232-0215"/>ments. To this we will recur.) His desire to
                    escape the difficulties of surface-reflexion led him to consider the radiation
                    inside an imperfectly transparent body in the enclosure above spoken of. He thus
                    arrived at an immediate proof of the existence of internal radiation, which
                    recruits the stream of radiant heat in any direction step by step precisely to
                    the amount by which it has been weakened by absorption. Thus the radiation and
                    absorption rigorously compensate one another, not merely in quantity but in
                    quality also, so that a body which is specially absorptive of one particular ray
                    is in the same proportion specially radiative of the same ray, its temperature
                    being the same in both cases. To complete the statement, all that is necessary
                    is to show how one ray may differ from another, viz., in intensity, wave-length,
                    and polarization.</p>
                <p>14. The illustrations which Stewart brought forward in support of his theory are
                    of the two following kinds. (1) He experimentally verified the existence of
                    internal radiation, to which his theory had led him. This he did by showing that
                    a thick plate of rock-salt (chosen on account of its comparative transparency to
                    heat-radiations) radiates more than a thin one at the same
                    temperature,—surrounding bodies being in this case of course at a lower
                    temperature, so that the effect should not be masked by transmission. The same
                    was found true of mica and of glass. (2) He showed that each of these bodies is
                    more opaque to radiations from a portion of its own substance than to radiation
                    in general. Then comes his conclusion, based, it will be observed, on his
                    fundamental assumption as to the nature of the equilibrium radiation in an
                    enclosure. It is merely a detailed explanation that, once equilibrium has been
                    arrived at, the consequent uniformity of radiation throughout the interior of a
                    body requires the step-by-step compensation already mentioned. And thus he
                    finally arrives at the statement that at any temperature a body’s radiation is
                    exactly the same both as to quality and quantity as that of its absorption from
                    the radiation of a black body at the same temperature. In symbolical language
                    Stewart’s proposition (extended in virtue of a principle always assumed) amounts
                    to this:—at any one temperature let <hi rend="italic">R</hi> be the radiation of
                    a black body, and <hi rend="italic">eR</hi> (where <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is
                    never greater than 1) that of any other substance, both for the same definite
                    wave-length; then the substance will, while at that temperature, absorb the
                    fraction <hi rend="italic">e</hi> of radiation of that wave-length, whatever be
                    the source from which it comes. The last clause contains the plausible
                    assumption already referred to. Stewart proceeds to show, in a very original and
                    ingenious way, that his result is compatible with the known facts of reflexion,
                    refraction, &amp;c., and arrives at the conclusion that for internal radiation
                    parallel to a plane the amount is (in isotropic bodies) proportional to the
                    refractive index. Of course, when the restriction of parallelism to a plane is
                    removed the internal radiation is found to be proportional to the square of the
                    refractive index. This obvious completion of the statement was first given by
                    Stewart himself at a somewhat later date.</p>
                <p>15. So far Stewart had restricted his work to “dark heat,” as it was then called;
                    and he says that he did so expressly in order to confine himself to rays “which
                    were universally acknowledged to produce heat by their absorption.” But he soon
                    proceeded to apply himself to luminous radiations. And here he brought forward
                    the extremely important fact that “coloured glasses invariably lose their colour
                    in the fire” when exactly at the temperature of the coals behind them, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they compensate exactly for their absorption by their
                    radiation. But a red glass when colder than the coals behind appears red, while
                    if it be hotter than they are it appears green. He also showed that a piece of
                    china or earthenware with a dark pattern on a light ground appears to have a
                    light pattern on a dark ground when it is taken out of the fire and examined in
                    a dark room. Hence he concluded that his extension of Prevost’s theory was true
                    for luminous rays also.</p>
                <p>16. In this part of the subject he had been anticipated, for Fraunhofer had long
                    ago shown that the flame of a candle when examined by a prism gives bright lines
                    <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> maxima of intensity of radiation) in the position
                    of the constituents of a remarkable double dark line <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> minima of radiation) in the solar spectrum, which he called <hi
                    rend="italic">D.</hi> Hallows Miller had afterwards more rigorously verified the
                    exact coincidence of these bright and dark lines. But Foucault <note

                    >L'Institut,</hi> 7th February 1849; see <hi rend="italic">Phil. Mag.,</hi>

                    electric arc, which shows these lines bright in its spectrum, not only
                    intensifies their blackness in the spectrum of sunlight transmitted through it,
                    but produces them as dark lines in the otherwise continuous spectrum of the
                    light from one of the carbon points, when that light is made by reflexion to
                    pass through the arc. Stokes about 1850 pointed out the true nature of the
                    connexion of these phenomena, and illustrated it by a dynamical analogy drawn
                    from sound. He stated his conclusions to Sir W. Thomson, <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Pogg. Ann.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or</hi><hi rend="italic">Phil. Mag.,</hi> 1S60. </p></note> who
                    (from 1852 at least) gave them regularly in his public lectures, always pointing
                    out that one constituent of the solar atmosphere is certainly sodium, and that
                    others are to be discovered by the coincidences of solar dark lines with bright
                    lines given by terrestrial substances rendered incandescent in the state of
                    vapour. Stokes’s analogy is based on the fact of synchronism (long ago discussed
                    by Hooke and others), viz., that a musical string is set in vibration when the
                    note to which it is tuned is sounded in its neighbourhood. Hence we have only to
                    imagine a space containing a great number of such strings, all tuned to the same
                    note. Such an arrangement would form, as it were, a medium which, when agitated,
                    would give that note, but which would be set in vibration by, and therefore
                    diminish the intensity of, that particular note in any mixed sound which passed
                    through it.</p>
                <p>17. Late in 1859 appeared Kirchhoff’s first paper on the subject. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Brit.
                    Assoc.,</hi> President’s address, 1871. </p></note> He supplied one important
                    omission in Stewart’s development of the theory by showing <hi rend="italic"
                    >why</hi> it is necessary to use as an absorbing body one colder than the source
                    in order to produce reversal of spectral lines. This we will presently consider.
                    Kirchhoff’s proof of the equality of radiating and absorbing powers is an
                    elaborate but unnecessary piece of mathematics, called for in consequence of his
                    mode of attacking the question. He chose to limit his reasoning to special
                    wave-lengths by introducing the complex mechanism of the colours of thin plates
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 608), and a consequent appeal to
                    Fourier’s theorem <hi rend="smallcaps">(Haemonic Analysis,</hi> vol. xi. p.
                    481), instead of to the obviously permissible assumption of a substance
                    imperfectly transparent for one special wave-length, but perfectly transparent
                    for all others; and he did not, as Stewart had done, carry his reasoning into
                    the interior of the body. With all its elaboration, his mode of attacking the
                    question leads us no farther than could Stewart’s. Both are ultimately based on
                    the final equilibrium of temperature in an enclosure required by Carnot’s
                    principle, and both are, as a consequence, equally inapplicable to exceptional
                    cases, such as the behaviour of fluorescent or phosphorescent substances. In
                    fact (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Thekmodynamics)</hi> Carnot’s principle is
                    established only on a statistical basis of averages, and is not necessarily true
                    when we are dealing with portions of space, which, though of essentially finite
                    dimensions, are extremely small in comparison with the sentient part of even the
                    tiniest instrument for measuring temperature.</p>

                <p>18. Kirchhoff’s addition to Stewart’s result may be given as follows. Let
                    radiation <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> of the same particular wavelength as that
                    spoken of in § 14, fall on the substance; <hi rend="italic">er</hi> of it will
                    be absorbed, and (1 <hi rend="italic">-e)r</hi> transmitted. This will be
                    recruited by the radiation of the substance itself, so that the whole amount for
                    that particular wave-length becomes (1 - <hi rend="italic">e)r</hi> + <hi
                    rend="italic">eR,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">r - e(r</hi> - <hi rend="italic"
                    >R).</hi> Thus the radiation is weakened only when <hi rend="italic"
                    >R&lt;r,</hi> a condition which requires that the source (even if it be a black
                    body) should be at a higher temperature than the absorbing substance (§ 4,
                    above). But the converse is, of course, not necessarily true. This part of the
                    subject, as well as the special work of Kirchhoff and of Bunsen, belongs
                    properly to spectrum analysis (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Spectroscopy).</hi></p>
                <p>19. From the extension of Prevost’s theory, obtained in either of the ways just
                    explained, we see at once how the constancy of the radiation in an enclosure is
                    maintained. In the neighbourhood of and perpendicular to the surfaces of a black
                    body it is wholly due to radiation, near a transparent body wholly to
                    transmission. A body which reflects must to the same extent be deficient in its
                    radiation and transmission; thus a perfect reflector can neither radiate nor
                    transmit. And a body which polarizes by reflexion must supply by radiation what
                    is requisite to render the whole radiation unpolarized. A body, such as a plate
                    of tourmaline, which polarizes transmitted light, must radiate light polarized
                    in the same plane as that which it absorbs. Kirchhoff and Stewart independently
                    gave this beautiful application.</p>
                <p>20. Empirical formulae representing more or less closely the law of cooling of
                    bodies, whether by radiation alone or by simultaneous radiation and convection,
                    have at least an historic interest. What is called Newton’s Law of Cooling was
                    employed by Fourier in his <hi rend="italic">Theorie Analytique de la
                    Chaleur.</hi> Here the rate of surface-loss was taken as proportional to the
                    excess of temperature over surrounding bodies. For small differences of
                    temperature it is accurate enough in its applications, such as to the
                    corrections for loss of heat in experimental determinations of specific heat,
                    &lt;kc., but it was soon found to give results much below the truth, even when
                    the excess of temperature was only 10° C.</p>

                    the air had been as far as possible extracted and which was maintained at a
                    constant temperature, were led to propound the exponential formula <hi
                    rend="italic">AA + B</hi> to represent the radiation from a black surface at
                    temperature <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> As this is an exponential formula, we may
                    take <hi rend="italic">t</hi> as representing absolute temperature, for the only
                    result will be a definite change of value of the constant <hi rend="italic"
                    >A.</hi> Hence if <hi rend="italic">t</hi> be the temperature of the enclosure,
                    the rate of loss of heat should be <hi rend="italic">A (aa <hi
                    rend="superscript">l</hi> °),</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ao.\u}־ <hi
                    rend="superscript">to</hi> -</hi> 1). The quantity <hi rend="italic">A</hi> was
                    found by them to depend on the nature of the radiating surface, but <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> was found to have the constant value 10077־. As the
                    approximate accuracy of this expression was verified by the experiments of De la
                    Provostaye and Desains for temperature differences up to 200° C., it may be well
                    to point out two of its consequences. (1) For a given difference of temperatures
                    the radiation is an exponential function of the lower (or of the higher)
                    temperature. (2) For a given temperature of the enclosure the radiation is as
                    (10-1(0077־, or 0(1+000380־+ . . . ), where 0 is the temperature excess of the
                    cooling body. Thus the Newtonian law gives 4 per cent, too little at 10° C. of
                    difference.</p>
                <p>22. Dulong and Petit have also given an empirical formula for the rate of loss by
                    simultaneous radiation and convection. This is of a highly artificial character,
                    the part due to radiation being as in the last section, while that due to
                    convection is independent of it, and also of the nature of the surface of the
                    cooling body. It is found to be proportional to a power of the pressure of the
                    surrounding gas (the power depending on the nature of the gas), and also to a
                    definite power of the temperature excess. The reader must be referred to French
                    treatises, especially that of Desains, for further information.</p>

                    respectively. The enclosure was blackened.</p>
                <p>24. Scanty as is our knowledge of radiation, it is not at all surprising that
                    that of convection should be almost <hi rend="italic">nil</hi> , except as
                    regards some of its practical applications. Here we have to deal with a problem
                    of hydrokinetics of a character, even in common cases, of far higher difficulty
                    than many hydrokinetic problems of which not even approximate solutions have

                    </p></note> led Stewart to some curious speculations, which a simple example
                    will easily explain. Suppose two parallel plates of the same substance,
                    perfectly transparent except to one definite wave-length, to be moving towards
                    or from one another. Each, we presume, will radiate as before, and on that
                    account cool; but the radiation which reaches either is no longer of the kind
                    which alone it can absorb, whether it come directly from the other, or is part
                    of its own or of the other’s radiation reflected from the enclosure. Hence it
                    would appear that relative motion is incompatible with temperature equilibrium
                    in an enclosure, and thus that there must be some effect analogous to resistance
                    to the motion. We may get over this difficulty if we adopt the former
                    speculation of Stewart, referred to in brackets in § 13 above. For this would
                    lead to the result that, as soon as either of the bodies has cooled, ever so
                    slightly, the radiation in the enclosure should become that belonging to a black
                    body of a slightly higher temperature than before, and thus the plates would be
                    furnished with radiation which they could at once absorb, and be gradually
                    heated to their former temperature.</p>
                <p>26. A very recent speculation, founded by Boltzmann <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Wiedemann's Ann.,</hi>
                    1884, xxii. </p></note> upon some ideas due to Bartoli, is closely connected in
                    principle with that just mentioned. This speculation is highly interesting,
                    because it leads to an expression for the amount of the whole radiation from a
                    black body in terms of its absolute temperature. Boltzmann’s investigation may
                    be put, as follows, in an exceedingly simple form. It was pointed out by Clerk
                    Maxwell, as a result of his electro-magnetic theory of light, that radiation
                    falling on the surface of a body must produce a certain pressure. It is easy to
                    see (most simply by the analogy of the virial equation, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mechanics,</hi> vol. xv. p. 719) that the measure of the pressure per square
                    unit on the surface of an impervious enclosure, in which there is thermal
                    equilibrium, must be one-third of the whole energy of radiation per cubic unit
                    of the enclosed space. We may now consider a reversible engine conveying heat
                    from one black body to another at a different temperature, by operations
                    alternately of the isothermal and the adiabatic character <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Thermodynamics),</hi> which consist in altering the volume of the en<pb

                    in it. For one of the fundamental equations gives <hi rend="italic">dE dp
                    d¿־</hi> where <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is the absolute temperature. If <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> be the pressure on unit surface, 3<hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    is the energy per unit of volume, and this equation becomes</p>
                <p>Hence it follows at once that, if the fundamental assumptions be granted, the
                    energy of radiation of a black body per unit volume of the enclosure is
                    proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. It is not a little
                    remarkable that Stefan <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Sitzungsber. d. k. Ak. in Wien,</hi> 1879. </p></note> had
                    some years previously shown that this very expression agrees more closely with
                    the experimental determinations of Dulong and Petit than does their own
                    empirical formula.</p>
                <p>27. It would appear from this expression that, if an impervious enclosure
                    containing only one black body in thermal equilibrium is separated into two
                    parts by an impervious partition, any alteration of volume of the part not
                    containing the black body will produce a corresponding alteration of the
                    radiation in its interior. It will now correspond to that of a second black
                    body, whose temperature is to that of the first in the inverse ratio of the
                    fourth roots of the volumes of the detached part of the enclosure.</p>
                <p>28. Lecher <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Wiedemann’s Ann.,</hi> 1882, xvii. </p></note> has endeavoured to
                    show that the distribution of energy among the constituents of the radiation
                    from a black body does not alter with temperature. Such a result, though
                    apparently inconsistent with many well-known facts, appears to be consistent
                    with and to harmonize many others. It accords perfectly with the notion of the
                    absolute uniformity (statistical) of the energy in an enclosure, and its being
                    exactly that of a black body, even if the contents (as in § 25) consist of a
                    body which can radiate one particular quality of light alone. And if this be the
                    case it will also follow that the intensity of radiation of any one wave-length
                    by any one body in a given state depends on the temperature in exactly the same
                    way as does the whole radiation from a black body. Unfortunately this last
                    deduction does not accord with Melloni’s results; at least the discrepance from
                    them would appear to be somewhat beyond what could fairly be set down to error
                    of experiment. But it is in thorough accordance with the common assumption (§
                    14) that the percentage absorption of any particular radiation does not depend
                    on the temperature of the source. The facts of fluorescence and phosphorescence,
                    involving the radiation of visible rays at temperatures where even a black body
                    is invisible, have not yet been dealt with under any general theory of
                    radiation; though Stokes has pointed out a dynamical explanation of a thoroughly
                    satisfactory character, they remain outside the domain of Carnot’s principle,
