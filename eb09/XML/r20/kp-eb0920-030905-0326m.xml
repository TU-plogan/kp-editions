                    private plaintiff (as the case may be) a certain sum of money, with condition to
                    be void if he shall do some particular act,— as if he shall appear at the
                    assizes, keep the peace, pay a certain debt, or the like.” The term itself means
                    that the person bound <hi rend="italic">recognizes</hi> the existence of a debt.
                    Recognizance was at one time used as a security for money lent, something in the
                    nature of a mortgage. In this sense it is practically obsolete, though it is
                    alluded to in modern Acts of Parliament, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 27 and 28
                    Yict. c. 112, by which a recognizance entered into after 29th July 1864 does not
                    bind the land until actual delivery in execution. The principal use of
                    recognizances at the present day is in chancery and criminal procedure. In
                    chancery recognizances are entered into as a form of security by certain <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n327/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0327-0310"/>persons appointed to positions of trust, such as
                    guardians or receivers. In criminal practice they affect either suspected or
                    accused persons, or witnesses. As early as 1360 the Act of 31 Edw. III. c. 1
                    empowered justices to take of all them that were not of good fame sufficient
                    surety and mainprize of their good behaviour. The wide terms of this provision
                    are not acted upon at the present day. The only recognizances of this kind
                    practically enforced are those entered into as security for keeping the peace.
                    Such recognizances are forfeited by any act tending to a breach of the peace.
                    The Criminal Law Consolidation Acts of 1861 provide that any court may on the
                    conviction of a person for an offence under any of the Acts require him in
                    addition to or in lieu of other punishment to enter into his own recognizances
                    for keeping the peace and being of good behaviour. The power to bind witnesses
                    by recognizance was originally conferred by an Act of 1554, 1 Ph. and M. c. 13.
                    Recognizances are now the usual means by which a court of summary jurisdiction
                    or a coroner binds over a prosecutor and his witnesses or an accused person and
                    his witnesses to appear at the trial. The procedure principally depends upon 7
                    Geo. IY. c. 64, 11 and 12 Vict. c. 42 (one of Jervis’s Acts), 30 and 31 Yict. c.
                    35 (Russell Gurney’s Act), 42 and 43 Yict. c. 49, s. 31 (the Summary
                    Jurisdiction Act, 1879). In proceedings in error and in appeals from courts of
                    summary jurisdiction to quarter sessions the prosecution of the appeal by the
                    appellant is secured by recognizance. In certain cases police authorities have
                    by recent statutes a limited authority to take the recognizance of accused
                    persons. Failure to comply with the conditions of recognizances leads to their
                    forfeiture. Additional facilities for the enforcing of recognizances were given
                    by the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Quarter
                    Sessions).</hi> When recognizances are forfeited they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >estreated</hi> ( <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi> ., extracted) from the records of
                    the court to be enforced against the defaulter. An appeal against an order of a
                    court of summary jurisdiction forfeiting recognizances lies to quarter sessions
                    (3 Geo. IY. c. 46). By 28 and 29 Yict. c. 104 a recognizance does not bind the
                    land in the hands of a <hi rend="italic">hona fide</hi> purchaser for valuable
                    consideration or a mortgagee unless actual execution has issued and been
                    registered in the name of the debtor at the central office of the Supreme Court
                    of Judicature. Registered recognizances are among the encumbrances for which
                    search is made on a purchase of land. By 45 and 46 Vict. c. 39 an official
                    negative of the existence of registered recognizances may be given by the proper
                    officer on application. A discharge in bankruptcy does not release the debtor
                    from a debt on a recognizance unless the Treasury certify in writing their
                    consent to his discharge (46 and 47 Yict. c. 52, s. 30). Forgery of
                    recognizances is a felony punishable by five years’ penal servitude (24 and 25
                    Yict. c. 98, s. 32).</p>
                <p>In Scotland the place of recognizances is filled by cautions; a caution in
                    law-burrows corresponds very nearly to a recognizance to keep the peace.</p>
                <p>In the United States recognizances are used for much the same purposes as in
                    England.</p>
