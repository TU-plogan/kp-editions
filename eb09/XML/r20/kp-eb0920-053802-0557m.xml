                <p><label type="entry">RICE</label>. According to Roxburgh the cultivated rice with
                    all its numerous varieties has originated from a wild plant called in India
                    Newaree or Nivara <hi rend="italic">{Oryza saliva).</hi> It is said to grow on
                    the borders of lakes in the Circars and elsewhere in India, and is also native
                    in tropical Australia. The rice plant is an annual grass with long linear
                    glabrous leaves, each provided with a long sharply-pointed ligule. The spikelets
                    are borne on a compound or branched spike, erect at first but afterwards bent
                    downwards. Each spikelet contains a solitary flower with two outer small glumes
                    and two inner, larger and folded lengthwise, the outer one of the two rather
                    larger and sometimes provided with an awn. Within these are six stamens, a hairy
                    ovary surmounted by two feathery styles which ripens into the fruit (grain), and
                    which is invested by the husk formed by the persistent glumes. The cultivated
                    varieties are extremely numerous, some kinds being adapted for marshy land,
                    others for growth on the hill-sides. The cultivators make two principal
                    divisions according as the sorts are early or late. Other subdivisions depend
                    upon the habit of the plant, the presence or absence of an awn, the colour of
                    the grain, and other particulars. Rice has been cultivated from time immemorial
                    in tropical countries. According to Stanislas Julien a ceremonial ordinance was
                    established in China by the emperor Chin-nung 2800 years <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> in accordance with which the emperor sows the rice himself while the
                    seeds of four other kinds may be sown by the princes of his family. This fact,
                    joined to other considerations, induced Alphonse de Candolle to consider rice as
                    a native of China. It was very early culti vated in India, in some parts of
                    which country, as in tro pical Australia, it is, as we have seen, indigenous. It
                    is not mentioned in the Bible, but its culture is alluded to in the Talmud.</p>
                <p>There is no evi dence of the exist ence of rice in</p>
                <p>Egyptian remains, nor is there any trace of it as a native plant among the
                    Greeks, Ro mans, or ancient</p>
                <p>Persians. There is proof of its culture in the Euphrates valley and in</p>
                <p>Syria four hundred yearsbefore Christ.</p>
                <p>Crawfurd on phi lological grounds considers that rice was introduced into Persia
                    from southern India.</p>
                <p>The Arabs carried the plant into</p>
                <p>Spain under the name “aruz,” the <hi rend="italic">arros</hi> of the Spanish, the
                    <hi rend="italic">mzo</hi> of the Italian, whence our word rice. Ricp was first
                    cultivated in Italy near Pisa in 1468. It was not introduced into Carolina until
                    1700, and then, as it is said, by accident, although at one time the southern
                    United States furnished a large proportion of the rice introduced into commerce.
                    Rice, says Crawfurd, sports into far more varieties than any of the corns
                    familiar to Europeans, for some varieties grow in the water and some on dry
                    land; some come to maturity in three months, while others take four and six
                    months to do so. The Hindus, however, are not content with such broad
                    distinctions as might be derived from these obvious sources, but have names for
                    varieties the distinctions between which are unappreciable by Europeans; besides
                    terms for this corn founded on variety, on season, and on mode of culture, the
                    grain itself bears one name in the straw, another when threshed, one name in the
                    husk and another when freed from it, and a fifth when cooked. A similar
                    abundance of terms is found in the languages of the Malay and Philippine
                    Islands. Such minute nomen <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0558-0539"/>clatures seem to point to a great antiquity in the
                    culture of this cereal.</p>
                <p>Rice constitutes one of the most important articles of food in all tropical and
                    subtropical countries, and is one of the most prolific of all crops. The rice
                    yields best on low lands subject to occasional inundations, and thus enriched by
                    alluvial deposits. Λn abundant rainfall during the growing season is also a
                    desideratum. Rice is sown broadcast, and in some districts is transplanted after
                    a fortnight or three weeks. No special rotation is followed; indeed the soil
                    best suited for rice is ill adapted for any other crop. In some cases little
                    manure is employed, but in others abundance of manure is used. No special
                    tillage is required, but weeding and irrigation are requisite. Rice in the husk
                    is known as “paddy.” On cutting across a grain of rice and examining it under
                    the microscope, first the flattened and dried cells of the husk are seen, and
                    then one or two layers of cells elongated in a direction parallel to the length
                    of the seed, which contain the gluten or nitrogenous matter. Within these, and
                    forming by far the largest part of the seed, are large polygonal cells filled
                    with very numerous and very minute angular starch grains. Rice is not so
                    valuable.as a food as some other cereals, inasmuch as the proportion of
                    nitrogenous matter (gluten) is less. Payen gives only 7 per cent, of gluten in
                    rice as compared with 22 per cent, in the finest wheat, 14 in oats, and 12 in
                    maize. The percentage of potash in the ash is as 18 to 23 in wheat. The fatty
                    matter is also less in proportion than in other cereals. Rice, therefore, is
                    chiefly a farinaceous food, and requires to be combined with fatty and
                    nitrogenous substances, such as milk or meat gravy, to satisfy the requirements
                    of the system.</p>
                <p>The imports of rice into the United Kingdom range from 7,000,000 cwt. to
                    8,000,000 cwt. annually, having an estimated value of,from £3,000,000 to
                    £3,500,000. Nearly the whole of this comes from British Burmah and Bengal. A
                    large proportion of the rice brought to Europe is used for starch-making, and
                    some is taken by distillers of alcohol. Rice is also the source of a drinking
                    spirit in India, and the national beverage of Japan—saké—is prepared entirely
                    from the fermented grain.</p>
