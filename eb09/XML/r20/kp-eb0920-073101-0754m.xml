                <p>BOTH the city and the state of Rome are represented in tradition as having been
                    gradually formed by the fusion of separate communities. The original settlement
                    of Romulus is said to have been limited to the Palatine Mount. With this were
                    united before the end of his reign the Capitoline and the Quirinal; Tullus
                    Hostilius added the Ctelian, Ancus Martius the Aventine; and finally Servius
                    Tullius included the Esquiline and Viminal, and enclosed the whole seven hills
                    with a stone wall. The growth of the state closely followed that of the city. To
                    the original Romans on the Palatine were added successively the Sabine followers
                    of King Tatius, Albans transplanted by Tullus, Latins by Ancus, and lastly the
                    Etruscan comrades of Cseles Vibenna. This tradition is supported by other and
                    more positive evidence. The race of the Luperci on February 15 was in fact a
                    purification of the boundaries of the “ancient Palatine town,” <note

                    </p></note> and the course taken is that described by Tacitus as the “pomoerium”
                    of the city founded by Romulus. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Varrò mentions an “ancient city” and an “earthen rampart,” <note anchored="true"

                    Septimontium is evidence of a union between this settlement and that on the
                    Palatine. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Festus, 348;
                    Jordan, i. 199; Gilbert, i. 161. The seven “montes” are the Palatine with the
                    Velia and Germalus, the Subura, and the three points of the Esquiline (Fagutal,
                    Oppius, and Cispius). </p></note> The fusion of these “Mounts” with a settlement
                    on the Quirinal “Hill” is also attested by trustworthy evidence; <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mommsen, <hi
                    rend="italic">R. G.</hi> (7th ed.), i. 51. </p></note> and in particular the
                    line taken by the procession of the Argei represents the enlarged boundaries of
                    these united communities. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    enclosure of the various settlements within a single ring-wall. But is tradition
                    right in representing this fusion of distinct settlements as a fusion also of
                    communities of different race? Much of what it says on this point may be at once
                    dismissed as fabulous. The tales of JEneas and his Trojans, of Evander and his
                    Arcadians, of the followers of Heracles, and of the still earlier Aborigines
                    have no claim to a place in history; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    cannot accept the tradition to which the Romans clung with proud humility of the
                    asylum opened by Romulus, or believe that the ancestors of the Romans were a

                    exaggerates the mixed character of the Roman people. Hegel, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phil. cl. Gesch.,</hi> 345, takes the story seriously. </p></note> nor, while
                    admitting the probability of the tradition that in remote times the “Sicels” had
                    dwelt on the seven hills, can we allow them any part or lot in the historic
                    Roman people. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dionys.,

                    the main homogeneous and in the main of Latin descent is unquestionable.
                    Indications of the truth are not wanting even in the traditions themselves:

                    assumed by the united Aborigines and Trojans; the immediate progenitors of Rome
                    are the Latin Lavinium and the Latin Alba. The evidence of the language, the
                    religion, the institutions and civilization of early Rome points to the same
                    conclusion. The speech of the Romans is from the first Latin <note

                    Geographically too the low hills by the Tiber form a part of the strip of
                    coast-land from which the Latini took their name, and the primitive settlements,
                    with their earthen ramparts and wooden palisades planted upon them out of reach
                    both of human foes and of the malaria of the swampy low grounds, are only
                    typical of the mode of settlement which the conditions of life dictated
                    throughout Latium. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    insists on the admixture of at least two non-Latin elements, a Sabine and an
                    Etruscan. The question as regards the latter will be more fully discussed
                    hereafter; it is enough to say here that there is no satisfactory evidence that
                    any one of the communities which combined to form Rome was Etruscan, or that
                    there was any important Etruscan strain in the Roman blood. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The existence of a Tuscan
                    quarter (Tuscus vicus) in early Rome probably points to nothing more than the
                    presence in Rome of Etruscan artisans and craftsmen. The Etruscan origin
                    ascribed to the third tribe, the “Luceres,” is a mere guess; see Schwegler,.i.
                    504, and Lange, <hi rend="italic">Rom. Alterth.,</hi> i. 85. </p></note> With
                    the Sabines it is otherwise. That union of the Palatine and Quirinal settlements
                    which constituted so decisive a stage in the growth of Rome is represented as
                    having been in reality a union of the original Latins with a band of Sabine
                    invaders who had seized and held not only the Quirinal Hill but the northern and
                    nearest peak of the Capitoline Mount. The tradition was evidently deeply rooted.
                    The name of the Quirinal Hill itself was derived from the Sabine town of Cures.

                    second and the fourth kings are both of Sabine descent. By the great majority of
                    modern writers the substance of the tradition, the fusion of a body of Sabine
                    invaders with the original Latins, is accepted as historical; and even Mommsen
                    allows its possibility, though he throws back the time of its occurrence to an
                    earlier period than that of the union of the two settlements. <note

                    G.,</hi> i. 43. Schwegler <hi rend="italic">(R. G.,</hi> i. 478) accepts the
                    tradition of a Sabine settlement on the Quirinal, and considers that in the
                    united state the Sabine element predominated. Volquardsen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rhein. Mus.,</hi> xxxiii. 559) believes in a complete Sabine conquest; and so
                    does Zoller <hi rend="italic">(Latium u. Rom,</hi> Leipsic, 1878), who, however,
                    places it after the expulsion of the Tarquins. Gilbert <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Topogr.,</hi> i. cap. 5) accepts the Sabine settlement, but holds rightly that
                    in the union the Latin element decisively predominated. </p></note> We cannot

                    safely made respecting it. The Sabine invasion, if it took place at all, must
                    have taken place far back in the prehistoric age; it must have been on a small
                    scale; and the Sabine invaders must have amalgamated easily and completely with
                    the Latin settlers. The structure of the early Roman state, while it bears
                    evident marks of a fusion of communities, shows no traces of a mixture of race.
                    Nor is it easy to point to any provably Sabine element in the language,
                    religion, or civilization of primitive Rome. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mommsen, i. 43. The Sabine words in
                    Latin, if not common to both dialects, were probably introduced later, or are
                    Sabinized Latin (Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Unterital. Dialekten,</hi> 347).
                    Schwegler’s attempt to distinguish Sabine features in the Roman character is
                    ingenious but unsatisfactory. </p></note> The theory of a Sabine conquest can
                    hardly be maintained in the face of the predominantly Latin character of both
                    people and institutions. On the other hand, the probability of a Sabine raid and
                    a Sabine settlement, possibly on the Quirinal Hill, in very early times may be
                    admitted. The incursions of the highland Apennine tribes into the lowlands fill
                    a large place in early Italian history. The Latins were said to have originally
                    descended from the mountain glens near Reate. <note anchored="true"

                    people, ever seeking new homes in richer lands. <note anchored="true"

                    legends.</p>
                <p>Such is all we know of the manner in which the separate settlements on the seven
                    hills grew into a single city and community. How long Rome took in the making,
                    or when or by whom the work was completed, we cannot say. Nor is it possible to
                    give more than a very meagre outline of the constitution and of the history of
                    the united state in the early days of its existence.</p>
                <p>The “populus Romanus” was, we are told, divided into three tribes, Ramnes,
                    Tities, and Luceres <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    tradition connecting the Ramnes with Romulus and the Tities with Tatius is as
                    old as Ennius (Varro, <hi rend="italic">L. L.,</hi> v. 55). Mommsen (i. 41)
                    explains Ramnes as = Romani, but this etymology is rejected by Schwegler and by
                    Corssen. As regards the Luceres there is little to add to Livy’s statement (i.
                    13), “nominis et originis causa incerta est. C/l, on the whole question,

                    primitive clan division, older than the Roman state itself. They survived in
                    later times only as divisions of the ancient “equitum centuriae,” and even in
                    the accounts of the earliest constitution they have ceased to serve as a
                    political division of the people. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    patres, with the primitive legion of 3000, with the vestal virgins, and with the

                    344; Mommsen, i. 41, 74, 75; Genz, <hi rend="italic">Patricisch. Rom,</hi> 90).
                    </p></note> Of far greater importance is the division into “curiae.” In Cicero’s
                    time there were still curies, curial festivals, and curiate assemblies, and
                    modern authors are unquestionably right in regarding the curia as the keystone
                    of the primitive political system. It was a primitive association held together
                    by participation in common “sacra,” and possessing common festivals, common
                    priests, and a common chapel, hall, and hearth. The members of a curia were very
                    probably neighbours and kinsmen, but the curia seems to represent a stage in
                    political development midway between that in which clanship is the sole bond of
                    union and that in which such claims as those of territorial contiguity and
                    ownership of land have obtained recognition. As separate associations the curiae

                    “gentes” and their elders, the importance of maintaining unbroken the continuity
                    of the “sacra,” on the transmission and observance of which the welfare of the
                    community depended, and thirdly the rights of the freemen, are all recognized.
                    On the death of a king, the auspicia, and with them the supreme authority,
                    revert to the council of elders, the “patres,” as representing the “gentes.” By
                    the “patres” an “interrex” is appointed, who in turn nominates a second; by him,
                    or even by a third or fourth interrex, a new king is selected in consultation
                    with the “patres.” The king-designate is then proposed to the freemen assembled
                    by their curiae for their acceptance, and finally their formal acceptance is
                    ratified by the “patres,” as a security that the “sacra” of which they are the
                    guardians have been respected. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Id., i. 32. In 336B.c. (Livy, viii. 12) the Publilian law directed that this
                    sanction should be given beforehand, “ante initum suffragium,” and thus reduced
                    it to a meaningless form (Livy, i. 11). It is wrongly identified by Schwegler
                    with the “lex curiata de imperio,” which in Cicero’s day followed and did not
                    precede election. According to Cicero <hi rend="italic">{De Rep.,</hi> ii. 13,
                    21), the proceedings included, in addition to the “creation” by the comitia
                    curiata and the sanction of the patres, the introduction by the king himself of
                    a lex curiata conferring the imperium and auspicia; but this theory, though
                    generally accepted, is probably an inference from the practice of a later time,
                    when the “creatio” had been transferred to the “comitia centuriata.” </p></note>
                    Thus the king is in the first instance selected by the representatives of the
                    old gentes, and they ratify his appointment. In form he is nominated directly by
                    a predecessor from whose hands he receives the auspicia. But it is necessary
                    also that the choice of the patres and the nomination of the interrex should be
                    confirmed by a solemn vote of the community.</p>

                    It is his business to consult the gods on its behalf, to offer the solemn
                    sacrifices, and to announce the days of the public festivals. Hard by his house
                    was the common hearth of the state, where the vestal virgins cherished the
                    sacred fire.</p>
                <p>By the side of the king stood the senate, or council of elders. In the
                    descriptions left us of the primitive senate, as in those of the “rex,” we can
                    discover traces of a transition from an earlier state of things when Rome was
                    only an assemblage of clans or village communities, allied indeed, but each
                    still ruled by its own chiefs and headmen, to one in which these groups have
                    been fused into a single state under a common ruler. On the one hand the senate
                    appears as a representative council of chiefs, with inalienable prerogatives of
                    its own, and claiming to be the ultimate depository of the supreme authority and
                    of the “sacra” connected with it. The senators are the “patres ”; they are taken
                    from the leading “gentes”; they hold their seats for life; to them the
                    “auspicia” revert on the death of a king; they appoint the interrex from their
                    own body, are consulted in the choice of the new king, <note anchored="true"

                    sanction is necessary to ratify the vote of the assembled freemen. On the other
                    hand they are no longer supreme. They cannot appoint a king but with the consent
                    of the community, and their relation to the king when appointed is one of
                    subordination. Vacancies in their ranks are filled up by him, and they can but

                    “interrex.” By the “rex” or “interrex” the question was put, and the voting took
                    place “curiatim,” the curiae being called up in turn. The vote of each curia was
                    decided by the majority of individual votes, and a majority of the votes of the
                    curiae determined the final result. But the occasions on which the assembly
                    could exercise its power must have been few. Their right to elect magistrates
                    was apparently limited to the acceptance or rejection of the king proposed by
                    the interrex. Of the passing of laws, in the later sense of the term, there is
                    no trace in the kingly period. Dionysius’s statement<note anchored="true"

                    improbable in itself and unsupported by tradition. They are indeed represented,
                    in one instance, as deciding a capital case, but it is by the express permission
                    of the king and not of right. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    people were also, and probably more frequently, convened for other purposes. Not
                    only did they meet to hear from the king the announcement of the high days and
                    holidays for each month, and to witness such solemn religious rites as the
                    inauguration of a priest, but their presence (and sometimes their vote) was
                    further required to authorize and attest certain acts, which in a later age

                <p>Such in outline was the political structure of the Roman state at the earliest
                    period known to us. It is clear that it belongs to a comparatively advanced
                    stage in the development of society, and that a long previous history lies
                    behind it. Traces of an older and more primitive order of things still linger in
                    the three ancient shadowy tribes, in the curiae and gentes, in many of the
                    features noticeable in the senate; but they are traces of an order that has
                    passed away. The supremacy of the state is established over the groups out of
                    whose fusion it has grown, and such of these groups as still retain a distinct
                    existence are merely private corporations. Private differences are settled and
                    wrongdoers punished by the state tribunals, and even within the close limits of
                    the family the authority of the head is limited by the claims of the state upon
                    the services of the sons and dependants.</p>
                <p>A history of this early Roman state is out of the question. The names, dates, and
                    achievements of the first four kings are all too unsubstantial to form the basis
                    of a sober narrative; <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>By far the most complete criticism of the traditional accounts of the first

                    few points only can be considered as fairly well established. If we except the
                    long eventless reign ascribed to King Numa, tradition represents the first kings
                    as incessantly at war with their immediate neighbours. The details of these wars
                    are no doubt mythical; but the implied condition of continual struggle, and the
                    narrow range within which the struggle is confined, may be accepted as true. The
                    picture drawn is that of a small community with a few square miles of territory,
                    at deadly feud with its nearest neighbours, within a radius of some 12 miles
                    round Rome. Nor, in spite of the repeated victories with which tradition credits
                    Romulus, Ancus, and Tullus, does there seem to have been any real extension of
                    Roman territory except towards the sea. Fidense remains Etruscan; the Sabines
                    continue masters up to the Anio; Prseneste, Gabii, and Tusculum are still
                    untouched; and on this side it is doubtful if Roman territory, in spite of the
                    possible destruction of Alba, extended to a greater distance than, the sixth
                    milestone from Rome. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the course of the Tiber below the city there was a decided advance. The

                    foundation of Ostia, and the acquisition of the saltworks near the sea may all
                    be safely ascribed to this early period. Closely connected, too, with the
                    control of the Tiber from Rome to the sea was the subjugation of the petty Latin
                    communities lying south of the river; and the tradition of the conquest and
                    destruction of Poli-torium, Tellenre, and Ficana is confirmed by the absence in

                    something like a transformation of the Roman city and state. Under the rule of
                    these latter kings the separate settlements are for the first time enclosed with
                    a rampart of colossal size and extent. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    are assigned the redivision of the city area into four new districts and the
                    introduction of a new military system, The kings increase in power and surround
                    themselves with new splendour. Abroad, too, Rome suddenly appears as a powerful
                    state ruling far and wide over southern Etruria and Latium. These startling
                    changes are, moreover, ascribed to kings of alien descent, who one and all
                    ascend the throne in the teeth of established constitutional forms. Finally,
                    with the expulsion of the last of them—the younger Tarquin—comes a sudden
                    shrinkage of power. At the commencement of the republic Rome is once more a
                    comparatively small state, with hostile and independent neighbours at her very
                    doors. It is difficult to avoid the conviction that the true explanation of this
                    phenomenon is to be found in the supposition that Rome during this period passed

                    and probably earlier still, the Etruscans appear as ruling widely outside the
                    limits of Etruria proper. They were supreme in the valley of the Po until their
                    power there was broken by the irruption of Celtic tribes from beyond the Alps,
                    and while still masters of the plains of Lombardy they established themselves in
                    the rich lowlands of Campania, where they held their ground until the capture of
                    Capua by the Samnite highlanders in 423 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is on
                    the face of it improbable that a power which had extended its sway from the Alps
                    to the Tiber, and from the Liris to Surrentum, should have left untouched the

                    come from South Etruria; their name can hardly be anything else than the Latin

                    what we are told of Etruscan conquests does not represent them as moving, like

                    with the theory of an Etruscan supremacy; on the contrary, it is at least

                    Etruscan rulers that Rome was first brought into direct contact with the Greeks,
                    who had long traded with the Etruscan ports and influenced Etruscan culture.

                <p>These Etruscan princes are represented, not only as having raised Rome for the
                    time to a commanding position in Latium and lavished upon the city itself the
                    resources of Etruscan civilization, but also as the authors of important
                    internal changes. They are represented as favouring new men at the expense of
                    the old patrician families, and as reorganizing the Roman army on a new footing,
                    a policy natural enough in military princes of alien birth, and rendered
                    possible by the additions which conquest had made to the original community.
                    From among the leading families of the conquered Latin states a hundred new
                    members were admitted to the senate, and these gentes thenceforth ranked as
                    patrician, and became known as “gentes minores.” <note anchored="true"

                    though subsequently adopted with modifications as the basis of the political

                    formation of a new and enlarged army on a new footing. In this force, excepting
                    in the case of the centuries of the horsemen, no regard was paid either to the
                    old clan divisions, or to the semi-religious semipolitical curiae. In its ranks
                    were included all freeholders within the Roman territory, whether members or not
                    of any of the old divisions, and the organization of this new army of assidui
                    was not less independent of the old system with its clannish and religious
                    traditions and forms. The unit was the “eenturia” or company of 100 men; the
                    centuriae were grouped in “classes” and drawn up in the order of the phalanx.

                    were composed of the wealthier citizens, whose means enabled them to bear the

                    The entire available body of freeholders was divided into two equal portions, a
                    reserve corps ofseniores” and a corps of “juniores” for active service. Each of

                    six centuries of horsemen, which still retained the old tribal names, twelve
                    more were added as a distinct body, and recruited from the wealthiest class of

                <p>The last of these Etruscan lords to rule in Rome was Tarquín the Proud. He is
                    described as a splendid and despotic monarch. His sway extended over Latium as *
                    far south as Circeii. Aristodemus, tyrant of Cumse, was his ally, and kinsmen of
                    his own were princes at Collatia, at Gabii, and at Tusculum. The Volscian
                    highlanders were chastised, and Signia with its massive walls was built to hold
                    them in check. In Rome itself the Capitoline temple and the great cloaca bore
                    witness to his power. But his rule pressed heavily upon the Romans, and at the
                    last, on the news of the foul wrong done by his son Sextus to a noble Roman
                    matron, Lucretia, the indignant people rose in revolt. Tarquín, who was away
                    besieging Ardea, was deposed; sentence of exile was passed upon him and upon all
                    his race; and the people swore that never again should a king rule in Rome.
                    Freed from the tyrant, they chose for themselves two yearly magistrates who
                    should exercise the supreme authority, and thus the republic of Rome was
                    founded. Three times the banished Tarquín strove desperately to recover the
                    throne he had lost. First of all the men of Veii and Tarquinii marched to his
                    aid, but were defeated in a pitched battle on the Roman frontier. A year later
                    Lars Porsena, prince of Clusium, at the head of all the powers of Etruria,
                    appeared before the gates of Rome, and closely besieged the city, until, moved
                    by the valour of his foe, he granted honourable terms of peace and withdrew.

                    freeholders voting by their classes and centuries (comitia centuriata), and to

                    and both the choice of magistrates and the passing of laws still required the

                    substitution of an annual magistracy for the life-long rule of a single king.
                    But the abolition of the monarchy brought with it a change of the utmost
                    importance in the actual working of the constitution. Though the distinction
                    between patricians and plebeians was at least as old as the state itself, it is
                    not until the establishment of the republic that it plays any part in the
                    history of Rome. No sooner, however, was the overshadowing authority of the king
                    removed than a struggle commenced between the two orders which lasted for more
                    than two centuries. It was in no sense a struggle between a conquering and a
                    conquered class, or between an exclusive citizen body and an unenfranchised mass
                    outside its pale. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Here

                    citizens of Rome, sprung of the same race and speaking the same tongue. The
                    former were the members of those ancient “gentes” which had possibly been once
                    the “chiefly” families in the small communities which preceded the united state,
                    and which claimed by hereditary right a privileged position in the community.
                    Only patricians could sit in the council of patres, and hence probably the name
                    given to their order. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    usages and forms which regulated the life of the people from day to day. To the
                    “plebs” (the multitude, <hi rend="smallcaps">7tA?7#os)</hi> belonged all who
                    were not members of some patrician gens, whether independent freemen or attached

                    “clientele,” see Mommsen <hi rend="italic">(Forsch.,</hi> i.) and Schwegler (i.

                    civil rights and a vote in the assembly of the curies, but he was excluded by
                    ancient custom from all share in the higher honours of the state, and
                    intermarriage with a patrician was not recognized as a properly legal union.</p>
                <p>The revolution which expelled the Tarquins gave the patricians, who had mainly
                    assisted in bringing it about, an overwhelming ascendency in the state. The
                    plebs had indeed gained something. Not only is it probable that the strictness
                    of the old tie of clientship had somewhat relaxed, and that the number of the
                    “clientes” was smaller and their dependence on patrician patrons less complete,
                    but the ranks of the plebs had, under the later kings, been swelled by the
                    admission of conquered Latins, and the freeholders among these had with others
                    been enrolled in the Servian tribes, classes, and centuries. The establishment
                    of the republic invested this military levy of free-</p>
                <p>holders with political rights as an assembly, for by their votes the consuls were
                    chosen and laws passed, and it was the plebeian freeholders who formed the main
                    strength of the plebs in the struggle that followed. But these gains were
                    greater in appearance than in reality. The plebeian freeholders commanded only a
                    minority of votes in the comitia centuriata. In their choice of magistrates they
                    were limited to the patrician candidates nominated by patrician presiding
                    magistrates, and their choice required confirmation not only by the older and
                    smaller assembly of the curiae, in which the patricians and their clients
                    predominated, but also by the patrician patres. They could only vote on laws
                    proposed by patrician consuls, and here again the subsequent sanction of the
                    patres was necessary. The whole procedure of the comitia was in short absolutely
                    in the hands of their patrician presidents, and liable to every sort of
                    interruption and suspension from patrician pontiffs and augurs.</p>
                <p>But these political disabilities did not constitute the main grievance of the
                    plebs in the early years of the republic. What they fought for was protection
                    for their lives and liberties, and the object of attack was the despotic
                    authority of the patrician magistrates. The consuls wielded the full “imperium”
                    of the kings, and against this “consular authority” the plebeian, though a
                    citizen, had no protection and no appeal, and matters were only worse when for
                    the two consuls was substituted in some emergency a single, all-powerful,
                    irresponsible dictator. In Rome, as in Greece, the first efforts of the people
                    were directed against the arbitrary powers of the executive magistrate.</p>
                <p>The history of this struggle between the orders opens with a concession made to
                    the plebs by one of the consuls themselves, a concession possibly due to a
                    desire to secure the allegiance of the plebeian freeholders, who formed the
                    backbone of the army. In the very first year of the republic, according to the
                    received chronology, P. Valerius Poplicola carried in the comitia centuriata his
                    famous law of appeal. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Livy, ii. 8, lex Valeria de provocationo; Cic. <hi rend="italic">De
                    Rep.,</hi> ii. 31; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Livy, iii. 20. </p></note> It
                    enacted that no magistrate, saving only a dictator, should execute a capital
                    sentence upon any Roman citizen unless the sentence had been confirmed on appeal
                    by the assembly of the centuries. But, though the “right of appeal” granted by
                    this law was justly regarded in later times as the greatest safeguard of a
                    Roman’s liberties, it was by no means at first so effective a protection as it
                    afterwards became. For not only was the operation of the law limited to the
                    bounds of the city, so that the consul in the field or on the march was left as
                    absolute as before, but no security was provided for its observance even within
                    the city by consuls resolved to disregard it.</p>
                <p>It was by their own efforts that the plebeians first' obtained any real
                    protection against magisterial despotism. The traditional accounts of the first
                    secession are con-; fused and contradictory <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Schwegler, ii. 226 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p></note> but
                    its causes and results are tolerably clear. The seceders were the plebeian
                    legionaries recently returned from a victorious campaign, indignant at the delay
                    of the promised reforms, they ignored the order given them to march afresh
                    against Volsci and Aiqui, and instead entrenched themselves on a hill across the
                    Anio, some three miles from Rome, and known afterwards as the Mons Sacer. The
                    frightened patricians came to terms, and a solemn agreement (lex sacrata) <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Schwegler, ii. 251, note;
                    Livy, i. 33. </p></note> was concluded between the orders, by which it was
                    provided that henceforth the plebeians should have annual magistrates of their
                    own (tribuni plebis), members of their own order, who should be authorized to
                    protect them against the <pb break="no"

                    the old form of government. The Valerio-Horatian laws, besides reaffirming the
                    right of appeal and the inviolability of the tribunes, improved the position of
                    the plebeian assemblies by enacting that “plebiscita” passed in them, and, as
                    seems probable, approved by the patres, should be binding on patricians as well
                    as plebeians. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy,
                    iii. 55, “quum veluti in controverso jure esset, tenerenturne patres
                    plt-biscitis legem comitiis centuriatis tulere, ut quod tributim plebs
                    jussissetpopulum teneret, qua lege tribuniciis rogationibus telum acerrimum
                    datum est.” What were the precise conditions under which a “plebiscitum” became
                    law, and what was the exact effect of the lex Publilia of 339 and the lex
                    Hortensia of 287, can only be conjectured. One of the two last can hardly have
                    been more than a reaffirmation of a previous law. </p></note> By this law the
                    tribunes obtained a recognized initiative in legislation. Henceforth the desired
                    reforms were introduced and carried by tribunes in what were now styled “comitia
                    tributa,” and, if sanctioned by the patres, became laws of the state. From this
                    period, too, must be dated the legalization at any rate of the tribune’s right
                    to impeach any citizen before the assembly of the tribes. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>After the decemvirate, the tribunes no longer
                    pronounce capital </p></note> Henceforward there is no question of the tribune’s
                    right to propose to the plebs to impose a fine, or of the validity of the
                    sentence when passed. The efficiency of these new -weapons of attack was amply
                    proved by the subsequent course of the struggle. Only a few years after the
                    Valerio-Horatian legislation came the lex Canuleia (445 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> by -which mixed marriages between patricians and plebeians were
                    declared lawful, and the social exclusiveness of the patriciate broken down. In
                    the same year with this measure, and like it in the interests primarily of the
                    wealthier plebeians, a vigorous attack commenced on the patrician monopoly of
                    the consulate, and round this stronghold of patrician ascendency the conflict
                    raged until the passing of the Licinian laws in 367. The original proposal of
                    Canuleius in 445 that the people should be allowed to elect a plebeian consul
                    was evaded by a compromise. The senate resolved that for the next year, in the
                    stead of consuls, six military tribunes with consular powers should be elected,
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, iv. 7; <hi

                    </p></note> and that the new office should be open to patricians and plebeians
                    alike. The consulship was thus for the time saved from pollution, as the
                    patricians phrased it, but the growing strength of the plebs is shown by the
                    fact that in fifty years out of the seventy-eight between 444 and 366 they
                    succeeded in obtaining the election of consular tribunes rather than of consuls.
                    A good omen for their ultimate success was a victory they won in connexion with
                    the inferior office of the qusestorship. Down to the time of the decemvirate the
                    quaestors had been nominated by the consuls, but in 447 their appointment was
                    transferred to the plebeian “comitia tributa,” and in 421 the first plebeian was
                    elected to the office. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    </p></note> Despite, however, these discouragements, the patricians fought on.
                    Each year they strove to secure the creation of consuls rather than consular
                    tribunes, and failing this strained every nerve to secure for their own order at
                    least a majority among the latter. Even the institution of the censorship (435),
                    though rendered desirable by the increasing importance and complexity of the
                    census, was, it is probable, due in part to their desire to discount beforehand
                    the threatened loss of the consulship by diminishing its powers. <note

                    poorer, whose minds were set rather on allotments of land, there was a division
                    of interest of which the patricians were not slow to take advantage, and to this
                    must be added the pressure of war. The death struggle with Veii and the sack of
                    Rome by the Gauls absorbed for the time all the energies of the community. In
                    377, however, two of the tribunes, C. I.icinius Stolo and L. Sextius, came
                    forward with proposals which united all sections of the plebs in their support.
                    Their proposals were as follows: <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Livy, vi. 35, 42; Appian, <hi rend="italic">B. C.,</hi> i.
                    8. </p></note> (1) that consuls and not consular tribunes be elected; (2) that
                    one consul at least should be a plebeian; (3) that the priestly college, which
                    had the charge of the Sibylline books, should consist of ten members instead of
                    two, and that of these half should be plebeians; (4) that no single citizen
                    should hold in occupation more than 500 acres of the common lands, or pasture
                    upon them more than 100 head of cattle and 500 sheep; (5) that all landowners
                    should employ a certain amount of free as w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ell as
                    slave labour on their estates <hi rend="italic">; (6)</hi> that interest already
                    paid on debts should be deducted from the principal, and the remainder paid off
                    in three years. The three last proposals were obviously intended to meet the
                    demands of the poorer plebeians, and to secure their support for the first half
                    of the scheme. Ten years of bitter conflict followed, but at last, in 367 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the Licinian rogations became law, and one of their
                    authors, L. Sextius, was created the first plebeian consul. For the moment it
                    was some consolation to the patricians that they not only succeeded in detaching
                    from the consulship the administration of civil law, which was entrusted to a
                    separate officer, “praetor urbanus,” to be elected by the comitia of the
                    centuries, with an understanding apparently that he should be a patrician, but
                    also obtained the institution of two additional sediles (“aediles curules”), who
                    were in like manner to be members of their own order. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, vi. 42. </p></note> With the opening of
                    the consulship, however, the issue of the long contest was virtually decided,
                    and the next eighty years witnessed a rapid succession of plebeian victories.
                    Now that a plebeian consul might preside at the elections, the main difficulty
                    in the way of the nomination and election of plebeian candidates -was removed.
                    The proposed patrician monopoly of the new curule sedileship was almost
                    instantly abandoned. In 356 the first plebeian was made dictator, in 350 the
                    censorship, and in 337 the praetorship were filled for the first time by
                    plebeians, and lastly, in 300, by the lex Ogulnia, even the sacred colleges of
                    the pontiffs and augurs, the old strongholds of patrician supremacy, were thrown
                    open to the plebs <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy,

                    they had exercised so long over the action of the people in assembly. The
                    “patrum auctoritas,” the sanction given or refused by the patrician senators to
                    laws and to elections, had hitherto been a powerful weapon in their hands. But
                    in 339 a law of Q. Publilius Philo, a plebeian dictator, enacted that this
                    sanction should be given beforehand to all laws <note anchored="true"

                    same rule was extended to elections. Henceforward the “patrum auctoritas” sank
                    into a meaningless form, though as such it still survived in the time of Livy. A
                    second Publilian law affirmed afresh the validity of “plebiscita,” <hi

                    Apparently, however, their validity was still left subject to some conditions,
                    for in 287 a lex Hortensia, carried by another plebeian dictator, was found
                    necessary finally to settle the question. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    agrarian reform but protection against the consuls. The tribunate gave them this
                    protection in a form which has no parallel in history. The tribune was not, and,
                    strictly speaking, never became, a magistrate of the Roman people. His one
                    proper prerogative was that of granting protection to the oppressed plebeian
                    against a patrician officer. This prerogative (jus auxilii) was secured to the
                    tribunes, not by the ordinary constitution, but by a special compact between the
                    orders, and was protected by the ancient oath (vetus jusjurandum), <note

                    individual acts of magisterial oppression. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    resolutions on questions of interest to the order. This incipient plebeian

                    Publilian law, if not before, the tribunes were annually elected. <note

                    to secure for the plebs their fair share of the common lands of the state (agri
                    publici). The main object, however, of this early agrarian agitation was not
                    economic but political. Membership in a tribe was now more than ever important
                    for a plebeian, as giving a vote not only in the comitia centuriata but also in
                    the plebeian “concilia,” and membership in a tribe was possible as yet only for
                    freeholders. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    increasing the number of freeholders was for the state to create freeholds on
                    the common lands. But such a policy met with bitter opposition from the
                    patricians, who had long enjoyed a virtual monopoly of these lands, and had
                    excluded the plebeians even from those more recently acquired tracts which they
                    had helped to win by their swords. Against this patrician monopoly the tribunes
                    unceasingly protested from a few years after the first secession down to 465 <hi

                    </p></note> was resolutely opposed by the patricians, but after ten years of
                    bitter party strife a compromise was effected. A commission of ten patricians
                    was appointed, who should frame and publish a code of law binding equally on
                    both the orders. These decemviri were to be the sole and supreme magistrates for
                    the year, and the law of appeal was suspended in their favour. <note

                    The code which they promulgated, the famous XII. Tables, owed little of its
                    importance to any novelties or improvements contained in its provisions. For the
                    most part it seems merely to have reaffirmed existing usages and laws (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Roman Law).</hi> But it substituted a public, written law,
                    binding on all citizens of Rome, for an unwritten usage, the knowledge of which
                    was confined to a few patricians, and which had been administered by this
                    minority in their own interests. With the publication of the code the proper
                    work of the decemvirs was finished; nevertheless for the next year a fresh
                    decemvirate was elected, and it is conceivable that the intention was
                    permanently to substitute government by an irresponsible patrician “council of
                    ten” for the old constitution. However this may have been, the tyranny of the
                    decemvirs themselves was fatal to the continuance of their power. We are told of
                    a second secession of the plebs, this time to the Janiculum, and of negotiations
                    with the senate, the result of which was the enforced abdication of the
                    decemvirs. The plebs joyfully chose for themselves tribunes, and in the comitia
                    centuriata two consuls were created. But this restoration of the old regime was
                    accompanied by legislation which made it an important crisis in the history of
                    the struggle between the orders. With the fall of the decemvirate this struggle
                    enters upon a new phase. The tribunes appear as at once more powerful and more
                    strictly constitutional magistrates; the plebeian “concilia” take their place as
                    formal comitia by the side of the older assemblies; and finally this improved
                    machinery is used not simply in self-defence against patrician oppression but to
                    obtain complete political equality. This change was no doubt due in part to
                    circumstances outside legislation, above all to the expansion of the Roman
                    state, which swelled the numbers and added to the social importance of the plebs
                    as compared with the dwindling forces of the close corporation of patrician
                    gentes. Still the legislation</p>

                <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">Conquest of Italy.—</hi> Twelve years after the passing of
                    the lex Hortensia, King Pyrrhus, beaten at Beneventum, withdrew from Italy, and
                    Rome was left mistress of the peninsula. The steps by which this supremacy had
                    been won have now to be traced. Under the rule of her Etruscan princes Rome
                    spread her sway over the lowlands of Latium, and her arms were a terror to the
                    warlike highlanders of the Sabine and Volscian hills. But with their fall this
                    miniature empire fell also, and at first it seemed as if the infant republic,
                    torn by internal dissensions, must succumb to the foes who threatened it from so
                    many sides at once. It was only after one hundred and fifty years of almost
                    constant war that Rome succeeded in rolling back the tide of invasion and in
                    establishing her supremacy over the neighbouring lowlands and over the hill
                    country which bordered them to the east and south. The close of this first stage
                    in her external growth is conveniently marked by the first collision with the

                    slowness of her advance up to this point is the fact that only seventy-five
                    years more were needed for the virtual subjugation of all the rest of the
                    peninsula (343-269).</p>
                <p>The expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, followed as it seems to have been by the
                    emancipation from Etruscan supremacy of all the country between the Tiber and
                    the Liris, entirely altered the aspect of affairs. North of the Tiber the
                    powerful Etruscan city of Veii, after a vain attempt to restore the Tarquins,
                    relapsed into an attitude of sullen hostility towards Rome, which, down to the
                    outbreak of the final struggle in 407, found vent in constant and harassing
                    border forays. The Sabines recommenced their raids across the Anio; from their
                    hills to the south-east the Aequi pressed forward as far as the eastern spurs of
                    the Alban range, and ravaged the plain country between that range and the Sabine
                    mountains; the Volsci overran the coast-lands as far as Antium, established
                    themselves at Velitrae, and even ravaged the fields within a few miles of Rome.
                    But the good fortune of Rome did not leave her to face these foes single-handed,
                    and it is a significant fact that the history of the Roman advance begins, not
                    with a brilliant victory, but with a useful and timely alliance. According to
                    Livy, it was in 493, only a few years after the defeat of the prince of Tusculum
                    at Lake Regillus, that a treaty was concluded between Rome and the Latin
                    communities of the Campagna. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Livy, ii. 33; Cic. <hi rend="italic">Pro Balbo,</hi> 23.
                    </p></note> The alliance was in every respect natural. The Latins were the near
                    neighbours and kinsmen of the Romans, and both Romans and Latins were just freed
                    from Etruscan rule to find themselves as lowlanders and dwellers in towns face
                    to face with a common foe in the ruder hill tribes on their borders. The exact
                    terms of the treaty cannot, any more than the precise circumstances under which
                    it was concluded, be stated with certainty (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Latium),</hi> but two points seem clear. There was at first a genuine equality
                    in the relations between the allies.; Romans and Latins, though combining for
                    defence and offence, did so without sacrificing their separate freedom of
                    action, even in the matter of waging wars independently of each other. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, viii. 2. </p></note>
                    But, secondly, Rome enjoyed from the first one inestimable advantage. The Latins
                    lay between her and the most active of her foes, the Aequi and Volsci, and
                    served to protect her territories at the expense of their own. Behind this
                    barrier Rome grew strong, and the close of the -zEciuian and Volscian wars left
                    the Latins her dependents rather than her allies. Beyond the limits of the
                    Campagna Rome found a second ally, hardly less useful than the Latins, in the
                    tribe of the Hernici (“the men of the rocks ”), in the valley of the Trerus, who
                    had equal reason with the Romans and Latins to dread the Volsci and Aequi, while
                    their position midway between the two latter peoples made them valuable
                    auxiliaries to the lowlanders of the Campagna.</p>
                <p>The treaty with the Hernici is said to have been concluded in 486, <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, ii. 40. </p></note> and
                    the confederacy of the three peoples —Romans, Latins, and Hernicans—lasted down
                    to the great Latin war in 340. Confused and untrustworthy as are the chronicles
                    of the early wars of Rome, it is clear that notwithstanding the acquisition of
                    these allies Rome made but little way against her foes during the first fifty
                    years of the existence of the republic. In 474, it is true, an end was put for a
                    time to the harassing border feud with Veii by a forty years’ peace, an
                    advantage due not so much to Roman valour as to the increasing dangers from
                    other quarters which were threatening the Etruscan states. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From the Celts in the north especially.
                    </p></note> But this partial success stands alone, and down to 449 the raids of
                    Sabines, Aequi, and Volsci continue without intermission, and are occasionally
                    carried up to the very walls of Rome. Very different is the impression left by
                    the annals of the next sixty years (449-390). During this period there is an
                    unmistakable development of Roman power on all sides.</p>
                <p>In southern Etruria the capture of Veii (396) virtually gave Rome the mastery as
                    far as the Ciminian forest. Sutrium and Nepete, “the gates of Etruria,” became
                    her allies and guarded her interests against any attack from the Etruscan
                    communities to the north, while along the Tiber valley her suzerainty was
                    acknowledged as far as Capena and Falerii. On the Anio frontier we hear of no
                    disturbances from 449 until some ten years after the sack of Rome by the Gauls.
                    In 446 the Aequi appear for the last time before the gates of Rome. After 418
                    they disappear from Mount Algidus, and in the same year the communications of
                    Rome and Latium with the Hernici in the Trerus valley were secured by the
                    capture and colonization of Labicum. Successive invasions, too, broke the
                    strength of the Volsci, and in 393 a Latin colony was founded as far south as
                    Circeii. In part, no doubt, these Roman successes were due to the improved
                    condition of affairs in Rome itself, consequent upon the great reforms carried
                    between 450 and 442; but it is equally certain that now as often afterwards
                    fortune befriended Rome by weakening, or by diverting the attention of, her
                    opponents. In particular, her rapid advance in southern Etruria was facilitated
                    by the heavy blows inflicted upon the Etruscans during the 5th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by Celts, Greeks, and Samnites. By the close of this
                    century the Celts had expelled them from the rich plains of what was afterwards
                    known as Cisalpine Gaul, and were even threatening to advance across the
                    Apennines into Etruria proper. The Sicilian Greeks, headed by the tyrants of
                    Syracuse, wrested from them their mastery of the seas, and finally, .on the
                    capture of Capua by the Samnites in 423, they lost their possessions in the
                    fertile Campanian plain. These conquests of the Samnites were part of a great
                    southward movement of the highland Sabellian peoples, the immediate effects of
                    which upon the fortunes of Rome were not confined to the weakening of the
                    Etruscan power. It is probable that the cessation of the Sabine raids across the
                    Anio was partly due to the new outlets which were opened southwards for the
                    restless and populous hill tribes which had so long disturbed the peace of the
                    Latin lowlands. We may conjecture, also,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n763/mode/1up"

                <p>that the growing feebleness exhibited by Volsci and Aequi was in some measure
                    caused by the pressure upon their rear of the Sabellian clans which at this time
                    established themselves near the Fucine Lake and along the course of the
                    Liris.</p>
                <p>But in 390, only six years after the great victory over her ancient rival Veii,
                    the Roman advance was for a moment checked by a disaster which threatened to
                    alter the course of history in Italy, and which left a lasting impress on the
                    Roman mind. In 391 a Celtic horde left their newly won lands on the Adriatic,
                    and, crossing the Apennines into Etruria, laid siege to the Etruscan city of
                    Clusium (Chiusi). Thence, provoked, it is said, by the conduct of the Roman
                    ambassadors, who, forgetting their sacred character, had fought in the ranks of
                    Clusium and slain a Celtic chief, the barbarians marched upon Rome. On July 18,
                    390 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> only a few miles from Rome, was fought the
                    disastrous battle of the Allia. The defeat of the Romans was complete, and Rome
                    lay at the ercy of her foe. But in characteristic fashion the Celts halted three
                    days to enjoy the fruits of victory, and time was thus given to put the Capitol
                    at least in a state of defence. The arrival of the barbarians was followed by
                    the sack of the city, but the Capitol remained impregnable. For seven months
                    they besieged it, and then in as sudden a fashion as they had come they
                    disappeared. The Roman chroniclers explain their retreat in their own way, by
                    the fortunate appearance of Camillus with the troops which he had collected, at
                    the very moment when famine had forced the garrison on the Capitol to accept
                    terms. More probably the news that their lands across the Apennines were
                    threatened by the Veneti, coupled with the unaccustomed tedium of a long siege
                    and the difficulty of obtaining supplies, inclined the Celts to accept readily a
                    heavy ransom as the price of their withdrawal. But, whatever the reason, it is
                    certain that they retreated, and, though during the next fifty years marauding
                    bands appeared at intervals in the neighbourhood of Rome, and even once
                    penetrated as far south as Campania (361-360), the Celts never obtained any
                    footing in Italy outside the plains in the north which they had made their
                    own.</p>
                <p>Nor, in spite of the defeat on the Allia and the sack of the city, was Rome
                    weakened except for the moment by the Celtic attack. The storm passed away as
                    rapidly as it had come on. The city was hastily rebuilt, and Rome dismayed the
                    enemies who hastened to take advantage of her misfortunes by her undiminished
                    vigour. Her conquests in southern Etruria were successfully defended against
                    repeated attacks from the Etruscans to the north. The creation in 387 of four
                    new tribes (Stellatina, Sabatina, Tromentina, Arniensis) marked the final
                    annexation of the territory of Veii and of the lands lying along the Tiber
                    valley. A few years later Latin colonies were established at Sutrium and Nepete
                    for the more effectual defence of the frontier, and finally, in 353, the
                    subjugation of South Etruria was completed by the submission of Caere (Cervetri)
                    and its partial incorporation with the Roman state as a “municipium sine
                    suffragio ”—the first, it is said, of its kind. <note anchored="true"

                <p>Next to the settlement of southern Etruria, the most important of the successes
                    gained by Rome between 390 and 343 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> were those won
                    against her old foes the Aequi and Volsci, and her old allies the Latins and
                    Hernicans. The Aequi indeed, already weakened by their long feud with Rome, and
                    hard pressed by the Sabellian tribes in their rear, were easily dealt with, and
                    after the campaign of 389 we have no further mention of an</p>
                <p>Aequian war until the last Aequian rising in 304. The Volsci, who in 389 had
                    advanced to Lanuvium, were met and utterly defeated by M. Furius Camillus, the
                    conqueror of Veii, and this victory was followed up by the gradual subjugation
                    to Rome of all the lowland country lying between the hills and the sea as far
                    south as Tarracina. Latin colonies were established at Satricum (385), at Setia
                    (379), and at Antium and Tarracina some time before 348. In 358 two fresh Roman
                    tribes (Pomp-tina and Publilia) were formed in the same district. <note

                    </p></note></p>
                <p>Rome had now nothing more to fear from the foes who a century ago had threatened
                    her very existence. The lowland country, of which she was the natural centre,
                    from the Ciminian forest to Tarracina, was quiet, and within its limits Rome was
                    by far the strongest power. But she had now to reckon with the old and faithful
                    allies to whose loyal aid her present position was largely due. The Latins and
                    Hernicans had suffered severely in the Aequian and Volscian wars; it is probable
                    that not a few of the smaller communities included in the league had either been
                    destroyed or been absorbed by larger states, and the independence of all alike
                    was threatened by the growing power of Rome. The sack of Rome by the Celts gave
                    them an opportunity of reasserting their independence, and we are consequently
                    told that this disaster was immediately followed by the temporary dissolution of
                    the confederacy, and this again a few years later by a series of actual
                    conflicts between Rome and her former allies. Between 383 and 358 we hear of
                    wars with Tibur, Prseneste, Tusculum, Lanuvium, Circeii, and the Hernici. But in
                    all Rome was successful. In 382 Tusculum was fully incorporated with the Roman
                    state by the bestowal of the full franchise <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Livy, vi. 26. </p></note>; in 358, according to both Livy
                    and Polybius the old alliance was formally renewed with Latins and Hernicans. We
                    cannot, however, be wrong in assuming that the position of the allies under the
                    new league was far inferior to that accorded them by the treaty of Spurius
                    Cassius. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mommsen, <hi

                    against their will, and from which they were yet to make one last effort to
                    escape.</p>
                <p>We have now reached the close of the first stage in Rome’s advance towards
                    supremacy in Italy. By 343 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> she was already
                    mistress both of the low country stretching from the Ciminian forest to
                    Tarracina and Circeii and of the bordering highlands. Her own territory had
                    largely increased. Across the Tiber the lands of Veii, Capena, and Caere were
                    nearly all Roman, while in Latium she had carried her frontiers to Tusculum on
                    the Alban range and to the southernmost limits of the Pomptine district. And
                    this territory was protected by a circle of dependent allies and colonies
                    reaching northward to Sutrium and Nepete, and southward to Sora on the upper
                    Liris, and to Circeii on the coast. Already, too, she was beginning to be
                    recognized as a power outside the limits of the Latin lowlands. The fame of the
                    capture of Rome by the Celts had reached Athens, and her subsequent victories
                    over marauding Celtic bands had given her prestige in South Italy as a bulwark
                    against northern barbarians. In 354 she had formed her first connexions beyond
                    the Liris by a treaty with the Samnites, and in 348 followed a far more
                    important treaty with the great maritime state of Carthage. <note

                    civilized communities of the lowlands against the rude highland tribes which

                    was in answer to an appeal from a lowland city against invaders from the hills.
                    While she was engaged in clearing Latium of Volsci and Aequi, the Sabellian
                    tribes of the central Apennines had rapidly spread over the southern half of the
                    peninsula. Foremost among these tribes were the Samnites, a portion of whom had
                    captured the Etruscan city of Capua in . 423, the Greek Cumae in 420, and had
                    since then ruled as masters over the fertile Campanian territory. But in their
                    new homes the conquerors soon lost all sense of relationship and sympathy with
                    their highland brethren. They dwelt in cities, amassed wealth, and inherited the
                    civilization of the Greeks and Etruscans whom they had dispossessed; <note

                    before long to defend themselves in their turn against the attacks of their
                    ruder kinsmen from the hills, and it was for aid against these that the Samnites
                    of Campania appealed to the rising state which had already made herself known as
                    the bulwark of the lowlands north of the Liris, and which with her Latin and
                    Hernican allies had scarcely less interest than the Campanian cities themselves
                    in checking the raids of the highland Samnite tribes.</p>
                <p>The Campanian appeal was listened to. Rome with her confederates entered into
                    alliance with Capua and the neighbouring Campanian towns, and war was formally
                    declared (343) against the Samnites. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    undertook the task of driving the invaders out of Campania. After two campaigns
                    the war was ended in 341 by a treaty, and the Samnites withdrew from the
                    lowlands, leaving Rome the recognized suzerain of the Campanian cities which had
                    sought her aid. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the

                <p>There is no doubt that the check thus given by Rome to the advance of the
                    hitherto invincible Sabellian highlanders not only made her the natural head and
                    champion of the low countries, south as well as north of the Liris, but also
                    considerably added to her prestige. Carthage sent her congratulations, and the
                    Etruscan city of Falerii voluntarily enrolled herself among the allies of Rome.
                    Of even greater service, however, was the fact that for fifteen years the
                    Samnites remained quiet, for this inactivity, whatever its cause, enabled Rome
                    triumphantly to surmount a danger which threatened for the moment to wreck her
                    whole position. This danger was nothing less than a desperate effort on the part
                    of nearly all her allies and dependents south of the Tiber to throw off the yoke
                    of her supremacy. The way was led by her ancient confederates the Latins, whose
                    smouldering discontent broke into open flame directly the fear of a Samnite
                    attack was removed. From the Latin Campagna and the Sabine hills the revolt
                    spread westward and southward to Antium and Tarracina, and even to the towns of
                    the Campanian plain, where the mass of the inhabitants at once repudiated the
                    alliance formed with Rome by the ruling class. The struggle was sharp but short.

                    sufficed for the complete reduction of such of the insurgent communities as
                    still held out. The revolt crushed, Rome set her-</p>
                <p>self deliberately to the task of re-establishing on a new and firmer basis her
                    supremacy over the lowlands, and in doing so laid the foundations of that
                    marvellous organization which was destined to spread rapidly over Italy, and to
                    withstand the attacks even of Haunibal. The old historic Latin league ceased to
                    exist, though its memory was still preserved by the yearly Latin festival on the
                    Alban Mount. Most if not all of the common land of the league became Roman
                    territory; <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, viii.

                    enter the pale of the Roman state. The rest, with the Latin colonies, were
                    ranked as Latin allies of Rome, but on terms which secured their complete
                    dependence upon the sovereign city. The policy of isolation, which became so
                    cardinal a principle of Roman rule, was now first systematically applied. No
                    rights of “con-nubium” or “commercium” were any longer to exist between these
                    communities. Their federal councils were prohibited, and all federal action
                    independent of Rome forbidden. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In future they were to have nothing in common but their common connexion with
                    Rome, a connexion based in each case on a separate treaty between the individual
                    Latin community and Rome. The Latin allied state retained its internal
                    independence and the old rights of intermarriage and commerce with Rome, but it
                    lost all freedom of action in external affairs. It could wage no wars, conclude
                    no treaties, and was bound, so the phrase ran, to have always the same foes and
                    friends as Rome herself. In Campania and the coast-lands connecting Campania
                    with Rome, a policy of annexation was considered safer than that of alliance. Of
                    the two frontier posts of the Volsci, Antium and Velitrae, the former was
                    constituted a Roman colony, its long galleys burnt and their prows set up in the
                    Forum at Rome, while the walls of Velitrae were razed to the ground, its leading
                    men banished beyond the Tiber, and their lands given to Roman settlers. Farther
                    south on the route to Campania, Fundi and Formiae were, after the precedent set
                    in the case of Caere, declared Roman and granted the civil rights of Roman
                    citizenship, while lastly in Campania itself the same status was given to Capua,
                    Cumae, and the smaller communities dependent upon them. <note anchored="true"

                    of settlement was steadily continued. Tarracina, like Antium, was made a Roman
                    colony. Privernum, the last Volscian town to offer resistance to Rome, was
                    subdued in 330, part of its territory allotted to Roman citizens, and the state
                    itself forced to accept the Roman ’franchise. Lastly, to strengthen the lines of
                    defence against the Sabellian tribes, two colonies with the rights of Latin
                    allies were established at Fregellae and at Cales. The settlement of the
                    lowlands was accomplished. From the Ciminian forest to the southern extremity of
                    the Campanian plain, the lands lying between the sea and the hills were now,
                    with few exceptions, Roman territory, while along the frontiers from Sutrium and
                    Nepete in the north to Cales in the south stretched the protecting line of the
                    Latin allied states and colonies. As a single powerful and compact state with an
                    outer circle of closely dependent allies, Rome now stood in sharp contrast with
                    the disunited and degenerate cities of northern Etruria, the loosely organized
                    tribes of the Apennines, and the decaying and disorderly’Greek towns of the
                    south.</p>

                <p>The strength of this system was now to be tried by a struggle with the one
                    Italian people who were still ready and able to contest with Rome the supremacy
                    of the peninsula. The passive attitude of the Samnites between 342 and 327 was
                    no doubt largely due to the dangers which had suddenly threatened them in South
                    Italy. But the death of Alexander of Epirus, in 332, <note anchored="true"

                    their only formidable opponent there, and left them free to turn their attention
                    to the necessity of checking the steady advance of Rome. In 327, the year after
                    the ominous foundation of a Roman colony at Fregellae, a pretext for renewing
                    the struggle was offered them. The Cumaean colony of Palaepolis <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, viιi. 22. </p></note>
                    had incurred the wrath of Rome by its raids into her territory in Campania. The
                    Samnites sent a force to defend it, and Rome replied by a declaration of war.
                    The two opponents were not at first <hi rend="subscript"/> sight unequally
                    matched, and had the Sabellian tribes held firmly together the issue of the
                    struggle might have been different. As it was, however, the Lucanians to the
                    south actually joined Rome from the first, while the northern clans Marsi,
                    Vestini, Paeligni, Erentani, after a feeble and lukewarm resistance, subsided
                    into a neutrality which was exchanged in 304 for a formal alliance with Rome. An
                    even greater advantage to Rome from the outset was the enmity existing between
                    Samnites and the Apulians, the latter of whom from the first joined Rome and
                    thus gave her a position in the rear of her enemy and in a country eminently
                    well fitted for maintaining a large military force. These weaknesses on the
                    Samnite side were amply illustrated by the events of the war.</p>
                <p>The first seven or eight years were marked by one serious disaster to the Roman
                    arms, the defeat at the Caudine Forks (321), but, when in 318 the Samnites asked
                    for and obtained a two years’ truce, Rome had succeeded not only in inflicting
                    several severe blows upon her enemies but in isolating them from outside help.
                    The Lucanians to the south were her allies. To the east, in the rear of Samnium,
                    Apulia acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome, and Luceria, captured in 320, had
                    been established as a base of Roman operations. Finally to the north the Romans
                    had easily overcome the feeble resistance of the Vestini and Frentani, and
                    secured through their territories a safe passage for their legions to Apulia. On
                    the renewal of hostilities in 316, the Samnites, bent on escaping from the net
                    which was being slowly drawn round them, made a series of desperate efforts to
                    break through the lines of defence which protected Latium and Campania. Sora and
                    Fregellae on the upper Liris were captured by a sudden attack; the Ausones in
                    the low country near the mouth of the same river were encouraged to revolt by
                    the appearance of the Samnite army; and in Campania another army, attracted by
                    rumours of disturbance, all but defeated the Roman consuls under the very walls
                    of Capua. But these efforts were unavailing. Sora and Fregellae were recovered
                    as quickly as they had been lost, and the frontier there was strengthened by the
                    establishment of a colony at Interamna. The Ausones were punished by the
                    confiscation of their territory, and Roman supremacy further secured by the two
                    colonies of Suessa and Pontia (312). The construction of the famous Via Appia,
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, ix. 23.
                    </p></note> the work of the censor Appius Claudius Caecus, opened a safe and
                    direct route to Campania, while the capture of Nola deprived the Samnites of
                    their last important stronghold in the Campanian lowlands. The failure of these
                    attempts broke the courage even of the Samnites. Their hopes were indeed raised
                    for a moment by the news that Etruria had risen against Rome (310), but their
                    daring scheme of effecting a union with the Etruscans was frustrated by the
                    energy of the Roman generals. Five years later (305) the Romans revenged a
                    Samnite raid into Campania by an invasion of Samuium itself. Arpinum on the
                    frontier was taken, and at last, after a twenty-two years’ struggle, the Second
                    Samnite War was closed by a renewal of the ancient treaty with Rome (304). <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, ix. 29. </p></note></p>
                <p>The six years of peace which followed (304-298) were characteristically employed
                    by Rome in still further strengthening her position. Already, two years before
                    the peace, a rash revolt of the Hernici <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Livy, ix. 45. </p></note> had given Rome a pretext for
                    finally annexing the territory of her ancient allies. The tribal confederacy was
                    broken up, and all the Hernican communities, with the exception of three which
                    had not joined the revolt, were incorporated with the Roman state as municipia,
                    with the civil rights of the Roman franchise. Between the Hernican valley and
                    the frontiers of the nearest Sabellian tribes lay what remained of the once
                    formidable people of the Aequi. In their case, too, a revolt (304) was followed
                    by the annexation of their territory, which was marked in this case by the
                    formation there (301) of two Roman tribes (Aniensis and Teretina). <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, ix. 45. </p></note> Not
                    content with thus carrying the borders of their own territory up to the very
                    frontiers of the Sabellian country, Rome succeeded in finally detaching from the
                    Sabellianconfederacyall the tribes lying <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Livy, x. 9. </p></note> between the north-east frontier of
                    Latium and the Adriatic Sea. Henceforward the Marsi, Paeligni, Vestini,
                    Marrucini, and Frentani were enrolled among the allies of Rome, and not only
                    swelled her forces in the field but interposed a useful barrier between her
                    enemies to the north in Etruria and Umbria and those to the south in Samnium,
                    while they connected her directly with the friendly Apulians. Lastly, as a
                    security for the fidelity at least of the nearest of these allies, colonies were
                    planted in the Marsian territories at Carseoli and at Alba Fucentia. A
                    significant indication of the widening range of Rome’s influence in Italy, and
                    of the new responsibilities rapidly pressing upon her, is the fact that when in
                    302 the Spartan Cleonymus landed in the territory of the Sallentini, far away in
                    the south-east, he was met and repulsed by a Roman force. <note anchored="true"

                <p>Six years after the conclusion of the treaty which ended the Second Samnite AVar,
                    news arrived that the Samnites were harassing the Lucanians. Rome at once
                    interfered to protect her allies. Samnium was invaded in force, the country
                    ravaged, and one stronghold after another captured. Unable any longer to hold
                    their own in a position where they were hedged round by enemies, the Samnite
                    leaders turned as a last hope to the communities of northern Etruria, to the
                    free tribes of Umbria, and to the once dreaded Celts. With a splendid daring
                    they formed the scheme of uniting all these peoples with themselves in a last
                    desperate effort to break the power of Rome.</p>
                <p>For some forty years after the final annexation of southern Etruria (351 <hi

                    Sutrium and Nepete still guarded the Roman frontier; the natural boundary of the
                    Ciminian forest was still intact; and up the valley of the Tiber Rome had not
                    advanced beyond Falerii, a few miles short of the most southerly Umbrian town
                    Ocriculum. But in 311, on the expiry, apparently, of the long truce with Rome,
                    concluded in 351, the northern Etruscans, alarmed no doubt by the rapid advances
                    which Rome was making further south, rose in arms and attacked Sutrium. The
                    attack, however, recoiled disastrously upon the heads of the assailants. A Roman
                    force promptly relieved Sutrium, and its leader, Q. Fabius Rullianus, without
                    awaiting orders from home, boldly plunged into the wilds of the Ciminian forest,
                    and crossing them safely swept <pb break="no"

                    Lake. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, ix. 39.

                    In the same year the promptitude of Fabius easily averted a threatened attack by
                    the Umbrians, but Rome proceeded nevertheless to fortify herself in her
                    invariable fashion against future dangers on this side, by an alliance with
                    Ocriculum, which was followed ten years later by a colony at Nequinum, <note

                    Picentes, whose position in the rear of Umbria rendered them as valuable to Rome
                    as the Apulians had proved farther south.</p>
                <p>Fourteen years had passed since the battle on the Vadimonian Lake, when the
                    Samnites appeared on the borders of Etruria and called on the peoples of
                    northern Italy to rise against the common enemy. Their appeal, backed by the
                    presence of their troops, was successful. The Etruscans found courage to face
                    the Roman legions once more; a few of the Umbrians joined them; but the most
                    valuable allies to the Samnites were the Celts, who had for some time threatened
                    a raid across the Apennines, and who now marched eagerly into Umbria and joined
                    the coalition. The news that the Celts were in motion produced a startling
                    effect at Rome, and every nerve was strained to meet this new danger. While two
                    armies were left in southern Etruria as reserves, the two consuls, Fabius and
                    Decius, both tried soldiers, marched northwards up the valley of the Tiber and
                    into Umbria at the head of four Roman legions and a still larger force of
                    Italian allies. At Sentinum, on the further side of the Apennines, they
                    encountered the united forces of the Celts and Samnites, the Etruscans and
                    Umbrians having, it is said, been withdrawn for the defence of their own homes.
                    The battle that followed was desperate, and the Romans lost one of their
                    consuls, Decius, and more than 8000 men. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Livy, x. 27. </p></note> But the Roman victory was decisive.
                    The Celts were annihilated, and the fear of a second Celtic attack on Rome
                    removed. All danger from the coalition was over. The Etruscan communities gladly
                    purchased peace by the payment of indemnities. The rising in Umbria, never
                    formidable, died away, and the Samnites were left single-handed to bear the
                    whole weight of the wrath of Rome. During four years more, however, they
                    desperately defended their highland homes, and twice at least, in 293 and 292,
                    they managed to place in the field a force sufficient to meet the Roman legions
                    on equal terms. At last, in 290, the consul M. Curius Dentatus finally exhausted
                    their power of resistance. Peace was concluded, and it is significant of the
                    respect inspired at Rome by their indomitable courage that they were allowed to
                    become the allies of Rome, on equal terms and without any sacrifice of
                    independence. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, <hi

                    interposed between her possible enemies in the north and those in the south.
                    North of the Picentes lay the territories of the Celtic Senones, stretching
                    inland to the north-east borders of Etruria, and these too now fell into her
                    hands. Ten years after their defeat at Sentinum (285-284) a Celtic force
                    descended into Etruria, besieged Arretium, and defeated the relieving force
                    despatched by Rome. In 283 the consul L. Cornelius Dolabella was sent to avenge
                    the insult. He completely routed the Senones. Their lands were annexed by Rome,
                    and a colony established at Sena on the coast. This success, followed as it was
                    by the decisive defeat of the neighbouring tribe of the Boii, who had invaded
                    Etruria and penetrated as far south as the Vadimonian Lake, awed the Celts into
                    quiet, and for more than forty years there was comparative tranquillity in
                    northern Italy. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy,

                <p>In the south, however, the claims of Rome to supremacy were now to be disputed by
                    a new and formidable foe. At the close of the Third Samnite War the Greek cities
                    on the southern coast of Italy found themselves once more harassed by the
                    Sabellian tribes on their borders, whose energies, no longer absorbed by the
                    long struggles in central Italy, now found an attractive opening southward.
                    Naturally enough the Greeks, like the Capuans sixty years before, appealed for
                    aid to Rome (283-282), and like the Capuans they offered in return to recognize
                    the suzerainty of the great Latin republic. In reply a Roman force under C.
                    Fabricius marched into South Italy, easily routed the marauding bands of
                    Lucanians, Bruttians, and Samnites, and established Roman garrisons in Locri.
                    Croton, Rhegium, and Thurii. At Tarentum, the most powerful and flourishing of
                    the Greek seaports, this sudden and rapid advance of Rome excited the greatest
                    anxiety. . Tarentum was already allied by treaty (301) with Rome, and she had
                    now to decide whether this treaty should be exchanged for one which would place
                    her, like the other Greek communities, under the protectorate of Rome, or
                    whether she should find some ally able and willing to assist in making a last
                    stand for independence. The former course, in Tarentum, as before at Capua, was
                    the one favoured by the aristocratic party; the latter was eagerly supported by
                    the mass of the people and their leaders. While matters were still in suspense,
                    the appearance, contrary to . the treaty, of a Roman squadron off the harbour
                    decided the controversy. The Tarentines, indignant at the insult, attacked the
                    hostile fleet, killed the admiral, and sunk most of the ships. Still Rome,
                    relying probably on her partisans in the city, tried negotiation, and an
                    alliance appeared likely after all, when suddenly the help for which the
                    Tarentine democrats had been looking appeared, and war with Rome was resolved
                    upon (281-280). <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy,

                <p>King Pyrrhus, whose timely appearance seemed for the moment to have saved the
                    independence of Tarentum, was the most brilliant of the military adventurers
                    whom the disturbed times following the death of Alexander the Great had brought
                    into prominence. High-spirited, generous, and ambitious, he had formed the
                    scheme of rivalling Alexander’s achievements in the East, by winning for himself
                    an empire in the West. He aspired not only to unite under his rule the Greek
                    communities of Italy and Sicily, but to overthrow the great Phoenician state of
                    Carthage—the natural enemy of Greeks in the West, as Persia had been in the
                    East. Of Rome it is clear that he <pb break="no"

                    Greek seaports of their barbarian foes he no doubt regarded as an easy one; and
                    the splendid force he brought with him was intended rather for the conquest of
                    the West than for the preliminary work of chastising a few Italian tribes, or
                    securing the submission of the Unwarlike Italian Greeks. Pyrrhus’s first measure
                    was to place Tarentum under a strict military discipline; this done he advanced
                    into Lucania to meet the Roman consul Laevinus. The battle which followed, on
                    the banks of the Liris, ended in the complete defeat of the Roman troops,
                    largely owing to the panic caused by the elephants which Pyrrhus had brought
                    with him (280). <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pliu.,
                    <hi rend="italic">X. H.,</hi> viii. 6. </p></note> The Greek cities expelled
                    their Roman garrisons and joined him, while numerous bands of Samnites,
                    Lucauians, and Bruttians flocked to his standard. But, to the disappointment of
                    his Greek and Italian allies, Pyrrhus showed no anxiety to follow up the
                    advantage he had gained. His heart was set on Sicily and Africa, and his
                    immediate object was to effect such an arrangement with Rome as would at once
                    fulfil the pledges he had given to the Greeks by securing them against Roman
                    interference and set himself free to seek his fortunes westward. But, though his
                    favourite minister Cineas employed all his skill to win the ear of the senate,
                    and, though Pyrrhus himself lent weight to his envoy’s words by advancing as
                    near Rome as Anagnia (279), nothing could shake the resolution of the senate,
                    and Cineas brought back the reply that the Romans could not treat with Pyrrhus
                    so long as he remained in arms upon Italian soil. Disappointed in his hopes of
                    peace, Pyrrhus in the next year (278) turned his forces against the Roman
                    strongholds in Apulia. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Plut., <hi rend="italic">Pyrrh.</hi> , 21. </p></note> Once more, at
                    Ascu-lum, he routed the legions, but only to find that the indomitable
                    resolution of the enemy was strengthened by defeat. Weary of a struggle which
                    threatened indefinitely to postpone the fulfilment of his dreams of empire,
                    Pyrrhus resolved to quit Italy, and, leaving garrisons in the Greek towns,
                    crossed into Sicily. Here his success at first was such as promised the speedy
                    realization of his hopes. The Sicilian Greeks hailed him as a deliverer; the
                    Carthaginians were driven back to the extreme west of the island, and Eryx and
                    Panormus fell into his hands. But at this point fortune deserted him. His
                    efforts to take Lilybaeum were fruitless; the Carthaginians recovered their
                    courage, while the unstable Greeks, easily daunted by the first threatenings of
                    failure, and impatient of the burdens of war, broke out into open murmurs
                    against him. Soured and disappointed, Pyrrhus returned to Italy (276) to find
                    the Roman legions steadily moving southwards, and his Italian allies disgusted
                    by his desertion of their cause. One of the consuls for the year (275), M.
                    Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of Samnium, was encamped at Beneventum awaiting
                    the arrival of his colleague. Here Pyrrhus attacked him, and the closing battle
                    of the war was fought. It ended in the complete victory of the Romans. Pyrrhus,
                    unable any longer to face his opponents in the field, and disappointed of all
                    assistance from his allies, retreated in disgust to Tarentum and thence crossed
                    into Greece. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, <hi

                <p>A few years later (272) Tarentum was surrendered to Rome by its Epirot garrison;
                    it was granted a treaty of alliance, but its walls were razed and its fleet
                    handed over to Rome. In 270 Rhegium also entered the ranks of Roman allies, and
                    finally in 269 a single campaign crushed the last efforts at resistance in
                    Samnium. Rome was now at leisure to consolidate the position she had won.
                    Between 273 and 263 three new colonies were founded in Samnium and
                    Lucania—Paestum in 273, Beneventum in</p>
                <p>268, Aesernia in 263. In central Italythe area of Roman territory was increased
                    by the full enfranchisement (268) of the Sabines, <note anchored="true"

                <p>Rome was now the undisputed mistress of Italy. The limits of her supremacy to the
                    north were represented roughly by a line drawn across the peninsula from the
                    mouth of the Arno on the west to that of the Aesis on the east. <note

                    the provincials, were not the subjects, but the “allies and friends” of the

                    i. 428, note. </p></note> Marvellous as are the perseverance and skill with
                    which Rome built up, consolidated, and directed this confederacy, it is yet
                    clear that both her success in forming it and its stability when formed were due
                    in part to other causes than Roman valour and policy. The disunion which, in
                    former times, had so often weakened the Italians in their struggles with Rome
                    still told in her favour, and rendered the danger of a combined revolt against
                    her authority remote in the extreme. In some cases, and especially in the city
                    states of Etruria, Campania, and Magna Graecia, where the antagonism of the two
                    political parties, aristocrats and democrats, was keen, Rome found natural and
                    valuable allies in the former. Among the more backward peoples of central Italy,
                    the looseness of their political organization not only lessened their power of
                    resistance, but enabled Rome either to detach tribe after tribe from the
                    confederacy or to attack and crush them singly. Elsewhere she was aided by
                    ancient feuds, such as those between Samnites and Apulians, or Tarentines and
                    Iapygians, or by the imminent dread of a foe—Celt, or Samnite, or Lucanian—whom
                    Roman aid alone could repel. And, while combination against her was thus
                    rendered difficult, if not impossible, by internal dissensions, feuds,
                    differences of interest, of race, of language, and habits, Rome herself, from
                    her position in the centre of Italy, was so placed as to be able to strike
                    promptly, on the first signs of concerted opposition. All these advantages Rome
                    utilized to the utmost. We have no means of deciding how far she applied
                    elsewhere the principle upon which she acted in northern Etruria and Campania,
                    of attaching the aristocratic party in a community to Roman interests, by the
                    grant of special privileges; but it is certain that she endeavoured by every
                    means in her power to perpetuate, and even to increase, the disunion which she
                    had found so useful among her allies. In every possible way she strove to
                    isolate them from each other, while binding them closely to herself. The old
                    federal groups were in most cases broken up, and each of the members united with
                    Rome by a special treaty of alliance. In Etruria, Latium, Campania, and Magna
                    Graecia the city state was taken as the unit; in central Italy, where urban life
                    was non-existent, the unit was the tribe. The northern Sabellian peoples, for
                    instance,—the Marsi, Paeligni, Vestini, Marrucini, Frentani,—were now <pb

                    with Rome. In many cases, too, no freedom of trade or intermarriage was allowed
                    between the allies themselves, a policy afterwards systematically pursued in the
                    provinces. Nor were all these numerous allied communities placed on the same
                    footing as regarded their relations with Rome herself. To begin with, a sharp
                    distinction was drawn between the “Latini” and the general mass of Italian
                    allies. The “Latins” of this period had little more than the name in common with
                    the old thirty Latin peoples of the days of Spurius Cassius. With a few
                    exceptions, such as Tibur and Praeneste, the latter had either disappeared or
                    had been incorporated with the Roman state, and the Latins of 268 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> were almost exclusively the “Latin colonies,” that is
                    to say, communities founded by Rome, composed of men of Roman blood, and whose
                    only claim to the title “Latin” lay in the fact that Rome granted to them some
                    portion of the rights and privileges formerly enjoyed by the old Latin cities
                    under the Cassian treaty. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    fact offshoots of Rome herself, bound to her by community of race, language, and
                    interest, and planted as Roman garrisons among alien and conquered peoples. The
                    Roman citizen who joined a Latin colony lost his citizenship,—to have allowed
                    him to retain it would no doubt have been regarded as enlarging too rapidly the
                    limits of the citizen body; but he received in exchange the status of a favoured
                    ally. The Latin colony did not indeed enjoy the equality and independence
                    originally possessed by the old Latin cities. It had no freedom of action
                    outside its own territory, could not make war or peace, and was bound to have
                    the same friends and foes as Rome. But its members had the right of commercium

                    Roman citizens. Provided they left sons and property to represent them at home,
                    they were free to migrate to Rome and acquire the Roman franchise. In war time
                    they not only shared in the booty, but claimed a portion of any land confiscated
                    by Rome and declared “public.” These privileges, coupled with their close
                    natural affinities with Rome, successfully secured the fidelity of the Latin
                    colonies, which became not only the most efficient props of Roman supremacy, but
                    powerful agents in the work of Romanizing Italy. Below the privileged Latins
                    stood the Italian allies; and here again we know generally that there were
                    considerable differences of status, determined in each case by the terms of
                    their respective treaties with Rome. We are told that the Greek cities of
                    Neapolis and Heraclea were among the most favoured; <note anchored="true"

                <p>Rome, however, did not rely only on this policy of isola tion. Her allies were
                    attached as closely to herself as they were clearly separated from each other,
                    and from the first she took every security for the maintenance of her own
                    paramount authority. Within its own borders, each ally was left to manage its
                    own affairs as an independent state. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    provinces—the resident magistrate and the tribute—were unknown in Italy. But in
                    all points affecting the relations of one ally with another, in all questions of
                    the general interests of Italy and of foreign policy, the decision rested solely
                    with Rome. The place of a federal constitution, of a federal council, of federal
                    officers, was filled by the Roman senate, assembly, and magistrates. The
                    maintenance of peace and order in Italy, the defence of the coasts and
                    frontiers, the making of war or peace with foreign powers, were matters the
                    settlement of which Rome kept entirely in her own hands. Each allied state, in
                    time of war, was called upon for a certain contingent of men, but, though its
                    contingent usually formed a distinct corps under officers of its own, its
                    numerical strength was fixed by Rome, it was brigaded with the Roman legions,
                    and was under the orders of the Roman consul. <note anchored="true"

                <p>This paramount authority of Rome throughout the peninsula was confirmed and
                    justified by the fact that Rome herself was now infinitely more powerful than
                    any one of her numerous allies. Her territory, as distinct from that of the
                    allied states, covered something like one-third of the peninsula south of the
                    Aesis. Along the west coast it stretched from Caere to the southern borders of
                    Campania. Inland, it included the former territories of the Aequi and Hernici,
                    the Sabine country, and even extended eastward into Picenum, while beyond these
                    limits were outlying districts, such as the lands of the Senonian Celts, with
                    the Roman colony of Sena, and others elsewhere in Italy, which had been
                    confiscated by Rome and given over to Roman settlers. Since the first important
                    annexation of territory after the capture of Veii (396), twelve new tribes had
                    been formed, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Four in

                    the Aequian and Hemican territory (299). The total of thirty-five was completed
                    in 241 by formation of the Velina and Quirina, probably in the Sabineand
                    Picentine districts, enfranchised in 268. See Beloch, 32. </p></note> and the
                    number of male citizens registered at the census had risen from 152,000 to

                    Within this enlarged Roman state were now included numerous communities with
                    local institutions and government. At their head stood the Roman colonies
                    (“coloniae civium Romanorum ”), founded to guard especially the coasts of Latium
                    and Canqjania. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ostia,

                    which had been invested with the full Roman franchise, such, for instance, as
                    the old Latin towns of Aricia, Lanuvium, Tusculum, Nomentum, and Pedum. Lowest
                    in the scale were those which had riot been considered ripe for the full
                    franchise, but had, like Caere, received instead the “civitas sine suffragio,”
                    the civil without the political rights. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    were also the groups of Roman settlers on the public lands, and the dwellers in
                    the village communities of the enfranchised highland districts in central

                <p>The administrative needs of this enlarged Rome were obviously such as could not
                    be adequately satisfied by the system which had done well enough fur a small
                    city state with a few square miles of territory. The old centralization of all
                    government in Rome itself had become an impossibility, and the Roman statesmen
                    did their best to meet the altered requirements of the time. The urban
                    communities within the Roman pale, colonies and muni<pb break="no"

                    self-government. In all we find local assemblies, senates, and magistrates, to
                    whose hands the ordinary routine of local administration was confided, and, in
                    spite of differences in detail, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the titles and
                    numbers of the magistrates, the same type of constitution prevailed throughout.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For details, see
                    Beloch, <hi rend="italic">Ital. Bund,</hi> caps, v., vi., vii. The enfranchised
                    communities in most cases retained the old titles for their magistrates, and
                    hence the variety in their designations. </p></note> But these local authorities
                    were carefully subordinated to the higher powers in Rome. The local constitution
                    could be modified or revoked by the Roman senate and assembly, aud the local
                    magistrates, no less than the ordinary members of the community, were subject to
                    the paramount authority of the Roman consuls, praetors, and censors. In
                    particular, care was taken to keep the administration of justice well under
                    central control. The Roman citizen in a colony or municipium enjoyed of course
                    the right of appeal to the Roman people in a capital case. We may also assume
                    that from the first some limit was placed to the jurisdiction of the local
                    magistrate, and that cases falling outside it came before the central
                    authorities. But</p>
                <p>. an additional safeguard for the equitable and uniform administration of Roman
                    law, in communities to many of which the Roman code was new and unfamiliar, was
                    provided by the institution of prefects (“praefecti juri dicundo”), <note

                    annually, as representatives of the Roman praetor, to administer j ustice in the
                    colonies and municipia. To prefects was, moreover, assigned the charge of those
                    districts within the Roman pale where no urban communities, and consequently no
                    organized local government, existed. In these two institutions, that of
                    municipal government and that of prefectures, we have already two of the
                    cardinal points of the later imperial system of government.</p>
                <p>A word must lastly be said of the changes which the altered position and
                    increased responsibilities of Rome had effected in her military system. <note

                    thus prepared the ιvay for that complete breach between the two which in the end
                    proved fatal to the republic. It is true that service in the legion was still
                    the first duty and the highest privilege of the fully qualified citizen. Every
                    “assiduus” was still liable to active military service between the ages of
                    seventeen to forty-five, and “proletarii” aud freedmen were still called out
                    only in great emergencies, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    was gradually altering in character. Though new legions were still raised each
                    year for the summer campaigns, this was by no means always accompanied, as
                    formerly, by the disbandment of those already on foot, and this increase in the
                    length of time during which the citizen was kept with the standards had, as
                    early as the siege of Veii, necessitated a further deviation from the old theory
                    of military service—the introduction of pay. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, iv. 59. </p></note> Hardly less
                    important than these changes were those which had taken place in the
                    organization of the legion itself. In the early days of the republic the same
                    divisions served for the soldier in the legion and the citizen in the assembly.
                    The Roman army in the field, and the Roman people in the comitia on the Campus,
                    were alike grouped according to their wealth, in classes and centuriae. But by
                    the time of the Latin war the arrangement of the legion had been wholly altered.
                    In the new manipular system, with its three lines, no regard was paid to civic
                    distinctions, but only to length of service and military efficiency, while at
                    the same time the more open order of fighting which it involved demanded of each
                    soldier greater skill, and therefore a more thorough training in arms thau the
                    old phalanx. One other change resulted from the new military necessities of the
                    time, which was as fruitful of results as the incipient separation between the
                    citizen and the soldier. The citizen soldiers of early Rome were commanded in
                    the field by the men whom they had chosen to be their chief magistrates at home,
                    and still, except when a dictator was appointed, the chief command of the
                    legions rested with the consuls of the year. But, as Rome’s military operations
                    increased in area and in distance from Rome, a larger staff became necessary,
                    and the inconvenience of summoning home a consul in the field from an unfinished
                    campaign became intolerable. The remedy found, that of prolonging for a further
                    period the imperium of the consul, was first applied in 327 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> in the case of Q. Publilius Philo, <note anchored="true"

                    “prorogatio imperii” became increasingly common. This proconsular authority,
                    originally an occasional and subordinate one, was destined to become first of
                    all the strongest force in the republic, and ultimately the chief prop of the
                    power of the Caesars. Already, within the limits of Italy, Rome had laid the
                    foundation stones of the system by which she afterwards governed the world,—the
                    municipal constitutions, the allied states, the proconsuls, and the
                    prefects.</p>

                    West.—</hi> Though marked out by her geographical position as the natural centre
                    of the Mediterranean, Italy had hitherto played no active part in Mediterranean
                    politics, but, now that she was for the first time united, it was felt
                    throughout the Mediterranean world that a new power had arisen, and Rome, as the
                    head and representative of Italy, found herself irresistibly drawn into the
                    vortex of Mediterranean affairs. With those of the eastern Mediterranean indeed
                    she was not immediately called upon to concern herself. Her repulse of Pyrrhus,
                    and the news that the Greek cities of South Italy had acknowledged her
                    suzerainty, had, it is true, suddenly revealed to the Eastern world the
                    existence of a powerful Italian state. Egypt sought her alliance, and Greek
                    scholars began to interest themselves keenly in the history, constitution, and
                    character of the Latin republic which had so suddenly become famous. But this
                    was all, and not until fifty years after the retreat of Pyrrhus did Rome
                    seriously turn her attention eastward. Westward of Italy the case was different.
                    The western coasts of the peninsula were the most fertile and populous and
                    wealthy, and it was westward rather than eastward that the natural openings for
                    Italian commerce were to be found. But it was precisely on this side that Rome
                    had serious ground for anxiety. Carthage was now at the height of her power. Her
                    outposts were threateningly near to Italy in Sardiuia and in Sicily, while her
                    fleets swept the seas and jealously guarded for the benefit of Carthage alone
                    the hidden treasures of the West. In the east of Sicily, Syracuse still upheld
                    the cause of Greek independence against the hereditary foe of the Greek race;
                    but Syracuse stood alone, and her resources were comparatively small. What Rome
                    had to fear was the establishment, and that at no distant date, of an absolute
                    Carthaginian domination over the Western seas—a domination which would not only
                    be fatal to Italian commerce but would be a standing menace to the safety of the
                    Italian coasts. Rome had indeed long been <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0770-0747"/>connected with Carthage by treaty, and the older
                    purely commercial treaties had quite recently been replaced by a close alliance
                    formed in face of the common danger to which both had been exposed by the
                    adventurous schemes of Pyrrhus. But this danger was past, and it is probable
                    that others besides Pyrrhus foresaw that on the old battleground of Greeks and
                    Phoenicians a struggle must soon be fought out between the Phoenician mistress
                    of the Italian seas and the rulers of the Italian peninsula.</p>
                <p>It was above all things essential for Rome that the Carthaginians should advance
                    no farther eastward. But already in 272 Tarentum had almost fallen into their
                    grasp, and seven years later Rome was threatened with a danger at least as
                    serious, the establishment of Carthaginian rule in the east of Sicily, and
                    within sight of the Italian coast. In 265 a body of Campanian mercenaries, who
                    had seized Messana, found themselves hard pressed by Hiero, king of Syracuse.
                    One party among them appealed for aid to Carthage. The Carthaginians readily
                    responded, and a Carthaginian garrison occupied the citadel of Messana. But at
                    Messana, as once at Tarentum, there were others who turned to Rome, and, as
                    Italians themselves, implored the aid of the great Italian republic, offering in
                    return to place Messana under the suzerainty of Rome. The request was a
                    perplexing one. Both Hiero and the Carthaginians were allies of Rome, and
                    Messana, if rescued from the latter, belonged of right to Hiero and not to Rome.
                    Apart, too, from treaty obligations, the Roman senate naturally hesitated before
                    acceding to an appeal which would precipitate a collision with Carthage, and
                    commit Rome to a new and hazardous career of enterprise beyond the sea. Finally,
                    however, all other considerations gave way before the paramount importance of
                    checking the advance of Carthage. The Roman assembly voted that assistance
                    should be sent to the Mamertines, and in 264 the Roman legions for the first
                    time crossed the sea. Messana was occupied, and, after sustaining a defeat, the
                    Carthaginians and Syracusans were forced to raise the siege and withdraw. The
                    opening years of the war which was thus begun gave little promise of the length
                    of the struggle, and it seemed likely at the outset that Rome’s immediate
                    object, the expulsion of the Carthaginians from Sicily, would be soon attained.
                    The accession to the Roman side of King Hiero (263) not only confirmed the
                    position which Rome had already assumed in Italy of the champion of the western
                    Greeks against barbarians, but provided her in eastern Sicily with a convenient
                    base of operations and commodious winter quarters, and in Hiero himself with a
                    loyal and effective ally. In the next year (262) followed the capture of
                    Agrigentum, and in 261 the Roman senate resolved on supplementing these
                    successes on land by the formation of a fleet which should not only enable them
                    to attack the maritime strongholds which defied the assaults of their legions,
                    and protect their own coasts, but even to carry the war into Africa itself. In
                    the spring of 260 the first regular Roman fleet, consisting of one hundred
                    quinqueremes and twenty triremes set sail; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    and the brilliant naval victory off Mylae, won by the consul C. Duilius in the
                    same year, seemed to promise the Romans as much success by sea as they had won
                    by land. But the promise was not fulfilled; and in 256 the senate, impatient of
                    the slow progress made in Sicily, determined on boldly invading Africa. It was a
                    policy for which, if Africa were once reached, the defenceless state of the
                    Carthaginian territories, the doubtful loyalty of her Libyan subjects, and the
                    Unwarlike habits of her own citizens, gave every hope of success, and, but for
                    the blunders of the Romans themselves, it might have succeeded now as it did
                    fifty years later. The passage to Africa was opened by the defeat of the
                    Carthaginian fleet off Ecnomus; the two consuls, L. Manlius Vulso and M. Atilius
                    Regulus, landed in safety and rapidly overran the country. But these successes
                    led the senate, at the close of the summer, into committing the serious blunder
                    of recalling one of the consuls, Manlius, with a large portion of the troops. It
                    was one of many instances in which the rules and traditions of the old
                    republican system proved themselves inconsistent with the new requirements of an
                    extended warfare. The consul came back to hold the elections; his soldiers
                    returned, as the custom had been, to their homes after a summer’s campaign; but
                    the efficiency of the expedition was fatally impaired. The rashness and
                    over-confidence of Regulus aggravated the effects of the senate’s action.
                    Emboldened by further successes, and notwithstanding his diminished forces, he
                    met the Carthaginian proposals for peace by terms so harsh that the latter,
                    though the Romans were almost at their gates, their soldiers disheartened, and
                    the nomad tribes swarming on their frontiers, indignantly broke off the
                    negotiations and prepared to resist to the last. At this crisis, so the story
                    runs, the arrival of Xanthippus, a Spartan soldier of fortune, changed the face
                    of affairs, as that of Gylippus had formerly done at Syracuse. His superior
                    military skill remedied the blunders of the Carthaginian generals; confidence
                    was restored; and in 255 he triumphantly routed the Roman forces a few <hi

                    Roman camp on the coast. Here they were rescued by a Roman fleet, but their
                    ill-fortune pursued them. On its way home the fleet was wrecked, and all but 80
                    vessels out of a total of 364 were lost.</p>
                <p>Still, though abandoning all thoughts of invading Africa, the Romans were
                    unwilling to renounce all thoughts of facing their enemy on the sea. But fresh
                    disasters followed. The hopes raised (254) by the capture of £ Panormus were
                    dashed to the ground the next year (253) £ by the total destruction in a storm
                    of the victorious fleet on its way home from Panormus to Rome. Four years later
                    a second fleet, despatched under P. Claudius to assist in the blockade of
                    Lilybaeum, was completely defeated off Drepana, while, to make matters worse,
                    his colleague L. Junius, who had been hastily sent out with reinforcements, was
                    wrecked near the dangerous promontory of Pachynus.</p>
                <p>Disheartened by these repeated disasters, the senate resolved to trust only to
                    the legions, and by sheer force of perseverance slowly to force the enemy out of
                    the few positions to which he still clung in Sicily. But, though for five years
                    (248-243) no fresh naval operations were £ attempted, no compensating success by
                    land followed. Hamilcar Barca, the new Carthaginian commander, not only ravaged
                    with his fleet the coasts of Italy, but from his impregnable position at Ercte
                    incessantly harassed the Roman troops in the west of the island, and even
                    recaptured Eryx. Convinced once more of the impossibility of driving the
                    Carthaginians out of Sicily as long as their navy swept the seas, the Romans
                    determined on a final effort. The treasury was empty; but by the liberal
                    contributions of private citizens a fleet was equipped, and C. Lutatius Catulus,
                    consul for 242, started for Sicily early 5 in the summer of that year with 200
                    quinqueremes. From Drepana, whither he had gone to aid in the blockade, he
                    sailed out to meet a Carthaginian fleet, despatched from Africa against him; and
                    a battle took place at the Aegates islands, some 20 miles from the Sicilian
                    coast, in which Catulus completely defeated his enemy. The end <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0771-0748"/>of the long struggle had come at last. The
                    Carthaginian government, despairing of being able to send further aid to their
                    troops in Sicily, authorized Hamilcar to treat for peace. His proposals were
                    accepted by Catulus, and the terms agreed upon between them were confirmed in
                    all essential points by the commissioners sent out from Rome. The Carthaginians
                    agreed to evacuate Sicily and the adjoining islands, to restore all prisoners,
                    and to pay an indemnity of 2300 talents.</p>
                <p>In its duration and its severity the First Punic War is justly ranked by Polybius
                    above all other wars of his own and preceding times, though neither in the
                    military talent displayed nor in the importance of its results can it be
                    compared with the war that followed. It was distinguished by no military
                    achievement comparable with Hannibal’s invasion of Italy, and with the single
                    exception of Hamilcar it produced no general of the calibre of Hannibal or
                    Scipio. It was in fact a struggle in which both Rome and Carthage were serving
                    an apprenticeship in a warfare the conditions of which were unfamiliar to both.
                    The Roman legions were foes very unlike any against which the Carthaginian
                    leaders had ever led their motley array of mercenaries, while Rome was called
                    upon for the first time to fight a war across the sea, and to fight with ships
                    against the greatest naval power of the age. The novelty of these conditions
                    accounts for much of the vacillating and uncertain action observable on both
                    sides, and their effect in this direction was increased by the evident doubts
                    felt by both antagonists as to the lengths to which the quarrel should be
                    pushed. It is possible that Hamilcar had already made up his mind that Rome must
                    be attacked and crushed in Italy, but his government attempted nothing more than
                    raids upon the coast. There are indications also that some in the Roman senate
                    saw no end to the struggle but in the destruction of Carthage; yet an invasion
                    of Africa was only once seriously attempted, and then only a halfhearted support
                    was given to the expedition. But these peculiarities in the war served to bring
                    out in the clearest relief the strength and the weakness of the two contending
                    states. The chief dangers for Carthage lay obviously in the jealousy exhibited
                    at home of her officers abroad, in the difficulty of controlling her mercenary
                    troops, and in the ever-present possibility of disaffection among her subjects
                    in Libya,—dangers which even the genius of Hannibal failed finally to surmount.
                    Rome, on the other hand, was strong in the public spirit of her citizens, the
                    fidelity of her allies, the valour and discipline of her legions. What she
                    needed was a system which should make a better use of her splendid materials
                    than one under which her plans were shaped from day to day by a divided senate,
                    and executed by officers who were changed every year, and by soldiers most of
                    whom returned home at the close of each summer’s campaign.</p>
                <p>The interval between the First and Second Punic Wars was employed by both Rome
                    and Carthage in strengthening their respective positions. Of the islands lying
                    off the coast of Italy, the most important, Sicily, had fallen to Rome as the
                    prize of the recent war. The eastern end of the island was still left under the
                    rule of King Hiero as the ally of Rome, but the larger western portion became
                    directly subject to Rome, and a temporary arrangement seems to have been made
                    for its government, either by one of the two praetors, or possibly by a
                    quaestor. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Marquardt,

                    and settled government, not only in Sardinia and Corsica, but also in Sicily. In
                    that year two additional praetors were elected; to one was assigned the charge
                    of western Sicily, to the other that of Sardinia and Corsica, <note

                    system were laid. Of at least equal importance for the security of the peninsula
                    was the subjugation of the Celtic tribes in the valley of the Po. These, headed
                    by the Boii and Insubres and assisted by levies from the Celts to the westward,
                    had in 225 alarmed the whole of Italy by invading Etruria and penetrating to
                    Clusium, only three days’ journey from Rome. Here, however, their courage seems
                    to have failed them. They retreated northward along the Etruscan coast, until at
                    Telamon their way was barred by the Roman legions, returning from Sardinia to
                    the defence of Rome, while a second consular army hung upon their rear. Thus
                    hemmed in, the Celts fought desperately, but were completely defeated and the
                    flower of their tribesmen slain. The Romans followed up their success by
                    invading the Celtic territory. The Boii were easily reduced to submission. The
                    Insubres, north of the Po, resisted more obstinately, but by 222 the war was
                    over, and all the tribes in the rich Po valley acknowledged the supremacy of
                    Rome. The conquered Celts were not enrolled among the Italian allies of Rome,
                    but were treated as subjects beyond the frontier. Three colonies were founded to
                    hold them in check—Placentia and Cremona in the territory ol the Insubres,
                    Mutina in that of the Boii; and the great northern road (Via Flaminia) was
                    completed as far as the Celtic border at Ariminum.</p>
                <p>On the Adriatic coast, where there was no Carthage tc be feared, and no important
                    adjacent islands to be annexed, the immediate interests of Rome were limited to
                    rendering the sea safe for Italian trade. It was with this object that, in 229,
                    the first Roman expedition crossed the Adriatic, and inflicted severe
                    chastisement on the Illyriac pirates of the opposite coast. <note

                    But the results of the expedition did not end here, for it was the means of
                    establishing for the first time direct political relations between Rome and the
                    states of Greece proper, to many of which the suppression of piracy in the
                    Adriatic was of as much importance as to Rome herself. Alliances were concluded
                    with Corcyra, Epidamnus, and Apollonia; and embassies explaining the reasons
                    which had brought Roman troops into Greece were sent to the Aetolians, the
                    Achaeans, and even to Athens and Corinth. Everywhere they were well received,
                    and the admission of the Romans to the Isthmian games <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Polyb., ii. 12. </p></note> (228) formally
                    acknowledged them as the natural allies of the free Greek states against both
                    barbarian tribes and foreign despots, a relationship which was destined to prove
                    as useful to Rome in the East as it had already proved itself to be in the
                    West.</p>
                <p>While Rome was thus fortifying herself on all sides, Carthage had acquired a
                    possession which promised to compensate her for the loss of Sicily, Sardinia,
                    and Corsica. The genius of her greatest citizen and soldier, Hamilcar Barca, had
                    appreciated the enormous value of the Spanish peninsula, and conceived the
                    scheme of founding there a Carthaginian dominion which should not only add to
                    the wealth of Carthage, but supply her with troops, and with a base of
                    operations for that war of revenge with Rome on which his heart was set. The
                    conquest of southern and eastern Spain, begun by Hamilcar (236-228), and carried
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n772/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0772-0749"/>on by his kinsman Hasdrubal (228-221), was
                    completed by his son Hannibal, who, with all his father’s genius, inherited also
                    his father’s hatred of Rome, and by 219 the authority of Carthage had been
                    extended as far as the Ebro. Rome had not watched this rapid advance without
                    anxiety, but, probably owing to her troubles with the Celts, she had contented
                    herself with stipulating (226) that Carthage should not carry her arms beyond
                    the Ebro, so as to threaten Rome’s ancient ally, the Greek Massilia, and with
                    securing the independence of the two nominally Greek communities, Emporiae and
                    Saguntum, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, xxi. 2,
                    5; Polyb.,liii. 15, 31. </p></note> on the east coast.</p>
                <p>But these precautions were of no avail against the resolute determination of
                    Hannibal, with whom the conquest of Spain was only preliminary to an attack upon
                    Italy, and who could not afford to leave behind him in Spain a state allied to
                    Rome. In 219, therefore, disregarding the protests of a Roman embassy, he
                    attacked and took Saguntum, an act which, as he had foreseen, rendered a rupture
                    with Rome inevitable, while it set his own hands free for a further advance.</p>
                <p>A second war with Carthage was no unlooked-for event at Rome; but the senate
                    seems to have confidently expected that it would be waged at a distance from
                    Italy—in Africa and in Spain, where Saguntum would have given them a convenient
                    point of support; and to this hope they clung even after Saguntum was lost. In
                    218, the first year of the war, one consul, P. Cornelius Scipio, was despatched
                    to Spain, and the other, T. Sempronius Gracchus, to Sicily, and thence to
                    Africa. But Hannibal’s secrecy and promptitude baffled all their calculations.
                    Leaving New Carthage early in 218, in the space of five months he crossed the
                    Pyrenees, reached the Rhone just as Scipio arrived at Massilia on his way to
                    Spain, passed the Alps in spite of endless difficulties and hardships, and
                    startled Italy by descending into the plains of Cisalpine Gaul. In two battles
                    on the Ticinus and the Trebia he defeated the forces hastily collected to bar
                    his progress southwards; the Celtic tribes rallied to his standard; and at the
                    beginning of the next year he prepared to realize the dream of his life and
                    carry fire and sword into Italy itself. His own force numbered 26,000 men; the
                    total available strength of Rome and her allies was estimated at over 700,OOO.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Polybius (ii. 24 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.)</hi> enumerates the forces of Rome and her allies at the time

                    Hannibal’s hope lay in the possibility that by the rapidity of his movements he
                    might be able to strike a decisive blow before Rome could mobilize her levies,
                    or get her somewhat cumbrous military machinery into working order. From a first
                    success he expected no less a result than the break up of the Roman confederacy,
                    and the isolation of Rome herself, while it would also increase the readiness of
                    his own government to render him effective support. His trust in himself and his
                    army was not misplaced, for to the last he had the advantage over the Roman
                    legions wherever he met them in person. Except, however, in South Italy, his
                    brilliant victories and dashing marches brought him no allies, and it was his
                    inability to shake the loyalty of northern and central Italy and of the Latin
                    colonies everywhere, even more than the indomitable perseverance of Rome and the
                    supineness of Carthage, which caused his ultimate failure.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 217 Hannibal crossed the Apennines and marched southwards
                    through the lowlands of eastern Etruria, the route taken before him by the
                    Celtic hordes. In April he annihilated Flaminius and his army at the Trasimene
                    Lake, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the date see

                    Spoletium, only a few days’ march from Rome. But Rome was not yet his goal; from
                    Spoletium, which had closed its gates against him, he moved rapidly eastward,
                    ravaging the territories of Roman allies as he went, till he reached the
                    Adriatic and the fertile lands of northern Apulia, where supplies and especially
                    remounts for his Numidian cavalry <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Livy, xxiv. 20. </p></note> were plentiful, and
                    communication with Carthage easy, and where, moreover, he was well placed for
                    testing the fidelity of the most recent and the least trustworthy of the Italian
                    allies of Rome. A second victory here, on the scale of that at the Trasimene
                    Lake, might be the signal for a general revolt against Roman rule. It was not,
                    however, until the summer of the next year that his opportunity came. The
                    patient tactics of Q. Fabius Cunctator had become unpopular at Rome; and the
                    consuls of 216, L. Aemilius Paulus and M. Terentius Varro, took the field in
                    Apulia, at the head of a larger force than Rome had yet raised, and with orders
                    to fight and crush the daring invader. The result realized for the moment
                    Hannibal’s highest hopes. The Roman army was annihilated at Cannae; and South
                    Italy, with the exception of the Latin colonies and the Greek cities on the
                    coast, came over to his side. Nor did the Roman misfortunes end here. Philip of
                    Macedon concluded an alliance with Hannibal (215), and threatened an invasion of
                    Italy. In the very next year Syracuse, no longer ruled by the faithful Hiero,
                    revolted, and a Carthaginian force landed in Sicily; lastly, in 212 came the
                    loss of the Greek cities on the south coast. But the truth of Polybius’s remark
                    that the Romans are most to be feared when their danger is greatest was never
                    better illustrated than by their conduct in the face of these accumulated
                    disasters. Patiently and undauntedly they set themselves to regain the ground
                    they had lost. Philip of Macedon was first of all forced to retire from the
                    allied city of Apollonia which he had attacked (214), and then effectually
                    diverted from all thoughts of an attack on Italy, by the formation of a
                    coalition against him in Greece itself (211); Syracuse was recaptured in 212,
                    after a lengthy siege, and Roman authority re-established in Sicily. In Italy
                    itself the Roman commanders took advantage of Hannibal’s absence in the extreme
                    south to reconquer northern Apulia; but their main efforts were directed to the
                    recovery of Campania, and above all of Capua. The imminent danger of Capua,
                    which he hg,d named as the successor of Rome in the headship of Italy, recalled
                    Hannibal from the south, where he was besieging a Roman garrison in the citadel
                    of Tarentum. Failing to break through the lines which enclosed it, he resolved,
                    as a last hope of diverting the Roman legions from the devoted city, to advance
                    on Rome itself. But his march, deeply as it impressed the imagination of his
                    contemporaries by its audacity and promptitude, was without result. Silently and
                    rapidly he moved along the course of the Latin Way, through the heart of the
                    territory of Rome, to within 3 miles of the city, and even rode up with his
                    advanced guard to the Colline gate. Yet no ally joined him; no Roman force was
                    recalled to face him; no proposals for peace reached his camp,; and, overcome,
                    it is said, by the unmoved confidence of his foe, he withdrew, as silently and
                    rapidly as he had advanced, to his headquarters in the south. The fall of Capua
                    followed inevitably (211), <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    removed to Lucania and Bruttium, and a prospect opening of some relief from the
                    exhausting exertions of the last five years. Their hopes were quickly dashed to
                    the ground. The <pb break="no"

                    beaten in Spain, was marching to join Hannibal, in Italy. The anxiety at Rome
                    was intense, and every nerve was strained to prevent the junction of the two
                    brothers. Equally great was the relief when the news arrived that the bold march
                    of the consul Claudius had succeeded, and that Hasdrubal had been defeated and
                    slain on the river Metaurus (207). The war in Italy was now virtually ended,
                    for, though during four years more Hannibal stood at bay in a corner of
                    Bruttium, he was powerless to prevent the restoration of Roman authority
                    throughout the peninsula. Sicily was once more secure; and finally in 206, the
                    year after the victory on the Metaurus, the successes of the young P. Scipio in
                    Spain (211-206) were crowned by the complete expulsion of the Carthaginians from
                    the peninsula. Nothing now remained to Carthage outside Africa but the ground on
                    which Hannibal desperately held out, and popular opinion at Rome warmly
                    supported Scipio when on his return from Spain he eagerly urged an immediate
                    invasion of Africa. The senate hesitated. Many were jealous of Scipio’s fame,
                    and resented his scarcely concealed intention of appealing to the people, should
                    the senate decline his proposals. Others, like the veteran Q. Fabius, thought
                    the attempt hazardous, with exhausted resources, and while Hannibal was still on
                    Italian soil. But Scipio gained the day. He was elected consul for 205, and
                    given the province of Sicily, with permission to cross into Africa if he thought
                    fit. Voluntary contributions of men, money, and supplies poured in to the
                    support of the popular hero; and by the end of 205 Scipio had collected in
                    Sicily a sufficient force for his purpose. In 201 he crossed to Africa, where he
                    was welcomed by the Numidian prince Masinissa, whose friendship he had made in
                    Spain. In 203 he twice defeated the Carthaginian forces, and a large party at
                    Carthage were anxious to accept his offer of negotiations. But the advocates of
                    resistance triumphed. Hannibal was recalled from Italy, and with him his brother
                    Mago, who had made a last desperate attempt to create a diversion in Italy by
                    landing in Liguria. Mago died on the voyage, but Hannibal returned to fight his
                    last battle against Rome at Zama, where Scipio, who had been continued in
                    command as proconsul for 202 by a special vote of the people, won a complete
                    victory. The war was over. The Roman assembly gladly voted that the Carthaginian
                    request for peace should be granted, and entrusted the settlement of the terms
                    to its favourite Scipio and a commission of ten senators. Carthage was allowed
                    to retain her own territory in Africa intact; but she undertook to wage no wars
                    outside Africa, and none inside without the consent of Rome. She surrendered all
                    her ships but ten triremes, her elephants, and all prisoners of war. Finally she
                    agreed to pay an indemnity of 10,000 talents in fifty years. Masinissa was
                    rewarded by an increase of territory, and was enrolled among the “allies and
                    friends” of the Roman people. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The battle of Zama decided the fate of the West. The power of Carthage was
                    broken, and her supremacy passed by the right of conquest to Rome. Henceforth
                    Rome had no rival to fear westward of Italy, and it rested with herself to
                    settle within what limits her supremacy should be confined, and what form it
                    should take. The answer to both these questions was largely determined for her
                    by circumstances. For the next fifty years Rome was too deeply involved in the
                    affairs of the East to think of extending her rule far beyond the limits of the
                    rich inheritance which had fallen to her by the defeat of Carthage; and it was
                    not until 125 that she commenced a fresh career of conquest in the West by
                    invading Transalpine Gaul. But within this area considerable advance was made in
                    the organization and consolidation of her rule. The rate of progress was indeed
                    unequal. In the case of Sicily and Spain, the immediate establishment of a Roman
                    government was imperatively necessary, if these possessions were not either to
                    fall a prey to internal anarchy, or be recovered for Carthage by some second
                    Hamilcar. Accordingly, we find that in Sicily the former dominions of Hiero were
                    at once united with the western half of the island as a single province, under
                    the rule of a Roman praetor (201), <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Sicily, assigned to one of the praetors for the year, two additional praetors
                    being elected for the purpose. But here the resemblance between the two cases
                    ends. From 201 down to the outbreak of the Slave War in 136 there was unbroken
                    peace in Sicily, and its part in the history is limited to its important
                    functions in supplying Rome with corn and in provisioning and clothing the Roman
                    legions. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, xxvii.

                    large proportion even of the land itself passed gradually into the hands of
                    enterprising Roman speculators. The governors of the two Spains had very
                    different work to do from that which fell to the lot of the Sicilian praetors.
                    Although the coast towns readily acquiesced in Roman rule, the restless and
                    warlike tribes of the interior were in a constant state of ferment, which from
                    time to time broke out into open revolt. In Sicily the ordinary praetorian
                    authority, with at most a few cohorts, was sufficient, but the condition of
                    Spain required that year after year the praetors should be armed with the
                    consular authority, and backed by a standing force of four legions, while more
                    than once the presence of the consuls themselves was found necessary. Still, in
                    spite of all difficulties, the work of pacification proceeded. To the elder Cato
                    (consul 195), and to Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (praetor and propraetor
                    180-179), father of the two tribunes, is mainly due the credit of quieting the
                    Celtiberian tribes of central Spain, and the government of Gracchus was followed
                    by thirty years of comparative tranquillity. The insurrection headed by
                    Viriathus in 149 was largely caused by the exactions of the Roman magistrates
                    themselves, while its obstinate continuance down to the capture of Numantia in
                    133, was almost as much the result of the incapacity of the Roman commanders.
                    But the re-settlement of the country by Scipio Africanus the younger in that
                    year left all Spain, with the exception of the highland Astures and Cantabri in
                    the north-west, finally and tranquilly subject to Rome. Meanwhile the disturbed
                    state of the interior had not prevented the spread of Roman civilization on the
                    seaboard. Roman traders and speculators flocked to the seaport towns and spread
                    inland. The mines became centres of Roman industry; the Roman legionaries
                    quartered in Spain year after year married Spanish wives, and when their service
                    was over gladly settled down in Spain, in preference to returning to Italy. The
                    first Roman communities established outside Italy were both planted in Spain,
                    and both owed their existence to the Roman legions. <note anchored="true"

                    201, was placed under the jealous watch of the loyal prince of Nu<pb break="no"

                    suzerainty of Rome. But it was impossible for this arrangement to be permanent.
                    Every symptom of reviving prosperity at Carthage was regarded at Rome with
                    feverish anxiety, and neither the expulsion of Hannibal in 195 nor his death in
                    183 did much to check the growing conviction that Rome would never be secure
                    while her rival existed. It was therefore with grim satisfaction that many in
                    the Roman senate watched the increasing irritation of the Carthaginians under
                    the harassing raids and encroachments of their favoured neighbour Masinissa, and
                    waited for the moment when Carthage should, by some breach of the conditions
                    imposed upon her, supply Rome with a pretext for interference. At last in 151
                    came the news that Carthage, in defiance of treaty obligations, was actually at
                    war with Masinissa. The anti-Carthaginan party in the senate, headed by M.
                    Porcius Cato, eagerly seized the opportunity, and, in spite of the protests of
                    Scipio Nasica and others, war was declared, and nothing short of the destruction
                    of their city itself was demanded from the despairing Carthaginians. This
                    demand, as the senate no doubt foresaw, was refused, and in 149 the siege of
                    Carthage begun. During the next two years little progress was made, but in 147
                    P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, son of L. Aemilius Paulus, conqueror of
                    Macedonia, and grandson by adoption of the conqueror of Hannibal was, at the age
                    of thirty-seven, and though only a candidate for the aedileship, elected consul,
                    and given the command in Africa. In the next year (146) Carthage was taken and
                    razed to the ground. Its territory became the Roman province of Africa, while
                    Numidia,.now ruled by the three sons of Masinissa, remained as an allied state
                    under Roman suzerainty, and served to protect the new province against the raids
                    of the desert tribes. Within little more than a centuryfrom the commencement of
                    the First PunicWar, the whole of the former dominions of Carthage had been
                    brought under the direct rule of Roman' magistrates, and were regularly
                    organized as Roman provinces.</p>
                <p>In Italy itself the Hannibalic war was inevitably followed by important changes,
                    and these changes were naturally enough in the direction of an increased Roman
                    predominance. In the north the Celtic tribes paid for their sympathy with
                    Hannibal with the final loss of all separate political existence. Cispadane
                    Gaul, studded with colonies, and flooded with Roman settlers, was rapidly
                    Romanized. Beyond the Po in Polybius’s time, about sixty years after the
                    Hannibalic war, Roman civilization was already widely spread. In the extreme
                    northeast the Latin colony of Aquileia, the last of its kind, was founded in
                    181, to hold in check the Alpine tribes, while in the north-west the Ligurians,
                    though not finally subdued until a later time, were held in check by the colony
                    of Luna (180), and by the extensive settlements of Roman citizens and Latins
                    made on Ligurian territory in 173. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    begun by the raids of the Sabellian tribes, was completed by the repeated blows
                    inflicted upon them during the Hannibalic struggle. Some of them lost territory;

                    land in their territories were seized by Rome, and allotted to Roman settlers,
                    or occupied by Roman speculators. That Etruria also suffered from declining
                    energy, a dwindling population, and the spread of large estates is clear from
                    the state of things existing there in 133. It was indeed in central Italy, the
                    home of the Latins and their nearest kinsmen, and in the new Latin and Roman
                    settlements throughout the peninsula that progress and activity were henceforth
                    concentrated, and even within this area the Roman, and not the strictly Latin,
                    element tended to preponderate. Of the twenty colonies founded between 201 and

                    Pyrrhus from Italy, Rome had been slowly drifting into closer contact with the
                    Eastern states. With one of the three great powers which had divided between
                    them the empire of Alexander, with Egypt, she had formed an alliance in 273, and
                    the alliance had been cemented by the growth of commercial intercourse between
                    the two countries. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Egypt had supplied corn to Italy during the Second Punic War (Polyb., ix.
                    44). </p></note> In 228 her chastisement of the Illyrian pirates had led
                    naturally enough to the establishment of friendly relations with some of the
                    states of Greece proper. Further than this, however, Rome for the time showed no
                    desire to go. The connexions already formed were sufficient to open the eastern
                    ports to her trade, and the engrossing struggle with Carthage left her neither
                    leisure nor strength for active interference in the incessant feuds and
                    rivalries which had made up Eastern politics since the falling asunder of
                    Alexander’s empire. In 214 the alliance between Philip and Hannibal, and the
                    former’s threatened attack on Italy, forced her into war with Macedon, but even
                    then she contented herself with heading a coalition of the Greek states against
                    him, which effectually frustrated his designs against herself; and at the first
                    opportunity (205) she ended the war by a peace which left the position
                    unchanged. The results of the war were not only to draw closer the ties which
                    bound Rome to the Greek states, but to inspire the senate with a genuine dread
                    of Philip’s restless ambition, and with a bitter resentment against him for his
                    union with Hannibal. The events of the next four years served to deepen both
                    these feelings. In 205 Philip entered into a compact with Antiochus of Syria for
                    the partition between them of the dominions of Egypt, <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Polyb., iii. 2, xv. 20; Livy, xxxi. 14.
                    </p></note> now left by the death of Ptolemy Philopator to the rule of a boy
                    king. Antiochus was to take Ccele-Syria and Phoenicia, while Philip claimed for
                    his share the districts subject to Egypt on the coasts of the Aegean and the
                    Greek islands. Philip no doubt hoped to be able to secure these unlawful
                    acquisitions before the close of the Second Punic War should set Rome free to
                    interfere with his plans. But the obstinate resistance offered by Attalus of
                    Perga-mum and the Rhodians upset his calculations. In 201 Rome ma*de peace with
                    Carthage, and the senate had leisure to listen to the urgent appeal for
                    assistance which reached her from her Eastern allies. With Antiochus indeed the
                    senate was not yet prepared to quarrel; Egypt was assured of the continued
                    friendship of Rome, but Antiochus was allowed to work his will in Ccele-Syria.

                    </p></note> With Philip it is clear that the senate had no thoughts of a

                    assistance he had recently rendered to Carthage. Always an unsafe and turbulent

                    in the Aegean, prove as dangerous to her interests in the East as Carthage had
                    been in the AVest; nor, lastly, could Rome, in honour, look quietly on at the
                    ill-treatment of states which, as Greeks and as allies of her own, had a double
                    claim on her protection. To cripple or at least to stay the growth of Philip’s
                    power was in the eyes of the senate a necessity, but it was only by representing
                    a AIacedonian invasion of Italy as imminent that they persuaded the assembly,
                    which was longing for peace, to pass a declaration of war <note anchored="true"

                    though the landing of the Roman legions in Epirus was not followed, as had been
                    hoped, by any general rising , against Philip, yet the latter had soon to
                    discover that, if they were not enthusiastic for Rome, they were still less
                    inclined actively to assist himself. Neither by force nor diplomacy could he
                    make any Jirogress south of Bceotia. The fleets of Pergamum and Rhodes, now the
                    zealous allies of Rome, protected Attica and watched the eastern coasts. The
                    Achaeans and Nabis of Sparta were obstinately neutral, while nearer home in the
                    north the Epirots and Aetolians threatened Thessaly and AIacedonia. His own
                    resources both in men and in money had been severely strained by his constant
                    wars, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, xxxiii. 3.
                    </p></note> and the only ally who could have given him effective assistance,
                    Antiochus, was fully occupied with the conquest of Ccele-Syria. It is no wonder
                    then that, in spite of his dashing generalship and high courage, he made but a
                    brief stand. T. Quinctius Flamininus (consul 198), in his first year of command,
                    defeated him on the Aous, drove him back to the pass of Tempe, and in the next
                    year utterly routed him at Cynos-cephalae. Almost at the same moment the
                    Achaeans, who' had now joined Rome, took Corinth, and the Rhodians defeated his
                    troops in Caria. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Rome’s main object in the war, the removal of all danger to herself and her

                    Philip was left in possession of his kingdom, but was degraded to the rank of a
                    second-rate power, deprived of all possessions in Greece, Thrace, and Asia
                    AIinor, and forbidden, as Carthage had been in 201, to wage war without the
                    consent of Rome, whose ally and friend he now became. AIacedon thus weakened
                    could no longer be formidable, but might yet be useful, not only as a barrier
                    against Thracians and Celts, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The second point in the settlement now effected by Rome was the liberation of the
                    Greeks, The “freedom of Greece” was proclaimed at the Isthmian games amid a
                    scene of wild enthusiasm, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Livy, xxxiii. 32, 33. </p></note> which reached its height when two years
                    later (194) Flamininus withdrew his trooj&gt;s even from the “three fetters of
                    Greece ”—Chalcis, Demetrias, and Corinth. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Livy, xxxiv. 48-52. </p></note> There is no reason to doubt
                    that, in acting thus, not only Flamininus himself, but the senate and people at
                    home were influenced, partly at any rate, by feelings of genuine sympathy with
                    the Greeks and reverence for their past. It is equally clear that no other
                    course was open to them. For Rome to have annexed Greece, as she had annexed
                    Sicily and Spain, would have been a flagrant violation of the pledges she had
                    repeatedly given both before and during the war; the attempt would have excited
                    the fiercest opposition, and would probably have thrown the Asiatic as well as
                    the European Greeks into the arms of Antiochus. But a friendly and independent
                    Greece would be at once a check on AIacedon, a barrier against aggression from
                    the East, and a promising field for Roman commerce. Nor while liberating the
                    Greeks did Rome abstain from such arrangements as seemed necessary to secure the
                    predominance of her own influence. In the Peloponnese, for instance, the
                    Achaeans were rewarded by considerable accessions of territory; and it is
                    possible that the Greek states, as allies of Rome, were expected to refrain from
                    war upon each other without her consent. The failure of the policy, after all,
                    was due to the impracticability of the Greeks, and the intensity of their civic
                    and tribal feuds. To suppose as some have done that Rome intended it to fail is
                    to attribute to the statesmen of the generation of Scipio and Flamininus even
                    more than the cynicism of the time of L. AIummius. <note anchored="true"

                <p>Antiochus III. of Syria, Philip’s accomplice in the pro-j&gt;osed partition of
                    the dominions of their common rival, Egypt, returned from the conquest of
                    Coele-Syria (198) to learn first of all that Philip was hard pressed by the
                    Romans, and shortly afterwards that he had been decisively beaten at
                    Cynoscephalae. It was already too late to assist his former ally, but Antiochus
                    resolved at any rate to lose no time in securing for himself the possessions of
                    the Ptolemies in Asia Alinor and in eastern Thrace, which Philip had claimed,
                    and which Rome now pronounced free and independent. In 197-196 he overran Asia
                    AIinor and crossed into Thrace. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Antiochus was pleasure-loving, irresolute, and above all no general, and it was
                    not until 192 that the urgent entreaties of the Aetolians, and the withdrawal of
                    the Roman troops from Greece, nerved him to the decisive step of crossing the
                    Aegean; and even then the force he took with him was so small as to show that he
                    completely failed to appreciate the nature of the task before him. <note

                    At Rome the prospect of a conflict with Antiochus excited great anxiety, and it
                    was not until every resource of diplomacy had been exhausted that war was
                    declared. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy,XXXV.
                    20, xxxvi. i. </p></note> At a distance, indeed, Antiochus, the great king, the
                    lord of all the forces of Asia, seemed an infinitely more formidable opponent
                    than their better known neighbour Philip, and a war against the vaguely known
                    powers of the East a far more serious matter than a campaign in Thessaly. War,
                    however, was unavoidable, unless Rome was to desert her Greek allies, and allow
                    Antiochus to advance unopposed to the coasts of the Adriatic. And the war had no
                    sooner commenced than the real weakness which lay behind the magnificent
                    pretensions of the “king of kings” was revealed.</p>
                <p>Had Antiochus acted with energy when in 192 he landed in Greece, he might have
                    won the day before the Roman legions appeared. As it was, in spite of the

                    he frittered away valuable time between his pleasures at Chalcis and useless
                    attacks on petty Thessalian towns. In 191 Glabrio landed at the head of an
                    imposing force; and a single battle at Thermopylae broke the courage of
                    Antiochus, .who hastily recrossed the sea to Ephesus, leaving his Aetolian
                    allies to their fate. But Rome could not pause here. The safety of her faithful
                    allies, the Pergamenes and Rhodians, and of the Greek cities in Asia Alinor, as
                    well as the necessity of chastising Antiochus, demanded an invasion of Asia. A

                    concert with the fleets of Pergamum and Rhodes worsted the navy of Antiochus. In
                    190 the new consul L. Scipio, accompanied by his famous brother, the conqueror
                    of Africa, led the Roman legions for the first time into Asia. At Magnesia, near
                    Mount Sipylus in Lydia, he met and defeated the motley aιid ill-disciplined
                    hosts of the great king. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    For the first time the West, under Roman leadership, successfully encountered
                    the forces of the East, and the struggle began which lasted far on into the days
                    of the emperors. The terms of the peace which followed the victory at Magnesia
                    tell their own story clearly enough. There is no question, any more than in
                    Greece, of annexation; the main object in view is that of securing the
                    predominance of Roman interests and influence throughout the peninsula of Asia
                    Minor, and removing to a safe distance the only Eastern power which could be
                    considered dangerous. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Halys and the Taurus range, the natural boundary of the peninsula eastward, was
                    established as the boundary between Antiochus and the kingdoms, cities, and
                    peoples now enrolled as the allies and friends of Rome. This line Antiochus was
                    forbidden to cross; nor was he to send ships of war farther west than Cape
                    Sarpedon in Cilicia. Immediately to the west of this frontier lay the small
                    states of Bithynia and Paphlagonia and the immigrant Celtic Galatae, and these
                    frontier states, now the allies of Rome, served as a second line of defence
                    against attacks from the east. The area lying between these “buffer states” and
                    the Aegean was organized by Rome in such a way as should at once reward the
                    fidelity of her allies and secure both her own paramount authority and safety
                    from foreign attack. Pergamum and Rhodes were so strengthened—the former by the
                    gift of the Chersonese, Lycaonia, Phrygia, Mysia, and Lydia, the latter by that
                    of Lycia and Caria—as not only amply to reward their loyalty, but to constitute
                    them effective props of Roman interests and effective barriers alike against
                    Thracian and Celtic raids in the north and against aggression by Syria in the
                    south. Lastly, the Greek cities on the coast, except those already tributary to
                    Pergamum, were declared free, and established as independent allies of Rome.</p>
                <p>In a space of little over eleven years (200-189) Rome had broken the power of
                    Alexander’s successors and established throughout the eastern Mediterranean a
                    Roman protectorate. It remained to be seen whether this protectorate could be
                    maintained, or whether Rome would be driven to that policy of annexation which
                    she had adopted from the first in Sicily and Spain.</p>
                <p>It was in the western half of the protectorate in European Greece that the first
                    steps in the direction of annexation were taken. The enthusiasm provoked by the
                    liberation of the Greeks had died away, and its place had been taken by feelings
                    of dissatisfied ambition or sullen resentment. Internecine feuds and economic
                    distress had brought many parts of Greece to the verge of anarchy, and, above
                    all, the very foundations of the settlement effected in 197 were threatened by
                    the reviving power and aspirations of Macedon. Loyally as Philip had aided Rome
                    in the war with Antiochus, the peace of Magnesia brought him nothing but fresh
                    humiliation. He was forced to abandon all hopes of recovering Thessaly, and he
                    had the mortification to see the hated king of Pergamum installed almost on his
                    borders as master of the Thracian Chersonese. Resistance at the time was
                    unavailing, but from 189 until his death (179) he laboured patiently and quietly
                    to increase the internal resources of his own kingdom, <note anchored="true"

                    to Rome among his Greek and barbarian neighbours. His successor, Perseus, his
                    son by a left-handed alliance, continued his father’s work. He made friends
                    among the Illyrian and Thracian princes, connected himself by marriage with
                    Antiochus IV. of Syria and with Prusias of Bithynia, and, among the Greek
                    peoples, strove, not without success, to revive the memories of the past glories
                    of Greece under the Macedonian leadership of the great Alexander. <note

                    The senate could no longer hesitate. They were well aware of the restlessness
                    and discontent in Greece; and after hearing from Eumenes of Pergamum, and from
                    their own officers, all details of Perseus’s intrigues and preparations they
                    declared war. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy,

                    incapacity at the outset of the Roman commanders, was short and decisive. The
                    sympathy of the Greeks with Perseus, which had been encouraged by the hitherto
                    passive attitude assumed by Rome, instantly evaporated on the news that the
                    Roman legions were on their way to Greece. No assistance came from Prusias or
                    Antiochus, and Perseus’s only allies were the Thracian king Cotys and the
                    Illyrian Genthius. The victory gained by L. Aemilius Paulus at Pydna (168) ended

                    been rejected; and his defeat was followed by the final extinction of the

                    essential for the maintenance of order—that of a resident Roman governor. The

                    controlling authority was substituted for that of the Macedonian king. The
                    inevitable result was confusion and disorder, resulting finally (149-116) in the
                    attempt of a pretender, Andriseus, who claimed to be a son of Perseus, to

                    defeat of Perseus in 167, no formal change of importance in the status of the
                    Greek states was made by Rome. The senate, though forced year after year to
                    listen to the mutual recriminations and complaints of rival communities and
                    factions, contented itself as a rule with intervening just enough to remind the
                    Greeks that their freedom was limited by its own paramount authority, and to
                    prevent any single state or confederacy from raising itself too far above the
                    level of general weakness which it was the interest of Rome to maintain. After

                    growing independence of language had awakened alarm at Rome. A thousand of their

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Polybius).</hi> In Aetolia the Romans connived at the
                    massacre by their so-called friends of 500 of the opposite party. Acarnania was
                    weakened by the loss of Leucas, while Athens was rewarded for her unambitious
                    loyalty by the gift of Delos and Samos.</p>
                <p>But this somewhat violent experiment only answered for a time. In 148 the
                    Achaeans rashly persisted, in spite of warnings, in attempting to compel Sparta
                    by force ’ of arms to submit to the league. λVhen threatened by Rome with the
                    loss of all that they had gained since Cynoscephalae, they madly rushed into
                    war. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, <hi

                    invariable Roman practice, was established, and the payment of a tribute
                    imposed. Into Greece, as into Macedonia in 167, the now familiar features of the
                    provincial system were introduced—disarmament, isolation, and taxation. The
                    Greeks were still nominally free, and no separate province with a governor of

                    the needed central control was provided by assigning to the neighbouring

                    Adriatic to the Aegean, and as far north as the river Drilo and Mount Scardus,

                    The levelling policy pursued towards Macedon and the Achaeans was applied with
                    less justice to Rome’s two faithful and favoured allies, Rhodes and Pergamum.
                    The former had rendered themselves obnoxious to Rome by their independent tone,
                    and still more by their power and commercial prosperity. On a charge of
                    complicity with Perseus they were threatened with war, and though this danger

                    with Rome for one which placed them in close dependence upon her, and to resign
                    the lucrative possessions in Lycia and Caria given them in 189. Finally, their
                    commercial prosperity was ruined by the establishment of a free port at Delos,

                    acquiescence of Rome in the raids of the Cretan pirates. With Eumenes of
                    Pergamum no other fault could be found than that he was strong and successful;
                    but this was enough. His brother Attalus was invited, but in vain, to - become
                    his rival. His turbulent neighbours, the Galatae, were encouraged to harass him
                    by raids. Pamphylia was declared independent, and favours were heaped upon
                    Prusias of Bithynia. These and other annoyances and humiliations had the desired
                    effect. Eumenes and his two successors—his brother and son, Attalus H. and
                    Attalus III.—contrived indeed by studious humility and dexterous flattery to
                    retain their thrones, but Pergamum ceased to be a powerful state, and its
                    weakness, added to that of Rhodes, increased the prevalent disorder in Asia
                    Minor. During the same period we have other indications of a temporary activity
                    on the part of Rome. The frontier of the protectorate was pushed forward to the
                    confines of Armenia and to the upper Euphrates by alliances with the kings of
                    Pontus and Cappadocia beyond the Halys. In Syria, on the death of Antiochus
                    Epiphanes (164), Rome intervened to place a minor, Antiochus Eupator, on the
                    throne, under Roman guardianship. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>But this display of energy was short-lived. From the death of Eumenes in 159 down

                    power in the East, and busy with affairs in Macedonia, Africa, and Spain,
                    relapsed into an inactivity the disastrous results of which revealed themselves
                    in the next period, in the rise of Mithradates of Pontus, the spread of Cretan
                    and Cilician piracy, and the advance of Parthia. To the next period also belongs
                    the conversion, on the death of Attalus III., of the kingdom of Pergamum into
                    the Roman province of Asia.</p>
                <p>Both the western and eastern Mediterranean now acknowledged the suzerainty of
                    Rome, but her relations with the two were from the first different. The West
                    fell to her as the prize of victory over Carthage, and, the Carthaginian power
                    broken, there was no hindrance to the immediate establishment in Sicily,
                    Sardinia, Spain, and finally in Africa, of direct Roman rule. To the majority,
                    moreover, of her Western subjects she brought a civilization as well as a
                    government of a higher type than any before known to them. And so in the West
                    she not only formed provinces but created a new and wider Roman world. To the
                    east, on the contrary, she came as the liberator of the Greeks; and it was only
                    slowly that in this part of the empire her provincial system made way. In the
                    East, moreover, the older civilization she found there obstinately held its
                    ground. Her proconsuls governed and her legions protected the Greek communities,
                    but to the last the East remained in language, manners, and thought Greek and
                    not Roman.</p>

                    two Herculean tasks which this unique position laid upon her,—the efficient
                    government of the subject peoples, and their defence against the barbarian races
                    which swarmed around them on all sides. They were tasks under which the old
                    republican constitution broke down, and which finally overtaxed the strength
                    even of the marvellous organization framed and elaborated by Augustus and his
                    successors.</p>
                <p>At the outset the difficulties of Rome were increased by the rapidity with which
                    her new duties came upon her. From a century, first of deadly struggle, and then
                    of dazzlingly easy success, she emerged to find herself called upon to govern a
                    world with the primitive machinery of a small city state, and to deal with new
                    and complicated administrative problems which she had as yet had no leisure to
                    study. Nor was it until her own political system had been remodelled that she
                    was able to deal effectively with the government of the empire at large. During
                    the period which has now to be considered, the period of the so-called
                    Revolution, but little advance was made towards a better imperial organization,
                    and that little was made by men who, like Caesar and Pompey, belonged, both in
                    the methods and aims of their policy and in the position they held, to the
                    empire rather than to the republic.</p>
                <p>Although in its outward form the old constitution had undergone little change
                    during the age of war and conquest from 265 to 146, <note anchored="true"

                    “caput” of a Roman citizen. But in practice the constitution had become an
                    oligarchy. The senate, not the assembly, ruled Rome, and both the senate and the
                    magistracies were in the hands of a class which, in defiance of the law,
                    arrogated to itself the title and the privileges of a nobility. <note

                    familiar a fact to need much illustration here. It is but rarely that the

                    was usually made by the magistrate in obedience to the express directions of the

                    are matters left to the senate. Now and then the assembly confers a command upon

                    foreign affairs are settled within the walls of the senate house. It is the
                    senate which year after year assigns the commands and fixes the number and

                    find that, besides supervising the ordinary current business of administration,
                    the senate decides questions connected with the Italian allies, sends out
                    colonies, allots lands, and directs the suppression of disorders. Lastly, both

                    “subject to the authority of the senate,” and even the once formidable “tribuni
                    plebis” are found during this period actively and loyally supporting the senate,
                    and acting as its spokesmen in the assembly. <note anchored="true"

                <p>The causes of this ascendency of the senate are not to be found in any additions
                    made by law to its constitutional prerogatives, but first of all in the fact
                    that the senate was the only body capable of conducting affairs in an age of
                    incessant war. The voters in the assembly, a numerous, widely scattered body,
                    many of whom were always away with the legions abroad, could not readily be
                    called together, and when assembled were very imperfectly qualified to decide
                    momentous questions of military strategy and foreign policy. The senate, on the
                    contrary, could be summoned in a moment, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    fitted than those of the comitia for securing the careful discussion and prompt
                    decision of the question before it. The subordination of the magistrates was
                    equally the result of circumstances, though it suited the senatorial advocates
                    of a later day to represent it as an original principle of the constitution, and
                    though it was encouraged and confirmed by the policy of the senate itself. <note

                    and combined with the older patrician gentes to form a distinct order. Office
                    brought wealth and prestige, and both wealth and prestige were liberally

                    freeholders throughout the greater part of Italy were sinking deeper into ruin
                    under the pressure of accumulated difficulties. The Hannibalic war had laid
                    waste their fields and thinned their numbers, and when peace returned to Italy
                    it brought with it no revival of prosperity. The heavy burden of military

                    unprofitable, and the hard laborious life with its scanty returns was thrown
                    into still darker relief when compared with the stirring life of the camps with
                    its opportunities of booty, or with the cheap provisions, frequent largesses,
                    and gay spectacles to be had in the large towns. The small holders went off to
                    follow the eagles or swell the proletariate of the cities, and their holdings
                    were left to run waste or merged in the vineyards, oliveyards, and above all in
                    the great cattle-farms, of the rich, and their own place was taken by slaves.
                    The evil was not equally serious in all parts of Italy. It was least felt in the
                    central highlands, in Campania, and in the newly settled fertile valley of the
                    Po. It was worst in Etruria and in southern Italy; but everywhere it was serious
                    enough to demand the earnest attention of Roman statesmen. Of its existence the
                    government had received plenty of warning in the declining numbers of

                    its ultimate failure something will be said later on; for the present we must
                    turn to the constitutional conflict which it provoked. The senate from the first
                    identified itself with the interests of the wealthy occupiers, and Tiberius
                    found himself forced into a struggle with the senate, which had been no part of
                    his original plan. He fell back on the legislative sovereignty of the assembly;
                    he resuscitated the half-forgotten powers of interference vested in the
                    tribunate in order to paralyse the action of· the senatorial magistrates, and
                    finally lost his life in an attempt to make good one of the weak points in the
                    tribune’s position by securing his own re-election for a second year. But the
                    conflict did not end with his death. It was renewed on a wider scale, and with a
                    more deliberate aim by his brother Gaius, who on his election to the tribunate
                    (123) at once came forward as the avowed enemy of the senate. The latter
                    suddenly found its control of the administration threatened at a variety of
                    points. On the invitation of the popular tribune the assembly proceeded to
                    restrict the senate’s freedom of action in assigning the provinces. <note

                <p>But, though the agrarian reform failed, the political conflict it had provoked
                    ended only with the dictatorship of Caesar, and the lines on which it was waged
                    were in the main those laid down by Gaius Gracchus. The sovereignty of the
                    assembly continued to be the watchword of the popular party, and a free use of
                    the tribunician powers of interference and of legislation remained the most
                    effective means of giving effect to their aims. At the same time the careers of
                    both Tiberius and Gaius had illustrated the weak points of their position,—the

                    hostility to the senate.</p>
                <p>Ten years after the death of Gaius the populäres once more summoned up courage to
                    challenge the supremacy of the senate; and it is important as marking a step in
                    advance that it was on a question not of domestic reform but of foreign
                    administration that the conflict was renewed. The course of affairs in the
                    client state of Numidia since Micipsa’s death in 118 had been such as to
                    discredit a stronger government than that of the senate. <note anchored="true"

                    war wrung from the senate (112) by popular indignation had been followed by the

                    here. Caecilius Metellus, who as consul (109) had succeeded to the command in
                    Numidia, was an able soldier but a rigid aristocrat; and they now resolved to
                    improve their success by entrusting the command instead to a genuine son of the
                    people. Their choice fell on Gaius Marius (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Marius),</hi> an experienced officer and administrator, but a man of humble
                    birth, wholly illiterate, and one who, though no politician, was by temperament
                    and training a hater of the polished and effeminate nobles who filled the

                <p>Jugurtha was vanquished; and Marius, who had been a second time elected consul in
                    his absence, arrived at Rome in January 104, bringing the captive prince with

                    (102), followed by that on the Raudine plain (101), put an end to the danger by
                    the annihilation of the invading hordes; and Marius, now consul for the fifth
                    time, returned to Rome in triumph. There the popular party welcomed him as a
                    leader, and as one who would bring to their aid the imperium of the consul and
                    all the prestige of a successful general. Once more, however, they were destined
                    to a brief success followed by disastrous defeat. Marius became for the sixth

                    praetor and Saturninus tribune. But neither Marius nor his allies were statesmen
                    of the stamp of the Gracchi; and the laws proposed by Saturninus had evidently
                    no other serious aim in view than that of harassing the senate. His corn law
                    merely reduced the price fixed in 123 for the monthly dole of corn, and the main
                    point of his agrarian law lay in the clause appended to it requiring all
                    senators to swear to observe its provisions. <note anchored="true"

                    exception of Metellus took the oath; but the triumph of the popular leaders was
                    short-lived. Their recklessness and violence had alienated all classes in Rome;
                    and their period of office was drawing to a close. At the elections fresh
                    rioting took place, and at last Marius as consul was called upon by the senate
                    to protect the state against his own partisans. In despair Saturninus and
                    Glaucia surrendered, but while the senate was discussing their fate they were
                    surrounded and murdered by the populace.</p>
                <p>The popular party had been worsted once more in their struggle with the senate,
                    but none the less their alliance with Marius, and the position in which their

                <p>The six consulships of Marius represented not merely a party victory but a
                    protest against the system of divided and rapidly-changing commands, which was
                    no doubt the system favoured by the senate, but was also an integral element of
                    the republican constitution, and in assailing it the populäres weakened the
                    republic even more than they irritated the senate. The transference of the
                    political leadership to a consul who was nothing if not a soldier was at once a
                    confession of the insufficiency of the purely civil authority of the tribunate
                    and a dangerous encouragement of military interference in political
                    controversies. The consequences were already foreshadowed by the special
                    provisions made by Saturninus for Marius’s veterans, and in the active part
                    taken by them in the passing of his laws. Indirectly too Marius, though no
                    politician, played an important part in this new departure. His military reforms

                    its leader for the time being. He swept away the last traces of civil
                    distinctions of rank or wealth within the legion, admitted to its ranks all
                    classes, and substituted voluntary enlistment under a popular general for the
                    old-fashioned compulsory levy. The efficiency of the legion was increased at the
                    cost of a complete severance of the ties which bound it to the civil community
                    and to the civil authorities.</p>
                <p>The defeat of Saturninus was followed by several years of quiet; nor was the next
                    important crisis provoked directly by any efforts of the discredited popular
                    party. It was due partly to the rivalry which had been growing more bitter each
                    year since 122 between the senate and the commercial class, and secondly to the
                    long impending question of the enfranchisement of the Italian allies. The
                    publicani, negotiatores, and others, who constituted what was now becoming known
                    as the equestrian order, had made unscrupulous use of their control of the
                    courts and especially of the “quaestio de repetundis” against their natural
                    rivals, the official class in the provinces. The threat of prosecution before a
                    hostile jury was held over the head of every governor, legate, and quaestor who
                    ventured to interfere with their operations in the provinces. The average
                    official preferred to connive at their exactions; the bolder ones paid with
                    fines and even exile for their courage. In 93 the necessity for a reform was
                    proved beyond a doubt by the scandalous condemnation of P. Rutilius Rufus, <note

                    reward of his efforts to check the extortions of the Roman equites in Asia.</p>
                <p>The need of reform was clear, but it was not so easy to carry a reform which
                    would certainly be opposed by the whole strength of the equestrian order, and
                    which, as involving the repeal of a Sempronian law, would arouse the resentment
                    of the popular party. The difficulties of the Italian question were more
                    serious. That the Italian allies were discontented was notorious. After nearly
                    two centuries of close alliance, of common dangers and victories, they now
                    eagerly coveted as a boon that complete amalgamation with Rome which they had at
                    first resented as a dishonour. But, unfortunately, Rome had grown more selfishly
                    exclusive in proportion as the value set upon Roman citizenship increased. The
                    politic liberality with which the franchise had once been granted had
                    disappeared. The allies found their burdens increasing and their ancient
                    privileges diminishing, while the resentment with which they viewed their
                    exclusion from the fruits of the conquests they had helped to make was
                    aggravated by the growingly suspicious and domineering attitude of the Roman
                    government. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mommsen,

                    On each occasion they had crowded to Rome, full of eager expectation, only to be
                    harshly ejected from the city by the consul’s orders. <note anchored="true"

                    and people alike was still jealously exclusive, and from a higher than a merely
                    selfish point of view there was much to be said against the revolution involved

                    Rome. His assassination was the signal for an outbreak which had been secretly

                    rushed to arms. No time was lost in proclaiming their plans for the future. A
                    new Italian state was to be formed. The Paelignian town of Corfinium was
                    selected as its capital and re-christened with the proud name of Italica. All
                    Italians were to be citizens of this new metropolis, and here were to be the
                    place of assembly and the senate house. A senate of 500 members and a magistracy
                    resembling that of Rome completed a constitution which adhered closely to the
                    very political traditions which its authors had most reason to abjure.</p>

                    Marius and his destined rival L. Cornelius Sulla, and even freedmen λvere
                    pressed into service with the legions. But the first year’s campaign opened
                    disastrously. In central Italy the northern Sabellians, and in the south the
                    Samnites, defeated the forces opposed to them. And though before the end of the
                    year Marius and Sulla in the north, and the consul Caesar himself in Campania,
                    succeeded in inflicting severe blows on the enemy, and on the Marsi especially,
                    it is not surprising that, with an empty treasury, with the insurgents’ strength
                    still unbroken, and with rumours of disaffection in the loyal districts, opinion
                    in Rome should have turned in the direction of the more liberal policy which had
                    been so often scornfully rejected and in favour of some compromise which should
                    check the spread of the revolt, and possibly sow discord among their enemies.
                    Towards the close of the year 90 the consul Caesar carried the “lex Julia,”
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the lex Julia, see

                    the Roman franchise was offered to all communities which had not as yet
                    revolted; early in the next year (89) the Julian law was supplemented by the
                    “lex Plautia Papiria,” introduced by two of the tribunes, which enacted that any
                    citizen of an allied community then domiciled in Italy might obtain the
                    franchise by giving in his name to a praetor in Rome within sixty days. A third
                    law (lex Calpurnia) apparently passed at the same time empowered Roman
                    magistrates in the field to bestow the franchise there and then upon all who
                    were willing to receive it. This sudden opening of the closed gates of Roman
                    citizenship was completely successful, and its effects were at once visible in
                    the diminished vigour of the insurgents. By the end of 89 the Samnites and
                    Lucanians were left alone in their obstinate hostility to Rome, and neither,
                    thanks to Sulla’s brilliant campaign in Samnium, had for the moment any strength
                    left for active aggression.</p>
                <p>The termination of the Social War brought with it no peace in Rome. The old

                    forward his laws. He proposed—(1) that the command of the Mithradatic war should
                    be given to Marius, (2) that the new citizens should be distributed through all
                    the tribes, (3) that the freedmen should no longer be confined to the four city
                    tribes, (4) that any senator owing more than 2000 denarii should lose his seat,
                    (5) that those exiled on suspicion of complicity with the Italian revolt should
                    be recalled. Whatever may have been Sulpicius’s intentions, these proposals
                    inevitably provoked a storm. The old voters bitterly resented the swamping of
                    the existing constituency; the senate rallied its forces to oppose the
                    alteration in the franchise of the freedmen and the proposed purging of its own
                    ranks; and, lastly, both the senate and Sulla himself, now one of the consuls,
                    ρre-pared-to resist the transference of the Asiatic command to Marius. Both
                    sides were ominously ready for violent measures. The consuls, in order to
                    prevent legislation, proclaimed a public holiday. <note anchored="true"

                    and driving the consuls from the forum. The proclamation was withdrawn and the
                    laws carried, but Sulpicius’s triumph was short-lived. From Nola in Campania,
                    where lay the legions commanded by him in the Social War, Sulla advanced on
                    Rome, and for the first time a Roman consul entered the city at the head of the
                    legions of the republic. Resistance was hopeless. Marius and Sulpicius fled,

                <p>Sulla had conquered, but his victory cost the republic dear. He had first taught
                    political partisans to look for final success, not to a majority of votes in the
                    forum or campus, but to the swords of the soldiery; and he had shown that the
                    legions, composed as they now were, could be trusted to regard nothing but the
                    commands of a favourite leader. The lesson was well learnt. Shortly after his
                    departure, Cinna as consul revived the proposals of Sulpicius; <note

                    head of an armed force fell upon the new citizens who had collected in crowds to
                    vote, and the forum was heaped high with the bodies of the slain. <note

                    but fled like Sulla to the legions. When the senate declared him deposed from
                    his consulship, he replied by invoking the aid of the soldiers in Campania in
                    behalf of the violated rights of the people and the injured dignity of the
                    consulship, and, like Sulla, found them ready to follow where he led. The
                    neighbouring Italian communities, who had lost many citizens in the recent
                    massacre, sent their new champion men and money; <note anchored="true"

                    while from Africa, whither he had escaped after Sulla’s entry into Rome, came
                    Marius with 1000 Numidian horsemen. He landed in Etruria, where his old veterans
                    flocked to his standard, and at the head of some GOOO men joined Cinna before
                    the gates of Rome. The senate had prepared for a desperate defence, but fortune
                    was adverse, and after a brief resistance they gave way. Cinna was acknowledged
                    as consul, the sentence of outlawry passed on Marius was revoked, and Cinna and
                    Marius entered Rome with their troops. Marius’s thirst for revenge was gratified
                    by a frightful massacre, and he lived long enough to be nominated consul for the
                    seventh time. But he held his consulship only a few weeks. Early in 86 he died,
                    and for the next three years Cinna ruled Rome. Constitutional government was

                    soldiers; his most trusted colleague Carbo was commanding as proconsul in
                    Cisalpine Gaul; and the resistance offered to Sulla’s advance was slight. At
                    Capua Sulla routed the forces of one consul, Norbanus; at Teanum the troops of
                    the other went over in a body to the side of the outlawed proconsul. After a
                    winter spent in Campania he pressed forward to Rome, defeated the younger Marius
                    (consul 82) near Praeneste, and entered the city without further opposition. In
                    North Italy the success of his lieutenants Metellus, C. Pompeius, and Marcus
                    Crassus had been fully as decisive. Cisalpine Gaul, Umbria, and Etruria had all
                    been won for Sulla, and the two principal leaders on the other side, Carbo and
                    Norbanus, had each fled, one to Rhodes, the other to Africa. Only one foe
                    remained to be conquered. The Samnites and Lucanians whom Cinna had conciliated,
                    and who saw in Sulla their bitterest foe, were for the last time in arms, and
                    had already joined forces with the remains of the Marian army close to Rome. The
                    decisive battle was fought under the walls of the city, and ended in the
                    complete defeat of the Marians and Italians. <note anchored="true"

                <p>For a period of nearly ten years Rome and Italy had been distracted by civil war.
                    Constitutional government, whether by senate or assembly, had been in abeyance,
                    while the opposing parties fought out their quarrels with the sword, under the
                    leadership of generals at the head of legions ready and willing to follow them
                    against their fellow citizens and against the established authorities of the
                    state. The strife had spread from the Roman forum to Italy, and from Italy to
                    the provinces; and for the first time the integrity of the empire was threatened
                    by the conflicts of rival governors. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rudely shaken by the ravages of war. Class hatreds and personal feuds distracted
                    the community, while the enfranchisement of the Italians was in itself a
                    revolution which affected the very foundations of the republic. Such was the
                    situation with which Sulla was now called upon to deal. It was for him to heal
                    the divisions which rent the state asunder, to set in working again the
                    machinery of civil government, and above all so to modify it as to meet the
                    altered conditions, and to fortify it against the dangers which visibly
                    threatened it in the future. The real charge against Sulla <note anchored="true"

                    all this, for to do so was beyond the powers even of a man so able, resolute,
                    and self-confident as Sulla, armed though he was with absolute authority and
                    backed by overwhelming military strength and the prestige of unbroken success.
                    He stands convicted rather of deliberately aggravating some and culpably
                    ignoring others of the evils he should have tried to cure, and of contenting
                    himself with a party triumph when he should have aimed at the regeneration and
                    confirmation of the whole state. His victory was instantly followed, not by any
                    measures of conciliation, but by a series of massacres, proscriptions, and
                    confiscations, of which almost the least serious consequence was the immediate
                    loss of life which they entailed. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    equestrian order. </p></note> From this time forward the fear of proscription
                    and confiscation recurred as a possible consequence of every political crisis,
                    and it was with difficulty that Caesar himself dissipated the belief that his
                    victory would be followed by a Sullan reign of terror. The legacy of hatred and
                    discontent which Sulla left behind him was a constant source of disquiet and
                    danger. In the children of the proscribed, whom he excluded from holding office,
                    and the dispossessed owners of the confiscated lands, every agitator found ready

                    Italian citizens might in time have learnt to feel for the old republican
                    constitution was nipped in the bud by the massacres at Praeneste and Norba, by
                    the harsh treatment of the ancient towns of Etruria, and by the ruthless

                    direction of the senate. Lastly, he replaced the pontifical and augural colleges
                    in the hands of the senatorial nobles, by enacting that vacancies in them

                    constitution, so as to make it pronounce in favour of his own party, was open to
                    two grave objections. It was not to be expected that the new legal safeguards
                    would protect the senate any more efficiently than the established custom and

                    and alter the constitution to suit themselves. Still less was Sulla successful

                    in the provinces, and from the transformation of the old civic militia into a
                    group of professional armies, devoted only to a successful leader, and with the
                    weakest possible sense of allegiance to the state. He had himself, as proconsul
                    of Asia, contemptuously and successfully defied the home government, and he,
                    more than any other Roman general, had taught his soldiers to look only to their
                    leader, and to think only of booty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    (Cic.<hi rend="italic">Ad Fam., i. 9, 25), a provision which increased rather
                    than diminished his freedom of action; (2) that an outgoing governor should

                    contained, it is true, a definition of treason evidently framed in the light of
                    recent experience. The magistrate was forbidden “exire de provincia, educere
                    exercitum, bellum sua sponte gerere, in regnum injussu populi ac senatus

                    to the long list of laws dealing with extortion in the provinces. But the danger
                    lay, not in the want of laws, but in the want of security for their observance
                    by an absolutely autocratic proconsul. The present writer cannot agree with
                    those who would include among Sulla’s laws one retaining consuls and praetors in
                    Rome for their year of office and then sending them out to a province. This was
                    becoming the common practice before 81. After 81 it is invariable for praetors,
                    as needed for the judicial work, and invariable but for two exceptions in the
                    case of consuls; but nowhere is there a hint that there had been any legislation
                    on the subject, and there are indications that it was convenience and not
                    law which maintained the arrangement. Mommsen, ii. 355; Marquardt, <hi

                    provinces, and applied between 149 and 81 to cases of treason and bribery, Sulla
                    extended so as to bring under it the chief criminal offences, and thus laid the
                    foundations of the Roman criminal law.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The Sullan system stood for nine years, and was then overthrown—as it had been
                    established—by a successful soldier. It was the fortune of Cn. Pompeius, a
                    favourite officer of Sulla, first of all to violate in his own person the
                    fundamental principles of the constitution re-established by his old chief, and
                    then to overturn it. In Spain the Marian governor Q. Sertorius (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sertorius)</hi> had defeated one after another of the
                    proconsuls sent out by the senate, and was already in 77 master of all Hither

                    crisis, the senate itself took a step which was in fact the plainest possible
                    confession that the system sanctioned afresh by Sulla was inadequate to the
                    needs of the state. Pompey, who was not yet thirty, and had never held even the
                    quaestorship, was sent out to Spain with proconsular authority.<note

                    troops to Italy, where, during his absence in Spain, an event had occurred which
                    had shown Roman society with startling plainness how near it stood to
                    revolution. In 73 Spartacus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Thracian slave, escaped with seventy others from a gladiators’ training school
                    at Capua. In an incredibly short time he found himself at the head of a numerous
                    force <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n786/mode/1up"

                    impoverished peasants. By the'end of 73 he had 70,000 men under his command, had
                    twice defeated the Roman troops, and was master of southern Italy. In 72 he
                    advanced on Rome, but, though he again routed the legions led against him by the
                    consuls in person, he abandoned his scheme and established himself in the now
                    desolate country near Thurii, already the natural home of brigandage. At length
                    in 71 the praetor Crassus, who had been sent against him with no less than six
                    legions, ended the war. Spartacus was defeated and slain in Apulia. In Rome
                    itself the various classes and parties hostile to the Sullan system had, ever
                    since Sulla’s death in 78, been incessantly agitating for the repeal of his most
                    obnoxious laws, and needed only a leader in order successfully to attack a
                    government discredited by failure at home and abroad. With the return of Pompey
                    from Spain their opportunity came. Pompey, who understood politics as little as
                    Marius, was anxious to obtain—what the senate was more than likely to refuse to
                    give him, and what he was not legally entitled to—a triumph, the consulship for
                    the next year (70), and as the natural consequence of this an important command
                    in the East. The opposition wanted his name and support, and a bargain was soon
                    struck. Pompey and with him AIarcus Crassus, the conqueror of Spartacus, were
                    elected consuls, almost in the presence of their troops, which lay encamped
                    outside the gates in readiness to assist at the triumph and ovation granted to
                    their respective leaders. Pompey lost no time in performing his part of the
                    agreement. The tribunes regained their prerogatives. <note anchored="true"

                    victory was complete; but for the future its chief significance lay in the
                    clearness with which it showed that the final decision in matters political lay
                    with neither of the two great parties in Rome, but with the holder of the
                    military authority. The recognition of this fact was fatal to the dignity of
                    politics in the city. In proportion as the mass of the Roman community in Italy,
                    and able aspirants to power, like Caesar, became conscious of the unreality of
                    the old constitutional controversies, they became indifferent to the questions
                    which agitated the forum and the curia and contemptuously ready to alter or
                    disregard the constitution itself, when it stood in the way of interests nearer
                    to their hearts. Of this growing indifference to the traditional politics of the
                    republic, against which Cicero struggled in vain, Pompey is an excellent
                    example. He was absolutely without interest in them, except in so far as they
                    led up to important military commands, and, though he was never revolutionary in
                    intention, his own career, in its quiet defiance of all the established rules of
                    the constitution, did almost more than the direct attacks of others to render
                    the republic impossible.</p>
                <p>AVhen his consulship ended, Pompey impatiently awaited at the hands of the
                    politicians he had befriended the further gift of a foreign command. He declined
                    an ordinary province, and from the end of 70 to 67 he remained at Rome in a
                    somewhat affectedly dignified seclusion. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    </p></note> But in 67 and 66 the laws of Gabiuius and Alanilius gave him all and
                    more than all that he expected. The ravages of the pirates, encouraged in the
                    first instance by the inactivity which had marked Roman policy in the East after
                    167, and by the absence of any effective Roman navy in the Alediterranean, had
                    now risen to an intolerable height, and the spasmodic efforts made since 81 had
                    done little to check them. The trade of the AIediterranean was paralysed, and
                    even the coasts of Italy were not safe from their raids. <note anchored="true"

                    authority over all Roman magistrates in the provinces throughout the

                    praetorian rank, were assigned to him, with two hundred ships, and as many
                    troops as he thought desirable. These powers were still further enlarged in the
                    next year by the Alanilian law, which transferred from Lucullus and Glabrio to
                    Pompey the conduct of the Alithradatic war in Asia, and with it the entire
                    control of Roman policy and interests in the East. <note anchored="true"

                    unrepublican character of the position thus granted to Pompey, and the dangers
                    of the precedent established, were clearly enough pointed out by such moderate
                    men as Q. Lutatius Catulus, the “father of the senate,” and by the orator
                    Hortensius—but in vain. Both laws were supported, not only by the tribunes and
                    the populace, but by the whole influence of the “ρublicani” and “nego-tiatores,”
                    whose interests in the East were at stake.</p>
                <p>Pompey left Rome in 67, and did not return to Italy till towards the end of 62.
                    The interval was marked in Rome by the rise to political importance of Caesar
                    and Cicero, and by Catiline’s attempt at revolution. AVhen in 7O the removal of
                    the restrictions placed upon the tribunate restored to the popular party their
                    old weapons of attack, Caesar was already a marked man. In addition to his
                    patrician birth, and his reputation for daring and ability, he possessed, as the
                    nephew of AIarius and the son-in-law of Cinna, a strong hereditary claim to the
                    leadership of the popular and AIarian party. He had already taken part in the
                    agitation for the restoration of the tribunate; he had supported the AIanilian
                    law; and, when Pompey’s withdrawal left the field clear for other competitors,
                    he stepped at once into the front rank on the popular side. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prof. Beesly, in his essay on
                    Catiline, has vainly endeavoured to show that Catiline and not Caesar was the
                    popular leader from 67 to 63. That this is the inference intentionally conveyed
                    by Sallust, in order to screen Caesar, is true, but the inference is a false
                    one. </p></note> He took upon himself, as their nearest representative, the task
                    of clearing the memory and avenging the wrongs of the great popular leaders,
                    AIarius, Cinna, and Saturninus. He publicly reminded the people of Alarius’s
                    services, and set up again upon the Capitol the trophies of the Cimbric AVar. He
                    endeavoured to bring to justice, not only the ringleaders in Sulla’s bloody work
                    of proscription, but even the murderers of Saturninus, and vehemently pleaded
                    the cause of the children of the proscribed. AVhile thus carrying on in genuine
                    Roman fashion the feud of his family, he attracted the sympathies of the
                    Italians by his efforts to procure the Roman franchise for the Latin communities
                    beyond the Po, and won the affections of the populace in Rome and its immediate
                    neighbourhood by the splendour of the games which he gave as curule aedile (65),
                    and by his lavish expenditure upon the improve<pb break="no"

                    of Caesar and of his time that these measures were with him only means to the
                    further end of creating for himself a position such as that which Pompey had
                    already won; and this ulterior aim he pursued with a skill, and with an
                    audacious indifference to constitutional forms and usages, unsurpassed even by
                    Sulla. His coalition with Crassus, soon after Pompey’s departure, secured him an
                    ally whose colossal wealth and wide financial connexions were of inestimable
                    value, and whose vanity and inferiority of intellect rendered him a willing
                    tool. The story of his attempted <hi rend="italic">coup détat</hi> in January 65

                    his position before Pompey’s return; and the agrarian law proposed early that
                    year by the tribune Rullus had for its real object the creation, in favour of
                    Caesar and Crassus, of a commission with powers so wide as to place its members

                    connected with the popular party, but directed the suspicions of the well-to-do
                    classes against Caesar himself, as a possible accomplice in Catiline’s

                <p>The same wave of indignation and suspicion which for the moment checked Caesar’s
                    rise carried Marcus Tullius Cicero to the height of his fortunes. Cicero, as a
                    politician, has been equally misjudged by friends and foes. That he was
                    deficient in courage, that he was vain, and that he attempted the impossible,
                    may be admitted at once. But he was neither a brilliant and unscrupulous
                    adventurer nor an aimless trimmer, nor yet a devoted champion merely of
                    senatorial ascendency. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Beesly. The best estimate of Cicero’s political position known to the present
                    writer is that given by Prof. Tyrrell in the Introduction to his edition of
                    Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Letters.</hi></p></note> He was a representative man,
                    with a numerous following, and a policy which was naturally suggested to him by

                    impracticable as it proved to be, was yet consistent, intelligible, and
                    high-minded. Born at Arpinum, he cherished like all Arpinates the memory of his
                    great fellow-townsman Marius, the friend of the Italians, the saviour of Italy,
                    and the irreconcilable foe of Sulla and the nobles. A “municipal” himself, his
                    chosen friends and his warmest supporters were found among the well-to-do
                    classes in the Italian towns. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Roman populace, he was the trusted leader of the Italian middle class, “the true

                    Caesar so anxious to win him over in 49. He represented their antipathy alike to
                    socialistic schemes and to aristocratic exclusiveness, and their old-fashioned
                    simplicity of life in contrast with the cosmopolitan luxury of the capital.

                    of the Italian towns and the smaller “squires” of the country districts. With
                    them, too, Cicero was at one in their dread of democratic excesses and their

                    ideal was the natural outcome of these circumstances of his position. He
                    advocated the maintenance of the old constitution, but not as it was understood
                    by the extreme politicians of the right and left. The senate was to be the

                    assemblage of nobles, but a body freely open to all citizens, and representing
                    the worth of the community. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    itself which elected the magistrates and passed the laws was to consist, not of
                    the “mob of the forum,” but of the true Roman people throughout Italy. <note

                    nobles in Rome and the great middle class of Italy represented by the equestrian
                    order, between the capital and the country towns and districts. This was the

                    politicians, above all the incompetency of the old machinery, even if reformed
                    as he would have had it reformed, to govern the empire and control the

                <p>Cicero’s election to the consulship for 63 over the heads of Caesar’s nominees,
                    Antonius and Catiline, was mainly the work of the Italian middle class, already
                    rendered uneasy both by the rumours which were rife of revolutionary schemes and
                    of Caesar’s boundless ambition, and by the numerous disquieting signs of
                    disturbance noticeable in Italy. The new consul vigorously set himself to
                    discharge the trust placed in him. He defeated the insidious proposals of Rullus
                    for Caesar’s aggrandizement, and assisted in quashing the prosecution of
                    Rabirius. But with the consular elections in the autumn of 63 a fresh danger
                    arose from a different quarter. The “conspiracy <note anchored="true"

                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Catiline)</hi> was not the work of the popular party,
                    and still less was it an unselfish attempt at reform; L. Sergius Catilina
                    himself was a patrician, who had held high office, and possessed considerable
                    ability and courage; but he was bankrupt in character and in purse, and two
                    successive defeats in the consular elections had rendered him desperate. To
                    retrieve his broken fortunes by violence was a course which was only too readily
                    suggested by the history of the last forty years, and materials for a
                    conflagration abounded on all sides. The danger to be feared from his intrigues
                    lay in the state of Italy, which made a revolt against society and the
                    established government only too likely if once a leader presented himself, and
                    it was such a revolt that Catiline in 65 is certain, and they were suspected
                    naturally enough of favouring t∏3 designs in 63, but their complicity is in the
                    highest degree improbable. '</p>

                    starving peasants whom they had dispossessed of their holdings, outlaws of every
                    description, the slave population of Rome, and the wilder herdsmen-slaves of the
                    Apulian pastures, were all enlisted under his banner, and attempts were even
                    made to excite disaffection among the newly-conquered people of southern Gaul
                    and the warlike tribes who still cherished the memory of Sertorius in Spain. In
                    Etruria, the seat and centreof agrarian distress and discontent, arising
                    actually took place headed by a Sullan centurion, but the spread of the revolt
                    was checked by Cicero’s vigorous measures. Catiline fled from Rome, and died
                    fighting with desperate courage at the head of his motley force of old soldiers,
                    peasants, and slaves. His accomplices in Rome were arrested, and, after an
                    unavailing protest from Caesar, the senate authorized the consuls summarily to
                    put them to death.</p>
                <p>The Catilinarian outbreak had been a blow to Caesar, whose schemes it
                    interrupted, but to Cicero it brought, not only popularity and honour, but, as
                    he believed, the realization of his political ideal. The senate and the
                    equestrian order, the nobles of Rome and the middle class in the country, had
                    made common cause in the face of a common danger; and the danger had been
                    averted by the vigorous action of a consul sprung from the people, under the
                    guidance of a united senate, and backed by the mass of good citizens.</p>

                    and again as in 70 the political future seemed to depend on the attitude which
                    the successful general would assume; Pompey himself looked simply to the
                    attainment by the help of one political party or another of his immediate aims,
                    which at present were the ratification of his arrangements in Asia and a grant
                    of land for his troops. It was the impracticable jealousy of his personal rivals
                    in the senate, aided by the versatility of Caesar, who presented himself not as
                    his rival but as his ally, which drove Pompey once more, in spite of Cicero’s
                    efforts, into the camp of what was still nominally the popular party. In 60, on
                    Caesar’s return from his propraetorship in Spain, the coalition was formed which
                    is known by the somewhat misleading title of the first triumvirate. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Misleading, because the
                    coalition was unofficial. The “triumvirs” of 43 were actual magistrates, “πιviri

                    this new alliance, and in return for the satisfaction of his own demands he
                    undertook to support Caesar’s candidature for the consulship. The wealth and
                    influence of Crassus were enlisted in the same cause, but what he was to receive
                    in exchange is not clear. Cicero was under no illusions as to the significance
                    of this coalition. It scattered to the winds his dreams of a stable and
                    conservative republic. Pompey, whom he had hoped to enlist as the champion of
                    constitutional government, had been driven into the arms of Caesar. The union
                    between the senate and the equestrian order had been dissolved, and the support
                    of the publicani lost by an untimely quarrel over the price to be paid for
                    collecting the taxes of Asia, and, to crown all, both his own personal safety
                    and the autnority of the senate were threatened by the openly avowed intentions
                    of Catiline’s friends to bring the consul of 63 to account for his
                    unconstitutional execution of Catiline’s accomplices. His fears were fully
                    justified by the results. The year 59 saw the republic powerless in the hands of
                    three citizens. Caesar as consul procured the ratification of Pompey’s acts in
                    Asia, conciliated the publicani by granting them the relief refused by the
                    senate, and carried an agrarian law of the new type, which provided for the
                    purchase of lands for allotment at the cost of the treasury, and for the
                    assignment of the rich “ager Campanus.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    But Caesar aimed at more than the carrying of an agrarian law in the teeth of
                    the senate or any party victory in the forum. An important military command was
                    essential to him, and he judged correctly enough that in the West there was work
                    to be done which might enable him to win a position such as Pompey had achieved
                    in the East. An obedient tribune was found, and by the lex Vatinia he was given
                    for rive years the command of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum, to which was added
                    by a decree of the senate Transalpine Gaul also. <note anchored="true"

                    affairs in Italy.</p>
                <p>Early the next year the attack upon himself which Cicero had foreseen was made.
                    P. Clodius as tribune brought forward a law enacting that any one who had put a
                    Roman citizen to death without trial by the people should be interdicted from
                    fire and water. Cicero finding himself deserted even by Pompey left Rome in a
                    panic, and by a second Clodian law he was declared to be outlawed. <note

                    was for the time master in Rome. But, absolute as he was in the streets, and
                    recklessly as he parodied the policy of the Gracchi by violent attacks on the
                    senate, his tribunate merely illustrated the anarchy which now inevitably
                    followed the withdrawal of a strong controlling hand. A reaction speedily
                    followed. Pompey, bewildered and alarmed by Clodius’s violence, at last
                    bestirred himself. Cicero’s recall was decreed by the senate, and early in
                    August 57 in the comitia centuriata, to which his Italian supporters flocked in
                    crowds, a law was passed revoking the sentence of outlawry passed upon him.</p>
                <p>Intoxicated by the acclamations which greeted him, and encouraged by Pompey’s
                    support, and by the salutary effects of Clodius’s excesses, Cicero’s hopes rose
                    high, and a return to the days of 63 seemed not impossible. <note

                    act in leaving Rome “interdicted from fire and water, ”—a procedure for which
                    precedents could be quoted. Clodius was within the letter of the law.
                    </p></note> With indefatigable energy he strove to reconstruct a solid
                    constitutional party, but only to fail once more. Pompey was irritated by the
                    hostility of a powerful party in the senate, who thwarted his desires for a
                    fresh command and even encouraged Clodius in insulting the conqueror of the
                    East. Caesar became alarmed at the reports which reached him that the repeal of
                    his agrarian law was threatened and that the feeling against the coalition was
                    growing in strength; above all he was anxious for a renewal of his five years’
                    command. He acted at once, and in the celebrated conference at Luca (56) the
                    alliance of the three self-constituted rulers of Rome was renewed. Cicero
                    succumbed to the inevitable and withdrew in despair from public life. Pompey and
                    Crassus became consuls for 55. Caesar’s command was renewed <hi

                    between them the control of the empire. For the future the question was, how
                    long the coalition itself would last. Its duration proved to be short. In 53
                    Crassus was defeated and slain by the Parthians at Carrhae, and in Rome the
                    course of events slowly forced Pompey into an attitude of hostility to Caesar.
                    The year 51 brought with it a renewal of the riotous anarchy which had disgraced
                    Rome in 58-57. Conscious of its own helplessness, the senate, with the eager
                    assent of all respectable citizens, dissuaded Pompey from leaving Italy. His
                    provinces were left to his legates, and he himself remained at home to maintain
                    order by the weight of his influence. It was a confession that the republic
                    could not stand alone. But Pompey’s mere presence proved insufficient. The
                    anarchy and confusion grew worse, and even strict constitutionalists like Cicero
                    talked of the necessity of investing Pompey with some extraordinary powers for

                    was one which flattered his vanity, but it entailed consequences which it is
                    probable he did not foresee, for it brought him into close alliance with the
                    senate, and in the senate there was a powerful party who were resolved to force
                    him into heading the attack they could not successfully make withβut him upon
                    Caesar. It was known that the latter, whose command expired in March 49, but who
                    in the ordinary course of things would not have been replaced by his successor
                    until January 48, was anxious to be allowed to stand for his second consulship
                    in the autumn of 49 without coming in person to Rome. <note anchored="true"

                    in the senate were equally bent on bringing his command to an end at the legal
                    time, and so obliging him to disband his troops and stand for the consulship as
                    a private person, or, if he kept his command, on preventing his standing for the
                    consulship. Through 51 and 50 the discussions in the senate and the negotiations
                    with Caesar continued, but with no result. On lst January 49 Caesar made a last
                    offer of compromise. The senate replied by requiring him on pain of outlawry to
                    disband his legions. Two tribunes who supported him were ejected from the senate
                    house, and the magistrates with Pompey were authorized to take measures to
                    protect the republic. Caesar hesitated no longer; he crossed the Rubicon and <hi
                    rend="superscript">e</hi> invaded Italy. The rapidity of his advance astounded
                    and bewildered his foes. Pompey, followed by the consuls, by the majority of the
                    senate and a long train of nobles, abandoned Italy as untenable, and crossed

                    and in his control of the sea. Politically, however, it was a blunder, as it
                    enabled Caesar to pose as the defender of Italy. </p></note> At the end of March

                <p>The task which Caesar had to perform was no easy one. It came upon him suddenly;
                    for there is no sufficient reason to believe that Caesar had long premeditated
                    revolution, or that he had previously aspired to anything more than such a
                    position as that which Pompey had already won, a position unrepublican indeed,
                    but accepted by republicans as inevitable. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>On this, as on many other points connected with Caesar,

                    Caesar’s early intentions. </p></note> War was forced upon him as the
                    alternative to political suicide, but success in war brought the
                    responsibilities of nearly absolute power, and Caesar’s genius must be held to
                    have shown itself in the masterly fashion in which he grasped the situation,
                    rather than in the supposed sagacity with which he is said to have foreseen and
                    prepared for it. In so far as he failed, his failure was mainly due to the fact
                    that his tenure of power was too short for the work which he was required to
                    perform. From the very first moment when Pompey’s ignominious retreat left him
                    master of Italy, he made it clear that he was neither a second Sulla nor even
                    the reckless anarchist which many believed him to be. <note anchored="true"

                    were first startled by the masterly rapidity and energy of his movements, and
                    then agreeably surprised by his lenity and moderation. No proscriptions or
                    confiscations followed his victories, and all his acts evinced an unmistakable
                    desire to effect a sober and reasonable settlement of the pressing questions of
                    the hour; of this, and of his almost superhuman energy, the long list of
                    measures he carried out or planned is sufficient proof. The “children of the

                    “novae tabulae” and grants of land were illusory. In allotting lands to his

                    largesses. But he was no indiscriminate flatterer of the mob. The popular clubs

                    cattle farms the owners were required to find employment for a certain amount of

                    administrative reform which entitles Caesar to the praise of having governed
                    well, whatever may be thought of the validity of his title to govern at all. But
                    how did Caesar deal with what was after all the greatest problem which he was
                    called upon to solve, the establishment of a satisfactory government for the
                    empire? One point indeed was already settled—the necessity, if the empire was to
                    hold together at all, of placing the army, the provinces, and the control of the
                    foreign policy in more vigorous hands than those of a number of changing
                    magistrates independent of each other, and only very imperfectly controlled by
                    the senate at home. Some centralization of the executive authority was
                    indispensable, and this part of his work Caesar thoroughly performed. From the
                    moment when he seized the moneys in the treasury on his first entry into Rome
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plut., 35. </p></note>
                    down to the day of his death he recognized no other authority but his throughout
                    the empire. He alone directed the policy of Rome in foreign affairs; the legions
                    were led, and the provinces governed, not by independent magistrates, but by his
                    “legates;” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dio, xliii.
                    47. </p></note> and the title “imperator” which he adopted was intended to
                    express the absolute and unlimited nature of the “imperium” he claimed, as
                    distinct from the limited spheres of authority possessed by republican
                    magistrates. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Suet., 40;

                    executive authority over the empire at large, Caesar was but developing the
                    policy implied in the Gabinian and Manilian laws, and the precedent he
                    established was closely followed by his successors. It was otherwise with the
                    more difficult question of the form under which this new executive authority
                    should be exercised and the relation it should hold to the republican
                    constitution. We must be content to remain in ignorance of the precise shape
                    which Caesar intended ultimately to give to the new system. The theory that he
                    contemplated a revival of the old Roman kingship <note anchored="true"

                    than the popular gossip of the day, and the form under which he actually wielded
                    his authority can hardly have been regarded by so sagacious a statesman as more
                    than a provisional arrangement. This form was that of the dictatorship; and in
                    favour of the choice it might have beeu urged that the dictatorship was the
                    office naturally marked out by republican tradition as the one best suited to
                    carry the state safely through a serious crisis, that the powers it conveyed
                    were wide, that it was as dictator that Sulla had reorganized the state, and
                    that a dictatorship had been spoken of as the readiest means of legalizing
                    Pompey’s protectorate of the republic in 53-52. The choice nevertheless was a
                    bad one. It was associated with those very Sullan traditions from which Caesar
                    was most anxious to sever himself; it implied necessarily the suspension for the
                    time of all constitutional government; and, lastly, the dictatorship as held by
                    Caesar could not even plead that it conformed to the old rules and traditions of
                    the office. There was indeed a precedent in Sulla’s case for a dictator
                    “reipublicae Constituendae causa,” but Caesar was not only appointed in an
                    unusual manner, but appointed for an unprecedentedly long period, <note

                    crowning victory at Munda (45) was a contradiction in terms and a repudiation of
                    constitutional government which excited the bitterest animosity. <note

                    served well enough for the time to give some appearance of legality to Caesar’s

                    satisfactory solution of the problem.</p>
                <p>A second question, hardly less important than the establishment and legalization
                    of a strong central executive authority over the army and the provinces, was
                    that of the position to be assigned to the old constitution, by the side of this
                    new power. So far as Caesar himself was concerned, the answer was for the time
                    sufficiently clear. The old constitution was not formally abrogated. The senate
                    met and deliberated; the assembly passed laws and elected magistrates; there
                    were still consuls, praetors, aediles, quaestors, and tribunes; and Caesar
                    himself, like his successors, professed to hold his authority by the will of the
                    people. But senate, assembly, and magistrates were all alike subordinated to the
                    paramount authority of the dictator; and this subordination was, in appearance
                    at least, more direct and complete under the rule of Caesar than under that of
                    Augustus. Caesar was by nature as impatient as Augustus was tolerant of
                    established forms; and, dazzled by the splendour of his career of victory and by
                    his ubiquitous energy and versatility, the Roman public, high and low,
                    prostrated themselves before him and heaped honours upon him with a reckless
                    profusion which made the existence of any authority by the side of his own an
                    absurdity. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the long

                    repeatedly disregarded, or suspended in a way which contrasted unfavourably with
                    the more respectful attitude assumed by Augustus. For months together Rome was
                    left without any regular magistrates, and was governed like a subject town by
                    Caesar’s prefects. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    transformed out of all likeness to its former self by the raising of its numbers
                    to 900, and by the admission of old soldiers, sons of freedmen, and even
                    “semi-barbarous Gauls.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Suet., 41, 76; Dio, xliii. 47. </p></note> But, though Caesar’s highhanded
                    conduct in this respect was not imitated by his immediate successors, yet the
                    main lines of their policy were laid down by him. These were (1) the
                    municipalization of the old republican constitution, and (2) its subordination
                    to the paramount authority of the master of the legions and the provinces. In
                    the first case he only carried further a change already in progress. Of late
                    years the senate had been rapidly losing its hold over the empire at large. Even
                    the ordinary proconsuls were virtually independent potentates, ruling their
                    provinces as they chose, and disposing absolutely of legions which recognized no
                    authority but theirs. The consuls and praetors of each year had since 81 been
                    stationed in Rome, and immersed in purely municipal business; and, lastly, since
                    the enfranchisement of Italy, the comitia, though still recognized as the
                    ultimate source of all authority, had become little more than assemblies of the
                    city populace, and their claim to represent the true Roman people was
                    indignantly questioned, even by republicans like Cicero. The concentration in
                    Caesar’s hands of all authority outside Rome completely and finally severed all
                    real connection between the old institutions of the republic of Rome and the
                    government of the Roman empire. And, though Augustus and Tiberius elevated the
                    senate to a place beside themselves in this government, its share of the work
                    was a subordinate one, and it never again directed the policy of the state;
                    while, from the time of Caesar onwards, the old magistracies are merely
                    municipal offices, with a steadily diminishing authority, even in the city, and
                    the comitia retain no other prerogative of imperial importance but that of
                    formally confirming the ruler of the empire in the possession of an authority
                    which is already his. But the institutions of the republic not merely became,
                    what they had originally been, the local institutions of the city of Rome; they
                    were also subordinated even within these narrow limits to the paramount
                    authority of the man who held in his hands the army and the provinces. And here
                    Caesar’s policy was closely followed by his successors. Autocratic abroad, at
                    home he was the chief magistrate of the commonwealth; and this position was
                    marked, in his case as in that of those who followed him, by a combination in
                    his person of various powers, and by a general right of precedence which left no
                    limits to his authority but such as he chose to impose upon himself. During the
                    greater part of his reign he was consul as well as dictator. <note

                    consolidating his power. Of his only two rivals, Lepidus his fellow triumvir was
                    in 36 ejected from Africa and banished to Circeii, while Sextus Pompeius, who
                    had since his defeat at Munda maintained a semi-piratical ascendency in the
                    western Mediterranean, was decisively defeated in the same year, and his death
                    in 35 left Octavian sole master of the West. The inevitable trial of strength
                    between himself and Antony was not long delayed. In 32 Antony inflicted one more
                    outrage upon Roman feeling, and openly challenged the hostility of Octavian by
                    divorcing Octavia in favour of the beautiful and daring Egyptian princess, with
                    whom, as the heiress of the Ptolemies, he aspired to share the empire of the
                    Eastern world. By a decree of the senate Antony was declared deposed from his

                    the integrity and stability of the empire. It was a task for which Octavian was
                    admirably fitted. To great administrative capacity and a quiet tenacity of
                    purpose he united deliberate caution and unfailing tact; while his bourgeois

                    It was not so easy to determine what relation he himself, the actual master of
                    the Roman world, should occupy towards this revived republic. His abdication, in
                    any real sense of the word, would have simply thrown everything back into
                    confusion. The interests of peace and order required that he should retain at

                    accomplished, and the rule of the emperors founded, in a manner which has no

                    and Octavian himself expressly refused the dictatorship. <note anchored="true"

                    before him, and so took his place among the lawfully appointed magistrates of
                    the republic;—only, to mark his pre-eminent dignity, as the first of them all,
                    the senate decreed that he should take as an additional cognomen that of
                    “Augustus,” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    as an abbreviated form of “princeps senatus” is quite untenable. For its real

                    realised; but it was only in appearance. For in fact the special prerogatives
                    conferred upon Octavian gave him back in substance the autocratic authority he
                    had resigned, and as between the restored republic and its new princeps the
                    balance of power was overwhelmingly on the side of the latter.</p>
                <p>Under one form or another Octavian had held the “imperium” since 43, and in 33 he
                    had been formally acknowledged as “imperator,” by the consent of all. <note

                    under which for nearly two centuries the provinces had been governed and the
                    legions led to war. He received it in the orthodox way, by decree of the senate;
                    and the decree, as was customary, defined the area of his command. The essential
                    difference between the “proconsular imperium” granted to Octavian and that which
                    had been voted year after year to the ordinary proconsuls, lay in its
                    unprecedentedly wide extent and in its long duration. All the provinces, with
                    the exception of those where no military authority or force was required, were
                    placed under his command, to be governed directly by “Iegati” appointed by him

                    senate; but in 23 even their governors were declared to be generally subordinate
                    to Octavian as the holder of a higher authority (“majus imperium).” <note

                    addition to this control, direct and indirect, of all the provinces, Octavian
                    received also the sole and supreme command of all the military and naval forces
                    of the empire. He alone henceforth levies, pays, and dismisses soldiers, equips
                    fleets, and orders the movements of both army and navy, and he was granted in
                    addition full authority to wage war and conclude treaties with whom he would.

                    Finally, in 23, if not in 27, he was exempted from the law which required the
                    proconsul to lay down his “imperium” on entering Rome, and was allowed to

                    “proconsular imperium” was granted in the first instance for ten years, <note

                    fiction of its temporary duration and periodic renewal was maintained under
                    Augustus’s successors by the celebration every ten years of the “decen-nalia.”

                <p>The proconsular imperium not only carried with it the control of the army and the

                    by proconsular authority; and, for the necessary direction and regulation of the
                    constitutional machinery which he had restored, Augustus contented himself <note

                    its holder with a popular leadership, that of the tribunes of the plebs. The
                    “tribunicia potestas” had been granted him for life in 36, <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mon. Aneyr.,</hi> ii. 21.

                    it was conferred for life upon all succeeding emperors, and the years of their
                    reigns are reckoned by the years of their tribunician power. It was conferred,
                    as all special “potestas” had been conferred under the republic, by a decree of
                    the senate and vote of the assembly. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    extant fragmentary law “de imperio Vespasiani” may be a part of the “lex”
                    conferring the “tribunicia potestas”; see his <hi rend="italic">Staatsr.,</hi>
                    ii. 818. The “tribunicia potestas” was, like the “proconsulare imperium,”
                    conferred on the chosen colleague or destined successor; Tac., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ann.,</hi> i. 2, of Tiberius, “consors tribuniciae potestatis.” </p></note> It
                    eave its holder all the prerogatives of the tribunate, without the restrictions
                    which hampered the tribunes themselves. Augustus and his successors were
                    unimpeded in its exercise by the presence of colleagues; and both their personal
                    inviolability and their right of interference held good outside the pomoerium.
                    It enabled them, as representing the acknowledged protectors of the plebs, to
                    control in the name of the people the whole administrative machinery, to
                    introduce laws, to convene the senate, to protect the aggrieved, and to
                    interfere with any exercise of authority by other magistrates. In short, it gave
                    to the man who already wielded an authority abroad more absolute than that
                    granted to Pompey by the Gabinian law all and more than all the power possessed
                    by a Gracchus in Rome.</p>
                <p>It was on these two powers that Augustus’s position as princeps rested. In virtue
                    of these he was chief magistrate of the Roman state, and all other offices and
                    privileges conferred upon him are comparatively of secondary importance. The
                    consulship which he held continuously from 31 up to 23 he never accepted again
                    but on two occasions, in 5 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and in 2 <hi

                <p>In theory at least, the Roman world was governed according to the “maxims of

                    rend="italic">Nero,</hi> 10, “ex Augusti praescripto.” </p></note> down to the
                    time of Diocletian. Even in the 3d century there is still, in name at least, a
                    republic, of which the emperor is in strictness only the chief magistrate,
                    deriving his authority from the senate and people, and with prerogatives limited
                    and defined by law. The case is quite different when we turn from the theory to
                    the practice. The division of authority between the republic and its chief
                    magistrate became increasingly unequal. Over the provinces the princeps from the
                    first ruled autocratically; and this autocracy reacted upon his position in
                    Rome, so that it became every year more difficult for a ruler so absolute abroad
                    to maintain even the fiction of republican government at home. The republican
                    institutions, with the partial exception of the senate, lose all semblance of
                    authority outside Rome, and even in their altered position as the municipal
                    institutions of the chief city of the empire they retain but little actual
                    power. The real government even of Rome passes gradually into the hands of
                    imperial prefects and commissioners, and the old magistracies become merely
                    decorations which the emperor gives away at his pleasure. And at the same time
                    the rule of the princeps assumes an increasingly personal character, and the
                    whole work of government is silently concentrated in his hands and in those of
                    his own subordinate officials. Closely connected with this change is the
                    different aspect presented by the history of the empire in Rome and Italy on <pb

                    Rome and Italy share in the decline of the republic. Political independence and
                    activity die out; their old preeminence and exclusive privileges gradually
                    disappear; and at the same time the weight of the overwhelming power of the
                    princeps, and the abuses of their power by individual “principes,” press most
                    heavily upon them. On the other hantl, in the provinces and on the frontiers,
                    where the imperial system was most needed, and where from the first it had full
                    play, unfettered by the fictions of republican government, it is seen at its
                    best as developing or protecting an orderly civilization and maintaining the
                    peace of the world.</p>
                <p>The decay of the republican institutions had commenced before the revolutionary
                    crisis of 49. It was accelerated by the virtual suspension of all regular
                    government between 49 and 28; and not even the diplomatic deference towards
                    ancient forms which Augustus displayed availed to conceal the unreality of his
                    work of restoration. The “comitia” received back from him “their ancient
                    rights,” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Suet., <hi

                    during his lifetime they continued to pass laws and to elect magistrates. But
                    after the end of the reign of Tiberius we have only two instances of legislation
                    by the assembly in the ordinary way, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The “plébiscita” of Claudius, Tac., <hi rend="italic"

                    decrees of the senate or by imperial edicts and constitutions. Their prerogative
                    of electing magistrates was, even under Augustus, robbed of most of its
                    importance by the control which the princeps exercised over their choice by
                    means of his rights of nomination and commendation, rights which effectually
                    secured the election of his own nominees. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For the nature of these rights, the latter of which was not
                    exercised in the case of the consulship until the time of Vespasian, see
                    Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Staatsr.,</hi> ii. 861-869; Tac., <hi rend="italic"

                    curtailed. The candidates for all magistracies except the consulship were
                    thenceforward nominated and voted for in the senate-house and by the senators,

                    praetorship, but that the change affected the lower magistracies also is
                    certain; see, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Pliny’s <hi rend="italic">Letters,

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dio, lviii. 20. </p></note> And, though the
                    election of consuls was never thus transferred to the senate, the process of
                    voting seems to have been silently abandoned. In the time of the younger Pliny
                    we hear only of the nomination’ of the candidates and of their formal
                    “renuntiatio” in the Campus Martius. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    ancient right of the people to confer all magisterial authority was saved, at
                    least in appearance; and it was acknowledged in as purely formal a manner in the
                    case of the princeps himself, who, as long as the principate lasted, continued
                    to receive the “tribunicia potestas” by a vote of the assembly, and was thus
                    held to derive his authority from the people. <note anchored="true"

                <p>This almost complete effacement of the “comitia” was largely due to the fact that
                    they had ceased to represent anything but the populace of Rome, and the
                    comparatively greater vitality shown by the old magistracies is mainly
                    attributable to the value they continued to possess in the eyes of the Roman
                    upper class. But, though they were eagerly sought, <note anchored="true"

                    conferred on their holders considerable social distinction, the magistrates
                    ceased, except in name, to be the popularly chosen executive officers of the
                    Roman state. In the administration of the empire at large they had no share, if
                    we except the subordinate duties still assigned to the quaestor in a province.
                    In Rome, to which their sphere of work was limited, they were overshadowed by
                    the dominant authority of the princeps, while their range of duties was
                    increasingly circumscribed by the gradual transference of administrative
                    authority, even within the city, to the emperor and his subordinate officials.
                    And their dependence on the princeps was confirmed by the control he exercised
                    over their appointment For all candidates the approval, if not the commendation,
                    of the princeps became the indispensable condition of success, and the princeps
                    on his side treated these ancient offices as pieces of preferment with which to
                    reward his adherents or gratify the ambition of Roman nobles. In all instances,
                    too, the dignity of the office was impaired by the practice, begun by Caesar and
                    continued by Augustus and his successors, of granting the insignia to men who
                    had not held the actual magistracy itself. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The senate alone among republican institutions retained some importance and

                    senate became gradually almost as powerless in reality as the comitia and the
                    magistracies. The two great supports of its authority under the republic—its
                    identification with the interests of a powerful aristocracy and the subserviency
                    of the magistrates—both fell away under the empire.</p>
                <p>The senators continued indeed to be taken as a rule from the ranks of the
                    wealthy, and a high property qualification was established by Augustus as a
                    condition of membership, but any effect which this may have had in giving
                    independence to the position of a senator was counterbalanced by the facilities
                    it afforded to the emperors for securing their own ascendency by subsidizing
                    those whose property fell short of the required standard, and who thus became
                    simply the paid creatures of their imperial patrons. <note anchored="true"

                    ancestral traditions were some guarantee for their independence. But this
                    element soon disappeared. The ranks of the old nobility were thinned by natural
                    decay and by the jealous fears of the last three Claudian emperors. Vespasian

                    senators of Rome. Some, no doubt, of these provincials, who constituted the
                    great majority of the senate in the 3d century, were men of wealth and mark, but
                    many more were of low birth, on some rested the stain of a servile descent, and
                    all owed alike their present position and their chances of further promotion to

                    at any stage, and to modify or reverse its decisions. The share of the senate in
                    the government was in fact determined by the amount of administrative activity
                    which each princeps saw fit to allow it to exercise, and by the extent to which
                    he chose to use it as an instrument of government. And this share became
                    steadily smaller. The jurisdiction assigned it by Augustus and Tiberius was in
                    the 3d century limited to the hearing of such cases as the emperor thought fit
                    to send for trial, and these became steadily fewer in number. Its control of the

                    only occasionally revived by the special favour of emperors who, like Marcus

                    advisers.</p>
                <p>The growing impotence of all other authority than that of the princeps inevitably
                    altered the character of the principate. Even under Augustus, Tiberius, and the
                    Claudian emperors, there is a silent and steady concentration of all authority
                    in the hands of the princeps; not only the army and the provinces, but even Rome
                    and Italy, are in reality governed by him, though still with a lingering respect
                    for the traditional prerogatives of the senate and the senatorial magistrates;
                    in the reigus of Caligula, Claudius, and Nero the politic disguise under which
                    Augustus and Tiberius had endeavoured to conceal the extent of their power was
                    thrown contemptuously aside. In the administration of justice and in finance, as
                    well as in military and foreign affairs, the authority of the princeps is
                    paramount; and his own personal subordinates—legates, prefects, procurators, and
                    even his freed-men <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For

                    real work of government. This increase of power was accompanied by a
                    corresponding elevation of the princeps himself above the level of all other
                    citizens. The comparatively modest household and simple life of Augustus were

                    the outward accessories of monarchy present, the palace, the palace guards, the
                    crowds of courtiers, and a court ceremonial. In direct opposition to the
                    republican theory of the principate, the members of the princeps’s family share
                    in the dignities of his position. The males bear the cognomen of Caesar, and are
                    invested, as youths, with high office; their names and even those of the females
                    are included in the yearly prayers for the safety of the princeps <note

                    chief magistrate of the Roman commonwealth with the divine attributes ascribed

                    a partial reaction. Not only Galba and the Flavian emperors but Trajan, Hadrian,
                    and the Antonines at once affected a certain simplicity in their personal
                    habits, and discountenanced the excessive servility and adulation encouraged by
                    Caligula and Nero. But this reaction served only to bring into clearer relief
                    the continued advance made towards the establishment of an autocratic and
                    military rule. Caligula, Claudius, and Nero were all first saluted as
                    imperatores by the soldiery and then invested with their powers by the senate,
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tac., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ann.,</hi> xii. 69, of Nero, “sententiam militum Secutapatrum </p></note> but
                    this reversal of the constitutional order was rendered less noticeable by the
                    fact that the choice was still made in Rome, and that it fell in each case on
                    one whose birth already marked him out as the natural successor to the purple.
                    The salutation of Galba by the legions in Spain marks the opening of a new
                    epoch. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tac., <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> i. 4. </p></note> Thenceforward, if the legions do not
                    actually select the princeps, it is their acceptance of him which is the one
                    essential condition of his tenure of power, and it is on their support that he
                    relies. Vitellius and Vespasian were chosen by the legions of Germany and Syria,
                    as Galba had been by those of Spain. Domitian emphasized the military character
                    of his rule by entering the senate in the triumphal dress; <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dio, lxvii. 4. </p></note> and under the
                    great soldier Trajan, whose adoption by Nerva was a frank confession of the
                    necessities of the case, the military title “imperator” was already superseding
                    the older and more constitutional “princeps.”</p>
                <p>Closely connected with the increasingly military character of the emperor’s
                    position was the gradual severance of the old ties which connected the emperor,
                    as chief magistrate, with Rome, as the traditional seat and centre of political
                    power. Galba, Vitellius, and Vespasian were already <hi rend="italic">de
                    facto</hi> emperors when they entered Rome from their distant provinces to claim
                    the legal confirmation by the senate. Trajan and Hadrian were both provincials
                    by birth; the former did not enter Rome for a full year after his accession, and
                    Hadrian courteously apologized to the senate for taking up the imperium in Syria
                    before his acceptance by that body. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dio, lxix. 2. </p></note> The connexion between the emperors
                    and Rome was further weakened by the increasing frequency and length of their
                    absences from the city. Life in Rome was no doubt irksome to men trained in
                    camps, as Trajan had been, and the state of affairs was such as imperatively to
                    require the emperor’s presence in the provinces and on the frontiers. The
                    distant campaigns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, and the unwearying travels of
                    Hadrian, were necessary for the safety and good government of the empire, but
                    they involved the removal from</p>
                <p>Rome of the real seat of government. The emperors from Vespasian to Aurelius
                    were, with the exception of Domitian, ready enough to respect constitutional
                    forms, at least in their personal intercourse with the senate, and Aurelius
                    seems sincerely to have wished to share with the senate the overwhelming
                    responsibilities which pressed upon him. But the improved organization of the
                    administrative system which the times demanded was too urgent a need to be set
                    aside out of respect for the niceties of an obsolete constitutional government;
                    and this period is marked by the development and extension of a purely imperial
                    system of government, the control of which was centralized in the hands of the
                    emperor alone. The main credit of this achievement is due to Hadrian, <note

                    increase the effectiveness of the administration; but it accelerated the decay
                    of local independence and energy, and thus diminished the strength of the
                    empire. The century which separates the death of Marcus Aurelius from the
                    accession of Diocletian (180-284) completed the destruction of the old Augustan
                    system. Now and again, as in the case of Pertinax, of Severus Alexander, of
                    Maximus and Balbinus, and of Tacitus, the senate succeeded in claiming for
                    itself the selection of an emperor, but with the single exception of Severus
                    Alexander their nominees were not more successful than Nerva in securing the
                    necessary attachment of the legions; as a rule the emperors of the 3d century
                    were more than ever the nominees of the soldiery, often men of obscure origin
                    from the frontier provinces. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    them excluded it from all share in the government. Septimius Severus, a native
                    of Africa, set the precedent of abstaining from seeking a formal confirmation of
                    his authority from the senate; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Rome, administered justice no longer openly in the forum but within the walls of
                    the palace, and finally established the prefect of the praetorian guard as the
                    officer next in power to the emperor himself. It is, moreover, on his
                    inscriptions that the emperor is first officially styled “dominus.” From the
                    accession of Decius (249), the first of a series of able emperors sprung from
                    the Danubian provinces, the autocratic and military character of the imperial
                    system rapidly develops. The old distinctions between imperial and senatorial
                    provinces, between the state treasury and the privy purse of the emperor,
                    finally disappear. Senators are almost entirely excluded alike from the military
                    and civil services. Lender Aurelian (270-275), an able soldier and a vigorous
                    administrator, the breach with the old traditions became complete. He
                    anticipated Diocletian in the completely autocratic methods of his government

                    peace which∣ the distracted Roman world desired, it was imperatively necessary
                    to establish on all sides of the empire really defensible frontiers; and this
                    became possible now that for the first time the direction of the foreign policy
                    of the state and of its military forces was concentrated in the hands of a
                    single magistrate. To the south and west the generals of the republic, and
                    Caesar himself, had extended the authority of Rome to the natural boundaries
                    formed by the African deserts and the Atlantic Ocean, and in these two
                    directions Augustus’s task was in the main confined to the organization of a
                    settled Roman government within these limits. In Africa the client state of
                    Egypt was formed into a separate province, and the kingdom of Numidia (25 <hi

                    Spain the hill-tribes of the northwest were finally subdued, and a third

                    <hi rend="italic">di. G.,</hi> v. caps. 4 and 6. </p></note> of Augustus’s
                    policy was to establish a protecting line of provinces running from the Euxine
                    to the North Sea, and covering the peaceful districts to the south,—AIoesia (6
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> Pannonia (9 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi>
                    Noricum (15 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> Raetia (15 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> and Gallia Belgica. Roman rule was thus carried up to the natural
                    frontier lines of the Rhine and the Danube. Here, after the defeat of Varus (9
                    A.D.) and the abandonment of a forward policy beyond the Rhine, Augustus fixed
                    the limits of the empire northward; his successor Tiberius recalled Germanicus,
                    as soon as the disaster in the Silva Teutoburgensis had been avenged; and after
                    the peace with AIaroboduus, the chief of the Alarcomanni on the upper Danube, in
                    the next year (17 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> the defensive policy
                    recommended by Augustus was adopted along the whole of the northern frontier.
                    The line of the great rivers was held by an imposing mass of troops. Along the
                    Rhine lay the armies of Upper and Lower Germany, consisting of four legions
                    each; eight more guarded the Danube and the frontiers of Pannonia and Aloesia.
                    The command of the troops was entrusted to imperial legates, whose posts became
                    the most coveted prizes in the imperial service, and were not Unfrequently
                    stepping-stones to the imperial purple itself. At frequent intervals along the
                    frontier were the military colonies, the permanent camps, and the smaller
                    intervening “castella.” Flotillas of galleys cruised up and down the rivers, and
                    Roman roads opened communication both along the frontiers and with the seat of
                    government in Italy.</p>
                <p>In the East Rome had other work to do than that of erecting a barrier against a
                    surging tide of barbarism, for here she was confronted with a well-organized and
                    powerful state whose claims to empire were second only to her own. The conquests
                    of Pompey (66-G2 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> had brought Rome face to face
                    with Parthia on the banks of the Euphrates, the limits of Roman authority being
                    marked by the eastern frontiers of the client states of</p>
                <p>Pontus, Cappadocia, and Commagene, and of the newly formed province of Syria. In
                    54 the rash advance of Crassus beyond the Euphrates provoked the first serious
                    collision between Rome and Parthia, and the victory at Carrhae encouraged among
                    the Parthians the idea of an invasion of Syria and Asia AIinor, while it
                    awakened in Rome a genuine fear of the formidable power which had so suddenly
                    arisen in the East. Caesar was at the moment of his death preparing to avenge
                    the death of Crassus by an invasion of Parthia, and Antony’s schemes of founding
                    an Eastern empire which should rival that of Alexander included the conquest of
                    the kingdom beyond the Euphrates. But on the Euphrates, as on the Rhine and the
                    Danube, Augustus adhered to the policy which he recommended to his successors of
                    “keeping the empire within its bounds”; and the Parthians, weakened by internal
                    feuds and dynastic quarrels, were in no mood for vigorous action. Roman pride
                    was satisfied by the restoration of the standards taken at Carrhae. Four legions
                    guarded the line of the Euphrates, and, beyond the frontiers of Pontus and
                    Cappadocia, Armenia was established as a “friendly and independent ally.” <note

                <p>Next in importance to the rectification and defence of the frontiers was the
                    reformation of the administration, and the restoration of prosperity to the
                    distracted and exhausted provinces. The most serious defect of the republican
                    system had been the absence of any effective contral control over the Roman
                    officials outside Italy. This was now supplied by the general proconsular
                    authority vested in the emperor. The provinces were for the first time treated
                    as departments of a single state, while their governors, from being independent
                    and virtually irresponsible rulers, became the subordinate officials of a higher
                    authority. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the

                    “legati” and “procurators” of the imperial provinces the control of the emperor
                    was as complete as that of the republican proconsul over his staff in his own
                    province. They were appointed by him, held office at his good pleasure, and were
                    directly responsible to him for their conduct. The proconsuls of the senatorial
                    provinces were in law magistrates equally with the princeps, though inferior to
                    him in rank; it was the senate that they were as of old responsible; they were
                    still selected by lot from among the senators of consular and praetorian rank.
                    But the distinction did not seriously interfere with the paramount authority of
                    the emperor. The provinces left nominally to the senate were the more peaceful
                    and settled districts in the heart of the empire, where only the routine work of
                    civil administration was needed, and where the local municipal governments were
                    as yet comparatively vigorous. The senatorial proconsuls themselves were
                    indirectly nominated by the emperor through his control of the praetorship and
                    consulship. They wielded no military and only a strictly subordinate financial
                    authority, and, though Augustus and Tiberius, at any rate, encouraged the
                    fiction of the responsibility of the senatorial governors to the senate, it was
                    in reality to the emperor that they looked for direction and advice, and to him
                    that they were held accountable. Moreover, in the case of all governors this
                    accountability became under the empire a reality. Prosecutions for extortion
                    (“de pecuniis repetundis”), which were now transferred to the hearing of the
                    senate, are tolerably frequent during the first century of the empire; but a
                    more effective check on maladministration lay in the appeal to Caesar from the
                    decisions of any <pb break="no"

                    in the right of petition. Under the Antonines, not the least laborious of the
                    duties which devolved upon the emperor and his ministers was the daily one of
                    hearing and deciding the innumerable cases sent up from the provinces. On the
                    other hand, the growing frequency of imperial mandates and rescripts (see above,
                    p. 705), dealing both with questions of general policy and with points of law,
                    attests the close attention paid by all the better emperors to the government of
                    the provinces and the increasing dependence of the governor on imperial
                    guidance. Within the province Augustus curtailed the powers of legate and
                    proconsul alike. In both cases there was a division of authority. By the side of
                    the imperial legate was placed, as the highest financial authority, an imperial
                    procurator, while the proconsul, in addition to the loss of all military
                    control, was checked by the presence of the imperial officer, also styled
                    procurator, to whom the care of the fiscal revenues was entrusted; finally, both
                    legate and proconsul were deprived of that right of requisitioning supplies
                    which, in spite of a long series of restrictive laws, had been the most powerful
                    instrument of oppression in the hands of republican governors. The financial

                    equitable, orderly, and economical system, and by the same centralization of
                    authority in the emperor’s hands. The institution of an imperial census, or
                    valuation of all land throughout the empire, and the assessment upon this basis
                    of a uniform land tax, in place of. the heterogeneous and irregular payments
                    made under the republic, were the work of Augustus, though the system was
                    developed and perfected by the emperors of the 2d century and by Diocletian. The
                    land tax itself was directly collected, either by imperial officials or by local
                    authorities responsible to them, and the old wasteful plan of selling the
                    privilege of collection to publicani was henceforward applied only to such
                    indirect taxes as the customs duties. The rate of the land tax was fixed by the
                    emperor, and with him rested the power of remission even in senatorial
                    provinces. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tac., <hi
                    rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> ii. 47. </p></note> The effect of these reforms is
                    clearly visible in the improved financial condition of the empire. Under the
                    republic the treasury had been nearly always in difficulties, and the provinces
                    exhausted and impoverished. Under the emperors, at least throughout the 1st
                    century, in spite of a largely increased expenditure on the army, on public
                    works, on shows and largesses, and on the machinery of government itself, the
                    better emperors, such as Tiberius and Vespasian, were able to accumulate large
                    sums, while the provinces show but few signs of distress. A reformed
                    administration and an improved system of taxation were not the only boons for
                    which the empire at large had to thank Augustus. While the republic had almost
                    entirely neglected to develop the internal resources of the provinces, Augustus
                    set the example of a liberal expenditure on public works, in the construction of
                    harbours, roads, and bridges, the reclamation of waste lands, and the erection
                    of public buildings. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    restrictions which the republic had placed on freedom of intercourse and trade,
                    even between the separate districts of a single province, disappeared under the
                    empire, and the institution of the provincial councils, as centres of provincial
                    unity, is one among many instances of the more liberal policy . pursued by the

                    gradual disappearance of the old pre-eminence of Rome and Italy. It was from the
                    provinces that the legions were increasingly recruited; provincials rose to high
                    rank as soldiers, statesmen, and men of letters; <note anchored="true"

                    cosmopolitanism of Rome, and with the dwindling population and decaying industry
                    of Italy; while even into Rome and Italy the methods of administration formerly
                    distinctive of the provinces found their way. From Augustus himself, jealous as
                    he was of the traditions and privileges of the ruling Roman people, date the
                    rule of an imperial prefect in the city of Rome, the division of Italy into
                    regiones in the provincial fashion, and the permanent quartering there of armed
                    troops. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Marquardt, i.

                <p>For a century and Ja half the policy initiated by Augustus secured the peace and
                    prosperity of the empire; of the emperors who ruled during that period the
                    majority were able and vigorous administrators, and even the follies and
                    excesses of Gaius, Claudius, and Nero did little harm beyond the limits of Rome
                    and Italy. The firm rule of Vespasian repaired the damages inflicted by the wars
                    of the rival emperors after Nero’s death, and the abilities of Trajan, Hadrian,
                    and the Antonines, if they failed to revive the flagging energies of the empire,
                    at least secured tranquillity and good government. But few additions of
                    importance were made to the territories of Rome. Io Britain] the work begun by

                    The conquest of Dacia by Trajan (107) was provoked by the threatening attitude
                    of the barbarian tribes on the lower Danube, and, though it remained part of the
                    empire down to 256, its exposed position as lying beyond the Danube frontier
                    rendered it always a source of weakness rather than strength. <note

                    strain the strength of the Roman defence. The presence of Trajau himself was

                    considered necessary to guard the Danubian frontier. Far more serious was the

                    regions beyond the limits of the “Roman peace.” In the East Rome and Parthia
                    still faced each other upon the banks of the Euphrates, and contended, now by
                    arms now by diplomacy, for supremacy in the debateable land of Armenia. Trajan’s
                    momentary acquisitions were abandoned by Hadrian, and on this side of the empire
                    the first changes of importance on the frontier belong to the reign of Septimius
                    Severus. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mommsen, v.

                    commenced by Augustus had steadily proceeded. A tolerably uniform provincial
                    system covered the whole area of the empire. The client states had one by one
                    been reconstituted as provinces, and even the government of Italy had been in
                    many respects assimilated to the provincial type. The municipal system had
                    spread widely; the period from Yespasian to Aurelius witnessed the elevation to
                    municipal rank of an immense number of communities, not only in the old
                    provinces of the West, in Africa, Spain, and Gaul, but in the newer provinces of
                    the North, and along the line of the northern frontier; and everywhere under the
                    influence of the central imperial authority there was an increasing uniformity
                    in the form of the local constitutions, framed and granted as they all were by
                    imperial edict. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Throughout the empire again the extension of the Roman franchise was preparing

                    and north this was preceded and accompanied by the complete Romanizing of the
                    people in language and civilization. Moreover, the empire, that was thus
                    becoming one in its administrative system, its laws, and its civilization, had
                    as yet continued to enjoy peace and order. The burdens of military service fell
                    on the frontier provinces, and only the echoes of the border wars reached the
                    Mediterranean territories. Yet, in spite of the internal tranquillity and the
                    good government which have made the age of the Antonines famous, we can detect
                    signs of weakness. Though the evils of excessive centralization were hardly felt
                    while the central authority was wielded by vigorous rulers, yet even under
                    Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines we notice a ailure of strength in the empire
                    as a whole, and a corresponding increase of pressure on the imperial government
                    itself. The reforms of Augustus had given free play to powers still fresh and
                    vigorous. The ceaseless labours of Hadrian were directed mainly to the careful
                    husbanding of such strength as still remained, or to attempts at reviving it by
                    the sheer force of imperial authority. Among the symptoms of incipient decline
                    which not the most heroic efforts of the government could entirely remove were
                    the growing depopulation especially of the central districts of the empire, the
                    constant financial difficulties, the deterioration in character of the local
                    governments in the provincial communities, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Eastern provinces, anticipated the two most serious of the dangers which
                    ultimately proved fatal to the empire.</p>
                <p>MarcusAureliusdied in 180, and his death was followed by a century of war and
                    disorder, during which nothing but the stern rule of soldier emperors, such as
                    Septimius Severus, Decius, Claudius, Aurelian, and Probus saved the empire from
                    dissolution. The want of any legal security for the orderly transmission of the
                    imperial power had been partially supplied during the 2d century by the practice
                    of adoption. But throughout the 3d century the Roman world witnessed a series of
                    desperate conflicts between rival generals put forward by their respective
                    legions as claimants for the imperial purple. Between the death of Severus in
                    211 and the accession of Diocletian in 284, no fewer than twenty-three emperors
                    sat in the seat of Augustus, and of these all but three died violent deaths at
                    the hands of a mutinous soldiery or by the orders of a successful rival. Of the
                    remaining three, Decius fell in battle against the Goths, Valerian died a
                    prisoner in the far East, and Claudius was among the victims of the chronic
                    pestilence which added to the miseries of the time. The “tyrants,” as the
                    Unsuccessfulpretenders to the imperial purple were styled, reappear with almost
                    unfailing regularity in each reign. The claims of Septimius Severus himself, the
                    first and ablest of the soldier emperors, were disputed by Clodius Albinus in
                    the West, and by Pescen-nius Niger in the East, and at the bloody battle of
                    Lug-dunum and the sack of Byzantium rival Roman forces, for the first time since
                    the accession of Vespasian, exhausted each other in civil war. <note

                    In 237-238 six emperors perished in the course of a few months. It was, however,
                    during the reign of Gallienus (260-2δ'J) that the evil reached its height. The
                    central authority was paralysed; the barbarians were pouring in from the North;
                    the Parthians were threatening to overrun the Eastern provinces; and the legions
                    on the frontiers were left to repel the enemies of Rome as best they could. A
                    hundred ties bound them closely to the districts in which they were stationed;
                    their permanent camps had grown into towns, they had families and farms; the
                    unarmed provincials looked to them as their natural protectors, and were
                    attached to them by bonds of intermarriage and by long intercourse. Now that
                    they found themselves left to repel by their own efforts the invaders from
                    without, they reasonably enough claimed the right to ignore the central
                    authority which was powerless to aid them, and to choose for themselves
                    “imperatores” whom they knew and trusted. The first of these provincial empires
                    was that established by Postumus in Gaul (259-272), and long maintained by his
                    successors Adctorinus and Tetricus. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    on the Rhine, but by the legions of Britain and Spain; and under Postumus at any
                    rate (259-269) the existence of the Gallic empire was justified by the repulse
                    of the barbarians and by the restoration of peace and security to the provinces
                    of Gaul. On the Danube, in Greece, and in Asia Minor none of the “pretenders”
                    enjoyed more than a passing success. It was otherwise in the far East, where the
                    Syrian Odaenathus, prince of Palmyra, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Armenia, Cappadocia, and Cilicia with all the independence of a sovereign.
                    Odaenathus was murdered in 266. His young son Vaballathus succeeded him in his
                    titles, but the real power was vested in his widow Zenobia, under whom not only
                    the greater part of Asia Minor but even the province of Egypt was forcibly added
                    to the dominions governed in the name of Gallienus by the Palmyrene prince.</p>

                    (275-282)—were at least rulers over the whole extent of the empire.</p>
                <p>While rival generals were contending for the imperial purple, the very existence
                    of the empire which they aspired to rule was imperilled by foreign invasion. As
                    early as 236 a new enemy, the Alemanni, had crossed the Rhine, but had been
                    driven back by the valour of Maxi-minus (238), and in the same year the Goths
                    first appeared on the banks of the Danube. It was, however, during the period of
                    internal dissension and civil war from the reign of Philip (244-249) to the
                    accession of Claudius (268) that the barbarians saw and used their opportunity.
                    From across the Rhine bands of Alemanni and Franks swept over Gaul and Spain,
                    and even descended upon the coasts of Africa, until their raids were checked by
                    the Gallic emperor Postumus (253-259). Far more destructive were the raids of
                    the Goths. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gibbon, i.
                    chap. x.; Mommsen, v. 216. </p></note> Towards the close of the reign of Philip
                    (247) they crossed the Danube, and overran Moesia, Thrace, and Macedonia. In 251
                    they defeated and slew the emperor Decius; and, though his successor Gallus
                    purchased a temporary peace by lavish gifts, the province of Dacia was finally
                    lost to Rome. The Gothic raids by sea which began under Valerian (253-260) were
                    even more destructive. Their fleets issuing from the ports of the Black Sea
                    ravaged the seaboard of Asia Minor, and returned laden with the spoils of the
                    maritime towns. In the reign of Gallienus (260-268) a fleet of five hundred sail
                    appeared off the coasts of Greece itself; Athens, Corinth, Argos, and Sparta
                    were sacked, and Epirus laid waste. On the death of Galfienus (268) the Goths
                    once more marched southward, but in the new emperor Claudius they were
                    confronted at last by an able and resolute opponent. They were decisively
                    defeated and driven back across the Danube (269). Claudius died of the plague in
                    the next year, but by his successor Aurelian Roman authority was established in
                    Moesia and Pannonia, and the Danube frontier was put once more in a state of
                    efficient defence. Five years later (276) Probus repulsed a raid of the Franks
                    and Alemanni, and restored peace on the Rhine. But the rule of Rome now stopped
                    short, as in the reign of Tiberius, at the line of the two great rivers; all
                    that had been acquired beyond since the time of Vespasian was abandoned, and on
                    the further banks of the Rhine and Danube stood, in the place of friendly or
                    subject tribes, a threatening array of hostile peoples.</p>
                <p>At the close of the 2d century the growing weakness of Parthia seemed to promise
                    an immunity from danger on the Eastern frontier. But with the revolution which
                    jdaced the Sassanidae upon the throne the whole situation was changed. <note

                    claimed descent from Cyrus and Darius, and aspired to recover from Western hands
                    the dominions which had once been theirs. In 230 Artaxares (Ardashir) had
                    formally demanded from Severus Alexander the restitution of the provinces of
                    Asia, had invaded Mesopotamia, now a Roman province, and even advanced into
                    Syria. Twenty years later his successor Sapor again crossed the Euphrates; in
                    260, ten years after Decius’s defeat by the Goths, the emperor Valerian was
                    conquered and taken prisoner by the Persians, who poured triumphantly into Syria
                    and captured Antioch. But here for the time their successes ended. Three years
                    later Odsenathus of Palmyra drove them back, and held the East securely in the
                    name of Rome. On the fall of Zenobia (273) they gained possession for a time of
                    Armenia and Mesopotamia, but were driven out by the emperor Carus (282), and the
                    frontier line as fixed by Septimius Severus was restored.</p>
                <p>Although any serious loss of territory had been avoided, the storms of the 3d
                    century had told with fatal effect <hi rend="superscript"/> upon the general

                    testimony to the altered condition of affairs. War, plague, and famine had
                    thinned the Jiopulation and crippled the resources of the provinces. On all
                    sides land was running waste, cities and towns were decaying, and commerce was
                    paralysed. Only with the greatest difficulty were sufficient funds squeezed from
                    the exhausted tax-payers to meet the increasing cost of the defence of the
                    frontiers. The old established culture and civilization of the Mediterranean

                    and luxury which marked the court, even of the better emperors, such as
                    Aurelian, was typical of the general deterioration, which was accelerated by the
                    growing practice of settling barbarians on lands within the emj)ire, and of

                    increased stability to the imperial authority itself, and to organize an
                    efficient administrative machinery throughout the empire. In the second year of
                    his reign Diocletian associated Maximian with himself as colleague, and six
                    years later (292) the hands of the two “Augusti” were further strengthened by
                    the proclamation of Constantius and Galerius as “Caesares.” Precedents for such
                    an arrangement might have been quoted from the earlier history of the empire;

                    considerations in favour of it at the time were strong. It divided the
                    overwhelming burdens and responsibilities of government, without sacrificing the
                    unity of the empire; for, although to each of the Augusti and Caesars a separate
                    sphere was assigned, the Caesars were subordinate to the higher authority of the
                    Augusti, and over all his three colleagues Diocletian claimed to exercise a
                    paramount control. It at least reduced the too familiar risk of a disputed
                    succession by establishing in the two Caesars the natural successors to the
                    higher position of Augusti, and finally it satisfied the jealous pride of the
                    rival armies of the empire by giving them what they had so constantly claimed,
                    imperatores of their own. The distribution of power between Diocletian and his
                    colleagues followed those lines of division which the feuds of the previous
                    century had only too clearly marked out. The armies of the Rhine, the Danube,
                    and of Syria fell to the lot respectively of Constantius, Galerius, and
                    Diocletian, the central districts of Italy and Africa to Maximian. <note

                    and final emancipation of the imperial authority from all constitutional
                    limitation and control. The last lingering traces of its republican origin
                    disappear. The emperors from Diocletian onwards are autocrats in theory as well
                    as in practice. The divided powers, the parallel jurisdictions, the defined
                    prerogatives of the Augustan system have all vanished. There is but one legal
                    authority throughout the empire, that of the emperor himself; and that authority
                    is absolute. This avowed despotism Diocletian, following in the steps of
                    Aurelian, hedged round with all the pomp and majesty of Oriental monarchy. The
                    final adoption of the title “dominus,” so often rejected by earlier emperors,
                    the diadem on the head, the robes of silk and gold, the replacement of the
                    republican salutation of a fellow citizen by the adoring prostration even of the
                    highest in rank before their lord and master, were all significant marks of tfie

                    placed the entire control of an elaborate administrative machinery. Most of the
                    old local and national distinctions, privileges, and liberties which had once
                    flourished within the empire had already disappeared under the levelling
                    influence of imperial rule, and the levelling process was now completed. Roman
                    citizenship had, since the edict of Caracalla, ceased to be the privilege of a
                    minority. Diocletian finally reduced Italy and Rome to the level of the
                    provinces: the provincial land-tax and provincial government were introduced

                    Parallel with this civil hierarchy of prefects, vicars, prae-sides, and smaller
                    “officiales” was the series of military officers, from the “magistri militum,”
                    the “duces,” and “comités” downwards. But the leading features of both are the
                    same. In both there is the utmost possible subordination and division of
                    authority. The subdivision of provinces, begun by the emperors of the 2d
                    century, was systematically carried out by Diocletian, and either by Diocletian
                    or by Constantine the legion was reduced to one-fifth of its former strength.

                    Finally, the various grades in these two imperial services were care-</p>
                <p>fully marked by the appropriation to each of distinctive titles, the highest
                    being that of “illustris,” which was confined to the prefects and to the

                <p>There can be little doubt that on the whole these reforms prolonged the existence
                    of the empire, by creating a machinery which enabled the stronger emperors to
                    utilize effectively all its available resources, and which even to some extent
                    made good the deficiencies of weaker rulers. But in many points they failed to
                    attain their object. Diocletian’s division of the imperial authority among
                    colleagues, subject to the general control of the senior Augustus, was
                    effectually discredited by the twenty years of almost constant conflict which
                    followed his own abdication (305-323). Constantine’s partition of the empire
                    among his three sons was not more successful in ensuring tranquillity, and in
                    the final division of the East and West between Valens and Valentinian (364) the
                    essential principle of Diocletian’s scheme, the maintenance of a single central
                    authority, was abandoned. The “tyrants,” the curse of the 3d century, were far
                    from unknown in the 4th, and their comparative paucity was due rather to the
                    hold which the house of Constantine obtained upon the allegiance of their
                    subjects than to the system of Diocletian. This system, moreover, while it
                    failed altogether to remove some of the existing evils, aggravated others. The
                    already overburdened financial resources of the empire were strained still
                    further by the increased expenditure necessitated by the substitution of four
                    imperial courts for one, and by the multiplication in every direction of paid
                    officials. The gigantic bureaucracy of the 4th century proved, in spite of its
                    undoubted services, an intolerable Aveight upon the energies of the empire.

                    government, Avhile it enlisted on the side of the state one of the most powerful

                    the new “City of Constantine” as a second Rome, Avith a second senate, a prefect
                    of tbe city, regiones, and even largesses, did more than proclaim once again the
                    deposition of Rome from her old imperial position. It paved the Avay for the
                    final separation of East and West by providing the former for the first time
                    with a suitable seat of government on the Bosphorus. The death of Constantine in
                    337 Avas folloAved, as the abdication of Diocletian had been, by the outbreak of
                    quarrels among rival Caesars. Of the three sons of Constantine Avho in 337
                    divided the empire between them, Constantine the eldest fell in civil Avar
                    against his brother Constans; Constans himself was, ten years afterwards,
                    defeated and slain by Magnentius; and the latter in his turn Avas in 353
                    vanquished by Constantine’s only surviving son Constantius. Thus for the second

                    to his cousin Julian and placed him in charge of Gaul, where the momentary
                    elevation of a tyrant, Silvanus, and still more the inroads of Franks and
                    Alemanni, had excited alarm. But Julian’s successes during the next five years
                    were such as to arouse the jealous fears of Constantius. In order to weaken his
                    suspected rival the legions under Julian in Gaul were suddenly ordered to march
                    eastward against the Persians (360). They refused, and when the order was
                    repeated replied by proclaiming Julian himself emperor and Augustus. Julian,
                    with probably sincere reluctance, accepted the position, but the death of
                    Constantius in 361 saved the empire from the threatened civil war. The chief
                    importance of the career of Julian, both as Caesar in Gaul from 355 to 361 and
                    during his brief tenure of sole power (361-363), lies, so far as the general
                    history of the empire is concerned, in his able defence of the Rhine frontier
                    and in his Persian campaign; for his attempted restoration of pagan and in
                    especial of Hellenic worships had no more permanent effect than the war which he
                    courageously waged against the multitudinous abuses which had grown up in the

                    administration in Gaul undoubtedly checked the barbarian advance across the
                    Rhine, and postponed the loss of the Western provinces, while, on the contrary,

                    beyond the Tigris won by Diocletian seventy years before. Julian died on June

                    long-impending division of the empire was at last effected,—Valentinian became
                    emperor of the West, Valens of the East. From 364 till his death in 375 the
                    vigour and ability of Valentinian kept his own frontier of the Rhine tolerably
                    intact, and prevented any serious disasters on the Danube. But his death, which
                    deprived the weaker Valens of a trusted counsellor and ally, was followed by a
                    crisis on the Danube, more serious than any which had occurred there since the
                    defeat of Decius. In 376 the Goths, hard pressed by their new foes from the
                    eastward, the Huns, sought and obtained the protection of the Roman empire. They
                    were transported across the Danube and settled in Mcesia, but, indignant at the
                    treatment they received, they rose in arms against their protectors. In 378 at
                    Hadrian-ople Valens was defeated and killed; the victorious Goths spread with
                    fire and sword over Illyricum, and advanced eastward to the very walls of
                    Constantinople. Once more, however, the danger passed away. The skill and tact
                    of Theodosius, who had been proclaimed emperor of the East by Gratian,
                    conciliated the Goths; they were granted an allowance, and in large numbers
                    entered the service of the Roman emperor. The remaining years of Theodosius’s
                    reign (382-395) were mainly engrossed by the duty which now devolved upon the
                    emperor of the East of upholding the increasingly feeble authority of his
                    colleague in the West against the attacks of pretenders. Maximus, the murderer
                    of Gratian (383), was at first recognized by Theodosius as Caesar, and left in
                    undisturbed command of Gaul, Spain, and Britain; but, when in 386 he proceeded
                    to oust Valentinian II. from Italy and Africa, Theodosius marched westward,
                    crushed him, and installed Valentinian as emperor of the West. In the very next
                    year, however, the murder of Valentinian (392) by Arbogast, a Frank, was
                    followed by the appearance of a fresh tyrant in the person of Eugenius, a
                    domestic officer and nominee of Arbogast himself. Once more Theodosius marched
                    westward, and near Aquileia decisively defeated his opponents. But his victory
                    was quickly followed by his own illness and death (395), and the fortunes of
                    East and West passed into the care of his two sons Arcadius and Honorius.</p>

                    in the century before, and though the frontier lines of the Rhine and the Danube

                    methods were adopted in order to secure for the imperial treasury every penny

                    every opportunity afforded by the dissensions or incapacity of the emperors to
                    cross the frontiers and harry the lands of the provincials. Constantine
                    (306-312), Julian (356-360), and Valentinian I. (364-375) had each to give a
                    temporary breathing space to Gaul by repelling the Franks and Alemanni. Britain
                    was harassed by Picts and Scots from the north (367-370), while the Saxon
                    pirates swept the Northern seas and the coasts both of Britain and Gaul. On the
                    Danube the Quadi, Sarmatae, and above all the Goths, poured at intervals into

                    ravages by the Isaurian mountaineers, and by a new enemy, the Saracens. <note

                    becoming barbarized. The policy which had been inaugurated by Augustus himself
                    of settling barbarians within the frontiers had been taken up on a larger scale
                    and in a more systematic way by the Illyrian emperors of the 3d century, and was
                    continued by their successors in the 4th. In Gaul, in the provinces south of the
                    Danube, even in Macedon and Italy, large barbarian settlements had been
                    made—Theodosius in particular distinguishing himself by his liberality in this
                    respect. Nor did the barbarians admitted during the 4th century merely swell the
                    class of half-servile coloni. On the contrary, they not only constituted to an
                    increasing extent the strength of the imperial forces, but won their way in
                    ever-growing numbers to posts of dignity and importance in the imperial service.

                    The Visigoths whom Alaric led into Italy had been settled south of the Danube as
                    the allies of the empire since the accession of Theodosius. The greater part of
                    them were Christians at least in name, and Alaric himself had stood high in tho
                    favour of Theodosius. The causes which set them in motion are tolerably clear.
                    Like the Germans of the days of Caesar, they wanted land for their own, and to
                    this land-hunger was evidently added in Alaric’s own case the ambition of
                    raising himself to the heights which had been reached before him by the Vandal
                    Stilicho at Ravenna and the Goth Rufinus at Constantinople. The jealousy which
                    existed between the rulers of the Western and Eastern empires furthered his
                    plans. In the name of Arcadius, the emperor of the East, or at least with the
                    connivance of Arcadius’s minister Rufinus, he occupied the province of
                    Illyricum, and from thence ravaged Greece, which according to the existing
                    division of provinces belonged to the Western empire. Thence in 396 he retreated
                    before Stilicho to Illyricum, with the command of which he was now formally
                    invested by Arcadius, and which gave him the best possible starting point for an
                    attack on Italy. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    retreat being hastened by the promises of gold freely made to him by the
                    imperial government. Not until the autumn of 408 did Alaric again cross the
                    Alps. Stilicho was dead; the barbarian troops in Honorius’s service had been
                    provoked into joining Alaricby the insane anti-Teutonic policy of Honorius and
                    his ministers, and Alaric marched unopposed to Rome. This time, however, the
                    payment of a heavy ransom saved the city. Several months of negotiation followed
                    between Alaric and the court of Ravenna. Alaric’s demands were moderate, but
                    Honorius would grant neither lands for his people nor the honourable post in the
                    imperial service which he asked for himself. Once more /Vlaric sat down before
                    Rome, and this time the panic-stricken citizens discovered a fresh mode of
                    escape. Attalus, a Greek, the prefect of the city, was declared Augustus, and
                    Alaric accepted the post of commander-inchief. But the incapacity of Attalus was
                    too much for the patience of his barbarian minister and patron, and after a few
                    months’ reign Alaric formally deposed him and renewed his offers to Honorius.
                    Again, however, they were declined, and Alaric marched to the siege and sack of
                    Rome (410). <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the

                    the invasion of Gaul and Italy by Attila. The Vandal settlement in Africa was
                    closely akin in its origin and results to those of the Visigoths and of the
                    Vandals themselves in Gaid and Spain. Here as there the occasion was given by
                    the jealous quarrels of powerful imperial ministers. The feud between Boniface,
                    count of Africa, and Aetius, the “master-general” or “count of Italy,” opened
                    the way to Africa for the Vandal king Gaiseric (Genseric), as that between
                    Stilicho and Rufinus had before set Alaric in motion westward, and as the
                    quarrel between the tyrant Constantine and the ministers of Honorius had paved
                    the way for the Vandals, Sueves, and Alans into Spain. In this case too, as in
                    the others, the hunger for more land and treasure was the impelling motive with
                    the barbarian invader, and in Africa, as in Gaul and Spain, the invaders’
                    acquisitions were confirmed by the imperial authority which they still professed
                    to recognize. It was in 429 that Gai-seric, king of the Vandals, crossed with
                    his warriors, their families and goods, to the province of Africa, a province
                    hitherto almost as untouched as Spain by the ravages of war. Thanks to the
                    quarrels of Boniface and Aetius their task was an easy one. The defenceless
                    province was easily and quickly overrun. In 435 <note anchored="true"

                    a formal treaty secured them in the possession of a large portion of the rich
                    lands which were the granary of Rome, in exchange for a payment probably of corn
                    and oil. Carthage was taken in 439, and by 440 the Vandal kingdom was firmly
                    established.</p>
                <p>Eleven years later (451) Attila invaded Gaul, but this Hunnish movement was in a
                    variety of ways different from those of the Visigoths and Vandals. Nearly a
                    century had passed since the Huns first appeared in Europe, and drove the Goths
                    to seek shelter within the Roman lines. Attila was now the ruler of a great
                    empire in central and northern Europe, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    his own Huns, the German tribes along the Rhine and Danube and far away to the
                    north owned him as king. He confronted the Roman power as an equal; and, in
                    marked contrast to the Gothic and Vandal chieftains, he treated with the
                    emperors of East and West as an independent sovereign. His advance on Gaul and
                    Italy threatened, not the establishment of yet one more barbaric chieftain on
                    Roman soil, but the subjugation of the civilized and Christian West to the rule
                    of a heathen and semi-barbarous conqueror. But Rome now reaped the advantages of
                    the policy which Honorius had perhaps involuntarily followed. The Visigoths in
                    Gaul, Christian and already half Romanized, rallied to the aid of the empire
                    against a common foe. Attila, defeated at Chalons <note anchored="true"

                    and in 453 he died. With the murder of Valentinian III. (453) the western branch
                    of the house of Theodosius came to an end, and the next twenty years witnessed
                    the accession and deposition of nine emperors. The three months’ rule of Maximus
                    is memorable only for the invasion of Italy and the sack of Rome by the Vandals
                    under Gaiseric. From 456-472 the actual ruler of Italy was Ricimer, the Sueve.
                    Of the four emperors whom he placed on the throne, Majorian (457-461) alone
                    played any imperial part outside Italy. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    own son Romulus. But Orestes’s tenure of power was brief. The barbarian
                    mercenaries in Italy determined to secure for themselves a position there such
                    as that which their kinsfolk had won in Gaul and Spain and Africa. Their demand

                <p>The installation of a barbarian king in Italy was the natural climax of the
                    changes which had been taking place in the West throughout the 5th century. In
                    Spain, Gaul, and Africa barbarian chieftains were already established as kings.
                    In Italy, for the last twenty years, the real power had been wielded by a
                    barbarian officer. Odoacer, when he decided to dispense with the nominal
                    authority of an emperor of the West, placed Italy on the same level of
                    independence with the neighbouring provinces. But the old ties with Rome were
                    not severed. The new king of Italy formally recognized the supremacy of the one
                    Roman emperor at Constantinople, and was invested in return with the rank of
                    “patrician,” which had been held before him by Aetius and Ricimer. In Italy too,
                    as in Spain and Gaul, the laws, the administrative system, and the language
                    remained Roman. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gibbon,

                    opening of a new epoch. It made possible in the West the development of a
                    Romano-German civilization; it facilitated the growth of new and distinct states
                    and nationalities;'it gave a new impulse to the influence of the Christian
                    church, and laid the foundations of the power of the bishops of Rome.</p>

                    Republic in the Middle Ages.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of the Roman republic during the Middle Ages has yet to be written,
                    and only by the discovery of new documents can the difficulties of the task be
                    completely overcome. Although very different in its origin, the Roman republic
                    gradually assumed the same form as the other Italian communes, and with almost
                    identical institutions. But, owing to the special local conditions amid which it
                    arose, it maintained a distinct physiognomy and character. The deserted Campagna
                    surrounding the city checked any notable increase of trade or industry, and
                    prevented the establishment of the guilds on the solid footing that elsewhere
                    made them the basis and support of the commune. There was also the continual and
                    oppressive influence of the empire, and, above all, the presence of the papacy,
                    which often appeared to absorb the entire vitality of the city. At such moments
                    the commune seemed annihilated, but it speedily revived and reasserted itself.
                    Consequently there are many apparent gaps in its history, and we have often
                    extreme difficulty in discovering the invisible links connecting the visible
                    fragments.</p>
                <p>Even the aristocracy of Rome had a special stamp. In the other republics,
                    excepting Venice, it was feudal, of German origin, and in perpetual conflict
                    with the popular and commercial elements which sought its destruction. The
                    history of municipal freedom lay in this struggle. But the infiltration of
                    Teutonic and feudal elements broke up the ancient aristocracy of Rome, and left
                    it at the mercy of the people. Then the popes, by the bestow <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> al of lucrative posts, rich benefices, and vast
                    estates, and, above all, by raising many nobles to the purple, introduced new
                    blood into the Roman aristocracy, and endued it with increasing strength and
                    vitality. Always divided, always turbulent, this irrepressible body was a
                    continual source of discord and civil war, of permanent confusion and turmoil.
                    Amidst all these difficulties the commune struggled on, but never succeeded in
                    long preserving a regular course or administration. What with continual warfare,
                    attacks on the Capitol, and consequent slaughter, pillage, and incendiarism, it
                    is no wonder that so few original documents are left to illustrate the history
                    of the Roman republic. Nor have chroniclers and historians done much to supply
                    this want, since, in treating of Roman affairs, their attention is mainly
                    devoted to the pope and the emperor. Nevertheless we will attempt to connect in
                    due order all the facts gleaned from former writers and published records.</p>
                <p>The removal of the seat of the empire to Constantinople effected a radical change
                    in the political situation of Rome; nor was this change neutralized by the
                    formation of the weak Western empire soon to be shattered by the Germanic
                    invasions. But we still find Roman laws and institutions; and no sign is yet
                    manifest of the rise of a mediaeval municipality. The earliest germ of one is
                    seen during the barbarian invasions. Of these we need only enumerate the four
                    most important,—those of the Goths, Byzantines, Lombards, and Franks. The Gothic
                    rule merely superposed upon the Roman social order a Teutonic stratum, that
                    never penetrated beneath its surface. The Goths always remained a conquering
                    army; according to the German custom, they took possession of one third of the
                    vanquished territory, but, while forbidding the Romans to bear arms, left their
                    local administration intact. The senate, the <hi rend="italic">curiae,</hi> the
                    principal magistrates, both provincial and municipal, the prefect of the city,
                    and the Roman judges enforcing the enactments of the Roman law were all
                    preserved. Already, under the empire, the civil power had been separated from
                    the military, and this separation was maintained. Hence there was no visible
                    change in the constitution of the state. Only, now there were conquered and
                    conquerors. All real and effective power was on the side of brute force, and the
                    Goths alone bore arms. In every province they had their <hi rend="italic"
                    >comites,</hi> or heads of the army, who had judicial power over their
                    countrymen, especially in criminal cases. Here then was a combination of civil
                    and military jurisdiction altogether contrary to the Roman idea. Nor can it be
                    denied that the comités, as chiefs of the armed force, necessarily exerted a
                    direct or indirect influence on the civil and administrative power of the
                    provinces, and especially upon the collection of the imposts. The civil arm,
                    being virtually subordinate to the military, suffered unavoidable change.
                    Notwithstanding the praise lavished on Theodoric, the kingdom founded by him in
                    Italy had no solid basis. It was composed of two nations differing in race and
                    traditions and even in religion, since the Goths were Arians and the Romans
                    Catholics. The latter were sunk in degeneracy and corruption; their institutions
                    were old and decrepit. It was necessary to infuse new life into the worn-out
                    body. This was difficult, perhaps impossible; and at any rate Theodoric never
                    attempted the task. Little wonder then if the Gothic kingdom succumbed to the
                    Byzantine hordes from Constantinople.</p>
                <p>The wars of Belisarius and Narses against the Goths lasted twenty years (535-555
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> Causedterribleslaughter and devastation in
                    Italy, and finally subjected her to Constantinople. In place of a Gothic king
                    she was now ruled by a Greek patrician, afterwards entitled the exarch, who had
                    his seat of government at Ravenna as lieutenant of the empire. In the chief,
                    provincial cities the ruling counts were replaced by dukes, subordinate to the
                    exarch; and the smaller towns were governed by military tribunes. Instead of
                    dukes, we sometimes find <hi rend="italic">magistm militum,</hi> apparently of
                    higher rank. The <hi rend="italic">praefectus praetorio</hi> of Italy, likewise
                    a dependant of the exarch, was at the head of the civil administration. The
                    pragmatic sanction (554), promulgating the Justinian code, again separated the
                    civil from the military power, which was no longer allowed to intervene in the
                    settlement of private disputes, and, by conferring on the bishops the
                    superintendence of and authority over the provincial and municipal government,
                    soon led to the increase of the power of the church, which had already
                    considerable influence.</p>
                <p>The new organization outwardly resembled that of the Goths: one army had been
                    replaced by another, the counts by dukes; there was an exarch instead of a king;
                    the civil and military jurisdictions were more exactly defined. But the army was
                    not, like that of the Goths, a conquering nation in arms; it was a Graeco-Roman
                    army, and did not hold a third of the territory which was now probably added to
                    the possessions of the state. The soldiery took its pay from Constantinople,
                    whence all instructions and appointments of superior officers likewise
                    proceeded. In Rome we find a <hi rend="italic">mαgister militum</hi> at the head
                    of the troops. The Roman senate still existed, but was reduced to a shadow.
                    Theodoric had left it intact until he suspected it of hostile designs and
                    dealings with the Byzantines, but then began to persecute it, as was proved by
                    the wretched fate of Boetius and Symmachus. Nevertheless the senate survived,
                    added the functions of a <hi rend="italic">curia</hi> or municipal council to
                    those of a governmental assembly, and took part in the election of the
                    pope—already one of the chief affairs of Rome. So many senators, however, were
                    slaughtered during the Byzantine war that it was commonly believed to be
                    extinct. The pragmatic sanction, conferring on senate and pope the
                    superintendence of weights and measures in Italy, is a convincing proof to the
                    contrary, although, in the general chaos, now that <pb break="no"

                    exposed to attack, we may imagine to what the senate was reduced.</p>
                <p>All Roman institutions were altered and decayed; but their original features were
                    still to be traced, and no heterogeneous element had been introduced into them.
                    The first dawn of a completely new epoch can only be dated from the invasion of
                    the Lombards (568-572). Their conquest of a large portion of Italy was
                    accompanied by the harshest oppression. They abolished all ancient laws and
                    institutions, and not only seized a third of the lands, but reduced the
                    inhabitants to almost utter slavery. But, in the unsubdued parts of the
                    country—namely, in Ravenna, Rome, and the maritime cities—a very different state
                    of things prevailed. The necessity for self-defence and the distance of the
                    empire, now too worn out to render any assistance, compelled the inhabitants to
                    depend solely on their own strength. Thus, certain maritime cities, such as
                    Naples, Amalfi, Pisa, and Venice, soon attained to a greater or less degree of
                    liberty and independence.</p>
                <p>A special state of things now arose in Rome. We behold the rapid growth of the
                    papal power and the continual increase of its moral and political influence.
                    This had already begun under Leo I., and been further promoted by the pragmatic
                    sanction. Not only the superintendence but often the nomination of public
                    functionaries and judges was now in the hands of the popes. And the accession to
                    St Peter’s chair of a man of real genius in the person of Gregory I., surnamed
                    the Great, marked the commencement of a new era. By force of individual
                    character, as well as by historic necessity, this pope became the most potent
                    personage in Rome. Power fell naturally into his hands; he was the true
                    representative of the city, the born defender of church and state. His
                    ecclesiastical authority, already great throughout Italy, was specially great in
                    the Roman diocese and in southern Italy. The continual offerings of the faithful
                    had previously endowed the church with enormous possessions in the province of
                    Rome, in Sicily, Sardinia, and other parts. The administration of all this
                    property soon assumed the shape of a small government council in Rome. This
                    protected and succoured the oppressed, settled disputes, nominated judges, and
                    controlled the ecclesiastical authorities. The use made by the pope of his
                    revenues greatly contributed to the increase of his moral and political
                    authority. When the city was besieged by the Lombards, and the emperor left his
                    army unpaid, Gregory supplied the required funds and thus made resistance
                    possible. And, when the defence could be no longer maintained, he alone, by the
                    weight of his personal influence and the payment of large sums, induced the
                    Lombards to raise the siege. He negotiated in person with Agilulph, and was
                    recognized by him as the true representative of the city. Thus Rome, after being
                    five times taken and sacked by the barbarians, was, on this occasion, saved by
                    its bishop. The exarch, although unable to give any help, protested against the
                    assumption of so much authority by the pope; but Gregory was no usurper, and his
                    attitude was the natural result of events. “For twenty-seven years”—-so wrote
                    this pontiff to the imperial government of Constantinople—“we lived in terror of
                    the Longobards, nor can I say what sums we had to pay them. There is an imperial
                    treasurer with the army at Ravenna; but here it is I who am treasurer. Likewise
                    I have to provide for the clergy, the poor, and the people, and even to succour
                    the distress of other churches.”</p>
                <p>It was at this moment that the new Roman commune began to take shape and acquire
                    increasing vigour owing to its distance from the seat of the empire and its
                    resistance to the Lombard besiegers. Its special character was now to be traced
                    in the preponderance of the military over the civil power. A Roman element had
                    penetrated into the army, which was already possessed of considerable political
                    importance. The prefect of Rome loses authority and seems almost a nullity
                    compared with the magister militum. Hardly anything is heard of the senate.
                    “Quia enim Senatus deest, populus interiit,” exclaims Gregory in a moment of
                    despair. The popes now make common cause with the people against the Lombards on
                    the one hand and the emperor on the other. But they avoid an absolute rupture
                    with the empire, lest they should have to face the Lombard power without any
                    prospect of help. I^ater, when the growing strength of the commune becomes
                    menacing, they remain faithful to the empire in order not to be at the mercy of
                    the people. It was a permanent feature of their policy never to allow the
                    complete independence of the city until they should be its sole and absolute
                    masters. But that time was still in the future. Meanwhile pope and people joined
                    in the defence of their common interests.</p>
                <p>This alliance was cemented by the religious disputes of the East and the West.
                    First came the Monothelite controversy regarding the twofold nature of Christ.
                    In order to compel obedience to his edict, the emperor commanded the exarch to
                    take energetic measures, and, provided he could secure the favour of the Roman
                    army, to actually seize the person of Pope Martin I. (649-654). A long and
                    violent struggle ensued, in which the people of Rome and of other Italian cities
                    sided so vigorously with the popes that John VI. (701-705) had to interpose in
                    order to release the exarch from captivity and prevent a definitive rupture with
                    the empire. Later (710-711) Ravenna revolted against the emperor, organized its
                    armed population under twelve flags, and almost all the cities of the exarchate
                    joined in a resistance that was the first step towards the independence of the
                    Italian communes. A still fiercer religious quarrel then broke out concerning
                    images. Pope Gregory II. (715-731) opposed the celebrated edict of the
                    iconoclastic emperor Leo the Isaurian. Venice and the Pentapolis took up arms in
                    favour of the pope, and elected dukes of their own without applying to the
                    emperor. Again public disorder rose to such a pitch that the pope was obliged to
                    check it lest it should go too far.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these warlike tumults a new constitution, almost a new state, was
                    being set up in Rome. During the conflict with Philippicus, the Monothelite and
                    heretical emperor who ascended the throne in 711, the <hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Pontificalis</hi> makes the first mention of the duchy of Rome <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fiucatus Romanae urbis),</hi> and we find the people struggling to elect a
                    duke of their own. In the early days of the Byzantine rule the territory
                    appertaining to the city was no greater than under the Roman empire. But, partly
                    through the weakness of the government of Constantinople, and above all through
                    the decomposition of the Italian provinces under the Lombards, who destroyed all
                    unity of government in the peninsula, this dukedom was widely extended, and its
                    limits were always changing in accordance with the course of events. It was
                    watered by the Tiber, and stretched into Tuscia to the right, starting from the
                    mouth of the Marta, by Tolfa and Bleda, and reaching as far as Orte. Viterbo was
                    a frontier city of the Lombards. On the left the duchy extended into Latium as
                    far as the Garigliano. It spread very little to the north-east and was badly
                    defended on that side, inasmuch as the duchy of Spoleto reached to within
                    fourteen miles of the Salara gate. On the other side, towards Umbria, the river
                    Nera was its boundary line.</p>
                <p>The constitution of the city now begins to show the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n807/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0807-0784"/>results of the conditions amid which it took
                    shape. The separation of the civil from the military power has entirely
                    disappeared. This is proved by the fact that, after the year 600, there is no
                    further mention of the prefect. His office still survived, but with a gradual
                    change of functions, until, in the 8th century, he once more appears as
                    president of a criminal tribunal. The constitution of the duchy and of the new
                    republic formed during the wars with the IjOmbards and the exarch was
                    substantially of an aristocratico-military nature. At its head was the duke,
                    first elected by the emperor, then by the pope and the people, and, as his
                    strength and influence grew with those of the commune, he gradually became the
                    most respected and powerful personage iu Rome. The duke inhabited the palace of
                    the Caesars on the Palatine Hill, and had both the civil and the military power
                    in his hands; he was at the head of the army, which, being composed of the best
                    citizens and highest nobility of Rome, was a truly national force. This army was
                    styled the <hi rend="italic">felicissimus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Jlorens
                    exercitus Romanus</hi> or also the <hi rend="italic">militia Romana.</hi> Its
                    members never lost their citizen stamp; on the contrary they formed the true
                    body of the citizens. We find mention of other <hi rend="italic">duxes</hi> in
                    Rome, but these were probably other leaders or superior officers of the army.
                    Counts and tribunes are found in the subject cities bound to furnish aid to the
                    capital. In fact during the pontificate of Sergius II. (844), when the duchy was
                    threatened by a Saracenic invasion, they were requested to send troops to defend
                    the coast, and as many soldiers as possible to the city.</p>
                <p>At that time the inhabitants of Rome were divided into four principal
                    classes—clergy, nobles, soldiers, and simple citizens. The nobles were divided
                    into two categories, first the genuine <hi rend="italic">optimates, i.e.,</hi>
                    members of old and wealthy families with large estates, and filling high, and
                    often hereditary, offices in the state, the church, and the army. These were
                    styled <hi rend="italic">proceres</hi> and <hi rend="italic">primates.</hi> The
                    second category comprised landed proprietors, of moderate means but exalted
                    position, mentioned as <hi rend="italic">nobiles</hi> by Gregory L, and
                    constituting in fact a numerous petty nobility and the bulk of the army. Next
                    followed the citizens, i.e., the commercial class, merchants, and craftsmen,
                    who, having as yet no fixed organization and but little influence, were simply
                    designated as <hi rend="italic">honxsti cives.</hi> These, however, were quite
                    distinct from the plebeians, <hi rend="italic">plebs, vulgus populi, viri
                    humiles,</hi> who in their turn ranked above bondsmen and slaves. The honesti
                    cives did not usually form part of the army, and were only enrolled in it in
                    seasons of emergency. Nevertheless the army was not only national, but became
                    increasingly democratic, so that in the IOth century it included every class of
                    inhabitants except churchmen and slaves. At that period we sometimes find the
                    whole people designated as the <hi rend="italic">exercitus,</hi> those actually
                    under arms being distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">militia exercitus
                    Romani.</hi> This again was divided into bands or “numbers,” t.β., regiments,
                    and also, in a manner peculiar to Rome, into <hi rend="italic">scholae
                    militurn.</hi> These scholae were associations derived from antiquity, gaining
                    strength and becoming more general in the Middle Ages as the central power of
                    the state declined. There were scholae of notaries, of church singers, and of
                    nearly every leading employment; there were scholae of foreigners of diverse
                    nationalities, of Franks, Lombards, Greeks, Saxons, Ac. Even the trades and
                    crafts began to form scholae. These were at first very feeble institutions, and
                    only later gained importance and became guilds. As early as the 8th century
                    there vzere scholae militurn in the army, which was thus doubly divided. But we
                    have no precise definition of their functions. They were <hi rend="italic">de
                    facto</hi> corporations with separate property, churches, and magistrates of
                    their own. The latter were always optimates, and guarded the interests of the
                    army. But the real chiefs of the bands or <hi rend="italic">numeri</hi> were the
                    duces or tribunes, and under the Franks the latter became comités. These chiefs
                    were styled <hi rend="italic">magnijici consules, optimates de militia,</hi>
                    often too <hi rend="italic">Pudixes de militia,</hi> since, as was the custom of
                    the Middle Ages, they wielded political and judicial as well as military
                    authority. The title of consul was now generally given to superior officers,
                    whether civil or military. The importance of the scholae militurn began to
                    decline in the IOth century; towards the middle of the 12th they disappeared
                    altogether, and, according to Papencordt, were last mentioned in 1145. It is
                    probable that the scholae militurn signified local divisions of the army,
                    corresponding with the city wards, which were twelve in number during the IOth
                    and Ilth centuries, then increased to thirteen, and occasionally to fourteen. It
                    is certain that from the beginning the army was distributed under twelve flags;
                    after the scholae had disappeared, we find it classified in districts, which
                    were subdivided into companies. The division of cities into quarters, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sestieri</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rwni,</hi> corresponding with
                    that of the army, and also with that of the municipal government, was the common
                    practice of Florence, Siena, and almost all the Italian communes. But, while
                    usually losing importance as the guilds acquired power, in Rome the
                    insignificance of the guilds added to the strength of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >regioni</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rwni,</hi> which not only became part of the
                    army but finally grasped the reins of government. This was a special
                    characteristic of the political constitution of the Roman commune.</p>
                <p>We now come to a question of weightier import for <hi rend="superscript">ι</hi>
                    all desiring to form a clear idea of the Roman government at that period. What
                    had become of the senate? It had undoubtedly lost its original character now
                    that the empire was extinct. But, after much learned discussion, historical
                    authorities are still divided upon the subject. Certain Italian writers of the
                    18th century— Vendettini, for example—asserted with scanty critical insight that
                    the Roman senate did not disappear in the Middle Ages. The same opinion backedby
                    much learned research was maintained by the great German historian Savigny. And
                    Leo, while denying the persistence of the curia in Lombard Italy, adhered to
                    Savigny’s views as regarded Rome. Papencordt did the same, but held the Roman
                    senate to be no more than a curia. This judgment was vigorously contested, first
                    by Hegel and Giesebrecht, then by Gregorovius. These writers believe that after
                    the middle of the 6th century the senate had a merely nominal existence.
                    According to Gregorovius its last appearance was in the year 579. After that
                    date it is mentioned in no documents, and the chroniclers are either equally
                    silent or merely allude to its decay and extinction. In the 8th century,
                    however, the terms <hi rend="italic">senator, senαtores, senatus</hi> again
                    reappear. We find letters addressed to Pippin, beginning thus: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Omvis senatus atque Universi populi geηeralitas.</hi> When Leo III. returned
                    from Germany he was met by <hi rend="italic">tam proceres cleri-corum cum
                    omnibus clericis, quamque optimates et senatus, Cunctaque militia</hi> (see
                    Anastasius, in Muratori, vol. iii. 198 c). But it has been noted that the senate
                    was never found to act as a political assembly; on occasions when it might have
                    been mentioned in that capacity we hear nothing of it, and only meet with it in
                    ceremonials and purely formal functions. Hence the conclusion that the term
                    senator was used in the sense of noble, senatus of nobility, and no longer
                    referred to an institution but only to a class of the citizens. Even when we
                    find that Otho III. (who sought to revive all the ancient institutions of Rome)
                    addressed an edict to the “Consuls and Senate of Rome,” and read that the laws
                    of St Stephen <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0808-0785"/>were issued <hi rend="italic">senatus
                    decreto,</hi> the learned Giesebrecht merely remarks that no important changes
                    in the Roman constitution are to be attributed to the consuls and senate
                    introduced by Otho III. Thus for the next glimpse of the senate we must pass to
                    the 12th century, when it was not only reformed, as some writers believe, but
                    entirely reconstituted.</p>
                <p>But in this case a serious difficulty remains to be disposed of. Gregorovius
                    firmly asserts that the nobles acquired great power between the 7th and IOth
                    centuries, not only filling the highest military, judicial, and ecclesiastical
                    offices, “but also directing the municipal government, presumably with the
                    prefect at their head.” He further adds :—“Notwithstanding the disappearance of
                    the senate, it is difficult to suppose that the city was without governing
                    magistrates, or without a council.” Thus, after the 7th century, the optimates
                    at the head of the army were also at the head of the citizens, and “formed a
                    communal council in the same manner in which it was afterwards formed by the <hi

                    427-8 and note (2d ed.). </p></note> Now, if the nobles were called senatores,
                    and the nobility senatus, and if this body of nobles met in council to
                    administer the affairs of the republic, there is no matter for dispute, inasmuch
                    as all are agreed that the original senate must have had a different character
                    from the senate of the Aliddle Ages. And, since the absence of all mention of a
                    prefect after the 7th century is not accepted as a proof of his non-existence,
                    and we find him reappear under another form in the 8th century, so the silence
                    as to the senate after the year 579, the fresh mention of it in the 8th century,
                    and its reappearance in the 12th as a firmly reconstituted body reasonably lead
                    to the inference that, during that time, the ancient senate had been gradually
                    transformed into the new council. Its meetings must have been held very
                    irregularly, and probably only in emergencies when important affairs had to be
                    discussed, previously to bringing them before the parliament or general assembly
                    of the people. Historians are better agreed as to the significance of the term
                    <hi rend="italic">consul.</hi> At first this was simply a title of honour
                    bestowed on superior magistrates, and retained that meaning from the 7th to the
                    Ilth century, but was then—as in other Italian cities—only given to the chief
                    officer of the state.</p>
                <p>During this period the Roman constitution was very simple. The duke, commanding
                    the army, and the prefect, presiding over the criminal court, were the chiefs of
                    the republic; the armed nobility constituted the forces, filled all superior
                    offices, and occasionally met in a council called the senate, though it had no
                    resemblance to the senate of older times. In moments of emergency a general
                    parliament of the people was convoked. This constitution differed little from
                    that of the other Italian communes, where, in the same way, we find all the
                    leading citizens under arms, a parliament, a council, and one or more chiefs at
                    the head of the government.</p>
                <p>But Rome had an element that was lacking elsewhere. We have already noted that,
                    in the provinces, the administrators of church lands were important personages,
                    and exercised during the AIiddle Ages, when there was no exact division of
                    power, both judicial and political functions. It was very natural that the heads
                    of this vast administration resident in Rome should have a still higher
                    standing, and in fact, from the 6th century, their power increased to such an
                    extent that in the times of the Franks they already formed a species of papal
                    cabinet with .a share and sometimes a predominance in the affairs of the
                    republic. There were seven principal administrators, but two of them held the
                    chief power,—the <hi rend="italic">primicerius Hotariorum</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Secundicerius, i.e.,</hi> the first. and under secretaries of
                    state. AVhen, on the constitution of the new empire, these ministers were
                    declared to be palatine or imperial as well as papal officials, the primicerius
                    and the Secundicerius were also in waiting on the emperor, who sat in council
                    with them, when in Rome. Next came the <hi rend="italic">arcarius,</hi>
                    Ortreasurer; the <hi rend="italic">Sacellarius,</hi> or cashier; <hi
                    rend="italic">theproto-Scriniarius,</hi> who was at the head of the papal
                    chancery; the <hi rend="italic">primus defensor,</hi> who was the advocate of
                    the church, and administered its possessions. Seventh and last came the <hi
                    rend="italic">Homenclator,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">admiηiculator,</hi> who
                    pleaded the cause of widows, orphans, and paupers. There were also some other
                    officials, such as the <hi rend="italic">vestianus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vicedominus</hi> or steward, the <hi rend="italic">cubicularius</hi> or
                    majordomo, but these were of inferior importance. They were ecclesiastics, but
                    not bound to be in priest’s orders. The first seven were those specially known
                    as <hi rend="italic">proceres clericorum</hi> and often er still as <hi
                    rend="italic">judices de clero,</hi> since they speedily assumed judicial
                    functions and ranked among the chief judges of Rome. But as ecclesiastics they
                    did not give decisions in criminal cases. Thus Rome had two tribunals, that of
                    <hi rend="italic">ike judices de clero,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ordinarii,</hi> presided over by the pope, and that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >judices de militia,</hi> leaders of the army, dukes and tribunes, also bearing
                    the generic title of consuls. First appointed by the exarch and then frequently
                    by the pope, these decided both civil and criminal cases. In the latter they
                    were sole judges under the presidency of the prefect.</p>
                <p>The pope was thus at the head of a large administrative body with judicial and
                    civil powers that were continually on the increase, and, in addition to his
                    moral authority over Christendom, was possessed of enormous revenues. So in
                    course of time he considered himself the real representative of the Roman
                    republic. Gregory II. (715-731) accepted in the name of the republic the
                    submission of other cities, and protested against the conquest by the Lombards
                    of those already belonging to Rome. He seemed indeed to regard the territory of
                    the duchy as the patrimony of the church. The duke was always at the head of the
                    army, and, officially, was always held to be an imperial magistrate. But the
                    empire was now powerless in Italy. Aleanwhile the advance of the Lombards was
                    becoming more and more threatening; they seized Ravenna in 751, thus putting an
                    end to the exarchate, and next marched towards Rome, which had only its own
                    forces and the aid of neighbouring cities to rely upon. To avoid being crushed
                    by the brute force of a foreign nation unfit to rule, and only capable of
                    oppression and pillage, it was necessary to make an energetic stand.</p>
                <p>Accordingly the reigning pope, Stephen II. (752-757), appealed to Pippin, king of
                    the Franks, and concluded with that monarch an alliance destined to inaugurate a
                    new epoch of the world’s history. The pope consecrated Pippin king of the
                    Franks, and named him <hi rend="italic">patricius Romanorum.</hi> This title, as
                    introduced by Constantine, had no longer the ancient meaning, but now became a
                    sign of lofty social rank. AVhen, however, it was afterwards conferred on
                    barbarian chieftains such as Odoacer and Theodoric, and then on the
                    representative of the Byzantine empire in Italy, it acquired the meaning of a
                    definite dignity or office. In fact the title was now given to Pippin as
                    defender of the church, for the pope styled him at the same time <hi
                    rend="italic">patricius Romanorum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">defensor</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">protector ecclesiae.</hi> And the king pledged himself not
                    only to defend the church but also to wrest the exarchate and the Pentapolis
                    from the Lombards and give them to Rome, or rather to the pope, which came to
                    the same thing. This was considered as a restitution made to the head of the
                    church, who was also the representative of the republic and the empire. And, to
                    preserve the character of a restitution, the famous “donation of Constantine”
                    was invented during this period (752<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0809-0786"/>777). Pippin brought his army to the rescue
                    (754-755)</p>
                <p>and fulfilled his promise. The pope accepted the donation in the name of St
                    Peter, and as the visible head of the church. Thus in 755 central Italy broke
                    its connexion with the empire and became independent; thus was inaugurated the
                    temporal power of the papacy, the cause of so much subsequent warfare and
                    revolution in Rome.</p>
                <p>Its first consequences were speedily seen. In 767 the death of Paul I. was
                    followed by a fierce revolt of the nobles under Duke Toto (Theodoro) of Nepi,
                    who by violent means raised his brother Constantine to the chair of St Peter,
                    although Constantine was a layman and had first to be ordained. For more than a
                    year the new pontiff was a pliable tool in the hands of Toto and of the nobles.
                    But the genuine papal faction, headed by a few judices de clero, asked the aid
                    of the Lombards and made a formidable resistance. Their adversaries were
                    defeated, tortured, and put to death. Toto was treacherously slain during a
                    fight. The pope was blinded and left half dead on the highway. Fresh and no less
                    violent riots ensued, owing to the public dread lest the new pope, Stephen IV.
                    (768-772), elected by favour of the Lombards, should give them the city in
                    return. But Stephen went over to the Franks, whom he had previously deserted,
                    and his successor, Hadrian I. (772-795), likewise adhered to their cause, called
                    the city to arms to resist king Desiderius and his Lombard hordes, and besought
                    the assistance of Charlemagne. This monarch accordingly made a descent into</p>
                <p>• Italy in 773, and not only gained an easy victory over Desiderius, but
                    destroyed the Lombard kingdom and seized the iron crown. Entering Rome for the
                    first time in 774, he confirmed and augmented the donation of Pippin by the
                    addition of the dukedom of Spoleto. He returned several times to Italy and Rome,
                    making new conquests and fresh concessions to Adrian L, until the death of the
                    latter in 795.</p>
                <p>The position of Rome and of the pope is now substantially changed. Duke, prefect,
                    militia, and the people exist as heretofore, but are all subordinate to the head
                    of the church, who, by the donations of Pippin and Charlemagne, has been
                    converted into a powerful temporal sovereign. Henceforth all connexion with
                    Byzantium is broken off, but Rome is still the mainspring of the empire, the
                    Roman duchy its sole surviving fragment in Italy, and the pope stands before the
                    world as representative of both. And, although it is difficult to determine how
                    this came about, the pope is now regarded aud regards himself as master of Rome.
                    In the year 772 he entrusts the <hi rend="italic">Vestiarius</hi> with judicial
                    powers over the laity, ecclesiastics, freemen, and slaves <hi rend="italic"
                    >nostrae Romanae reipublicae.</hi> He writes to Charlemagne that he has issued
                    orders for the burning of the Greek ships employed in the slave trade, “in our
                    city of Civita Vecchia” (Centumcelke), and he always speaks of Rome and the
                    Romans as “our city,” “our republic,” “our people.” The donations of Pippin and
                    Charlemagne are restitutions made to Saint Peter, the holy church, and the
                    republic at the same time. It is true that Charlemagne held the supreme power,
                    had an immensely increased authority, and actively fulfilled his duties as
                    patricius. But his power was only occasionally exercised in Rome; it was the
                    result of services rendered to the church, and of the church’s continual need of
                    his help; it was, as it were, the power of a mighty and indispensable ally. The
                    pope, however, was most tenacious of his own authority in Rome, made vigorous
                    protest whenever rebels fled to Charlemagne or appealed to that monarch’s
                    arbitration, and contested the supremacy of the imperial officials in Rome. Yet
                    the pope was no absolute sovereign, nor, in the modern sense of the term, did
                    any then exist. He asserted supremacy over many lands which continually rebelled
                    against him, and which, for want of an army of his own, he was unable to reduce
                    to obedience without others’ help. Neither did the republic acknowledge him as
                    its head. It profited by the growing power of the pope, could not exist without
                    him, respected his moral authority, but considered that he usurped undue power
                    in Rome. This λvas specially the feeling of the nobles, who had hitherto held
                    the chief authority in the republic, and, being still the leaders of the army,
                    were by no means willing to relinquish it. The Roman nobles were very different
                    from other aristocratic bodies elsewhere. They were not, as they pretended,
                    descendants of the Camilli aud the Scipios, but neither were they a feudal
                    aristocracy, inasmuch as the Teutonic element had as yet made small way among
                    them. They were a mixture of different elements, national and foreign, formed by
                    the special conditions of Rome. Their power was chiefly derived from the high
                    offices and large grants of money and land conferred on them by the popes; but,
                    as no dynasty existed, they could not be dynastic. Every pope aggrandized his
                    own kindred and friends, and these were the natural and often open adversaries
                    of the next pontiff and his favourites. Thus the Roman nobility was powerful,
                    divided, restless, and turbulent; it was continually plotting against the pope,
                    threatening not only his power, but even his life; it continually appealed to
                    the people for assistance, stirred the militia to revolt, and rendered
                    government an impossibility. Hence, notwithstanding his immense moral authority,
                    the pope was the effective head neither of the aristocracy, the army, nor of the
                    as yet unorganized lower classes. The lord of vast but often insubordinate
                    territories, the recognized master of a capital city torn by internecine feud
                    and plots against himself, he needed the support of an effective force for his
                    own preservation and the maintenance of the authority proffered him from all
                    quarters. Hence the necessity of creating an empire of the West, after having
                    snapped every link with that of the East. Thus the history of Rome is still, as
                    in the past, a history of continual strife between pope, emperor, and republic;
                    and the city, while imbibing strength from all three, keeps them in perpetual
                    tumult and confusion.</p>
                <p>Leo III. (796-816) further strengthened the ties between Charlemagne and the
                    church by sending the former a letter with the keys of the shrine of St Peter
                    and the banner of Rome. Charlemagne had already joined to his office of
                    patrician the function of high justice. The new symbols now sent constituted him
                    <hi rend="italic">miles</hi> of Rome and general of the church. The pope urged
                    him to despatch an envoy to receive the oath of fealty, thus placing himself,
                    the representative of the republic, in the subordinate position of one of the
                    bishops who had received the immunities of counts. And all these arrangements
                    took place without the slightest reference to the senate, the army, or the
                    people. Much resentment was felt, especially by the nobles, and a revolution
                    ensued headed by the primicerius Paschalis and the secundicerius Campulus, and
                    backed by all who wished to liberate the city from the papal rule. During a
                    solemn procession the pope was attacked and barbarously maltreated by his
                    assailants, who tried to tear out his eyes and tongue (799). He was thrown into
                    prison, escaped, and overtook Charlemagne at Paderborn, and returned guarded by
                    ten of the monarch’s envoys, who condemned to death the leaders of the revolt,
                    reserving, however, to their sovereign the right of final judgment. Charlemagne
                    arrived in December 800, and as Iiighjustice assembled a tribunal of the clergy,
                    nobles, citizens, and Franks; he pronounced Leo to be innocent, and confirmed
                    the capital sentence passed on the rebels. But through the intercession of the
                    pope, who dreaded the wrath of the nobles, this was presently com <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0810-0787"/>muted into perpetual exile. And finally on
                    Christmas day, in St Peter’s, before an assemblage of Roman and Frankish lords,
                    the clergy, and the people, the pontiff placed the imperial crown on
                    Charlemagne’s head and all proclaimed him emperor.</p>
                <p>Thus the new emperor was elected by the Romans and consecrated by the pope. But
                    he was their real master and supreme judge. The pope existed only by his will,
                    since he alone supplied the means for the maintenance of the temporal power, and
                    already pretended to the right of controlling the papal elections. Yet
                    Charlemagne was not sovereign of Rome; he possessed scarcely any regalia there,
                    and was not in command of the army; he mainly represented a principle, but this
                    principle was the law which is the basis of the state. The pope still nominated
                    the Roman judges, but the emperor or his ro⅛' presided over them, together with
                    those of the pope, and his decision was appealed to in last resort. During the
                    Caro-lingian times no mention is found of the prefect, and it would seem that
                    his office was filled by the imperial <hi rend="italic">missus,</hi> or legate,
                    the judices de clero, and judices de militia. The power of the pope was now
                    entangled with that of the republic on the one hand and that of the empire on
                    the other. The consequent confusion of sacred and secular functions naturally
                    led to infinite complications and disputes.</p>
                <p>The death of Charlemagne in 814 was the signal for a fresh conspiracy of the
                    nobles against the pope, who, discovering their design, instantly put the
                    ringleaders to death, and was severely blamed by Louis for this violation of the
                    imperial prerogative. While the matter was under discussion the nobles broke out
                    in fiercer tumults, both in Rome and the Campagna. At last, in 824, the emperor
                    Lothair came to re-establish order in Rome, and proclaimed a new and noteworthy
                    constitution, to which Pope Eugenius II. (824-27) gave his oath of adherence. By
                    this the partnership of pope and emperor in the temporal rule of Rome and the
                    states of the church was again confirmed. The more direct power appertained to
                    the pope; the supreme authority, présidence of the tribunals, and final judgment
                    on appeal to the emperor. The new constitution also established the right of
                    contending parties to select either the Roman or the Teutonic code for the
                    settlement of their disputes. During the Carolingian period it is not surprising
                    that the commune should have been, as it were, absorbed by the church and the
                    empire. In fact it is scarcely mentioned in history throughout that time. And
                    when, no longer sustained by the genius of its founder, the Frankish empire
                    began to show signs of dissolution, the popes, finding their power thereby
                    strengthened, began to assume many of the imperial attributes. Soon, however, as
                    a natural consequence of the loss of the main support of the papacy, the nobles
                    regained vigour and were once more masters of the city. Teutonic and feudal
                    elements had now largely penetrated into their organization. The system of
                    granting lands, and even churches and convents, as benefices according to feudal
                    forms, became more and more general. It was vain for the popes to offer
                    opposition, and they ended by yielding to the current. The fall of the Frankish
                    empire left all Italy a prey to anarchy, and torn by the faction fights of
                    Berengar of Friuli and Guido of Spoleto, the rival claimants to the crowns of
                    Italy and the empire. The Saracens were advancing from the south, the Huns from
                    the north; the popes had lost all power; and in the midst of this frightful
                    chaos a way was opened for the rise of the republics. Anarchy was at its climax
                    in Rome, but the laity began to overpower the clergy to such an extent that the
                    judices de militia prevailed over the judices de clero. For a long time no
                    imperial missi or legates had been seen, and the papacy was incredibly lowered.
                    The election of the popes had positively fallen into the hands of certain
                    beautiful women notorious for their evil life and depravity. The aristocracy
                    alone gained strength; now freed from the domination of the emperor, it
                    continually wrested fresh privileges from the impotent pontiffs, and became
                    organized as the ruling force of the republic. Gregorovius, notwithstanding his
                    denial of the continuation of the senate after the 6th century, is obliged to
                    acknowledge that it appeared to have retürned to life in the power of this new
                    baronage. And, although this body was now permeated with the feudal principle,
                    it did not discard its ancient traditions. The nobles claimed to be the main
                    source of the empire; they wished to regain the dignity and office of patricius,
                    and to make it, if possible, hereditary in their families. Nothing is known of
                    their system of organization, but it seems that they elected a chief bearing the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">consul, senator, pmnceps Romanorum,</hi> who was
                    officially recognized by the pope, as a patricius presided over the tribunals,
                    and was the head of the commune.</p>
                <p>Theophylact was one of the first to assume this dignity. His wife Theodora, known
                    as the <hi rend="italic">senαtrix,</hi> was one of the women then dominating
                    Rome by force of their charms and licentiousness. She was supposed to be the
                    concubine' of Pope John X. (914-928), whose election was due to her influence.
                    Her daughter Marozia, in all things her worthy rival, was married to Alberic, a
                    foreign mercenary of uncertain birth who rose to a position of great influence,
                    and, although an alien, played a leading part in the affairs of the city. He
                    helped to increase the power of Theophylact, who seemingly shared the rule of
                    the city with the pope. In the bloody war that had to be waged against the
                    Saracens of southern Italy, and at the defeat of the latter on the Garigliano
                    (916), Theophylact and Alberic were the Roman leaders, and distinguished
                    themselves by their valour. They disappeared from the scene after this victory,
                    but Marozia retained her power, and bore a son Alberic, who was destined to
                    greater deeds. The pope found himself caught in this woman’s toils, and
                    struggled to escape, but Marozia, gaining fresh influence by her marriage with
                    Hugo, margrave of Tuscany, imprisoned the pontiff himself in Castle St Angelo
                    (928). This fortress was the property of Marozia and the basis of her strength.
                    The unfortunate John died within its walls. Raised to the chair by Theodora, he
                    was deposed and killed by her daughter. The authority of the latter reached its
                    culminating point in 931, when she succeeded in placing her son John XI. on the
                    papal throne. On the death of her second husband she espoused Hugo of Provence,
                    the same who in 928 had seized the iron crown at Pavia, and now aspired to the
                    empire. Dissolute, ambitious, and despotic, he came to Rome in 932, and, leaving
                    his army outside the walls, entered Castle St Angelo with his knights, instantly
                    began to play the tyrant, and gave a blow to Alberic his stepson, who detested
                    him as a foreign intruder. This blow proved the cause of a memorable revolution;
                    for Alberic rushed from the castle and harangued the people, crying that the
                    time was come to shake off the tyrannous yoke of a woman and of barbarians who
                    were once the slaves of Rome. Then, putting himself at the head of the populace,
                    he closed the city gates to prevent Hugo’s troops from coming to the rescue, and
                    attacked the castle. The king fled; Marozia was imprisoned, Alberic proclaimed
                    lord of the Romans, and the pope confined to the Lateran in the custody of his
                    own brother. Rome was again an independent state, a republic of nobles. Rid of
                    the temporal dominion of emperor and pope, and having expelled the foreigners
                    with great energy and courage, it chose Alberic for its chief with the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">pmnceps atgue omnium Romanornm senator.</hi> The tendency of

                    those of Alberic, Brancaleone, Crescenzio, Cola di Rienzo, and others. One of
                    the many causes of this tendency may be traced to the conception of the new
                    empire of which Rome was the original and enduring fountainhead. As Rome had
                    once transferred the empire from Byzantium to the Franks, so Rome was surely
                    entitled to reclaim it. The imperial authority was represented by the office of
                    patrician, now virtually assumed by Alberic. That he gave the name of Octavian
                    to his son is an additional proof of this fact. In the Eternal City the
                    mediaeval political idea has always the aspect of a resurrection or
                    transformation of classic antiquity. This is another characteristic of the
                    history of the Roman commune.</p>
                <p>Alberic’s strength was due to his connexion with the nobility, to his father’s
                    valiant service against the Saracens at the battle of Garigliano, and to the
                    militia under his command, on which everything depended amid the internal and
                    external dangers now threatening the new state. As yet no genuine municipal
                    constitution was possible in Rome, w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> here neither
                    the people nor the wealthy burghers engaged in industry and commerce had any
                    fixed organization. All was in the hands of the nobles, and Alberic, as their
                    chief, frequently convened them in council, although obliged to use pressure to
                    keep them united and avoid falling a prey to their disputes. Hence the whole
                    power was concentrated in his grasp; he was at the head of the tribunals as well
                    as of the army. The judices de clero and judices de militia still existed, but
                    no longer met in the Lateran or the Vatican, under the presidency of emperor and
                    pope or their missi. Alberic himself was their president; and, a still more
                    significant fact, their sittings were often held in his private dwelling. There
                    is no longer any mention of prefect or patricius. The papal coinage w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> as inscribed with Alberic’s name instead of the
                    emperor’s. His chief attention was given to the militia, which was still
                    arranged in scholae, and it is highly probable that he was the author of the new
                    division of the city into twelve <hi rend="italic">regions,</hi> with a
                    corresponding classification of the army in as many regiments under twelve flags
                    and twelve <hi rend="italic">baηderesi,</hi> one for every region. The
                    organization of the scholae could not have been very dissimilar, but doubtless
                    Alberic had some important motive for altering the old method of classification.
                    By means of the armed regions he included the people in the forces. It is
                    certain that after his time we find the army much changed and far more
                    democratic. It was only natural that so excellent a statesman should seek the
                    aid of the popular element as a defence against the arrogance of the nobles, and
                    it was requisite to reinforce the army in order to be prepared for the attacks
                    threatened from abroad. This change effected, Alberic felt prepared for the
                    worst, and began to rule with energy, moderation, and justice. His
                    contemporaries award him high praise, and he seems to have been exempt from the
                    vices of his mother and grandmother.</p>
                <p>In 933 Hugo made his first attack upon the city, and w <hi rend="superscript"
                    >r</hi> as repulsed. A second attempt in 936 proved still more unfortunate, for
                    his army was decimated by a pestilence. Thoroughly disheartened, he not only
                    made peace, but gave his daughter in marriage to Alberic, thus satisfying the
                    latter’s desire to ally himself with a royal house. But this union led to no
                    conciliation with Hugo. For Alberic, finding his power increased, marched at the
                    head of his troops to consolidate his rule in the Campagna and the Sabine land.
                    On the death of his brother, Pope John XI., in 936, he controlled the election
                    of several successive popes, quelled a conspiracy formed against him by the
                    clergy and certain nobles instigated by Hugo, and brilliantly repulsed, in 941,
                    another attack by that potentate. At last, however, this inveterate foe withdrew
                    from Rome, being summoned to the north by the victories of his rival
                    Berengarius. But Alberic, after procuring the election of various popes who were
                    docile instruments of his will, experienced a check when Agapetus H. (946-955),
                    a man of firmness and resource, was raised to the papal throne. The fortunes of
                    Berengarius were now in the ascendant. In 950 he had seized the iron crown, and
                    ruled in the Pentapolis and the exarchate. This being singularly painful to the
                    pope, he proceeded to make alliance with all those enemies of Berengarius
                    preferring a distant emperor to a neighbouring and effective sovereign, with the
                    Roman nobles who were discontented with Alberic, and with all who foresaw
                    danger, even to Rome, from the extended power of Berengarius. And Agapetus
                    recurred to the old papal policy, by making appeal to Otho I., whose rule in
                    Germany was distinguished by a prestige almost comparable with that of
                    Charlemagne.</p>
                <p>Otho immediately responded to the appeal and descended into Italy; but his envoys
                    were indignantly repulsed by Alberic, and, being prudent as well as firm, he
                    decided to wait a more opportune moment for the accomplishment of his designs.
                    Meanwhile Alberic died in 954, and the curtain fell on the first great drama of
                    the Roman republic. He had reigned for twenty-two years with justice, energy,
                    and prudence; he had repelled foreign invaders, maintained order and authority.
                    He seems, however, to have realized that the aspect of affairs was about to
                    change, that the work he had accomplished would be exposed to new dangers. These
                    dangers, in fact, had already begun with the accession of an enterprising pope
                    to the Holy See. The name of Octavian given by Alberic to his son leads to the
                    inference that he meant to make his power hereditary. But, suddenly, he began to
                    educate this son for the priesthood, and, assembling the nobles in StBeteFs
                    shortly before his death, he made them swear to elect Octavian as pope on the
                    decease of Agapetus II. They kept their word, for in this way they freed
                    themselves from a ruler. Possibly Alberic trusted that both offices might be
                    united, and that his son would be head of the state as well as the church. But
                    the nobles knew this to be a delusion, especially in the case of a nature such
                    as Octavian’s. The lad w ’ as sixteen years old when his father died, received
                    princely honours until the death of Agapetus, and w <hi rend="superscript"
                    >τ</hi> as then elected pope with the name of John XII. He had inherited the
                    ungoverned passions of his grandmother Marozia and great-grandmother Theodora,
                    but without their intelligence and cunning. His palace was the scene of the most
                    scandalous licence, while his public acts were those of a baby tyrant. He
                    conferred a bishopric on a child of ten, consecrated a deacon in a stable,
                    invoked Venus and Jupiter in his games, and drank to the devil’s health. He
                    desired to be both pope and prince, but utterly failed to be either. Before
                    long, realizing the impossibility of holding in check Berengarius, who still
                    ruled over the exarchate, he sought in 960 the aid of Otho L, and promised him
                    the imperial crown. Thus the new ruler was summoned by the son of the man by
                    whom he had been repulsed. Otho vowed to defend the church, to restore her
                    territories, to refrain from usurping the power of the pope or the republic, and
                    was crowned on the 2d February 962 with unheard-of pomp and display.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, after being extinct for thirty-seven years, the empire was revived
                    under different but no less difficult conditions. The politico-religious unity
                    founded by Charlemagne had been dissolved, partly on account of the
                    heterogeneous elements of which it was composed, and partly because other
                    nations were in course of formation.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0812-0789"/>
                <p>Now too the feudal system was converting the officers of the I empire into
                    independent princes, and the new spirit of communal liberty was giving freedom
                    to the cities. Otho once more united the empire and the church, Italy and
                    Germany, in order to combat these new foes. But the difficulties of the
                    enterprise at once came to light. John XII., finding a master in the protector
                    he had invoked, now joined the discontented nobles who were conspiring with
                    Berengarius against the emperor. But the latter hastened to Rome in November
                    963, assembled the clergy, nobles, and heads of the people, and made them take
                    an oath never again to elect a pope without his consent and that of his son. He
                    also convoked a synod presided over by himself in St Peter’s, which judged,
                    condemned, and deposed Pope John and elected Leo VIIL (963-965), a Roman noble,
                    in his stead. All this was done at the direct bidding of the emperor, who thus
                    deprived the Romans of their most valued privilege, the right of choosing their
                    own pope. But the people had now risen to considerable importance, and, for the
                    first time, we find it officially represented in the synod by the plebeian
                    Pietro, surnamed Imperiola, together with the leaders of the militia, which had
                    also become a popular institution since Alberic’s reign. It was no longer easy
                    to keep the lower orders in subjection, and by their junction with the
                    malcontent nobles they formed a very respectable force. On the 3d January 964
                    they sounded the battle-peal and attacked the Vatican, where the emperor was
                    lodged. The German knights repulsed them with much slaughter, and this bloodshed
                    proved the beginning of an endless feud. Otho departed in February, and John
                    XII., as the chosen pope of the Romans, returned with an army of followers and
                    compelled the defenceless Leo VIII. to seek safety in flight. Soon afterwards
                    Leo was deposed and excommunicated by a new synod, and many of his adherents
                    were cruelly murdered. But on the 14th May 964 John suddenly expired; the
                    Romans, amid violent struggles and tumults, resumed their rights, elected
                    Benedict V. and procured his consecration in spite of the emperor’s veto. Otho
                    now appeared at the head of an army, committed fresh slaughter, besieged the
                    city, reduced it by famine, and, after holding a council which deposed Benedict
                    and sent him a prisoner to Hamburg, restored Leo VIII. to the papal throne.</p>
                <p>But, although the emperor thus disposed of the papacy at his will, his arbitrary
                    exercise of power roûsed a long and obstinate resistance, which had no slight
                    effect upon the history of the commune. Leo VIII. died in 965, and the imperial
                    party elected John XIIL (965-972). Upon this the nobles of the national party
                    joined the people, and there was a general revolt. The nobles were led by
                    Pietro, prefect of Rome. As we have noted, this office seemed to be extinct
                    during the Carolingian rule, but we again meet with it in 955, after an interval
                    of a century and a half. The leaders of the people were twelve <hi rend="italic"
                    >decarconi,</hi> a term of unknown derivation, but probably indicating chiefs of
                    the twelve regions <hi rend="italic">{dodecarchi, dodecarcoηi, decarconi).</hi>
                    The new pope was seized and confined, first in Castle St Angelo, then in a
                    fortress in the Campagna. But the emperor qτiιckly marched an army against Rome,
                    and this sufficed to produce a reaction which recalled the pope (November 966),
                    sent the prefect into exile, and put several of the rebellious nobles to death.
                    And shortly after the emperor sacked the city. Many Romans were exiled, some
                    tortured, others, including the twelve <hi rend="italic">decarconi,</hi> killed.
                    John XIII. died in 972 and Otho in 973.</p>
                <p>All these events clearly prove how great a change had now taken place in the
                    conditions of Rome. The people <hi rend="italic">(plebs)</hi> had made its
                    appearance upon the stage; the army had become democratic; the twelve regions
                    were regularly organized under leaders. Opposed to them stood the nobles, headed
                    by the prefect, also a noble, precisely as in Florence the nobles and the
                    podestà were later opposed to the guilds and the people. So far, it is true,
                    nobles and people had made common cause in Rome; but this harmony was soon to be
                    interrupted. The feudal spirit had made its way among the Roman aristocrats, had
                    split them into two parties and diminished their strength. It was now destined
                    to spread, and, as it was always vigorously detested and opposed by the people
                    elsewhere in Italy, so the same consequence was inevitable in Rome. Another
                    notable change, and a subject of unending controversy, had also occurred in the
                    administration of justice. So far there were the judices de clero, also known as
                    ordinary or palatine judges, and the judices de militia, also styled consules or
                    duces. These judges generally formed a court of seven, three being de clero,
                    four de militia, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> under the presidency of
                    the papal or imperial missi. In criminal cases the judices de militia had the
                    prefect or the imperial missus for their president. But there was a third order
                    of judges called <hi rend="italic">pedanei, a COnsulibus creatk</hi> It seems
                    clear that the duces, being <hi rend="italic">distributi per judicatus,</hi>
                    found themselves isolated in the provinces, and to obtain assistance nominated
                    these pedanei, who were legal experts. In Rome, with its courts of law, they
                    were less needed, but possibly in those sections of the city where cases of
                    minor importance were submitted to a single magistrate reference was made to the
                    pedanei. But many changes were made under the Franks, and when the edict of
                    Lothair (824) granted free choice of either the Roman or Germanic laιv, and the
                    duces were replaced by <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >gαstaldioηes,</hi> chiefly of German origin, the use of legal experts became
                    increasingly necessary. And the custom of employing them was the more easily
                    diffused by being already common among the Franks, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >scabini</hi> were legal experts acting as judges, though not qualified to pass
                    sentence. Thus the pedanei multiplied, came to resemble the scabini, and were
                    designated <hi rend="italic">judices dαtivi (a magistratu dαti)</hi> or simply
                    <hi rend="italic">dativi.</hi> These were to be found in the exarchate in 838,
                    but not in Rome until 961, when the judices de militia had ceased to exist. The
                    great progress of the German legal procedure may then have contributed to the
                    formation of the new office.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Pope John XIII. had been succeeded by Benedict VI. (973-974) and Otho
                    I. by his son Otho II., a youth of eighteen married to the Byzantine princess
                    Theophano. Thereupon the Romans, who had supported the election of another pope,
                    and were in no awe of the new emperor, rose to arms under the command of
                    Crescenzio, a rich and powerful noble. They not only seized Benedict VI. by
                    force, but strangled him in Castle St Angelo. The national and imperial parties
                    then elected several popes who were either exiled or persecuted, and one of them
                    was said to be murdered. In 985 John XV. was elected (985-996). During this
                    turmoil, the national party, composed of nobles and people, led by Giovanni
                    Crescenzio, son of the other Crescenzio mentioned above, had taken complete
                    possession of the government. This Crescenzio assumed the title of patrician,
                    and sought to imitate Alberic, although far his inferior in capacity.
                    Fortunately for him the reigning pope was a detested tyrant, and the emperor a
                    child entirely guided by his mother. But the new emperor Otho III. was backed by
                    a powerful party, and on coming to Rome in 996 was able, although only aged
                    fifteen, to quell the rebellion, oust Crescenzio from public life, and elect as
                    successor to John XV. his own cousin, Pope Gregory V. (996-999). But this first
                    German pope surrounded himself with compatriots, and by raising them to lofty
                    posts even in the tribunals excited a revolt that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n813/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0813-0790"/>drove him from the throne (29th September 996).
                    Cres-cenzio, being master of Castle St Angelo, resumed the title of patrician or
                    consul of the Romans, expelled the German judges, reconstituted the government,
                    prepared his troops for defence, and created a new pope. But the following year
                    Otho III. came to Rome, and his party opened the gates to him. Although deserted
                    by nearly all his adherents, Crescenzio held the castle valiantly against its
                    besiegers. At last, on the 29th April 998, he was forced to make terms, and the
                    imperialists, violating their pledges, first put him to torture and then hurled
                    him from the battlements. Gregory V. dying shortly after these events, Sylvester
                    II., another German, was raised to the papacy (999-1003).</p>
                <p>Thus Otho III. was enabled to establish his mastery of Rome. But, as the son of a
                    Greek mother, trained amid Greek influences, his fantastic and contradictory
                    nature seemed only to grasp the void. He wished to reconstitute a
                    Romano-Byzantine empire with Rome for l∏3 capital. His discourse always turned
                    on the ancient republic, on consuls and senate, on the might and grandeur of the
                    Roman people; and his edicts were addressed to the senate and the people. The
                    senate is now constantly mentioned, and its heads bear the title of consuls. The
                    emperor also gave renewed honour to the title of patrician, surrounded himself
                    with officials bearing Greek and Roman designations, and raised the prestige of
                    the prefect, who, having now almost the functions of an imperial vicar, bore the
                    eagle and the sword as his insignia. Nevertheless Otho III. was thoroughly
                    German, and during his reign all Germanic institutions made progress in Rome.
                    This was particularly the case with feudalism, and Sylvester II. was the first
                    pope to treat it with favour. Many families of real feudal barons now arose. The
                    Crescenzii held sway in the Sabine hills, and Prseneste and Tusculum were great
                    centres cf feudalism in the llth century. The system of feudal benefices was
                    recognized by the church, which made grants of lands, cities, and provinces in
                    the feudal manner. The bishops, like feudal barons, became actual counts. And,
                    in consequence of these changes, when the emperor, as head of the feudal system,
                    seeks to impose his will upon the church (which has also become feudal) and
                    control the papal elections, he is met by the great question of the
                    investitures, a question destined to disturb the whole world. Meanwhile the
                    Roman barons were growing more and more powerful, and were neither submissive
                    nor faithful to the emperor. On the contrary they resented his attitude as
                    master of Rome, and, when he subjected Tivoli to the Holy See, attacked both him
                    and the pope with so much vigour as to put both to flight (l6th February 1001).
                    Thereupon Rome again became a republic, headed by Gregory of Tusculum, a man of
                    a powerful family claiming descent from Alberic.</p>
                <p>By the emperor’s death in January 1002 the race of the Othos became extinct, the
                    papacy began to decline, as at the end of the Carolingian period, and the
                    nobles, divided into an imperial and a national party, were again predominant.
                    They reserved to themselves the office of patrician, and, electing popes from
                    their own ranks, obtained enlarged privileges and power. At the time when
                    Ardoin, marquis of Ivrea, profiting by the extinction of the Othos and the
                    anarchy of Germany, was stirring Italy in the vain hope of constituting a
                    national kingdom, the Roman republic was being consolidated under another
                    Giovanni Crescenzio, of the national faction. He was now elected patrician; one
                    of his kinsmen was invested with the office of prefect, and the new pope John
                    XVIII. (1003-9) was one of his creatures. Although the power of Henry of Bavaria
                    was then gaining ascendency in Germany, and giving strength to the imperialist
                    nobles, Crescenzio still remained supreme ruler of the city and the Campagna.
                    Surrounded by his judges, the senators, and his kinsman the prefect, he
                    continued to dispense justice in his own palace until his death in 1012, after
                    ten years’ rule. And, Pope Sergius IV. having died the same year, the counts of
                    Tusculum compassed the election of Benedict VIIL (1012-24), one of their own
                    kin. This pope expelled the Crescenzii, changed the prefect, and reserved the
                    title of patrician for Henry II., whom lie consecrated emperor on the 14th
                    February 1014. A second Alberic, bearing the title of “eminentissimus consul et
                    dux,” was now at the head of the republic and dispensed <hi rend="italic"
                    >placita</hi> in the palace of his great ancestor, from whom the counts of
                    Tusculum were also descended.</p>
                <p>The new emperor endeavoured to re-establish order in Rome, and strengthen his own
                    authority together with that of the pope. But the nobles had in all things the
                    upper hand. They were regularly organized under leaders, held meetings, asserted
                    their right to nominate both pope and emperor, and in fact often succeeded in so
                    doing. Even Henry II. himself was obliged to secure their votes before his
                    coronation. The terms senate and senator now recur still more frequently in
                    history. Nevertheless, Benedict VIIL succeeded in placing his own brother,
                    Romano, at the head of the republic with the title of “consul, dux, and
                    senator,” thus making him leader of the nobles, who met at his bidding, and
                    chief of the militia and the tribunals. The prefect still retained his
                    authority, and the emperor was by right supremejudge. But, a violent revolt
                    breaking out, the emperor only stayed to suppress it and then went to Germany in
                    disgust. The pope, aided by his brother, conducted the government with energy;
                    he awed the party of Crescenzio, and waged war against the Saracens in the
                    south. But he died in 1024, and in the same year Henry II. was succeeded by
                    Conrad II. There was now beheld a repetition of the same strange event that had
                    followed the death of Alberic, and with no less fatal consequences. Benedict’s
                    brother Romano, head of the republic, and still retaining office, was, although
                    a layman, elected pope. He took the name of John XIX. (1024-33), and in 1027
                    conferred the imperial crown on Conrad the Salic, who, abolishing the Lothairian
                    edict of 824, decreed that throughout Rome and its territory justice should be
                    henceforth administered solely by the Justinian code. Thus, notwithstanding the
                    spread of feudalism and Germanic procedure, the Roman law triumphed through the
                    irresistible force of the national character, which was already manifested in
                    many other ways.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile John XIX. was succeeded by his nephew, Benedict IX. (1033-45), a lad of
                    twelve, who placed his own brother at the head of the republic. Thus church and
                    state assumed the aspect of hereditary possessions in the powerful house of the
                    counts of Tusculum. But the vices and excesses of Benedict were so monstrous
                    that the papacy sank to the lowest depth of corruption; there followed a series
                    of tumults and reactionary attempts, and so many conflicting elections that in
                    1045 three popes were struggling for the tiara in the midst of scandal and
                    anarchy. The streets and neighbourhood of Rome swarmed with thieves and
                    assassins; pilgrims were plundered; citizens trembled for their lives; and a
                    hundred petty barons threatened the rival popes, who were obliged to defend
                    themselves by force. This state of things lasted until Henry III. came to
                    re-establish order. He appointed a synod to depose the three popes, and then,
                    with the consent of the wearied and anarchy-stricken Romans, assuming the right
                    of election, proposed a German, Clement II., who was consecrated at Christmas
                    1046. Henry III. was then crowned, and also took the title of patrician. Thus
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n814/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0814-0791"/>emperor was lord over church and state. This,
                    however, stirred both people and pope against him, and led to the terrible
                    contest of the investitures, although for the moment the Romans, being
                    exlιausted by past calamities, seemed not only resigned but contented.</p>
                <p>In fact, the idea of reform and independence was already germinating in the
                    church and was soon to become tenacious and irresistible. Hildebrand was the
                    prompter and hero of this idea. He sought to abolish the simony and concubinage
                    of the priesthood, to give the papal elections into the hands of the higher
                    ecclesiastics, and to emancipate the church from all dependence on the empire.
                    Henry III. procured the election of four German popes in succession, and
                    Hildebrand was always at hand to inspire their actions and dominate them by his
                    strength of intellect and still greater strength of will. But the fourth German
                    pope, Victor IL, died in 1057, and Henry III. had been succeeded in 1056 by the
                    young Henry IV. under the regency of a weak woman, the empress Agnes. Hildebrand
                    seized this favourable moment for trying his strength and procured the election
                    of Stephen IX. (1057-58), a candidate he had long had in view. Stephen, however,
                    died in 1058; the nobles instantly rose in rebellion; and Gregory of Tusculum,
                    who had assumed the patriciate, caused an incapable cousin to be named pope
                    (Benedict X.). Upon this Hildebrand postponed his design of maintaining the
                    papacy by the help of Italian potentates and had recourse to the empress. In a
                    synod held at Siena with her consent Benedict was deposed and Nicholas</p>
                <p>II. (1059-61) elected in his stead. This pope entered Rome escorted by the troops
                    of Godfrey of Tuscany, and, when also assured of help from Naples, assembled a
                    council of one hundred and thirteen bishops (1059), who condemned the deposed
                    pontiff and renewed the prohibition of simony and concubinage among the
                    priesthood. Finally Nicholas instituted the college of cardinals, entrusting it
                    with the election of the pope, who was in future to be chosen from its ranks.
                    The assent of the clergy and people was left purely formal. The decree also
                    contained the proviso— “saving the honour and reverence due to the emperor”; but
                    this too was an empty expression.</p>
                <p>The new decree was a master-stroke of Hildebrand’s genius, for by means of it he
                    placed the papal election in the hands of a genuine ecclesiastical senate and
                    gave a monarchical form to the church. Backed by the Normans who were in Rome,
                    and whose commander, Richard of Capua, did not scruple to strike off the heads
                    of many recalcitrant nobles, Hildebrand and the pope could now pursue their work
                    of reform. Nevertheless the nobles again revolted on the death of Nicholas II.
                    in 1061, and declared their purpose of restoring to Henry IV. the patriciate and
                    right of election; but Hildebrand, by speedily convoking the cardinals, procured
                    the election of Alexander</p>
                <p>II. (1061-73). This pope, although friendly to the empire, did not await the
                    imperial sanction, but, protected by the Romans, at once entered the Lateran and
                    put some other riotous nobles to death. The German bishops, however, elected
                    Honorius IL, who had the support of the barons. Thus the city was split into two
                    camps and a deadly civil war ensued, terminating, despite the vigorous
                    resistance of the nobility, in the defeat of Honorius II. But the nobles
                    persevered in the contest and were the real masters of Rome. By conferring the
                    patriciate on the emperor, as their feudal chief, they hoped to organize
                    themselves under the prefect, who now, with greatly increased authority,
                    presided over both the civil and criminal courts in the absence of the pope’s
                    representative. In a general assembly the Romans elected their prefect, whose
                    investiture was granted by the emperor, while the pope elected another. Thus
                    disorder was brought to a climax,</p>
                <p>Alexander died on the 21st April 1073, and thereupon ∣ Hildebrand was at last
                    raised to the chair as pope Gregory VIL (1073-85). He reconfirmed his
                    predecessors’ decrees, dismissed all simoniacal and non-celibate priests, and
                    then in a second council (1075) forbade the clergy to receive investiture at the
                    hands of laymen. No bishop nor abbot was again to accept ring or crozier from
                    king or emperor. Now, as ecclesiastical dignities included the possession of
                    extensive benefices, privileges, and feudal rights, this decree gave rise to
                    tremendous dispute and to fierce contest between the empire and the church. The
                    nobles took a very decided part in the struggle. With Cenci, their former
                    prefect, at their head, they rose in revolt, assailed the pope on Christmas day
                    1075, and threw him into prison. But their fear of the popular wrath compelled
                    his speedy release; and he then decreed the excommunication and deposition of
                    the emperor who had declared him deposed. That monarch afterwards made
                    submission to Gregory at Canossa (1077), but, again turning against him, was
                    again excommunicated. And in 1081 he returned to Italy bringing the antipope
                    Clement III., and besieged Rome for forty days. Assembling the nobles in his
                    camp, he there arranged a new government of the city with prefect and senate,
                    palatine judges, and other magistrates, exactly similar to the existing
                    government within the walls. He then took his departure, returned several times
                    in vain, but at last forced his way into the city (March 1084), and compelled
                    Gregory VII. to seek refuge in Castle St Angelo. The emperor was then master of
                    Rome, established the government he had previously arranged, and, calling a
                    parliament of nobles and bishops, procured the deposition of Gregory and the
                    consecration of Clement III., by whom he was crowned in 1084. He then attacked
                    and seized the Capitol, and assaulted the castle in order to capture the pope.
                    But Robert Guiscard brought his army to the rescue. Emperor and anti-pope fled;
                    the city was taken, the pope liberated, and Rome reduced to ruin by fire and
                    pillage. Upon this Gregory VII., broken with grief, went away with the Normans,
                    and died at Salerno on the 25th May 1085. He had separated the church from the
                    people and the empire by a struggle that, as Gregorovius says, disturbed the
                    deep sleep of the Middle Ages</p>
                <p>Pope Paschal II. (1099-1118) found himself entirely at the mercy of the tyrannous
                    nobles who were alike masters of Rome, of its government, and its spiritual
                    lord. As they were divided among themselves, all the pope could do was to side
                    with one party in order to overcome the other. With the help of his own nephew
                    Gualfredo, the prefect Pietro Pierleone, and the Frangipani, he Avas able to
                    keep down the Corsi, and hold the Colonna in check. Beingcompelled to repair to
                    Benevento in 1108, he left Gualfredo to command the militia, Tolomeo of Tusculum
                    to guard the Campagna, and the consuls Pierleone and Leone Frangipani, together
                    Avith the prefect, in charge of the government. The consulship was no longer a
                    mere title of honour. The consuls seem to have been elected, as at Ravenna, in
                    imitation of those of the Lombard cities, and were at the head of the nobles and
                    senate. The expressions “praefectus et consules,” “de senatoribus et
                    consulibus,” are now of frequent occurrence. We have no precise knowledge of the
                    political organization of the city at this moment; but it was an aristocratic
                    government, similar to that originally formed in Florence, as Villani tells us,
                    Avith a senate and consuls. The nobles were so completely the masters that the
                    pope, in spite of having trusted them Avitlι the government, could only return
                    to Rome Avith the aid of the Normans. Being iioav absorbed in the great
                    investiture question, he had recourse to a daring plan. He proposed to Henry V.
                    that the bishops <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n815/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0815-0792"/>should resign all property derived from the crown
                    and depend solely on tithes and donations, while the empire should resign the
                    right of investiture. Henry seemed disposed to accept the suggestion, but,
                    suddenly changing hjs mind, took the pope prisoner and forced him to yield the
                    right of investiture and to give him the crown (1111). But the following year
                    the party of reform annulled in council this concession, which the pope declared
                    to have been extorted by force. By the death of Countess Matilda in 1115 and the
                    bequest of her vast possessions to the Holy See, the pope’s dominions were
                    greatly enlarged, but his authority as a ruler was nowise increased. Deeds of
                    violence still continued in Rome; and then followed the death of the prefect
                    Pietro. The nobles of the imperial party, joined with the people, wished to
                    elect Pietro’s son, also nephew to Tolomeo of Tusculum, who then held the
                    position of a potent imperial margrave, had territories stretching from the
                    Sabine mountains to the sea, was the dictator of Tusculum, master of Latium, and
                    consul of the Romans. The pope opposed this election to the best of his
                    strength; but the nobles carried the day, and their new prefect received
                    investiture from the emperor. Upon this the pope again quitted Rome, and on his
                    return, two years later, was compelled to shut himself up in Castle St Angelo,
                    where he died in 1118.</p>
                <p>The popes were now the sport of the nobles whom they had aggrandized by continual
                    concessions for the sake of peace. And peace seemed at hand when Innocent II.
                    (1130-43), after triumphing over two antipopes, came to terms with Roger L,
                    recognized him as king of Sicily, and gained his friendship and protection. But
                    now still graver tumults took place. In consequence of the division of the
                    nobles neither party could overcome its foes without the aid of the people,
                    which thus became increasingly powerful. Throughout Upper and Central Italy the
                    cities were being organized as free and independent communes on a democratic
                    basis. Their example was soon followed in the ancient duchy of Rome and almost
                    in the immediate neighbourhood of the city. Even Tivoli was converted into a
                    republic. This excited the deepest jealousy in the Romans, and they became
                    furious when this little city, profiting by its strong position in the Teverone
                    valley, not only sought to annex Roman territory, but dared to offer successful
                    resistance to the descendants of the conquerors of the world. In 1141 Tivoli
                    openly rebelled against the mother city, and the pope sent the Romans to subdue
                    it. They were not only repulsed, but Ignominiously pursued to their own gates.
                    Afterwards, returning to the assault in greater numbers, they conquered the
                    hostile town. Its defenders surrendered to the pope, and he immediately
                    concluded a treaty of peace without consulting either the people or the
                    republic. The soldiery, still flushed with victory, were furious at this slight.
                    They demanded not only the submission of Tivoli to the Roman people, but also
                    permission to demolish its walls and dwellings and expel its population.
                    Innocent II. refused consent to these excesses, and a memorable revolution
                    ensued by which the temporal power of the papacy was entirely overthrown.</p>
                <p>In 1143 the rebellious people rushed to the Capitol, proclaimed the republic,
                    reconstituted the senate, to the almost entire exclusion of the nobles, declared
                    the abolition of the temporal power, issued coin inscribed to the senate, the
                    people, and St Peter, and began to reckon time from the day of the restoration
                    of liberty. Arnold of Brescia was not, as has been incorrectly stated, the
                    author of this revolution, for he had not yet arrived in Rome. It was the
                    outcome of an historic necessity—above all of the renewed vigour of the people
                    and its detestation of the feudal aristocracy. This body, besides being divided
                    into an imperial and a national party, had almost excluded from the government
                    the powerful baronage of the Campagna and the provinces. Also, as we have before
                    noted, the Roman aristocracy was by no means an exclusive caste. Between the
                    great aristocrats and the people there stood a middle or new nobility, which
                    made common cause with the people, whose chief strength now lay in the army.
                    This, divided into twelve and then into thirteen or fourteen regions, assembled
                    under its banners all arm-bearing citizens. Thus the <hi rend="italic"
                    >exercitus</hi> was also the real <hi rend="italic">populus Romanus,</hi> now
                    bent on the destruction of the temporal power. This purpose, originating in the
                    struggle of the investitures, was the logical and inevitable result of the
                    proposals of Paschal IL, which, despite their rejection, found a loud echo in
                    Italy. Lucius II. (1144-45) tried to withstand the revolution by seeking Norman
                    aid and throwing himself into the arms of the feudal party, but this only
                    precipitated the course of events. The people, after having excluded nearly all
                    aristocrats from the senate, now placed at its head the noble Giordano dei
                    Pierleoni, who had joined the revolutionary party. They named him patrician, but
                    without prejudice to the authority of the empire, still held by them in respect,
                    and also conferred on him the judicial powers appertaining to the aristocratic
                    and imperial office of prefect. The pope was requested to resign the temporal
                    power, the regalia, and every other possession, and content himself with the
                    tithes and offerings of the faithful according to the scheme of Paschal</p>
                <p>II. He indignantly refused, marched at the head of the nobles against the
                    Capitol, but was violently repulsed, and received a blow on the head from a
                    stone, which is supposed to have occasioned his speedy death on the l5th
                    February 1145. Eugenius III. was then elected (1145-53), but soon had to fly to
                    Viterbo in quest of armed assistance, in consequence of the senate’s resolve to
                    forcibly prevent his consecration until he recognized the new state of things in
                    the Eternal City.</p>
                <p>It was at this moment that Arnold of Brescia arrived in Rome. His ideas, already
                    well known in Italy, had inspired and promoted the Roman revolution, and he now
                    came to determine its method and direction. Born at Brescia in the beginning of
                    the l2th century, Arnold had studied in France under the celebrated Abelard, who
                    had instructed him in theology and philosophy, inspired him with a great love
                    for antiquity, and stimulated his natural independence of mind. On returning to
                    his native land he assumed the monkish habit, and proved the force and fervour
                    of his character by taking part in all struggles for liberty. And, together with
                    political reform, he preached his favourite doctrine of the necessary
                    renunciation by the clergy of all temporal wealth. Expounded with singular
                    eloquence, these doctrines had a stirring effect on men’s minds, spread
                    throughout the cities of northern Italy, and were echoed on all sides. It seems
                    undoubted that they penetrated to Rome and helped to promote the revolution, so
                    that Arnold was already present in spirit before he arrived there in person. It
                    is known that at the Lateran council of 1139 Innocent II. had declared these
                    doctrines to be inimical to the church and enjoined silence on their author.
                    And, as at that time the party hostile to liberty was triumphant in Brescia,
                    Arnold left his native place, crossed the Alps, and returned to France, where
                    other struggles awaited him. He professed no anti-Catholic dogmas,—only
                    maintaining that when the pope and the prelacy deviated from the gospel rule of
                    poverty they should not be obeyed, but fearlessly opposed. In France, finding
                    his master, Abelard, exposed to the persecutions of St Bernard, he assumed his
                    defence with so much ardour that St Bernard directed the thunders of his
                    eloquence against the disciple as well as the master, saying of the former, “He
                    neither eats nor drinks,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n816/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0816-0793"/>
                <p>suffers hunger, and, being leagued with the devil, only thirsts for the blood of
                    souls.” In 1142 we find Arnold a wanderer in Switzerland, and then, suddenly
                    reappearing in Italy, he arrived in Rome.</p>
                <p>Three different elements entered into his nature and inspired his eloquence—an
                    exalted and mystic temperament, a great and candid admiration for classic
                    antiquity added to an equal admiration for republican freedom independent of the
                    church and the empire, and a profound conviction, derived from the Vaudois and
                    Paterine doctrines, that the church could only be purified by the renunciation
                    of temporal wealth. Finding Rome already revolutionized in accordance with his
                    own ideas, he immediately began to preach there. His mystic exhortations against
                    the riches of the church had an inflammatory effect, while his classical
                    reminiscences aroused the enthusiasm of the Romans, and his suggestion that they
                    should imitate the republican institutions of Upper Italy met the necessities of
                    the time that had created the revolution. He urged the reconstitution of the
                    ancient senate and senatorial order, which indeed was already partially
                    accomplished, and of the ancient equestrian order, and the reconstruction and
                    fortification of the Capitol. His proposed senate was a body somewhat resembling
                    the communal councils of Upper Italy, his equestrian order a mounted force
                    composed of the lesser nobility, since at Rome, as elsewhere, the lower classes
                    had neither time nor means to form part of it. All his suggestions were
                    accepted; the citizens laboured strenuously on the fortification of the Capitol.
                    The pope soon beheld the revolution spread beyond the walls, and several cities
                    of the state proclaimed their independence. The barons of the Cam-pagna profited
                    by the opportunity to act as independent sovereigns. Thus the whole domain of
                    the church was threatened with dissolution. The pope marched towards Rome with
                    his newly gathered army, but hoped to come to terms. The Romans in fact
                    recognized his authority, and he in his turn recognized the republic. The office
                    of patrician was abolished, and seems to have been replaced by that of
                    gonfalonier, and the prefect, answering to the podestà of the other republics,
                    was revived. The senators received investiture from the pope, who returned to
                    Rome at Christmas 1145.</p>
                <p>The republic now seems to have been fully constituted. The senate was drawn from
                    the lower classes and the petty nobility, and this was the special
                    characteristic of the new revolution. In 1144 there were fifty-six senators,
                    probably four to each of the fourteen regions, but the number often varied. By
                    the few existing documents of the period we notice that the senators were
                    divided into <hi rend="italic">Senatores COnsiliarii</hi> and ordinary senators.
                    The former constituted a smaller council, which, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Credtnza</hi> or lesser council found in other cities, consulted with the head
                    or heads of the republic on the more urgent and secret affairs of the state.
                    And, conjointly with the rest of the senators, it formed the greater council.
                    Thus classic traditions were identified with new republican usages, and the
                    commonwealth of Rome resembled those in other parts of Italy. But, of course,
                    every republic had special local customs of its own. So the Roman senate had
                    judicial as well as political attributes, and there was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >curia senatus</hi> composed of senators and legal experts.</p>
                <p>As was easily to be foreseen, the agreement with the pope was of short duration.
                    The revolution could not be checked; the Romans desired independence, and their
                    spiritual lord fled to France, whence, in 1147, he proclaimed a new crusade,
                    while the Romans were employed in demolishing Tivoli, banishing its inhabitants,
                    and waging war on other cities. Giordano Pierleone was gonfalonier and head of
                    the republic, and Arnold, supported by the popular favour and the enthusiasm of
                    the lower clergy, was preaching with even greater fervour than before. But the
                    pope now re-entered Italy, proclaimed Arnold a schismatic, and then advancing to
                    Tusculum assembled an army in order to attack Rome. In this emergency the Romans
                    applied to Conrad III., the first emperor of the house of Hohenstaufen; and
                    their urgent letters are clearly expressive of Arnold’s theories and his medley
                    of ancient and modern, sacred and profane, ideas. “Rome,” so they said, “is the
                    fountain of the empire confided to you by the Almighty, and we seek to restore
                    to Rome the power possessed by her under Constantine and Justinian. For this end
                    we conquered and destroyed the strongholds of the barons who, together with the
                    pope and the Normans, sought to resist us. These are now attacking us on all
                    sides. Haste to Rome, the capital of the world, thus to establish thy imperial
                    sway over the Italian and German lands.”</p>
                <p>After long hesitation the king of the Romans at last replied to these appeals,
                    stating that he would come “to re-establish order, reward the faithful, and
                    punish the rebellious.” These words promised ill. In fact Conrad had already
                    arranged terms with the pope; but his life came to an end on the 15th February
                    1152.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by Frederick I. surnamed Barbarossa, who took no notice of the
                    numerous letters urging him to come and receive the empire from the Roman
                    people, which alone had the right of conferring it. In accordance with his
                    design of subduing all the independent cities, he made an agreement with the
                    pope, in which he vowed to give no truce to the Romans, but subject them to
                    their spiritual lord, whose temporal power should be restored. The pope, on his
                    side, promised to crown him emperor. Thereupon the people again rose to arms,
                    and Arnold broke off all negotiations with Eugenius III. The senate was
                    reorganized, formed of one hundred members, and, according to the old Roman
                    precedent, had two consuls, one for internal and the other for external affairs.
                    Frederick was a daring statesman, a valiant soldier in command of a powerful
                    army, and was no friend of half measures. Accordingly the nobles ventured on
                    reaction. Finally, to increase the gravity of the situation, an English pope,
                    Hadrian IV., was elected (1154—59), who was also a man of strong and resolute
                    temper. In fact, even before being able to take possession of the Lateran, he
                    requested the Romans to banish Arnold, who, with greater eloquence than ever,
                    was directing his thunders against the papacy. These utterances increased the
                    wrath of Hadrian, who, encouraged by the knowledge that Frederick and his host
                    were already in Italy, at last launched an interdict against Rome. It was the
                    first time that a pope had ventured to curse the Eternal City. The interdict put
                    a summary stop to the religious life of the inhabitants. Men’s minds were seized
                    with a sudden terror, and a fierce tumult broke out. Thereupon the senators,
                    whose opposition to the pope was less courageous than that of the fallen
                    magnates, prostrated themselves at his feet and implored pardon. But Hadrian
                    demanded the expulsion of Arnold before consenting to raise the interdict.
                    Arnold was therefore obliged to leave Rome. After having for nine years preached
                    successfully in favour of liberty, after having been the moving spirit of the
                    new revolution, the new constitution, he was now abandoned by all, and forced to
                    wander from castle to castle, in the hope of reaching some independent city
                    capable of shielding him from the fierce enmity of the pope. Meanwhile Frederick
                    I. had achieved his first victories in Lombardy, and, leaving ruined cities and
                    bloodshed in his track, was rapidly advancing towards central Italy. The pope
                    sent three cardinals to him, with a request for the capture and consignment of
                    Arnold, who <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n817/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0817-0794"/>had taken refuge in the castle of the Visconti of
                    Campag-natico. Frederick without delay caused one of the Visconti to be seized
                    and kept prisoner until Arnold was given up, and then consigned the latter to
                    the papal legates. The pope in his turn gave the reformer into the hands of the
                    prefect, Pietro di Vico, who immediately hanged his prisoner, burnt his body at
                    the stake, and cast his ashes into the Tiber. Theexecutiontookplacein June 1155.
                    The exact date and place of it are unknown; we only know that Arnold met his
                    fate with great serenity and firmness.</p>
                <p>But the Romans who had so basely deserted their champion λvould not give up their
                    republic. Their envoys went to meet Frederick near Sutri, and made an address in
                    the usual fantastic style on the privileges of the Roman people and its sole
                    right to confer the imperial crown. But Frederick indignantly cut short their
                    harangue, and they had to depart full of rage. He then continued his march, and,
                    entering Romeon the 18th June 1155, was forthwith crowned in St Peter’s by the
                    pope. Thereupon the Romans rushed to arms, and made a furious attack on the
                    Leonine city and the imperial camp. A desperate battle went on throughout the
                    day; and the knights proved that the equestrian order instituted at Arnold’s
                    suggestion was no empty sham. About a thousand Romans perished by the sword or
                    by drowning, but their fellow-citizens made such determined preparations to
                    continue the struggle that Frederick, on the 19th June, hastily retreated or
                    rather fled, and was escorted as far as Tivoli by the pope and the cardinals.
                    After all, the temporal power of the papacy was not restored, and the republic
                    still survived in the form bestowed on it by Arnold of Brescia. Its existence
                    was in truth favourable rather than injurious to Frederick, whose aim was to
                    rule over Rome and treat the bishops as his vassals. He had not yet discerned
                    that his best policy would have been to use the republic as a lever against the
                    pope. The latter, with keener acumen, while remaining faithful to the feudal
                    party in Rome, made alliance with the communes of Lombardy and encouraged them
                    in their resistance to the emperor. Hadrian IV. died in 1159, and the national
                    party elected Alexander III. (1159-1181), who energetically opposed the
                    pretensions of Frederick, but, having to struggle with three antipopes
                    successively raised against him by the imperial party, was repeatedly driven
                    into exile. During these schisms the senate quietly carried on the government,
                    administered justice, and made war on some neighbouring cities and barons. An
                    army comprising many nobles of the national party marched against Tusculum, but
                    found it defended by several valiant officers and a strong band of German
                    soldiery, who, on the 29th May 1167, inflicted on the Romans so severe a defeat
                    that it is styled by Gregorovius the Cannae of the Middle Ages. Shortly
                    afterwards the emperor arrived in Rome with his antipope Paschal III., and
                    Alexander had to fly before him to Benevento. Then, at last, Frederick came to
                    terms with the republic, recognized the senate, which accepted investiture at
                    his hands, re-established the prefecture as an imperial office, and bestowed it
                    on Giovanni, son of Pietro di Vico. He then hastily departed, without having
                    advanced outside the Leonine city.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Pope Alexander continued the crafty policy of Hadrian and with better
                    success, for the Lombard cities had now formed a league and inflicted a signal
                    defeat on the emperor at Legnano on the 29th May 1176. One of the results of
                    this battle was the conclusion of an agreement between the pope and the emperor,
                    the latter resigning his pretensions on Rome and yielding all that he had denied
                    to Hadrian. And by the treaty of Venice (1st August 1177) the antipope was
                    forsaken, Alexander</p>
                <p>III. recognized and hailed as tho legitimate pontiff, and the prefect of Rome
                    again nominated by the pope, to whom the emperor restored the temporal power,
                    acknowledging him the independent sovereign of Rome and of the ecclesiastical
                    state, from Acquapendente to Ceprano. Frederick’s troops accompanied the pope to
                    Rome, where the republic was forced to make submission to him. But, proudly
                    conscious as it still was of its strength, its surrender wore the aspect of a
                    voluntary concession, and its terms began with these words—“Totius populi Romani
                    consilio et deliberatione statutum est,” &lt;Vc. The senators, elected yearly in
                    September, had to swear fealty to the pope, and a certain proportion of nobles
                    was included in their number. On his return to Rome, Alexander received a solemn
                    welcome from all, but he had neither extinguished nor really subdued the
                    republic. On the contrary, men’s minds were more and more inflamed by the
                    example of freedom displayed in the north of Italy. He died on the 30th August
                    1181. The fact that between 1181 and 1187 there were three popes always living
                    in exile proves that the republic was by no means crushed. During the same
                    period another blow was inflicted on the papacy by the marriage of Henry VI.,
                    soil and successor to Frederick L, with Constance, sole heiress of the Norman
                    line in Naples. For thus the kingdom was joined to the empire and the popes were
                    more than ever in the latter’s power. On the 20th December 1187 Clement III.
                    (1187-91), being raised to the pontificate, made a solemn agreement with the
                    Government of the Capitol before coming to Rome. And this peace or <hi
                    rend="italic">Concordia</hi> had the air of a treaty between potentates of equal
                    importance. Rome confronted the pope from the same standpoint from which the
                    Lombard cities had confronted the emperor after Legnano. This treaty, the basis
                    of the new constitution, was confirmed on the last day of May 1188 (Anno XLIV.
                    of the senate). It begins with these words: —“Concordia inter Dominum Papam
                    Clementem III. et senatores populumque Romanum super regalibus et aliis
                    dignitatibus urbis.” The pope was recognized as supreme lord, and invested the
                    senators with their dignity. He resumed the privilege of coinage, but allowed
                    one-third of the issue to be made by the senate. Almost all the old pontifical
                    rights and prerogatives .were restored to him. The pope might employ the Roman
                    militia for the defence of his patrimony, but was to furnish its pay. The rights
                    of the church over Tivoli and Tusculum were confirmed; but the republic reserved
                    to itself the right of making war on those cities, and declared its resolve to
                    dismantle and destroy the walls and castle of Tusculum. In this undertaking the
                    pope was to co-operate with the Romans, even should the unhappy city make
                    surrender to him alone.</p>
                <p>From all this it is clear that the church had been made independent of the
                    empire, and that the republic, despite its numerous concessions, was by no means
                    subject to the church. The pope, in fact, had obtained liberty of election, and
                    Frederick L, by resigning the investiture of the prefect, had virtually
                    renounced his claim to imperial power in Rome. The republic had no patrician nor
                    any other imperial magistrate, and preserved its independence even as regarded
                    the pope, who merely granted investiture to magistrates freely chosen by the
                    people, and had no legislative nor administrative power in the city. His
                    temporal dominion was limited to his great possessions, to his regalia, to a
                    supreme authority that was very indefinite, and to a feudal authority over the
                    barons of the Campagna and many cities of a state that seemed ever on the point
                    of dissolution. The senate continued to frame laws, to govern, and to administer
                    justice. The army carried on the wars of the republic, as we see by the tragic
                    fate of Tusculum, which was razed to the ground on the 19th <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n818/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0818-0795"/>April 1191. Thus the powerful counts of Tusculum
                    disappeared; they sought refuge in the Campagna, and according to all
                    probability the no less potent family of the Colonna sprang from their line. In
                    consequence of these events, the nobles realized that the papacy sought to
                    reduce them to vassalage. And, seeing that the republic remained firmly
                    established and able to help them, they began to adhere to it and succeeded in
                    obtaining admission to the new senate. In fact, whereas since 1143 plebeians and
                    petty nobles had prevailed in its ranks, nobles of ancient descent are now found
                    outnumbering the knights and burghers. But in 1191 this state of things caused a
                    sudden popular outbreak which abolished the aristocratic senate and gave the
                    headship of the republic to a single senator, <hi rend="italic">summus
                    senator,</hi> named Benedetto “Carissimus” or “Carus Homo” or “Carosomo,” of
                    unknown, but undoubtedly plebeian, origin. During the two years he remained in
                    office this personage stripped the pope of his revenues, despatched <hi
                    rend="italic">justitiarii</hi> even to the provinces, and with the aid of the
                    parliament and other popular assemblies promulgated laws and statutes. But he
                    was overthrown by a counter-revolution, and Giovanni Capoccio of the party of
                    the nobles became senator for two years, and had been succeeded by one of the
                    Pierleoni when, in 1197, a fresh revolution re-established a senate of fifty-six
                    members, chiefly consisting of feudal barons in high favour with Henry VI., who
                    had revived the imperial faction in Rome. But this emperor’s life ended the same
                    year as the pope’s, in 1198, and the new pontiff Innocent III. (1198-1216) began
                    to make war on the nobles, who were again masters of the republic. Their leader
                    was the prefect Pietro di Vico. Owing to the revolution of 1143 most of the
                    prefectorial attributes were now vested in the senate; nevertheless Pietro still
                    retained a tribunal of police both within and without the city. But his main
                    strength λvas derived from the vast possessions of the Vico family, in which the
                    office of prefect now became hereditary. Very soon, however, these prefects of
                    Vico were chiefly regarded as the great feudal lords of Tuscia, and the
                    independent municipal office lost its true character. Then the popes made a
                    point of according great pomp and dignity to this nominal prefect, in order to
                    overshadow the senator, who still represented the independence of the republic
                    and had assumed many of the attributes wrested from the prefect.</p>
                <p>But Innocent III., dissatisfied with this state of things, contrived by bribing
                    the people to arrogate to himself the right of electing the senator, who had now
                    to swear fealty and submission to the pope, and also that of nominating the
                    provincial <hi rend="italic">justitiarii,</hi> formerly chosen by the Government
                    of the Capitol. This was a deadly blow to the republic, for the principal rights
                    of the people, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the election of pope and emperor,
                    prefect and senate, were now lost. The general discontent provoked fresh
                    revolutions, and Innocent III. employed all his political dexterity to ward off
                    their effects. But shortly afterwards the people made a loud outcry for a senate
                    of fifty-six members; and the pope, again making a virtue of necessity, caused
                    that number to be chosen by twelve <hi rend="italic">mediani</hi> specially
                    named by him for the purpose. Even this did not calm the popular discontent,
                    which was also stirred by other disputes. The consequence was that when, six
                    months later, the pope again elected a single senator the Romans rose to arms,
                    and in 1204 formed a Government of <hi rend="italic">Buoni Uomini</hi> in
                    opposition to that created by the pope. But an amicable arrangement being
                    concluded, the pope once more nominated fifty-six senators; and when, soon
                    after, he again reduced them to one, the people were too weary to resist (1205).
                    Thus the Capitol was subdued, and Innocent</p>
                <p>III. spent his last years in tranquillity.</p>
                <p>On the 22d November 1220 Honorius III. (1216-27) conferred the imperial crown on
                    Frederick IL, who confirmed to the church the possession of her former states,
                    of those bequeathed to her by countess Matilda, and even of the March of Ancona.
                    But it was soon seen that he sought to dominate all Italy, and was therefore a
                    foe to be dreaded. The successor of Honorius, Pope Gregory IX. (1227-41) was
                    speedily insulted and put to flight by the Ghibelline nobles, whose courage had
                    revived, and the republic began to subdue the Latian cities on its own account.
                    Peace was several times made and unmade by pope and people; but no enduring
                    harmony was possible between them, since the former wished to subject the entire
                    state to the church, and the latter to escape from the rule of the church and
                    hold sway over “the universal land from Ceprano to Radicofani” formerly,
                    belonging to the duchy. Accordingly the Roman people now appointed judges,
                    imposed taxes, issued coin, and made the clergy amenable to secular tribunals.
                    In 1234 the senator Luca Savelli published an edict declaring Tuscia and
                    Campania territories of the republic, and sentjudges thither to exact an oath of
                    obedience. He also despatched the militia to the coast, where it occupied
                    several cities and erected fortresses; and columns λvere raised everywhere
                    inscribed with the initials S. P. Q. R. The pope, unable to prevent but equally
                    unable to tolerate these acts, fled from Rome, hurling his anathema against
                    Savelli, “et omnes illos con-siliarios urbis quorum consilio,” Ac. The Romans
                    sacked the Lateran and the houses of many cardinals, and marched on Viterbo, but
                    were driven back by the papal troops. When Savelli left office and Angelo
                    Malabranca was elected in his stead, the people made peace and submission in
                    1235, and were obliged to give up their pretensions of subjecting the clergy to
                    ordinary tribunals and the urban territory to the republic. Thus matters were
                    virtually settled on the footing established by Innocent</p>
                <p>III., thanks to the aid given to the pope by Frederick II., who had been one of
                    the promoters of the rebellion.</p>
                <p>It may appear strange that, at this period of their history, the Romans, after
                    showing such tenacious adherence to the republic and senate, should have
                    accepted the rule of a single senator without rushing to arms, and passed and
                    repassed from one form of government to another with such surprising
                    indifference. But on closer examination it is plain that these changes were
                    greater in appearance than reality. We have already seen, in treating of
                    Carosomo, how the single senator convoked the people in parliament to pass
                    sanction on the laws. But, whenever there is only one senator, we also
                    continually meet with the expression “consilium vel consilia urbis.” It is
                    evident that when, instead of laws to be approved in parliament by a simple
                    placet or rejected by a non-placet, matters requiring consideration had to be
                    discussed, the senator convoked a much smaller council, consisting only of the
                    leaders of the people. These leaders were the heads of the twelve or thirteen
                    regions, of the guilds, now becoming organized and soon to be also thirteen in
                    number, and of the militia. As in the other Italian republics, all these
                    associations had been formed in Rome.</p>
                <p>The senator therefore held consultation with the leading men of the city; and,
                    although, especially at first, these meetings were rather loosely organized, it
                    is clear that they took the form of two councils—one numerous <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fion-siglio maggiore),</hi> the other limited <hi rend="italic">(consigliο
                    minore</hi> or <hi rend="italic">spéciale),</hi> co-operating with and forming
                    part of the first. Such was the prevailing custom throughout Italy at the time
                    when Roman institutions most nearly resembled those of the other republics. We
                    already know that, from the date of Arnold’s reforms, the senate, with its junta
                    of counsellors, had been divided into two parts, forming when <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n819/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0819-0796"/>united a species of greater council. Therefore the
                    transition from a senate divided into two parts to the greater and lesser
                    councils must have been very easy and natural. And, seeing that later, when the
                    nomination of a single senator had become a constant practice, the meetings of
                    the two councils are frequently mentioned without the slightest remark or hint
                    as to their origin, it is clear that they had been gradually formed and long
                    established. Not long after the revolution of 1143 the grandees sought to
                    re-enter the senate; and the popes themselves, partly from dread of the people
                    and partly to aggrandize their own kindred, contributed to build up the power of
                    a new and no less turbulent nobility. This class, arising between the 12th and
                    13th centuries, was composed of families newly created by the popes, together
                    with remnants of the oldaristocracy, such as the Frangipani, Colonna, &lt;fec.
                    These nobles, regaining possession of the senate, so completely eliminated the
                    popular element that, when the popes again opposed them, and, obtaining from the
                    parliament the right of electing the senators, adopted the expedient of
                    appointing one only, the senator was always chosen from the ranks of the nobles.
                    And then the people, unable and unwilling to renounce republican forms, replaced
                    their suppressed senate by a greater and a lesser council. This was an easy
                    task—a natural consequence of the fact that the people now began to constitute
                    the real strength of the republic. Later, with an increasing detestation for
                    their nobility, the Romans decreed that the single senator should be of foreign
                    birth, and, as we shall see, chose Brancaleone in the middle of the 13th
                    century.</p>
                <p>Thus, after a long series of frequent changes and revolutions, the Roman republic
                    became a commonwealth, with an increasing resemblance to those of the other
                    Italian cities. The people were organized and armed, the guilds almost
                    established, the two councils gradually constituted, and the aristocracy, while
                    retaining special local characteristics, assumed its definitive shape. It is not
                    surprising to find that Rome, like other Italian cities, now possessed statutes
                    of its own. There has been much controversy on this point. Certain writers had
                    alluded to a statute of 1246. As no one, however, could discover any statute of
                    that date, others decided that it had never existed. A statute of 1363 was
                    TecentlypublishedbyProfessor Camillo Re, who asserted it to be the first and
                    most ancient that Rome had possessed. But the still more recent researches of
                    Messrs La Mantia and Levi prove that Professor Re’s assertions were somewhat too
                    bold. There is certain evidence of a <hi rend="italic">statutum senatus</hi>
                    existing between 1212 and 1227, of a <hi rend="italic">statutum vel Capitulare
                    Senatoris vel senatus</hi> of 1235, followed in 1241 by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >statutum urbis.</hi> This brings us very near to the statute of 1246 mentioned
                    by Vitale and others. So it is well ascertained that, in the first half of the
                    l3th century, Rome possessed statutes at large composed of older limited
                    statutes. The consuls of the trade guilds were from 1267 regular members of the
                    councils; and the merchants’ guild held general meetings in 1255. Its statutes
                    were confirmed in 1296 by the senator Pandolfo Savelli, and the compilation of
                    these, published in 1880 by Signor Gatti, refers to 1317.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the struggle between Frederick IT. and the pope was once more renewed.
                    The former sought to dominate Italy, separate the state from the church, and
                    repress the republics. The latter, although really hostile to the Roman free
                    Government, joined it against the emperor, who on his side favoured the republic
                    of Rome and the nobles most adverse to the pope. Thus the new nobility,
                    composed, as we have seen, of two different elements, was again split into a
                    Guelf party headed by the Orsini and a Ghibelline party under the Colonna. And
                    in 1238 it was deemed advisable to elect two senators instead of one, in the
                    hope of conciliating both factions by simultaneously raising them to power.
                    Afterwards one only was elected, alternately an Orsini and a Colonna, then again
                    two, and so on. But all these changes failed in their aims, since the struggle
                    between emperor and pope exasperated party feeling in Rome. The political genius
                    of Frederick might have wrought great harm to the city had not his mind teemed
                    with contradictory ideas. Although desirous to emancipate the state from the
                    church, he was opposed to the communal democracy, which was then the chief
                    strength of the secular state in Italy. AVhile combating the church and
                    persecuting her defenders, he yet sent heretics to the stake; although
                    excommunicated, he undertook a crusade; he feasted at his table philosophers,
                    sceptic and atheist poets, bishops, and Alussulmans; he proclaimed
                    anti-Christian the possession of wealth by the church, yet made lavish gifts to
                    altar and monastery. Thus, although he had a strong party in Rome, it seemed to
                    dissolve at his approach, inasmuch as all feared that he might abolish the
                    statutes and liberties of the commune. It fact, when he advanced towards Rome on
                    the death of Gregory IX. in 1241 he was energetically repulsed by the people,
                    and later even by Viterbo, a city that had always been faithful to him. But
                    after he had withdrawn his adherents gained strength and put to flight his
                    opponent, Innocent</p>
                <p>IV. (1243-54), the newly elected pope, who then from his asylum in France hurled
                    an excommunication against him. Frederick’s death in December 1250 determined
                    the fall of the Ghibelline party and the close of the imperial epoch in Italy.
                    The pope instantly returned to Rome with the set purpose of destroying the power
                    of the Hohenstaufens. This was no longer difficult when, by the decease of
                    Conrad IV. (1254), the child Conradin became the last legitimate representative
                    of that line, and negotiations were already on foot for placing the Angevins on
                    the Neapolitan throne.</p>
                <p>The republic meanwhile preserved its independence against the pope, who, among
                    other concessions, had entirely given up to it the right of coinage.
                    Nevertheless, being much harassed by the factiousness of the nobility, it was
                    obliged in 1252 to decide on the election of an alien senator armed with ample
                    powers, precisely as other communes gave the government into the hands of a
                    podestà. Accordingly a Bolognese noble, Brancaleone degli Andal5, count of
                    Casalecchio, and a Ghibelline of much <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> energy and
                    talent, was invited to Rome. But before J accepting office he insisted on making
                    definite terms. He∣ desired to hold the government for three years; and this, 1
                    although contrary to the statutes, was granted. Further, to <hi
                    rend="superscript">i</hi> ensure his personal safety, he demanded that many
                    scions of the noblest Roman houses should be sent as hostages to Bologna; and to
                    this also the republic consented. Then, in August 1252, he came with his judges
                    and notaries, made oath to observe justice and the laws, and began to govern. He
                    was head of the republic in peace and in war, supreme judge and captain in
                    chief. He nominated the podestàs of subject territories, despatched ambassadors,
                    issued coin, concluded treaties, and received oaths of obedience. The pope, who
                    was then at Perugia, was greatly afflicted by the arrival of this new master,
                    but, despairing of aid from any quarter, was forced to make a virtue of
                    necessity. Thus Brancaleone was able to seize the reins of power with a firm
                    grasp. The parliament still met in the square of the Capitol, and the greater
                    and lesser councils in the church of Ara Coeli. There were besides frequent
                    assemblies of the college of Capitoline judges or <hi rend="italic"
                    >assectamentum.</hi> Unfortunately, no records having been preserved of the
                    proceedings of the Roman councils and parliament, little can be said of the
                    manner in which affairs were conducted. Certainly Brancaleone’s govern<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n820/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0820-0797"/>ment was not very parliamentary. He convoked the
                    councils as seldom as was possible, although he frequently assembled the people
                    in parliament. The chief complaint made against him was of undue severity in the
                    administration of justice. He rendered the clergy amenable to secular tribunals,
                    subdued the neighbouring cities of Tivoli, Palestrina, &lt;fec., and commanded
                    in person the attacking force. But his greatest energy was directed to the
                    repression of the more turbulent nobles who were opposed to him; and he soon
                    made them feel the weight of his hand by hanging some, banishing others, and
                    persecuting several more. But he too recognized the expediency of winning the
                    popular favour. He was the first senator to add to his title that of captain of
                    the people (“Almae Urbis Senator Ill: et Romani Populi Capitaneus ”). He
                    befriended the people by promoting the organization of guilds after the manner
                    of those of his native Bologna. There were already a few in Rome, such as the
                    merchants’ guild and that of the agriculturists, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bobacteriorum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bovattari,</hi> who must have resembled
                    the so-called <hi rend="italic">mercαnti di campagna</hi> or graziers of the
                    present day, since no peasant guild existed in Italian republics. The merchants’
                    guild, definitely established in 1255 under Brancaleone’s rule, had four consuls
                    and twelve councillors, held meetings, and made laws. The other guilds, thirteen
                    in all, were organized much on the same plan. The admission of their heads into
                    the councils of the republic in 1267 shows how efficaciously their interests had
                    been promoted by Brancaleone.</p>
                <p>The death of Innocent IV. and the election of Alexander</p>
                <p>IV. (1254-61), who was milder and less shrewd than his predecessor, were
                    favourable events for Brancaleone; but he failed to check the growing discontent
                    of the clergy and the more powerful nobles, who had received deadly injuries at
                    his hands. And when, on the expiration of his three years’ term of office, his
                    re-election was proposed, his enemies rose against him, accused him before the
                    <hi rend="italic">sindαcato,</hi> threw him into prison, and vehemently
                    protested against the continuance of “foreign tyranny.” His life was only spared
                    on account of the hostages sent to Bologna. The next senator chosen was a
                    Brescian Guelf, Emanuele de Madio, a tool of the nobles,- who were now masters
                    of the situation. But soon afterwards, in 1257, the guilds rose in revolt, drove
                    the nobles from power, put the pope to flight, and recalled Brancaleone for
                    another three years’ term. He ruled more sternly than before, hung several
                    nobles, and made alliance with Manfred, the representative of the Swabian party
                    in Italy. This rendered him increasingly odious to the pope and procured his
                    excommunication. But, disregarding the thunders of the church, he marched
                    against Anagni, the pope’s birthplace, and Alexander was quickly obliged to
                    humiliate himself before the senator of Rome. Brancaleone next set to work to
                    destroy the fortified towers of the nobility, and in razing them to the ground
                    ruined many of the adjacent dwellings. Accordingly, a considerable number of
                    nobles became homeless exiles. In 1258, while engaged on the siege of Corneto,
                    Brancaleone was attacked by a violent fever, and, being carried back to Rome,
                    died on the Capitoline Hill. Thus ended the career of a truly remarkable
                    statesman. He was succeeded by his uncle, Castellano degli Andalo, who, lacking
                    the political genius of his nephew, only retained office until the following
                    spring (1259), in the midst of fierce and perpetual disturbances. Then the
                    people, being bribed by the pope, joined with the nobles and drove him away. His
                    life too was saved by having followed his nephew’s shrewd plan of sending
                    hostages to Bologna. Two senators of Roman birth were next elected; and on the
                    death of Alexander IV. a French pope was chosen, Urban IV. (1261-64), thus
                    giving fresh predominance in the church to the anti-Swabian policy. But the
                    internal disturbances of the city soon drove Urban to flight.</p>
                <p>At this period the fall of the empire had induced many Italian republics to seek
                    strength by placing their governments in the hands of some prince willing to
                    swear respect to their laws and to undertake their defence against neighbouring
                    states and the pope. In Rome the Guelfs and Ghibellines proposed various
                    candidates for this office, and after many fierce quarrels ended by electing a
                    committee of <hi rend="italic">boni homines,</hi> charged with the revision of
                    the statutes, reorganization of the city, and choice of a senator. This
                    committee sat for more than a year without nominating any one, so, the Guelf
                    party being now predominant, and all being wearied of this provisional state of
                    things, the majority agreed on the election as senator of Charles of Anjou, who,
                    at the pope’s summons, was already preparing for the conquest of Naples. He
                    would defend Rome against the pope, and the pope would defend Rome against him.
                    By thus taking advantage of either’s jealousy the citizens hoped to keep their
                    republic intact. In fact, although Urban IV. had incited Charles to attack
                    Naples, he was by no means willing to see him established as master in Rome. He
                    accordingly declared that, if Charles really wished to obtain the Neapolitan
                    crown, he must only accept the offered dignity pending the conquest of that
                    kingdom. And he must likewise promise to recognize the supremacy of the pope
                    over the senate. Charles soothed him with the amplest verbal promises, but in
                    fact accepted the senatorship for life. In 1265, when Urban was succeeded by
                    Clement IV. (1265-68), who as a Provençal was a subject of Charles, the latter
                    entered Rome and was immediately made senator. Seven days later (28th June) he
                    received the investiture of the Neapolitan kingdom, and in the following January
                    its crown. On the 26th February 1266 the battle of Benevento was fought, and,
                    the valiant Manfred being killed, the triumph of the Guelf Angevins in Italy was
                    assured. Then, at the urgent command of the pope, Charles was forced to resign
                    the senatorship in the May of the same year. Two Romans were elected in his
                    stead, but soon fell out with the pope, because the Guelf nobles again tried to
                    exercise tyranny. The people, however, profited by these disturbances to rise on
                    its own account, and formed a democratic government of twenty-six boni homines
                    with Angelo Capocci, a Ghibelline, as its captain. By this government Don Henry,
                    son of Ferdinand III. of Castile, was elected senator; and he came to Rome for
                    the purpose of promoting a Ghibelline and Swabian policy in favour ' of
                    Conradin, who was preparing for conflict. The rule of the new senator was very
                    energetic, for he kept down the clergy, subdued the Campagna, persecuted the
                    Guelf nobles, made alliance with the Tuscan Ghibellines, forcibly drove back the
                    troops of King Charles, who was advancing towards Rome, and gave a splendid
                    reception to Conradin. But the battle of Tagliacozzo (23rd August 1268),
                    followed by the murder of Conradin, proved fatal to the Ghibelline party.
                    Charles was re-elected senator immediately after the battle, and the pope
                    confirmed his powers for a term of ten years, after having already named him
                    imperial vicar in Tuscany. On the 16th September Charles for the second time
                    took possession of the Capitol, and ruled Rome firmly by means of vice-governors
                    or vicars.</p>
                <p>The Swabian line was now extinct, and in Charles’s hands the Neapolitan kingdom
                    had become a fief of the church. The empire had fallen so low as to be no longer
                    formidable. Now therefore was the moment for treating with it in order to
                    restrain Charles, and also for making use of the French king to keep the empire
                    in check. And this was the policy of Nicholas III. (1277-80), who hastened to
                    extract advantageous promises from Rudolph <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n821/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0821-0798"/>of Hapsburg, the new candidate for the imperial
                    crown.</p>
                <p>In 1278, the ten years’ term having expired, he deprived</p>
                <p>Charles of the senatorship and appointed Rudolph vicar of Tuscany. After
                    declaring that he left to the people the right of electing the senator, he
                    promulgated a new constitution (18th July 1278) which, while confirming the
                    rights of the church over the city, prohibited the election of any foreign
                    emperor, prince, marquis, count, or baron as senator of Rome. Thus the Colonna,
                    Savelli, Orsini, Annibaldi, and other Roman nobles again rose to power, and the
                    republic was again endangered and plunged in disorder. The Romans then gave the
                    reconstitution of the city into the pope’s hands by yielding to him the right of
                    nominating senators, declaring, however, that this was a personal concession to
                    himself, and not to the popes in general. So Nicholas proceeded to name
                    senators, alternating a Colonna with au Orsini, or simultaneously choosing one
                    of each faction. The same power over the senate was granted with the same
                    restriction to AIartin</p>
                <p>IV. (1281-85), and he at once re-elected Charlesof Anjou. Thus, greatly to the
                    disgust of the Romans, the Capitol was again invaded by French vicars, notaries,
                    judges, and soldiery. But the terrible blow dealt at Charles’s power by the
                    Sicilian A <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> espers (31st AIarch 1282) resounded
                    even in Rome. The Orsini, backed by the people, rose to arms, massacred the
                    French garrison, and quickly re-established a popular Government. Giovanni
                    Cencio, a kinsman of the Orsini, was elected captain and defender of the people,
                    and ruled the city with the co-operation of the senator and a council of priors
                    of the guilds. This Government was of brief duration, for, although the pope had
                    professed his willingness to tolerate the experiment, he quickly arranged fresh
                    terms, and, forsaking Charles of Anjou, again nominated two Roman senators. Pope
                    and king both died in 1285, and Nicholas IV. (1288-92), also holding sway over
                    the senate, favoured the Colonna in order to curb the growing mastery of the
                    Orsini. But thus there were two powerful houses instead of one. In fact Giovanni
                    Colonna, when elected senator, ruled from the Capitol as an independent
                    sovereign, conducted in person the campaign against Viterbo, and subjected that
                    city to the republic on the 3d AIay 1291.</p>
                <p>AVhen one of the Gaetani, Boniface VIIL (1294-1303), was raised to the papal
                    chair, the extent of the Colonnas’ power became evident to all. Boniface opposed
                    them in order to aggrandize his own kin, and they showed equal virulence in
                    return. The Cardinals Colonna refused to acknowledge him as the legitimate pope,
                    and he excommunicated them and proclaimed a crusade against their house. Even
                    after he had subdued them and destroyed Palestrina, their principal fief, the
                    drama did not yet come to an end. Boniface had a very lofty conception of the
                    church, and desired to establish her supremacy over the state. The king of
                    France (Philip the Fair) believed, on the contrary, that the Angevin successes
                    entitled him to fill the place in Italy vacated by the Swabians, and to play the
                    master there. This led to a tremendous contest in which all the French sided
                    with their king. And shortly afterwards a plot was hatched against the pope by
                    the agents of France and the Colonna. These determined enemies of the pope met
                    with much favour in Rome, on account of the general irritation against the
                    Gaetani and the enormous power conferred on them by Boniface. Suffice it to say
                    that they were now lords of the whole of lower Latium, from Capo Circeo to
                    Ninfa, from Ceprano to Subiaco. Thus Sciarra Colonna and a Frenchman named
                    Nogaret were able to fall on the pope at Anagni, insult him, and take him
                    prisoner. The people rising to his rescue, the conspirators were put to flight.
                    But when Boniface returned to Rome with the escort and protection of the</p>
                <p>Orsini, who had made themselves masters of the city, he found that he was
                    virtually a captive in their hands. PIe felt this so keenly that he died of rage
                    and exhaustion onthe Ilth October 1303. The brief pontificate of his successor
                    Benedict XI. was followed by that of Clement</p>
                <p>V. (1305-14), a Frenchman, who, instead of coming to Rome, summoned the cardinals
                    to France. This was the beginning of the church’s so-called exile in Avignon,
                    which, although depriving Rome of a source of wealth and influence, left the
                    republic to pursue its own course. It ' employed this freedom in trying to hold
                    its own against 1 the nobles, whose power was much lessened by the absence ’ of
                    the pope, and endeavoured to gain fresh strength by , organizing the thirteen
                    regions, which, as we have shown, . were associations of a much firmer nature in
                    Rome thau the <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> guilds. Accordingly, in 1305, a
                    captain of the people was elected with thirteen elders and a senator, Paganino
                    della Torre, who governed for one year. The pope was opposed to these changes at
                    first, but in 1310 he issued a brief granting Rome full permission to select its
                    own form of government. Thus, the first pope in Avignon restored the rights of
                    the Romans. But the latter, even with church and empire so far removed, still
                    considered Rome the Eternal City, the source of all law, and the only natural
                    seat of the spiritual and temporal government of the world. To their republic,
                    they thought, appertained a new and lofty destiny, nor could it ever be content
                    to descend to the level of other Italian municipalities.</p>
                <p>On the 6th January 1309 Henry VII. was crowned king 1 of the Romans at
                    Aix-la-Chapelle; and so greatly were men’s minds changed in Italy that,
                    throughout the land, he was hailed as a deliverer. He w <hi rend="superscript"
                    >r</hi> ished to restore the grandeur of the empire, and the Italians, above all
                    Dante Alighieri, beheld in him the champion of the state against the church,
                    who, after becoming the foe of communal liberty, had forsaken Italy and
                    withdrawn to France. The Roman people shared these ideas, and awaited Henry with
                    equal impatience, but the nobles rose in opposition. The Orsini, leaders of the
                    Guelfs, and allied with Robert of Naples, took possession of Castle St Angelo
                    and the Trastevere. Hence, when Henry reached Rome in Alay 1312, after seizing
                    the iron crown at AIilan, he was obliged to act on the offensive. He took the
                    Capitol by assault, but, failing in his attack on Castle St Angelo, was pursued
                    by its Neapolitan garrison. Forsaken by many discouraged adherents, he was
                    forced to recognize the expediency of departure. First, however, he desired to
                    be crowned at the Lateran, St Peter’s being held by his foes. The cardinals
                    refused his request, but were compelled to yield by the threats of the people,
                    who, reasserting their ancient rights, insisted that the coronation should take
                    place without delay. And the ceremony was performed on the 29th June 1312. The
                    emperor then resolved to depart in spite of the popular protest against his
                    leaving the natural seat of the empire, and on the 20th August started for
                    Tuscany, where worse fortune awaited him.</p>
                <p>Their differences settled, the nobles expelled the cap-J tain of the people left
                    by Henry, and elected as senators * Sciarra Colonna and Francesco Orsini. But
                    this was the θ signal for a popular revolt. The Capitol was attacked, the <hi
                    rend="subscript">p</hi> senators put to flight, and Jacopo Arlotti elected
                    captain with a council of twenty-six worthies <hi rend="italic">lbuoni
                    homini</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> The new leader instantly summoned the chief
                    nobles before his tribunal, had them chained and cast into prison, and
                    demolished many of their houses and strongholds. But, having thus humiliated
                    their pride, Arlotti dared not put them to death, and, releasing them from
                    confinement, banished them to their estates, where they plunged into hostile
                    preparations. Aleanwhile the victorious people convoked a parliament and decreed
                    that, the aristocracy <pb break="no"

                    >tribunitia potestas</hi> alone should invite the emperor to make his triumphal
                    entry into the Capitol, and receive his authority from the people of Rome. This
                    conception of the Roman power will now be seen to become more and more definite
                    until finding its last expression in Cola di Rienzo. Pope Clement, resigning
                    himself to necessity, acknowledged the new government under the energetic rule
                    of Arlotti. The latter now joined the Ghibellines of the Campagna against the
                    Orsini and the Neapolitans, subdued Velletri, and gave it a podestà. But then
                    the Gaetani, who were Guelfs, united with the Orsini and the Neapolitans, and,
                    giving battle to the Ghibellines in the Campagna, routed them in such wise as to
                    put an end to the popular government. The nobles forced their way into the city,
                    attacked the Capitol, made Arlotti their prisoner, and re-elected the senators
                    Sciarra Colonna and Francesco Orsini. Close upon these reverses came the death
                    of Henry VIL (24th August 1313) at Buonconvento near Siena, which put an end to
                    the Ghibel-Iine party in Italy. Thereupon King Robert of Naples, being named
                    senator by the pope, immediately appointed a vicar in Rome. Clement likewise
                    profited by the vacancy of the imperial throne to name the king imperial vicar
                    in Tuscany. And he died on the 20th April 1314, well content to have witnessed
                    the triumphs of the Guelfs in Italy.</p>
                <p>Affairs took a fresh turn under Pope John XXII. (1316-34). Rome was still ruled
                    by the vicars of King Robert; but, owing to the continued absence of the popes,
                    matters grew daily worse. Trade and industry declined, revenue diminished, the
                    impoverished nobles were exceedingly turbulent, deeds of murder and violence
                    occurred on all sides; even by day the streets of the city were unsafe. Hence
                    there was universal discontent. Meanwhile Louis the Bavarian, who in 1314 had
                    been crowned king of the Romans, having overcome his German enemies at Mühldorf
                    in 1322, turned against the pope, one of his fiercest opponents. ∙ Louis was
                    surrounded by Minorite friars, supporters of the poverty of the church, and
                    consequently enemies to the temporal power. They were men of the stamp of
                    William of Occam, Marsilio of Padua, Giovanni Janduno, and other philosophers
                    favourable to the rights of the empire and the people. Accordingly the Italian
                    Ghibellines hailed Louis as they had previously hailed Henry. Even the Roman
                    people were roused to action, and, driving out the representatives and partisans
                    of King Robert, in the spring of 1327, seized on Castle St Angelo, and again
                    established a democratic government. “Nearly all Italy was stirred to new
                    deeds,” says G. Villani, “and the Romans rose to arms and organized the people”
                    (bk. x. c. 20). Regardless of the reproofs of the pope, they elected a haughty
                    Ghibelline, Sciarra Colonna, captain of the people and general of the militia,
                    with a council of fifty-two <hi rend="italic">popolani,</hi> four to each
                    region. Then, ranged under the standards of the militia, the Romans gave chase
                    to the foes of the republic, and Sciarra, returning victorious, ascended to the
                    Capitol and invited Louis the Bavarian to Rome. Thesummons was obeyed; on the
                    7th January 1328 the king was already encamped in the Neronian Fields with five
                    thousand horse and a considerable number of foot soldiers, and, with better
                    fortune than Henry VII., was able to enter the Vatican at once.</p>
                <p>Encircled by a crowd of heretics, reformers, and Minorite brethren, he convoked a
                    parliament on the Capitol, asking that the imperial crown might be conferred
                    upon him by the people, from whom alone he wished to receive it. And the people
                    proclaimed him their captain, senator, and emperor. On the 17th January his
                    coronation took place in St Peter’s. But, as he had neither money nor practical
                    sense, his method of taxation and the excesses committed by himself and his
                    over-excited philosophers speedily aroused the popular discontent. His
                    ecclesiastical vicar, Marsilio of Padua, and Giovanni Janduno placarded the
                    walls with insulting manifestoes against the pope, whom the Minorites
                    stigmatized as a heretic and wished to depose. In April Louis twice assembled
                    the parliament in St Peter’s Square, and, after obtaining its sanction to
                    several anti-papal edicts, declared John XXII. degraded and deposed as a
                    heretic. This was a very strange and novel spectacle, the more so that, as was
                    speedily proved, the Romans were stirred by no anti-Catholic spirit, no yearning
                    for religious reform. Jacopo Colonna, a canon of the Lateran, was able to make
                    his way into Rome with four masked companions, to publicly read, at the top of
                    his voice and before a great multitude, the excommunication launched against the
                    emperor by the deposed pope, to traverse the entire city, and to withdraw
                    unmolested to Palestrina. Meanwhile the emperor contented himself with decreeing
                    that henceforth the popes must reside in Rome,—that if, when invited, they
                    should fail to come they would be thereby held deposed from the throne. As a
                    logical consequence, proceedings were immediately begun for the election of the
                    new pope, Nicholas V., who on the 12th May was proclaimed by the popular voice
                    in St Peter’s Square, and received the imperial sanction. But this ephemeral
                    drama came to an end when the emperor departed with his antipope on the 4th
                    August. This caused the immediate downfall of the democratic Government.
                    Bertoldo Orsini, who had returned to Rome with his Guelfs, and Stefano Colonna
                    were elected senators, and confirmed in the office by Cardinal Giovanni Orsini
                    in the name of the pope. A new parliament cancelled the emperor’s edicts, and
                    had them burnt by the public executioner. Later, Nicholas, the antipope, went
                    with a rope about his neck to make submission to John XXII., and Louis promised
                    to disavow and retract all that he had done against the church, provided the
                    sentence of excommunication were withdrawn. This, however, was refused. Never
                    had the empire fallen so low. Meanwhile King Robert was again supreme in Rome,
                    and, being reelected senator, appointed vicars there as before. Anarchy reigned.
                    The city was torn by factions, and the provinces rebelled against the French
                    representatives of the pope, who, in their ignorance of Italian affairs, were at
                    a loss how to act.</p>
                <p>And after the election of Benedict XII. (1334-42) confusion reached so great a
                    pitch that, on the expiration of Robert’s senatorial term, the Romans named
                    thirteen heads of regions to carry on the government with two senators, while
                    the king still sent vicars as before. The people, for the sake of peace, once
                    more granted the supremacy of the senate to the pope, and he nominated two
                    knights of Gubbio, Giacomo di Cante dei Gabrielli and Bosone Novello dei
                    Gabrielli, who were succeeded by two other senators the following year. But in
                    1339 the Romans attacked the Capitol, named two senators of their own choice,
                    re-established a democratic Government, and sent ambassadors to Florence to ask
                    for the ordinances of justice <hi rend="italic">Iprdinamenti della
                    giustizia),</hi> by which that city had broken the power of the nobles, and also
                    that a few skilled citizens should lend their help in the reconstitution of
                    Rome. Accordingly some Florentines came with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ordinamenti,</hi> some portions of which may be recognized in the Roman
                    statutes, and, after first rearranging the taxes, elected thirteen priors of the
                    guilds, a gonfalonier of justice, and a captain of the people after the
                    Florentine manner. But there was a dissimilarity in the conditions of the two
                    cities. The guilds having little influence in Rome, the projected reform failed,
                    and the pope, who was opposed to it, re-elected the senators.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n823/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0823-0800"/>
                <p>Thereupon public discontent swelled, and especially when, by the foundation of
                    the papal palace of Avignon, it was evident that Benedict XII. had no intention
                    of restoring the Holy See to Italy. This pope was succeeded in 1342 by Clement
                    VI. (1342-52), and King Robert in 1343 by his niece Joanna; and the latter
                    event, while plunging the kingdom in anarchy, likewise aggravated the condition
                    of Rome. For not only were the Neapolitan sovereigns still very powerful there,
                    but the principal Roman nobles held large fiefs across the Neapolitan
                    borders.</p>
                <p>Shortly before this another revolution in Rome had re-established the government
                    of the Thirteen and the two senators. The people, being anxious to show their
                    intention of respecting the papal authority, had despatched to Avignon as
                    ambassador of the republic, in 1343, a man destined to make much noise in the
                    world. This was Cola di Rienzo, sou of a Roman innkeeper, a notary, and an
                    impassioned student of the Bible, the fathers, Livy, Seneca, Cicero, and
                    Valerius Maximus. Thoroughly imbued with a half pagan half Christian spirit, he
                    believed that he had a divinely inspired mission to revive the ancient glories
                    of Rome. Of handsome presence, full of fantastic eloquence, and stirred to
                    enthusiasm by contemplation of the ruined monuments of Rome, he harangued the
                    people with a stilted oratory that enchanted their ears. He hated the nobles,
                    because one of his brothers had been killed by them; he loved the republic, and
                    in its name addressed a stately Latin speech to the astonished pope, and,
                    offering him the supreme power, besought his instant return to Rome. He also
                    begged him to allow the city to celebrate a jubilee every fifty years, and then,
                    as a personal request, asked to be nominated notary to the urban chamber. The
                    pope consented to everything, and Rienzi communicated this good news to Rome in
                    an emphatically worded epistle. After Easter, in 1344, he returned to Rome, and
                    found to his grief that the city was a prey to the nobles. He immediately began
                    to admonish the latter, and then, draped in a toga adorned with symbols,
                    exhibited and explained allegorical designs to the people, and announced the
                    speedy restoration of the past grandeur of Rome. Finally he and a few burghers
                    and merchants, whom he had secretly inflamed by his discourses, made a solemn
                    vow to overthrow the nobility and consolidate the republic. The moment was
                    favourable, owing to the anarchy of Naples, the absence of the pope, the
                    weakness of the empire, and the disputes of the barons, although the latter were
                    still very potent and constituted, as it were, a separate government opposed to
                    that of the people. Rienzi, having gained the pope’s ecclesiastical vicar to his
                    side, passed in prayer the night of the 19th May 1347, placing his enterprise
                    under the protection of the Holy Spirit, and the following day marched to the
                    Capitol, surrounded by his adherents, convoked a parliament of the people, and
                    obtained its sanction for the following proposals :—that all pending lawsuits
                    should be at once decided; that justice should be equally administered to all;
                    that every region should equip one hundred foot soldiers and twenty-five horse;
                    that the dues and taxes should be rearranged; that the forts, bridges, and gates
                    of the city should be held by the rector of the people instead of by the
                    nobility; and that granaries should be opened for the public use. On the same
                    day, amid general homage and applause, Rienzi was proclaimed head of the
                    republic, with the title of tribune and liberator of the Holy Roman Republic,
                    “by authority of the most merciful Lord Jesus Christ.” The nobles withdrew
                    scoffing but alarmed. Rienzi engaged a body-guard of one hundred men, and
                    assumed the command of thirteen hundred infantry and three hundred and ninety
                    light horse; he abolished the senators, retained the Thirteen and the general
                    and special councils, and set the administration on a new footing. These
                    measures and the prompt submission of the other cities of the state brought an
                    instant increase of revenue to Rome.</p>
                <p>This revolution, as will be noted, was of an entirely novel stamp. For its leader
                    despatched envoys to all the cities of Italy, exhorting them to shake off the
                    yoke of their tyrants, and send representatives to the parliament convoked for
                    the 1st August, inasmuch as the liberation of Rome also implied the “liberation
                    of the sacred land of Italy.” In Rienzi’s judgment the Roman revolution must be,
                    not municipal, but national, and even in some points universal. And this idea
                    was welcomed with general enthusiasm throughout the peninsula. Solemn festivals
                    and processions were held in Rome; and, when the tribune went in state to St
                    Peter’s, the canons met him on the steps chanting the <hi rend="italic">Veni,
                    Creator Spimtus.</hi> Even the pope, willingly or unwillingly, accorded his
                    approval to Rienzi’s deeds. The provincial cities did homage to Rome and her
                    tribune, and almost all the rest of Italy gave him its enthusiastic adherence.
                    The ancient sovereign people seemed on the point of resuscitation. And others
                    besides the multitude were fascinated and carried off their feet. Great men like
                    Petrarch were transported with joy. The poet lauded Cola di Rienzo as a sublime
                    and supernatural being, the greatest of ancient and modern men. But it was soon
                    evident that all this enthusiasm was mainly factitious. On the 26th of July a
                    new parliament was called, and this decreed that all the rights and privileges
                    granted to the empire and church must now be vested in the Roman people, from
                    whom they had first emanated. But on the convocation of the national parliament
                    few representatives obeyed the summons and the scheme was a failure. All had
                    gone well so long as principles only were proclaimed, but when words had to be
                    followed by deeds the municipal feeling awoke and distrust began to prevail.
                    Nevertheless, on the 1st August Rienzi assumed the spurs of knighthood and
                    passed a decree declaring that Rome would now resume her old jurisdiction over
                    the world, invoking the Holy Spirit upon Italy, granting the Roman citizenship
                    to all her cities, and proclaiming them free in virtue of the freedom of Rome.
                    This was a strange jumble of the ancient Roman idea combined with the mediaeval.
                    It was a dream of Rienzi’s brain, but it was also the dream of Dante and
                    Petrarch. The conception of the empire and the history of Italy, particularly
                    that of ancient and mediaeval Rome, were inevitably preparing the way for the
                    national idea. This Rienzi foresaw, and this constitutes the true grandeur of
                    his character, which in other respects was not exempt from pettiness and
                    infirmity. He pursued his course, therefore, undismayed, and had indeed gone too
                    far to draw back. On the 15th August he caused himself to be crowned tribune
                    with great pomp, and confirmed the rights of Roman citizenship to all natives of
                    Italy. But practical matters had also to be taken into account, and it was here
                    that his weakness and lack of judgment were shown. The nobles remained steadily
                    hostile, and refused to yield to the charm of his words. Hence conflict was
                    unavoidable; and at first Rienzi succeeded in vanquishing the Gaetani by means
                    of Giovanni Colonna. He next endeavoured to suppress the Guelf and Ghibelline
                    factions, and to restore Italy to “holy union” by raising her from her present
                    abasement.</p>
                <p>The pope, however, was weary of toleration, and, coming to terms with the nobles,
                    incited them to war. They accordingly moved from Palestrina, and on the 30th
                    November were encamped before Rome. Rienzi now put forth his energy. He had
                    already called the militia to arms, and a genuine battle took place in which
                    eighty <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n824/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0824-0801"/>nobles, chiefly of the Colonna clan, were left
                    dead. This was a real catastrophe to them, and the aristocracy never again
                    achieved the rule of the republic. But Rienzi’s head was turned by this sudden
                    success. In great need of money, he began to play the tyrant by levying taxes
                    and exacting instant obedience. The papal legate saw his opportunity and seized
                    it, by threatening to bring a charge of heresy against the tribune. Rienzi was
                    dismayed. He declared himself friendly to the pope and willing to respect his
                    authority; and he even sought to conciliate the nobles. At this moment certain
                    Neapolitan and Hungarian captains, after levying soldiers with the tribune’s
                    consent, joined the nobles and broke out in revolt. On their proving victorious
                    in a preliminary encounter with some of Rienzi’s guards, the tribune suddenly
                    lost heart, resigned the power he had held for seven months, and took refuge
                    with a few trusty adherents in Castle St Angelo, on the 15th December 1347.
                    Thence he presently fled to Naples, vainly hoping to find aid, and afterwards
                    disappeared for some time from the scene.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Romans remained tranquil, intent on making money by the jubilee;
                    but no sooner was this over than disorders broke out and the tyranny of the
                    baronage recommenced. To remedy this state of things, application was made to
                    the pope. He consulted with a committee of cardinals, who sought the advice of
                    Petrarch, and the poet suggested a popular government, to the complete exclusion
                    of the nobles, since these, he said, were strangers who ruined the city. The
                    people had already elected the Thirteen, and now, encouraged by these counsels,
                    on the 26th December 1351 chose Giovanni Perrone as head of the republic. But
                    the new leader was unable to withstand the hostilities of the nobles; and in
                    September 1353 Prancesco Baroncelli was elected tribune. He was a follower of
                    Rienzi, had been his ambassador to Florence, and did little beyond imitating his
                    mode of government and smoothing the way for his return.</p>
                <p>Rienzi had spent two years in the Abruzzi, leading a life of mystic contemplation
                    on Monte Maiella. Then, in 1350, he had gone to Prague and endeavoured to
                    convert to his ideas the yet uncrowned emperor Charles IV. When apparently on
                    the point of success, he was sent under arrest to the new pope, Innocent VI.
                    (1352-62), a man of great shrewdness and practical sense. On Rienzi’s arrival at
                    Avignon it became evident that his popularity was still very great, and that it
                    would be no easy task to dispose of him. The Romans were imploring his return;
                    Petrarch lauded him as a modern Gracchus or Scipio; and the pope finally
                    released him from confinement. Innocent had decided to send to Italy, in order
                    to settle affairs and bring the state into subjection to the church, that
                    valiant captain and skilled politician, Cardinal Albornoz. And, having no fear
                    that the latter’s hand would be forced, he further decided that Rienzi should be
                    sent to give him the support of his own popularity in Rome. In fact directly the
                    pair arrived Baroncelli was overthrown, the supremacy of the senate granted to
                    the pope, and the government confided to Albornoz, who, without concerning
                    himself with Rienzi, nominated Guido Patrizi as senator. He then marched at the
                    head of his troops against Giovanni, prefect of Vico, and forced him to render
                    submission at Montefiascone on the 5th June 1354. With the same promptitude and
                    skill he reduced Umbria and the Tuscan and Sabine districts, consented to leave
                    the privileges of the cities intact in return for their recognition of the papal
                    authority, and planted fortresses in suitable positions. In the meantime
                    Rienzi’s popularity was increasing in Rome; without either money or arms, the
                    ex-tribune succeeded by his eloquence in winning over the two Provençal leaders,
                    brothers of the famous free captain Fra Monreale; and, seduced by his promises
                    and hopes, they supplied him with funds. Then, profiting by his prestige, the
                    apparent favour of the pope, and the sums received, he was able to collect a
                    band of five hundred soldiers of mixed nationalities and returned towards Rome.
                    On Monte Mario he was met by the cavallerotti. On the 1st August 1354 he entered
                    the Castello gate, took possession of the government, named Monreale’s two
                    brothers his captains, and sent them to lay siege to Palestrina, which was still
                    the headquarters of the Colonna. But then money ran short, and he again lost his
                    head. Inviting Fra Monreale to a banquet, he put him to death for the sake of
                    his wealth, and kept the two brothers in confinement. This act excited general
                    indignation. And when, after his ill-gotten gains were spent, he again recurred
                    to violence to fill his purse, the public discontent was vented in a sudden
                    revolt on the 8th October. The people stormed the Capitol with cries of “Death
                    to the traitor.” Rienzi presented himself at a window waving the flag of Rome.
                    But the charm was finally broken. Missiles were hurled at him; the palace was
                    fired. He hid himself in the courtyard, shaved his beard, and, disguised as a
                    shepherd with a cloth over his head, slipped into the crowd and joined in their
                    cries against himself. Being recognized, however, by the golden bracelets he had
                    forgotten to remove, he was instantly stabbed. For two days his corpse was left
                    exposed to the insults of the mob, and was then burned. Such was the wretched
                    end of the man who, at one moment, seemed destined to fill the world with his
                    name as the regenerator of Rome and of Italy.</p>
                <p>In all the Italian cities the overthrow of the aristocracy had led to military
                    impotence and pressing danger of tyranny. The same thing had happened in Rome
                    when the nobility, weakened by the absence of church and empire, received its
                    death blow from Rienzi. But, whereas elsewhere tyrants were gradually arising in
                    the citizen class, Rome was always in danger of oppression by the pope. Nor was
                    any aid available from the empire, which had never recovered from its abasement
                    under Louis the Bavarian. In fact, when Charles of Luxembourg came to Rome to be
                    crowned, he was obliged to promise the pope that he would not enter the city. On
                    Easter day 1355 he received the crown, and departed, after counselling the
                    Romans to obey the pope. And the pontiffs had greater need than ever of an
                    established kingdom. Their position in France was much endangered by that
                    country’s disorder. New states were being formed on all sides; the mediaeval
                    unity was shattered; and the shrunken spiritual authority of the church
                    increased her need of material strength. As Italian affairs stood, it would be
                    easy for the popes to found a kingdom, but their presence was required in Rome
                    before it could be firmly established. The blood-stained sword of Albornoz had
                    prepared the way before them. In 1355-56 he vanquished the lords or tyrants of
                    Rimini, Fano, Fossombrone, Pesaro, Urbino, and other cities. And all these
                    places had been so rudely oppressed that the cardinal was often hailed as a
                    liberator after subduing their masters by fire , and sword. But everywhere he
                    had been obliged to leave existing Governments and rulers <hi rend="italic">in
                    statu quo</hi> after exacting their oaths of fealty. Thus the state was still
                    dissevered, and it was impossible to bind it together with the pope at Avignon
                    and Rome a republic. Bologna was still independent, Ordelaffi still lord of
                    Forli; Cesena and other cities were still rebellious; and the Campagna was still
                    in the hands of the barons. Some places were ruled by rectors nominated by the
                    pope; at Montefiascone there was an ecclesiastical rector, with a bench of
                    judges, and a captain commanding a mixed band of adventurers. Rome had submitted
                    to the haughty cardinal, but hated him <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0825-0802"/>mortally, and, on his departure for Avignon in
                    1357 to assist the threatened pontiff, immediately conceded to the latter the
                    supremacy of the senate. And the pope, instead of two senators, hastened to name
                    a single one of foreign birth. This was a shrewd device of Albornoz and another
                    blow to the nobles, with whom he was still at war. Thus was inaugurated, by the
                    nomination of Raimondo de’ Tolomei in 1358, a series of foreign senators,
                    fulfilling the functions of a podestà, and changed every six months, together
                    with their staff of judges, notaries, and knights. The people approved of this
                    reform as being inimical to the nobles and favourable to the preservation of
                    liberty. Hitherto the senators had been assisted, or rather kept in check, by
                    the thirteen representatives of the regions. These were now replaced by seven
                    reformers, in imitation of the priors of Florence, the better to follow that
                    city’s example. The reformers were soon the veritable chiefs of the republic.
                    They first appeared in 1360, were either <hi rend="italic">popolani</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cavallerotti,</hi> and were elected by ballot every three months.
                    When Albornoz returned to Italy, although desirous to keep Rome in the same
                    subjection as the other cities, he had first to vanquish Ordelaffi and reduce
                    Bologna. The latter enterprise was the more difficult task, and provoked a
                    lengthy war with Matteo Visconti of Milan. Thus Rome, being left to herself,
                    continued to be governed by her reformers; and the nobles, already shut out from
                    power, were also excluded from the militia, which had been reorganized, like
                    that of Florence, on the democratic system. Three thousand men, mostly archers,
                    were enrolled under the command of two banderesi, “in the likeness,” says M.
                    Villani, “of our gonfaloniers of the companies,” with four <hi rend="italic"
                    >antepositi</hi> constituting a supreme council of war. And the whole body was
                    styled the “Felix Societas Balestrariorum et Pavesatorum.” It was instituted to
                    support the reformers and re-establish order in the city and Campagna, to keep
                    down the nobles and defend the republic. It fulfilled these duties with much,
                    and sometimes excessive, severity. Banderesi and antepositi had seats in the
                    special council beside those of the reformers, as, in Florence, the gonfaloniers
                    of the companies were seated beside the priors. Later these officials
                    constituted the so-called <hi rend="italic">signoriα dei banderesi.</hi> In
                    1362, the Romans having subjected Velletri, which was defended by the nobles,
                    the latter made a riot in Rome. Thereupon the banderesi drove them all from the
                    city, killed some of their kindred, and did not even spare the cavallerotti. The
                    fight became so furious that from gate to gate all Rome w <hi rend="superscript"
                    >y</hi> as in arms, and even mercenaries were hired. But in the end renewed
                    submission was made to the pope.</p>
                <p>On the death of Innocent VI. in 1362, an agreement was concluded with his
                    successor Urban V. (1362-70), also a Frenchman, who was obliged to give his
                    sanction to the government of the reformers and banderesi. And then, Albornoz
                    being recalled in disgrace to Avignon, and afterwards sent as legate to Naples,
                    these Roman magistrates were able, with or without the co-operation of the
                    foreign senator, to rule in their own way. They did justice on the nobles by
                    hanging a few more; and they defended the city from the threatening attacks of
                    the mercenaries, who had now become Italy’s worst foes. It was at this period
                    that the Roman statutes were revised and rearranged in the compilation
                    erroneously attributed by some writers to Albornoz, which has come down to us
                    supplemented by alterations of a later date.</p>
                <p>But now the popes, being no longer in safety at Avignon, really decided to return
                    to Italy. Even Urban</p>
                <p>V. had to pay ransom to escape from the threatened attacks of the free companies.
                    The Romans implored his return, and he was further urged to it by the Italian
                    <hi rend="italic">literati</hi> with Petrarch at their head. In April 1367 he
                    finally quitted Avignon, and, entering Rome on the 16th October, was given the
                    lordship of the city. Cardinal Albornoz had fallen mortally ill at Viterbo, but,
                    though unable to accompany the pope to Rome, had, before dying, suggested his
                    course of action. Certainly Urban showed much acumen in profiting by the first
                    burst of popular enthusiasm to effect quick and dexterous changes in the
                    constitution of the republic. After naming a senator, he abolished the posts of
                    reformers and banderesi, substituting three conservators, or rather a species of
                    municipal council, alone charged with judicial and administrative powers, which
                    has lasted to the present day. The thirteen leaders of the regions and the
                    consuls of the guilds still sat in the councils, which were left unsuppressed.
                    But all real power was in the hands of the pope, who, in Rome, as in his other
                    cities, nominated the principal magistrates. Thus, by transforming political
                    into civil institutions and concentrating the supreme authority in his own
                    grasp, Urban V. dealt a mortal blow to the liberties of Rome. Yet he felt no
                    sense of security among a people who, after the first rejoicings over the return
                    of the Holy See, were always on the brink of revolt. Besides he felt himself a
                    stranger in Italy, and was so regarded. Accordingly, in April 1370 he decided to
                    return to France; on the 20th of that month he wrote from Viterbo that no change
                    was to be made in the government; and he died in Avignon on the 19th of
                    December.</p>
                <p>The Romans retained the conservators, conferring on them the political power of
                    the reformers; they re-established the banderesi with the Florentine title of
                    <hi rend="italic">executores justitiαe</hi> and the four antepositi with that of
                    consiliarii. Thus the “Felix Societas Balestrariorum et Pavesatorum Urbis” was
                    restored, and the two councils met as before. The new French pope, Gregory XI.
                    (1370-78), had to be content with obtaining supremacy over the Senate and the
                    possession of the Castle St Angelo. It was a difficult moment for him. The
                    Florentines had come to an open rupture with his legates, and had adopted the
                    expedient of inviting all the cities of the Roman state to redeem their lost
                    freedom. Accordingly in 1375 many of them rose against the legates, who were
                    mostly French and regarded with dislike as foreigners. Florentine despatches,
                    full of classical allusions and chiefly composed by the famous scholar,
                    Secretary Coluccio Salutati, were rapidly sent in all directions. Those
                    addressed to the Romans were specially fervid, and emphatically appealed to
                    their patriotism and memories of the past. But the Romans received them with
                    doubt and mistrust, for they saw that the revolution threatened to dismember the
                    state, by promoting the independence of every separate city. Besides, while
                    maintaining their republic, they also desired the pope’s presence in Rome.
                    Nevertheless they went with the current to the extent of reforming their
                    constitution. In February 1376 they nominated Giovanni Cenci captain of the
                    people, and gave him uncontrolled power over the towns of the patrimony and the
                    Sabine land. The conservators, with their new political authority, the
                    executores, the antepositi, and the two councils were all preserved, and a new
                    magistracy was created, the “Très Gubernatores Pacis et Libertatis Reipublicae
                    Romanae.” This answered to the Eight (afterwards Ten) of War in Florence,
                    likewise frequently called the Eight of Liberty and Peace. It was this Council
                    of Eight that was now directing the war against the pope and braving his
                    sentence of excommunication; and their fiery zeal had won them the title of the
                    Holy Eight from the Florentines.</p>
                <p>Realizing that further absence would cost him his state, Gregory XI. quitted
                    Avignon on the 13th September 1376, and, reaching Corneto in December,
                    despatched to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n826/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0826-0803"/>Rome three legates, who, on the 2lst of the month,
                    concluded an agreement with the parliament. The people gave up the gates, the
                    fortresses, and the Trastevere, and promised that if the pope returned to Rome
                    he should have the same powers which had been granted to Urban V. But, on his
                    side, he must pledge himself to maintain the executores, their council, the
                    Three of War, and allow the Romans the right of reforming the banderesi, who
                    would then swear fealty to him. The terms of this peace and the pope’s epistles
                    clearly prove that the two councils still exercised their functions, that the
                    banderesi were still the virtual heads of the Government, and that their
                    suppression was not contemplated. In fact, when the pope made his entry on the
                    17th January 1377 accompanied by two thousand armed men, he perceived that there
                    was much public agitation, that the Romans did not intend to fulfil their
                    agreement, and that the Government of the banderesi went on as before.
                    Accordingly, after naming Gomez Albornoz, a nephew of the deceased cardinal, to
                    the office of senator, he retired to Anagni, and remained there until November
                    1377. The Romans presently waited on him with conciliating offers, and begged
                    him to negotiate a peace for them with the prefect of Vico. In fact the treaty
                    was concluded at Anagni in October, and on the IOth November confirmed in Rome
                    by the general council. The meeting was held in the great hall of the Capitol,
                    “ubi consilia generalia urbis fieri soient,” in the presence of all the members
                    of the republican Government. But the pope was enraged by the survival of this
                    Government, and, being worn out by the persistent hostility of the Florentines,
                    which reduced his power to a low ebb, had determined to make peace, when
                    surprised by death on the 27th March 1378.</p>
                <p>The next pope, Urban VI. (1378-89), a Neapolitan, was the spirit of discord
                    incarnate. His election was not altogether regular: the French party among the
                    cardinals was against him; and the people were ripe for insurrection. But,
                    regardless of all this, Urban threatened the cardinals in his first consistory,
                    saying that church reform must begin with them; and he used the same tone with
                    the people, reproving them for failing to suppress the banderesi. In consequence
                    of this the cardinals of the French party, assembling at Fondi, elected the
                    antipope Clement VIL (1378-94) and started a long and painful schism in the
                    church. Clement resided in Avignon, while Urban in Rome was engaged in opposing
                    Queen Joanna I. of Naples and favouring Charles of Durazzo, who, on conquering
                    the Neapolitan kingdom, was made gonfalonier of the church and senator of Rome,
                    where he left a vicar as his deputy. Shortly afterwards the pope went to Naples,
                    and made fierce war on the king. Then, after many adventures, during which he
                    tortured and put to death several cardinals whom he suspected of hostile
                    intentions, he returned to Rome, where the utmost disorder prevailed. The
                    conservators and the banderesi were still at the head of the Government, and,
                    the pope speedily falling out with them, a riot ensued, after which he
                    excommunicated the banderesi. These at last made submission to him, and Urban
                    VI. became master of Rome before his death in 1389. He was succeeded by Boniface
                    IX. (1389-1404), another Neapolitan, but a man of greater shrewdness and
                    capacity. His first act was to crown Ladislaus king of Naples, and secure the
                    friendship and protection of this ambitious and powerful prince. In all the
                    principal cities of the state he chose the reigning lords for his vicars. But he
                    allowed Fermo, Ascoli, and Bologna the privilege of assuming their own vicariate
                    for twenty-five years. And, as these different potentates and Governments had
                    only to pay him an annual tribute, all parties were satisfied, and the pope was
                    able to bestow at least an appearance of order and unity on his state. But fresh
                    tumults soon arose, partly because the conservators and banderesi sought to
                    govern on their own account, and especially because the pope seems for a time to
                    have omitted naming the senator. Boniface was a prudent man; he saw that events
                    were turning in his favour, now that throughout Italy liberty was tottering to
                    its fall, and bided his time. He was satisfied for the moment by obtaining a
                    recognition of the immunities of the clergy, rendering them solely amenable to
                    ecclesiastical tribunals, and thus distinguishing the powers of the church from
                    those of the state in Rome. The republic also pledged itself neither to molest
                    the prelates nor to levy fresh contributions on them towards repairing the
                    walls, to aid in recovering the estates of the church in Tuscia, and to try to
                    conciliate the baronage. This concordat, concluded with the
                    Conservatorsandbanderesionthe Ilth September 1391, was also confirmed on the 5th
                    March 1392 by the heads of the regions, together with a fresh treaty binding
                    both parties to furnish a certain number of armed men to combat the prefect of
                    Vico and the adherents of the antipope at Viterbo. With the exception of this
                    city, Orchi, and Civita Vecchia, all other conquered territory was to belong to
                    the republic. But the Romans soon discovered that they were playing into the
                    hands of the pope, who kept everything for himself, without even paying the
                    troops. Upon this a riot broke out; Boniface fled to Perugia in October 1392,
                    and resolved to exact better terms when next recalled to Rome. Meanwhile the
                    Romans subdued the prefect, captured Viterbo, and, being already repentant,
                    handed it over to the pope and implored his return. He then proposed his own
                    terms, which were approved, not only by the conservators, banderesi, and four
                    councillors, but also by the special council and by the unanimous vote of a
                    general assembly composed of the above-mentioned authorities, heads of regions,
                    other officials, and a hundred citizens (8th August 1393). These terms
                    prescribed that the pope was to elect the senator, and that, on his failing so
                    to do, the conservators would carry on the government after swearing fealty to
                    him. The senatorial function was to be neither controlled nor hampered by the
                    banderesi. The immunities of the clergy were to be preserved, and all church
                    property was to be respected by the magistrates. The expenses of the pope’s
                    journey were to be paid, and he was to be escorted to Rome in state. Boniface
                    tried to complete his work by abolishing the banderesi, the last bulwarks of
                    freedom; but the people, although weakened and weary, made efforts to preserve
                    them, and, although their fall was inevitable, the struggle went on for some
                    time.</p>
                <p>During the spring of 1394 the banderesi provoked an insurrection in which the
                    pope’s life was endangered; it was only saved by the arrival of King Ladislaus,
                    who came from Naples with a large force in the early autumn. But for the
                    Neapolitan soldiery Boniface could not have withstood the long series of revolts
                    that continually exposed him to fresh perils and the anxiety caused by the
                    persistent schism .of the church. The death of Clement VII. in 1394 was followed
                    by the election of another antipope, Benedict XIII. But a new jubilee was in
                    prospect for the year 1400, and this was always an efficacious means of bending
                    the will of the Romans. Depending upon this and the assistance of Ladislaus,
                    Boniface not only demanded full powers to nominate senators (none having been
                    recently elected), but insisted on the suppression of the banderesi. Both
                    requests were granted; but, directly Angelo Alaleoni was made senator, a
                    conspiracy was hatched for the re-establishment of the banderesi. However, the
                    pope felt sure of his strength; the plot was discovered and the conspirators
                    were beheaded <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0827-0804"/>on the stairs of the CapitoL This proved the end
                    of the banderesi and of the liberties of Rome. The government was again directed
                    by an alien senator together with three conservators, but the latter were
                    gradually deprived of their political attributes, and became mere civil
                    officers. The militia, regions, guilds, and other associations now rapidly lost
                    all political importance, and before long were little more than empty names.
                    Thus in 1398 the Romans submitted to the complete sway of the pope, and in July
                    of the same year the senator chosen by him was Mala-testa dei Malatesti of
                    Rimini, one of a line of tyrants, a valiant soldier, who was also temporal vicar
                    and captain general of the church. Boniface continued to appoint foreign
                    senators during the rest of his life; he fortified Castle St Angelo, the
                    Vatican, and the Capitol; he stationed galleys at the mouth of the Tiber, and
                    proved himself in all things a thoroughly temporal prince. He aggrandized all
                    his kindred, especially his brother, and, with the aid of his senator, his armed
                    force, and the protection of Ladislaus, succeeded in keeping down all the
                    surviving nobles. In 1400, however, these made an attempt to upset the
                    Government. Niccolb Colonna forced his way into the city with cries of “Popolo,
                    popolo! death to Boniface !” But the Romans had grown deaf to the voice of
                    liberty; they refused to rise, and the senator, a λ <hi rend="superscript"
                    >r</hi> enetian named Zaccaria Trevisan, behaved with much energy. Colonna and
                    his men had to beat a swift retreat to Palestrina. A charge of high treason was
                    immediately instituted against him, and thirty-one rebels were beheaded. The
                    pope then proclaimed a crusade against all the Colonna, and sent a body of two
                    thousand men and some of the Neapolitan soldiery to attack them. Several of
                    their estates were seized and devastated, but Palestrina continued to hold out,
                    and on the 7th January 1401 the Colonna finally made submission to the pope.
                    Nevertheless they obtained advantageous terms, for Boniface left them their
                    lands, appointed them vicars of other territories, and made similar agreements
                    with the Gaetani and Orsini. In this way he became absolute master of Rome. One
                    chronicler remarks that “Romanis tanquam rigidus imperator dominabatur,” and the
                    same tone is taken by others. But he did not succeed in putting an end to the
                    schism of the church, which was still going on when he died in the Vatican on
                    the 1st October 1404.</p>
                <p>Innocent VII. (1404-6) was the next pope. He too was a Neapolitan, and on his
                    election the people again rose in revolt and refused to acknowledge him unless
                    he consented to resign the temporal power. But Ladislaus of Naples hastened to
                    his help, and an agreement was made which, under the cover of apparent
                    concessions, really riveted the people’s chains. Rome was recognized as the seat
                    of the temporal and spiritual sovereignty of the pope, and the pope continued to
                    appoint the senator. The people were to elect seven governors of the city, who
                    were to swear fealty to the pope and carry on the government in conjunction with
                    three other governors chosen by the pontiff or Ladislaus. The stipulations of
                    Boniface IX. concerning ecclesiastical immunities were again confirmed. Γhe
                    barons were forbidden to place more than five lances each at the service of the
                    people, and—which was the real gist of the covenant—the people were henceforth
                    forbidden to make laws or statutes without the permission of the pope. The
                    captain of the people, deprived of his political and judicial functions and
                    reduced to a simple judge, was also to be chosen by the pope. But this treaty,
                    drawn up on the 27th October 1404, was not signed at the time, and many
                    difficulties and disturbances arose when its terms were to be put into effect.
                    The Romans nominated the seven governors, but, without waiting until the pope
                    had chosen three more, placed the state in their hands, and styled them
                    governors of the liberty of the Roman republic. They were in fact banderesi or
                    reformatori under a new name. But the attempt proved inefficacious, for, at the
                    pope’s first threat of departure, the Romans made their submission, and the
                    treaty of October was subscribed on the 15th May 1405. Nevertheless, as it only
                    bears the signatures of the “seven governors of the liberty of the Roman
                    republic,” the pope would seem to have made some concessions. His position was
                    by no means assured. Ladislaus was known to aspire to absolute dominion in
                    Italy, and, although willing to aid in suppressing the republic, tried to
                    prepare the way for his own designs, and frequently held out a helping hand to
                    the vanquished. On the 6th August fourteen influential citizens of Rome boldly
                    presented themselves at the Vatican, and in a threatening manner called the pope
                    to account for giving his whole attention to worldly things, instead of
                    endeavouring to put a stop to the schisms of the church. But, on leaving his
                    presence, they were attacked by Luigi Migliorati, the pope’s nephew, and
                    notorious for his violence, who killed eleven of their number, including several
                    heads of the regions and two of the governors. An insurrection ensued, and the
                    pope and his nephew fled to Viterbo. The Colonna tried to profit by these
                    events, and applied to Ladislaus, who, hoping that the moment had come to make
                    himself master of Rome, sent the count of Troia thither with a troop of three
                    thousand horse. But the people, enraged by this treachery, and determined not to
                    fall under the yoke of Naples, awoke for an instant to the memory of their past
                    glories, and bravely repulsed the Colonna and the Neapolitans. And, on the
                    speedy arrival of the Orsini with some of the papal troops, the people
                    voluntarily restored the papal government, and, assembling the parliament,
                    besought the pope to return on his own terms. Accordingly, after first naming
                    Francesco Panciatichi of Pistoia to the senatorship, the pope came back on the
                    13th March 1406, bringing his whole curia with him, and also the murderer
                    Migliorati, who, triumphing in impunity, became more arrogant than before. Here
                    indeed was a proof that the Romans were no longer worthy of liberty! And now, by
                    means of the Orsini, Innocent had only to reduce the Colonna and other nobles
                    raised to power by Ladislaus; nor was this very difficult, seeing that the king,
                    in his usual fashion, abandoned them to their fate, and, making terms with the
                    pope, was named gonfalonier of the church and again protected her cause.</p>
                <p>Innocent, dying in 1406, was succeeded by Gregory XII., a Venetian, who, as we
                    shall presently see, resigned the chair in 1415. On his accession, finding his
                    state firmly established, he seemed to be seriously bent on putting an end to
                    the Great Schism, and for that purpose arranged a meeting with the antipope
                    Benedict XIII. at the congress of Savona in 1408. But Gregory and Benedict only
                    used the congress as a pretext for making war upon each other, and were urged on
                    by Ladislaus, who hoped by Aveakening both to gain possession of Rome, where,
                    although opposed by the Orsini, he had the support of the Colonna. Gregory, who
                    had then fled from Rome, made a momentary attempt to win the popular favour by
                    restoring the government of the banderesi; but Ladislaus marched into Rome in
                    June 1408 and established a senator of his oavπ. Meanwhile the two popes were
                    continuing their shameful struggle, and the council of Pisa (March 1409), in
                    attempting to check it, only succeeded in raising up a third pontiff, first in
                    the person of Alexander V. (1409-10), and then in the turbulent Baldassare
                    Cossa, who assumed the name of John XXIII. The latter began by sending a large
                    contingent to assist Louis of Anjou against Ladislaus. But the enterprise
                    failed, and, seeing himself deserted by all, Pope John next embraced the cause
                    of his foe by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n828/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0828-0805"/>naming him gonfalonier of the church. Thereupon
                    Ladislaus concluded a sham peace, and then, seizing Rome, put it to the sack and
                    established his own government there. Thus John, like the other two popes,
                    became a wanderer in Italy. In August 1414 Ladislaus died and was succeeded by
                    the scandalous Queen Joanna II. The Roman people promptly expelled the
                    Neapolitans, and Cardinal Isolani, John’s legate, succeeding in rousing a
                    reaction in favour of the church, constituted a government of thirteen
                    “conservators” on the 19th October.</p>
                <p>In November 1414 the council of Constance assembled, and at last ended the schism
                    by deposing all the popes, and incarcerating John XXIII., the most turbulent of
                    the three. On the Ilth November 1417 Oddo Colonna was unanimously elected to the
                    papal chair; he was consecrated in the cathedral on the 27 th as Pope Martin V.,
                    and, being acknowledged by all, hastened without delay to take possession of his
                    see. Meanwhile disorder was at. its height in Rome. The cardinal legate Isolani
                    ’ governed as he best could, while Castle St Angelo remained in the hands of the
                    Neapolitans, who still had a party in the city. In this divided state of affairs
                    Braccio, a daring captain of adventurers, nicknamed Fortebraccio, was inspired
                    with the idea of making himself master of Rome. Overcoming the feeble resistance
                    opposed to him, he succeeded in this on the l6th June 1416 and assumed the title
                    of “Defensor Urbis.” But Joanna of Naples despatched Sforza, an equally valiant
                    captain, against him, and, without offering battle, Fortebraccio withdrew on the
                    26th August, after having been absolute master of the eternal city for seventy
                    days. Sforza marched in on the</p>
                <p>27th, and took possession of the city in the name of Joanna. Martin V. instantly
                    proved himself a good statesman. He confirmed the legate Isolani as his vicar,
                    and Giovanni Savelli as senator. Leaving Constance on the 16th May 1418, he
                    reached Milan on the 12th October, and slowly proceeded on his journey. While in
                    Florence he despatched his brother and nephew to Naples to make alliance with
                    Joanna, and caused her to be crowned on the 28th October 1419 by his legate
                    Morosini. Upon this she promised to give up Rome to the pope. Her general,
                    Sforza, then entered the service of Martin V., and compelled Fortebraccio, who
                    was lingering in a threatening attitude at Perugia, to make peace with the pope.
                    The latter entrusted Fortebraccio with the conduct of the campaign against
                    Bologna, and that city was reduced to submission on the 15 th July 1420. The
                    Romans had already yielded to Martin’s brother the legate, and now earnestly
                    besought the arrival of their pope. Accordinglyhe left Florence on the 19th
                    September 1420, and entered the Vatican on the 28th. Rome was in ruins; nobility
                    and burghers were equally disorganized, the people unable to bear arms and
                    careless of their rights, while the battered walls of the Capitol recorded the
                    fall of two republics.</p>
                <p>Martin V. had now to fulfil a far more difficult task than that of taking
                    possession of Rome. Throughout Italy municipal freedom was overthrown, and the
                    Roman republic had ceased to exist. The Middle Ages were ended; the Renaissance
                    was beginning. The universal unity both of church and of empire was dissolved;
                    the empire was now Germanic, and derived its principal strength from direct
                    dominion over a few provinces. Independent -and national states were already
                    formed or forming on all sides. The papacy itself had ceased to claim universal
                    supremacy over the world’s Governments, and the possession of a temporal state
                    had become essential to its existence. In fact Martin V. was the first of the
                    series of popes who were real sovereigns, and more occupied with politics than
                    religion. Involved in all the foreign intrigues, falsehoods, and treacheries of
                    Italian diplomacy in the 15th century, their internal policy was imbued with all
                    the arts practised by the tyrants of the Renaissance, and nepotism became
                    necessarily the basis of their strength. It was natural that men suddenly
                    elected sovereigns of a new country where they had no ties, and of which they
                    had often no knowledge, should seek to strengthen their position by aggrandizing

                <p>Martin V. reduced the remains of the free Roman ' Government to a mere civil
                    municipality. Following the method of the other despots of Italy, the old
                    republican institutions were allowed to retain their names and forms, their
                    administrative and some of their judicial attributes, while all their political
                    functions were transferred to the new Government. Order was re-established, and
                    justice rigidly observed. Many rebellious places were subdued by the sword, and
                    many leaders of armed bands were hanged. The pope, however, was forced to lean
                    on his kinsmen the Colonna and again raise them to power by grants of vast fiefs
                    both in his own state and the Neapolitan territory. And, after first supporting
                    Joanna II., who had assisted his entry into Rome, he next sided with her
                    adversary, Louis of Anjou, and then with Alphonso of Aragon, the conqueror of
                    both and the constant friend of the pope, who at last felt safe on his throne.
                    Rome now enjoyed order, peace, and security, but had lost all hope of liberty.
                    And when Martin died (20th February 1431) these words were inscribed on his
                    tomb, <hi rend="italic">Temporum suorum félicitas.</hi></p>
                <p>Eugenius IV. (1431-47) leant on the Orsini, and was fiercely opposed by the
                    Colonna, who excited the people against him. Accordingly on the 29th May 1434
                    the Romans rose in revolt to the old cry of “Popolo e popolo,” and again
                    constituted the rule of the seven governors of liberty. The pope fled by boat
                    down the Tiber, and, being pursued with stones and shots, narrowly escaped with
                    his life. On reaching Florence, he turned his energies to the recovery of the
                    state. It was necessary to quell the people; but, first of all, the Colonna and
                    the clan of the prefects of Vico, with their renewed princely power, had to be
                    overthrown. The Orsini were still his friends. Eugenius entrusted the campaign
                    to Patriarch (afterwards Cardinal) Vitelleschi, a worthy successor of Albornoz,
                    and of greater ferocity if less talent. This leader marched his army towards
                    Rome, and, instantly attacking Giovanni, prefect of Vico, captured and beheaded
                    him. The family was now extinguished; and, its possessions reverting to the
                    church, the greater part of them were sold or given to Count Everso
                    d’Anguillara, of the house of Orsini. The prefecture, now little more than an
                    honorary title, was bestowed at will by the popes. Eugenius gave it to
                    Francesco, founder of the powerful line of the Gravina-Orsini. Thus one noble
                    family was raised to greatness while another perished by the sword. Vitelleschi
                    had already begun to persecute the Colonna and the Savelli, and committed
                    terrible slaughter among them. Many castles were demolished, many towns
                    destroyed; and their inhabitants, driven to wander famine-stricken over the
                    Campagna, had to sell themselves as slaves for the sake of bread. Finally the
                    arrogant patriarch marched into Rome, as into a conquered city, at the head of
                    his men, and the Romans crouched at his feet. The pope now began to distrust
                    him, and sent Scarampo, another prelate of the same stamp, to take his place.
                    This new commander soon arrived, and, perceiving that Vitelleschi proposed to
                    resist, had him surrounded by his soldiers, who were obliged to use force to
                    compel his surrender. ATtelleschi was carried bleeding to Castle St Angelo,
                    where he soon afterwards died. The pope at last returned to Rome in 1443, and
                    remained there quietly till his death in 1447.</p>

                <p>His successor Nicholas V. (1447-55) was a scholar solely devoted to the patronage
                    of literati and artists. During his reign there was a fresh attempt to restore
                    the republic, but it was rather prompted by literary and classical enthusiasm
                    than by any genuine patriotic ardour. Political passions and interests had
                    ceased to exist. The conspiracy was headed by Stefano Porcari, a man of the f
                    people, who claimed to be descended from Cato. He had once been captain of the
                    people in Florence, and was made podestà of Bologna by Eugenius IV. He was a
                    caricature of Cola di Rienzo, and extravagantly proud of his Latin speeches in
                    honour of ancient republican liberty. The admiration of antiquity was then at
                    its height, and Porcari found many enthusiastic hearers. Directly after the
                    death of Eugenius IV. he made a first and unsuccessful attempt to proclaim the
                    republic. Nevertheless Nicholas V., with the same indulgence for scholars that
                    had prompted him to pardon Valla for denying the temporal power of the papacy
                    and laughing to scorn the pretended donation of Constantine, freely pardoned
                    Porcari and named him podestà of Anagni. He filled this office with credit, but
                    on his return to Rome again began to play the agitator, and was banished to
                    Bologna with a pension from the pope. Nicholas V. had conferred all the state
                    offices upon priests and abbots, and had erected numerous fortresses. Hence
                    there were many malcontents in Rome, in communication with Porcari at Bologna,
                    and ready to join in his plot. Arms were collected, and on the day fixed he
                    presented himself to his fellow-conspirators adorned with rich robes and a gold
                    chain, and harangued them in Latin on the duty of freeing their country from the
                    yoke of the priests. His design was to set fire to the Vatican on the 6th
                    January 1453, the feast of the Epiphany; he and his followers were to seize the
                    pope, the cardinals, and Castle St Angelo. But Nicholas received timely warning;
                    the conspirators’ house was surrounded; and Porcari himself was seized while
                    trying to escape, confined in Castle St Angelo, and put to death with nine of
                    his companions on the 9th January. Others shortly suffered the same fate.</p>
                <p>Under Calixtus III. and Pius II. affairs went on quietly enough, but Paul II.
                    (1464-71) had a somewhat troubled reign. Yet he was a skilled politician. He
                    reordered the finances and the courts of justice, punished crime with severity,
                    was an energetic foe to the Malatesta of Rimini, put an end to the oppression
                    exercised in Rome by the wealthy and arrogant house of Anguillara, and kept the
                    people in good humour with continual festivities. But—and this was a grave
                    defect at that period—he extended no favour to learning, and, by driving many
                    scholars from the curia to make room for his own kinsmen, brought a storm about
                    his ears. At that time the house of Pomponio Leto was the rendezvous of learned
                    men and the seat of the Roman Academy. Leto was an enthusiast of antiquity; and,
                    as the members of the Academy all assumed old Latin names, they were suspected
                    of a design to re-establish paganism and the republican government. It is
                    certain that they all inveighed against the pope; and, as the latter was no man
                    of half measures, during the carnival of 1468 he suddenly imprisoned twenty
                    Academicians, and even subjected a few of them to torture. Pomponio Leto,
                    although absent in Venice, was also arrested and tried; but he exculpated
                    himself, craved forgiveness, and was set at liberty. His friends were also
                    released, for the charge of conspiracy proved to be unfounded. Certain members
                    of the Academy, and notably Platina in his <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                    Popes,</hi> afterwards revenged themselves by stigmatizing Paul II. as the
                    persecutor of philosophy and letters. But he was no more a persecutor than a
                    patron of learning; he was a politician, the author of some useful reforms, and
                    solely intent on the consolidation of his absolute power. Among his reforms may
                    be classed the revision of the Roman statutes in 1469, for the purpose of
                    destroying the substance while preserving the form of the old Roman legislation,
                    and entirely stripping it of all political significance. In fact the pope’s will
                    was now absolute, and even in criminal cases he could trample unhindered on the
                    common law.</p>
                <p>There was still a senator of Rome, whose nomination was entirely in the hands of
                    the pope, still three conservators, the heads of the rioni, and an elected
                    council of twenty-six citizens. Now and then also a shadowy semblance of a
                    popular assembly was held to cast dust in the eyes of the public, but even this
                    was not for long. All these officials, together with the judges of the Capitol,
                    retained various attributes of different kinds. They administered justice and
                    gave sentence. There were numerous tribunals all with undefined modes of
                    procedure, so that it was very difficult for the citizens to ascertain in which
                    court justice should be sought. But in last resort there was always the supreme
                    decision of the pope. Thus matters remained to the time of the French
                    Revolution.</p>
                <p>For the completion of this system a final blow had to be dealt to the
                    aristocracy, whose power had been increased by nepotism; and it was dealt by
                    bloodshed under the three following popes—Sixtus IV. (1471-84), Innocent VIIL
                    (1484-92), and Alexander VI. (1492-1503)—each of whom was worse than his
                    predecessor. The first, by means of his nephews, continued the slaughter of the
                    Colonna, sending an army against them, devastating their estates at Alarino, and
                    beheading the protonotary Lorenzo Colonna. Innocent VIII. was confronted by the
                    power of the Orsini, who so greatly endangered his life by their disturbances in
                    the city that he was only saved by an alliance with Naples. Neither peace nor
                    order could be lastingly established until these arrogant barons were
                    overthrown. This task was accomplished by the worst of the three pontiffs,
                    Alexander VI. All know how the massacre of the Orsini was compassed, almost
                    simultaneously, by the pope in Rome and his equally iniquitous son, Caesar
                    Borgia, at Sinigaglia (1502). This pair dealt the last blow to the Roman
                    aristocracy and the tyrants of Romagna, and thus the temporal dominion of the
                    papacy was finally assured. The republic was now at an end; it had shrivelled to
                    a civil municipality. Its institutions, deprived of all practical value,
                    lingered on like ghosts of the past, subject from century to century to
                    unimportant changes. The history of Rome is henceforth absorbed in that of the
                    papacy.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless the republic twice attempted to rise from its grave, and on the
                    second occasion gave proofs of heroism worthy of its past. It was first
                    resuscitated in February 1798, by the influence of the French Revolution, and
                    the French constitution of the year III. was rapidly imitated. Rome had again
                    two councils—the tribunate and the senate, with five consuls constituting the
                    executive power. But in the following year, owing to the military reverses of
                    the French, the government of the popes was restored until 1809, when Napoleon
                    I. annexed to his empire the States of the Church. Rome was then governed by a
                    consulta Straordinaria—a special commission—with the municipal and provincial
                    institutions of France. In 1814 the papal government was again reinstated, and
                    the old institutions, somewhat modified on the French system, were recalled to
                    life. Pius IX. (1846-77) tried to introduce fresh reforms, and to improve and
                    simplify the old machinery of state; but the advancing tide of the Italian
                    revolution of 1848 drove him from Rome; the republic was once more proclaimed,
                    and had a brief but glorious existence. Its programme was dictated by Joseph
                    AIazzini, who with Saffi and Armellini formed the triumvirate at the head of the
                    Government. United Italy was to be a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0830-0807"/>republic with Rome for her capital. The rhetorical
                    idea of Cola di Rienzo became heroic in 1849. The constituent assembly (9th
                    February 1849) proclaimed the fall of the temporal power of the popes, and the
                    establishment of a republic which was to be not only of Rome but of all Italy.
                    France, although then herself a republic, assumed the unenviable task of
                    re-establishing the temporal power by force of arms. But the gallant defence of
                    Rome by General Garibaldi covered the republic with glory. The enemy was
                    repulsed, and the army of the Neapolitan king, sent to restore the pope, was
                    also driven off. Then, however, France despatched a fresh and more powerful
                    force; Rome was vigorously besieged, and at last compelled to surrender. AVith
                    June 1849 begins the new series of pontifical laws designed to restore the
                    government of Pius IX., whose reign down to 1870 was that of an absolute
                    sovereign. Then the Italian Government entered Rome (20th September 1870),
                    proclaimed the national constitution (9th October 1870), and the Eternal City
                    became the capital of Italy. Thus the scheme of national unity, the natural
                    outcome of the history of Rome and of Italy, impossible of accomplishment under
                    the rule of the popes, was finally achieved by the monarchy of Savoy, which, as
                    the true representative and personification of Italian interests, has abolished
                    the temporal power of the papacy and made Rome the seat of government of the
                    united country. (p. v.)</p>

                <p>PART II.—TOPOGRAPHY AND ARCHAeOLOGY.</p>
                <p>Rome <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The limited space
                    available for the following article is devoted mainly to those buildings of
                    which some remains still exist, to the unavoidable neglect of a large number
                    which are known only from documentary evidence. The plan of the Forum (Plate
                    VII.) and nearly all the cuts have been measured and drawn by the author
                    specially to illustrate this article. </p></note> is situated (41° 53' 52" N.
                    Iat., 12° 28' 40" E. long.) on the banks of the Tiber, Italy, 14 miles from its
                    present mouth, in a great plain of alluvial and marine deposit, broken into
                    elevations by numerous masses of volcanic matter. The nine or ten hills and
                    ridges on which the city stands are formed of masses of tufa or conglomerated
                    sand and ashes thrown out by neighbouring volcanoes now extinct, but active down
                    to a very recent period. One group of these volcanoes is that around Lago
                    Bracciano, while another, still nearer to Rome, composes the Alban Hills. That
                    some at least of these craters have been in a state of activity at no very
                    distant period has been shown by the discovery at many places of broken pottery
                    and bronze implements below the strata of tufa or other volcanic deposits.
                    Traces of human life have even been found below that great flood of lava which,
                    issuing from the Alban Hills, flowed towards the site of Rome, only stopping
                    about 3 miles short, by the tomb of Cecilia Metella.</p>
                <p>The superficial strata on which Rome is built are of three main kinds: (1) the
                    plains and valleys on the left bank of the Tiber are covered, as it were, by a
                    sea of alluvial deposit, in the midst of which (2) the hills of volcanic origin
                    rise like so many islands; and (3) on the right bank of the Tiber, around the
                    Janiculan and Vatican Hills, are extensive remains of an ancient sea-beach,
                    conspicuous in parts by its fine golden sand and its deposits of greyish white
                    potter’s clay. From its yellow sand the Janiculan has been sometimes known as
                    the Golden Hill, a name which survives in the church on its summit called S.
                    Pietro in Montorio (Monte d’Oro). In addition to these three chief deposits, at
                    a few places, especially in the Aventine and Pincian Hills, under-strata of
                    travertine crop out—a hard limestone rock, once in solution in running water,
                    and deposited gradually as the water lost its carbonic-acid solvent, a process
                    still rapidly going on at Terni, Tivoli, and other places in the neighbourhood.
                    The conditions under which the tufa hills were formed have been very various, as
                    is clearly seen by an examination of the rock at different places. The volcanic
                    ashes and sand of which the tufa is composed appear in parts to lie just as they
                    were showered down from the crater; in that case it shows but little sign of
                    stratification, and consists wholly of igneous products. In parts time and
                    pressure have bound together these scoriae into a soft and friable rock; in
                    other places they still lie in loose sandy beds and can be dug out with the
                    spade. Other masses of tufa again show signs either of having been deposited in
                    water, or else washed away from their first resting-place and redeposited with
                    visible stratifications; this is shown by the water-worn pebbles and chips of
                    limestone rock, which form a conglomerate bound together by the volcanic ashes
                    into a sort of natural cement. A third variety is that which exists on the
                    Palatine Hill. Here the shower of red-hot ashes has evidently fallen on a
                    thickly-growin forest, and the burning wood, partly smothered by the ashes, has
                    been converted into charcoal, large masses of which are embedded in the tufa
                    rock. In some places charred branches of trees, their form well preserved, can
                    be easily distinguished. The so-called “wall of Romulus” is built of this
                    conglomerate of tufa and charred wood; a very perfect section of the branch of a
                    tree is visible onone of the blocks by the Scalae Caci.</p>
                <p>So great have been the physical changes in the site of Rome since the first dawn
                    of the historic period that it is difficult now to realize what its aspect once
                    was. The Forum Romanum, the Velabrum, the great Campus Martius (now the most
                    crowded part of modern Rome), and other valleys were once almost impassable
                    marshes or pools of water (0v., <hi rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> vi. 401; Dionys.,
                    ii. 50). The draining of these valleys was effected by means of the great
                    cloacae, which were among the earliest important architectural works of Rome
                    (Vaιτo, <hi rend="italic">Ling. Lat.,</hi> iv. 149). Again, the various hills
                    and ridges were once more numerous and very much more abrupt than they are now.
                    At an early period, when each hill was crowned by a separate village fort, the
                    great object of the inhabitants was to increase the steepness of its cliffs and
                    render access difficult. At a later time, when Rome was united under one
                    government, the very physical peculiarities which had originally made its hills
                    so populous, through their natural adaptability for defence, became extremely
                    inconvenient in a united city, where architectural symmetry and splendour were
                    above all things aimed at. Hence the most gigantic engineering works were
                    undertaken: tops of hills were levelled, whole ridges cut away, and gentle
                    slopes formed in the place of abrupt cliffs. The levelling of the Velia and the
                    excavation of the site for Trajan’s forum are instances of this. The same works
                    were continued in the Middle Ages, as when in the 14th century an access was
                    made to the Capitoline Arx <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>By the great flight of marble steps up to S. Maria in Ara Coeli </p></note>
                    from the side of the Campus Martius; up to that time a steep cliff had prevented
                    all approach except from the side of the Forum.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n831/mode/1up"

                <p>And under the present Government an even more extensive plan, called the “piano
                    regolatore,” is being (1886) gradually carried out, with the object of reducing
                    hills and valleys to one uniform level, on which wide boulevards are being
                    constructed on the chessboard plan of an American city. The constant fires which
                    have devastated Rome have been a great agent in obliterating the natural contour
                    of the ground. The accumulated rubbish from these and other causes has in some
                    places covered the ground to the depth of 40 feet, especially in the
                    valleys.</p>
                <p>The climate of Rome in ancient times appeal's to have been colder than it is at
                    present. Malarious fever in and around the city existed to some extent, but to a
                    much less degree than it does now. The magnificent villa of Hadrian and other
                    country houses near Rome are built on sites which are now very unhealthy. The
                    sanitary superiority of the Campagna in ancient times was mainly due to its more
                    complete drainage and thicker population. That fever did exist is, however,
                    proved in many ways. Altars to the goddess Febris were erected on the Palatine
                    and other hills, and on the Esquiline was a grove dedicated to Mephitis. The
                    population of Rome <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>The chief building materials used in ancient Rome were those enumerated below.
                    (1) 2 ’ w∕α, the “ruber et niger tophus” of Vitruvius (ii. 7), the formation of
                    which has been described above, is usually a warm brown or yellow colour. The
                    Aventine, Palatine, and Capitoline Hills contained quarries of the tufa, much
                    worked at an early period (see Liv., xxvi. 27, xxxix. 44, and Varro, A.Z., iv.
                    151). It is a very bad “weather-stone,” but stands well if protected with stucco
                    (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 48). (2) <hi rend="italic">Lapis
                    Albanus,</hi> from Alba Longa, is also of volcanic origin, a conglomerate of
                    ashes, gravel, and fragments of stone; its quarries are still worked at Albano
                    and Marino. (3) <hi rend="italic">Lapis Gabinus,</hi> from Gabii, is very
                    similar to the last, but harder and a better weather-stone; it contains large
                    lumps of broken lava, products of an earlier eruption, and small pieces of
                    limestone. According to Tacitus <hi rend="italic">[Ann.,</hi> xv. 43), it is
                    fire-proof, and this is also the case with the Alban stone. Both are now called
                    <hi rend="italic">peperino,</hi> from the black scoriae, like peppercorns, with
                    which the brown conglomerate mass is studded. (4) <hi rend="italic">Silex</hi>
                    (mod. <hi rend="italic">selce),</hi> a lava from the now extinct volcanoes in
                    the Alban Hills, was used for paving roads, and when broken into small pieces
                    and mixed with lime and pozzolana formed an immensely durable concrete. It is
                    dark grey, very hard, and breaks with a slightly conchoidal fracture (Plin., <hi
                    rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 29; Vitr., ii. 7), but does not resemble what is
                    now called <hi rend="italic">silex</hi> or flint. (5) <hi rend="italic">Lapis
                    Tiburtimis</hi> (travertine), the chief quarries of which are at Tibur (Tivoli)
                    and other places along the river Anio, is a hard pure carbonate of lime, of a
                    creamy white colour, deposited from running or dripping water in a highly
                    stratified form, with frequent cavities and fissures lined with crystals. As
                    Vitruvius (ii. 5) says, it is a good weather-stone, but is soon calcined by
                    fire. If laid horizontally it is very strong, but if set on end its crystalline
                    structure is a great source of weakness, and it splits from end to end. Neglect
                    on the part of Roman builders of this important precaution in many cases caused
                    a complete failure in the structure. This was notably the case in the rostra
                    (see below). (6) <hi rend="italic">Pulvis Ruteo-lanus</hi> (pozzolana), so
                    called from extensive beds of it at Puteoli, is a volcanic product, which looks
                    like red sandy earth, and lies in enormous beds under and round the city of
                    Rome. When mixed with lime it forms a very strong hydraulic cement, of equal use
                    in concrete, mortar, or undercoats of stucco. It is to this material that the
                    concrete walls of Rome owe their enormous strength and durability, in many cases
                    far exceeding those of the most massive stone masonry. Vitruvius devotes a
                    chapter (bk. ii. ch. 6) to this very important material.</p>
                <p>Bricks were either sun-dried or kiln-baked <hi rend="italic">[lateres crιιdi aui
                    cοcti).</hi> The remarks of Vitruvius (ii. 3) seem to refer wholly to sun-dried
                    bricks, of which no examples now exist in Rome. It is very important to
                    recognize the fact that among the existing ancient buildings of Rome there is no
                    such thing as a brick wall or a brick arch in the true sense of the word; bricks
                    were merely used as a facing to concrete walls and arches and have no
                    constructional importance. Concrete <hi rend="italic">[fartura, eaementum,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">opus structurae caementitiae,</hi> Vitr., ii. 4, 6, 8), the
                    most important of all the materials used, is made of rough pieces of stone or of
                    fragments of brick, averaging from about the size of a man’s fist and embedded
                    in cement made of lime and pozzolana,—forming one solid mass of enormous
                    strength and coherence. Stucco, cement, and mortar <hi rend="italic">[Iectorium,
                    opus albarium, structura testacea,</hi> and other names) are of many kinds; the
                    ancient Romans especially excelled in their manufacture. The cement used for
                    lining the channels of aqueducts <hi rend="italic">[opus signinum)</hi> was made
                    of lime mixed with pounded brick or potsherds and pozzolana; the same mixture
                    was used for floors under the “nucleus” or finer cement on which the mosaic or
                    marble paving-slabs were bedded, and was called <hi rend="italic">eaementum ex
                    testis tunsis.</hi> For walls, three or four coats of stucco were used, often as
                    much as 5 inches thick altogether; the lower coats were of lime and pozzolana,
                    the finishing coats of powdered white marble <hi rend="italic">[opus
                    albarium)</hi> suitable to receive painting. Even marble buildings were usually
                    coated with a thin layer of this fine white stucco, nearly as hard and durable
                    as the marble itself—a practice also employed in the finest buildings of the
                    Greeks—probably because it formed a more absorbent ground for coloured
                    decoration; stone columns coated in this way λvere called “columnae dealbatae”
                    (Cic., <hi rend="italic">In Verr.,</hi> ii. 1, 52 <hi rend="italic">sq. ).</hi>
                    For the kinds of sand used in mortar and stucco Vitruvius (ii. 4) mentions sea,

                <p>Marble appears to have come into use about the beginning of the 1st century B.c.
                    Its introduction was at first viewed with great jealousy, as savouring of Greek
                    luxury. The orator Crassus was the first to use it in his house on the Palatine,
                    built about 92 b.c.; and, though he had only six small columns of Hymettian
                    marble, he was for this luxury nicknamed the “Palatine Venus” by the stern
                    republican M. Brutus (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H. N,</hi> xxxvi. 3). The
                    temporary wooden theatre of the aedile M. Aemilius Scaurus, built in 58 b.c.,
                    appears to have been the first building in which marble was more largely used;
                    its 360 columns and the lower order of its scena were of Greek marble (see
                    Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 3, 24). In a very few years, under
                    the rule of Augustus, marble became very common. <note anchored="true"

                    has probably much truth in it, if for “brick” we read “peperino and tufa.” In
                    the time of Augustus burnt brick was very little used, the usual wall-facings

                    pavements are covered with the richest specimens found during excavations. All
                    the fine marbles in Roman churches have been taken from ancient buildings; an

                <p>Of white statuary marble four principal varieties were used. (1) <hi
                    rend="italic">Marmor Luncnse.</hi> from Luna, near the modern Carrara (Strabo,
                    v.), is of many qualities, from the purest creamy white and the finest grain to
                    the coarser sorts disfigured with bluish grey streaks. (Ex., the eleven
                    Corinthian columns in the Dogana di Terra.) (2) <hi rend="italic">Marmor
                    Hymettium,</hi> from Mount Hymettus, near Athens, is coarser in grain than the
                    best Luna marble and is usually marked with grey or blue striations (Strabo,
                    x.). (Ex., the forty-two columns in the nave of S Maria Maggiore and the columns
                    in S. Pietro in Vincoli.)</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Marmor Pentelicum,</hi> from Mount Pentelicus, also near
                    Athens, is very fine in grain and of a pure white; it was more used for
                    architectural purposes than for statues, though some sculptors preferred it
                    above all others, especially Scopas and Praxiteles (Paus., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arcad.,</hi> viii. ). (Ex., the bust of the young Augustus in the Vatican.)</p>
                <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Marrnor Barium,</hi> from the Isle of Paros, is very
                    beautiful, though coarse in texture, having a very crystalline structure.</p>
                <p>Nine chief varieties of coloured marbles were used in Rome. (1) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marmor Numidieum</hi> (mod. <hi rend="italic">giallo αηtico;</hi> Plin., <hi
                    rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> v. 3), from Numidia and Libya, hence also called <hi
                    rend="italic">Libycum,</hi> is of a rich yellow, deepening to orange and even
                    pink. Enormous quantities of it were used, especially for columns, wall-linings,
                    and pavements. (Ex., six large columns in the Pantheon and seven on the arch of
                    Constantine, taken from the arch of Trajan; the eighth column is in the Lateran
                    basilica.) (2) <hi rend="italic">Marmor Carystium</hi> (mod. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cipollino),</hi> from Carystus in Eubcea (Strabo, x.), has alternate wavy
                    strata of white and pale green—the “undosa Carystos” of Statius <hi
                    rend="italic">[Silν.</hi> , i. 5, 36). From its well-defined layers like an
                    onion <hi rend="italic">[cipolla)</hi> is derived its modern name. (Ex., columns
                    of temple of Faustina. ) (3) <hi rend="italic">Marrnor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Phrygium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">SynnadiCUm</hi> (mod. <hi rend="italic"
                    >pavonazetto),</hi> from Synnada in Phrygia (Strabo, xii.; Juv., xiv. 307;
                    Tibull., iii. 3, 13), is a slightly translucent marble, with rich purple
                    markings, violet verging on red. It was fabled to be stained with the blood of
                    Atys (Stat., <hi rend="italic">Silv.,</hi> i. 5, 36). (Ex., twelve fluted
                    columns in S. Lorenzo fuori Ie Mura, and large columns in the apse of S. Paolo
                    fuori, saved from the ancient nave of the basilica, burnt in 1823.) (4) <hi
                    rend="italic">Marrnor Iasium</hi> (probably the modern <hi rend="italic">porta
                    Santa),</hi> from Iasus, is mottled with large patches of dull red, olive green,
                    and white. The “holy door” of St Peter’s is framed with it, hence its modern
                    name. (Ex., the slabs in front of the Gracostasisand four columns in S. Agnese
                    fuori Ie Mura. ) (5) <hi rend="italic">Marmor Chium</hi> (probably the modern
                    <hi rend="italic">Afrieano),</hi> from Chios, is similar in colour and marking
                    to the porta santa, but more brilliant in tint. (Ex., a great part of the paving
                    of the Basilica Julia and two large columns in the centre of the façade of St
                    Peter’s.) (6) <hi rend="italic">Rosso antico</hi> (the ancient name is unknown)
                    is a very close-grained marble of a rich deep red, like blood. As a rule it does

                    patches of white and brown on a brilliant green ground. It seldom occurs in
                    large masses. (The finest known specimens are the twenty-four columns beside the

                    found on the Palatine, in the baths of Caracalla, and elsewhere. It is
                    semi-transparent, and beautifully marked with concentric nodules and wavy
                    strata. An immense number of other less common marbles have been found,
                    including many varieties of breccia, but their ancient names are unknown.</p>
                <p>From the latter part of the 1st century b.c. hard stones—granites and
                    basalts—were introduced in great quantities. The basalts— “basanites” of Pliny
                    (xxxvi. 11)—are very refractory, and can only be worked by the help of emery or
                    diamond dust. The former was obtained largely at Naxos; diamond-dust drills are
                    mentioned by Pliny <hi rend="italic">{H.N.,</hi> xxxvii. 76). The basalts are
                    black, green, and brown, and are usually free from spots or markings; examples
                    of all three exist, but are comparatively rare. The red variety called
                    “porphyry” was used in enormous quantities. It is the “porphyrites” of Pliny <hi
                    rend="italic">{H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 11), and was brought from Egypt. It has a rich
                    red ground, covered with small specks of white felspar; hence it was also called
                    “Ieptopsephos.” A large number of columns of it exist, and it was much used for
                    pavements of <hi rend="italic">opus Alexandrinum.</hi> A rich green porphyry or
                    basalt was also largely used, but not in such great masses as the red porphyry.
                    It has a brilliant green ground covered with rectangular light green crystals of
                    felspar. This is the <hi rend="italic">lapis Lacedxmoxiixis</hi> (wrongly called
                    by the modern Romans “Serpentino ”), so named from its quarries in Mount
                    Taygetus in Lacedaemonia (Paus., <hi rend="italic">Lac.,</hi> iii. and viii.;
                    Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 11; Juv., xi. 173). It appears to
                    have been mostly used for pavements and panels of wall linings. The granites
                    used in Rome came mostly from near Phike on the Nile (Plin., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Η.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 13). The red sort was called <hi rend="italic">lapis
                    pyrrhopoecilus</hi> and the grey <hi rend="italic">lapis psaronius.</hi> The
                    columns in the Basilica Ulpia are a fine example of the latter; both sorts are
                    used for the columns of the Pantheon and those of the temple of Saturn in the
                    Forum. Gigantic ships were specially made to carry the obelisks and other great
                    monoliths (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 1, 14).</p>
                <p>The style of architecture employed in ancient Rome may be said to have passed
                    through three stages,—the Etruscan, the Greek, and the Roman. During the first
                    few centuries of the existence of the city, both the methods of construction and
                    the designs employed appear to have been purely Etruscan. The earliest temples
                    were either simple cellae without columns, as we see on the Palatine by the
                    Scalae Caci, or else, in the case of the grander temples, such as that of
                    Capitoline Jupiter, the columns were very widely spaced (araeostyle), and
                    consequently had entablatures of wooden beams. The architectural decorations
                    were more generally in gilt bronze or painted terra-cotta than in stone, and the
                    paintings or statues which decorated the buildings were usually the work of
                    Etruscan artists. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pliny
                    (fl <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> .Λ <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ., xxxv. 45),
                    quoting Varro, says that the decorations in painting and sculpture of the temple
                    of Ceres near the Circus Maximus (now S. Maria in Cosmedin) were the work of the
                    first Greek artists employed in Rome, and that before that (c. 493 b.c.) “all
                    things in temples were Etruscan.” Vitruvius (iii. 3) says, “Ornantque signis
                    Actilibus aut aereis inauratis earum fastigia Tuscanico more, uti est ad Circum
                    Maximum Cereris, et Herculis Pompeiani, item Capitolii” (comp. iv. 7, vi. 3).
                    </p></note> The Greek influence is more obvious; almost all the temples of the
                    earlier imperial age are Greek, with certain modifications, not only in general
                    design but in details and ornaments. Greek architects were largely employed; and
                    Roman architects such as Vitruvius and C. Mutius in the 1st century b.c.,
                    Severus and Celer under Nero, and Rabirius under Domitian were Greek by
                    education, and probably studied at Athens (see Vitr., vii., <hi rend="italic"

                    Greek buildings of the best period, e.g., in the lion-tomb at Cnidus and the
                    temple of Zeus at Agrigentum. Surface enrichments over the mouldings were used
                    far more largely by the Romans than by the Greeks. </p></note> The Romans,
                    however, though quite devoid of artistic originality, were very able engineers,
                    and this led to the development of a new and more purely Roman style, in which
                    the restrictions imposed by the use of the stone lintel were put aside and large
                    spaces were covered with vaults and domes cast in semifluid concrete, a method
                    which had the enormous advantage of giving the arched form without the constant
                    thrust at the springing which makes true arches or vaults of wide span so
                    difficult to deal with. The enormous vaults of the great thermae, the basilica
                    of Constantine, and the like cover their spaces with one solid mass like a metal
                    lid, giving the form but not the principle of the arch, and thus allowing the
                    vault to be set on walls which would at once have been thrust apart had they
                    been subjected to the immense leverage which a true arched vault constantly
                    exerts on its imposts. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In the beautiful drawings of Choisy <hi rend="italic">(F Art de bâtir chez
                    les Romains,</hi> Paris, 1873) the structural importance of the brick used in
                    vaults and arches is very much exaggerated. </p></note> This is a very important
                    point, and one which is usually overlooked, mainly owing to the Roman practice
                    of facing their concrete with bricks, which (from an examination of the surface
                    only) appear to be a principal item in the construction. The walls of the
                    Pantheon, for example, are covered with tiers of brick arches, and many theories
                    have been invented as to their use in distributing the weight of the walls. But
                    a recognition of the fact that these walls are of concrete about 20 feet thick,
                    while the brick facing averages scarcely 6 inches in thickness, clearly shows
                    that these ‘ ‘ relieving arches” have no more constructional use as far as
                    concerns the pressure than if they were painted on the surface of the walls.
                    Exactly the same reasons apply to the superficial use of brick in all arches and
                    vaults.</p>
                <p>At first tufa only was used in opus quadratum, as we see in the so-called wall of
                    Romulus. Next the harder peperino began to be worked: it is used, though
                    sparingly, in the great Servian wall, and during the later republic appears to
                    have been largely employed for exterior walls or points where there was heavy
                    pressure, while other parts were built of tufa. Thirdly, travertine appears to
                    have been introduced about the 2d century B. c., but was used at first for
                    merely ornamental purposes, very much as marble was under the empire; after
                    about the middle of the 1st century a.d. travertine began to be largely used for
                    the solid mass of walls, as in the temple of Vespasian and the</p>
                <p>Colosseum. The tufa or peperino blocks were roughly 2 (Ro man) feet thick in
                    regular courses, <hi rend="italic">iso-</hi><hi rend="italic">domum,</hi> by 2
                    feet across the end, and under the republic often exactly 4 feet long, so that
                    two blocks set endways ranged with one set lengthways. They were then arranged
                    in alternate courses of headers and stretchers, so as to make a good bond; this
                    is the ‘ ‘ em-</p>
                <p>plecton” of Vitruvius</p>
                <p>(ii. 8). The so-called</p>
                <p>Tabularium of the</p>
                <p>Capitol is a good example of this (see fig. 1). The harder and more valuable
                    travertine was not cut in this regular way, but pieces of all sizes were used,
                    just as they happened to come from the quarry, in order to avoid waste: blocks
                    as much as 15 by 8 feet were used, and the courses varied in thickness—the
                    “pseudispdomuπι” of Vitruvius. When tufa or peperino was mixed with' the
                    travertine, it was cut so as to range with the irregular courses of the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>It is an interesting point to note the manner in which the Roman builders mixed
                    their different materials according to the weight they had to carry. While tufa
                    was frequently used for the main walls, peperino <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi>

                    inserted at points of special pressure, such as piers or arches (see fig. 21
                    below). The Colosseum is a particularly elaborate example of this mixed
                    construction with three degrees of pressure supported by three different

                    buildings in Rome (see fig.</p>
                <p>11). Under the empire massive blocks, whether of tufa, travertine, or marble, are
                    set without any mortar. It must, however, be observed that in these early
                    instances the “mortar” is but a thin stratum of lime, little thicker than stout
                    paper, used not as a cement to bind the blocks together, but simply to give the
                    joints a smoothly fitting surface. The actual binding together was done by
                    clamps and dowels, as well as by the mass and weight of the great blocks used.
                    Except in the earliest masonry, each block was</p>
                <p>Verycarefully fastened, not only to the next blocks on the same course, which was

                    pointed ends driven into the concrete while it was soft, and worked smooth on
                    the face only (see fig. 3). Thirdly, in the 1st century b.c. opus reticulatum,
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These two kinds of
                    stone facings are mentioned thus by Vitruvius (ii. 8), </p></note> also of tufa,
                    was largely used alone; after that it began to be mixed with brickwork. It is
                    very neat in appearance, and is often fitted with great care, though it was
                    generally covered with stucco. The so-called “house of Livia” on the Palatine is
                    a good example of the earlier sort, when the quoins were made of small
                    rectangular blocks of tufa.</p>
                <p>The palace of Caligula has it with quoins of brick facing. Though in Rome opus
                    reticulatum was always made of tufa, in the neighbourhood of the city it was
                    sometimes of peperino or even lava, where these materials were found on the
                    spot.</p>
                <p>Of concrete walls faced with burnt bricks no dated example 1 earlier than the
                    middle of the 1st century n.c. is known. Thei Pantheon (27 b.c. ) is the most
                    important early specimen of certain date. The bricks used are always triangular
                    in shape, so as to present a large surface on the face with little expenditure
                    of brick, and also to improve the bond with the concrete behind (see fig. 4).
                    Even party walls of small rooms, only 7 inches thick, are not built solid, but
                    have a concrete core faced with brick triangles about 3 inches long. Owing to
                    this method of forming the walls it was necessarily to support the facing until
                    the concrete was set, which appears to have been done with a λvooden framing
                    covered with planks on the inside.</p>
                <p>In some cases the planks were nailed outside the wooden uprights, as was done
                    with the unfaced concrete walls (see below), and then a series of perpendicular
                    grooves appear in the face of the brickwork. Walls faced with opus reticulatum
                    must have been supported temporarily in the same way.</p>
                <p>The character of the brick facing is a great help towards determining the date of
                    Roman buildings; it has been stated that this can be done simply by measuring
                    the number of brick courses that go to a foot,—the more the bricks the earlier
                    the work. This, however, is not the case. In early work the bricks are thick and
                    the joints thin, while in later times the reverse is the case. Thus brickwork of
                    the time of Severus and later usually has more bricks to the foot than that of
                    the Flavian period. The following list gives a few characteristic specimens of
                    different dates.</p>
                <p>The length of the bricks as it appears on the face is no guide to the date, owing
                    to the fact that one or more of the sharp points of the brick triangles were
                    very frequently broken off before they were used. Moreover, varieties both in
                    quality of workmanship and size of the bricks often occur in work of the same
                    date; a new gang of workmen oι ’ a batch of bricks from a fresh <hi
                    rend="italic">figlina</hi> might easily occasion this. In the remains of Nero’s
                    Golden House great varieties appear, and some of the walls in the inferior rooms
                    are faced with very irregular and careless brickwork. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some of the bricks are as muck as 2∣ inches
                    thick, while IJ inche3 is the usual maximum for Roman bricks. </p></note>
                    Special care and neatness were always employed in the rare cases when the wall
                    was not to be covered with stucco, which in the absence of marble was usually
                    spread over both inside and outside walls. All these circumstances make great
                    caution necessary in judging of dates; fortunately after the 1st centuryA.D.,
                    and in some cases even earlier, stamps impressed on bricks, and especially on
                    the largo tiles used for arches, give clearer indications. The reason of tlιo
                    almost universal use of smooth facings either of opus reticulatum or of brick
                    over concrete walls is a very puzzling question; for concrete itself forms an
                    excellent ground for the stucco coating or backing to the marble slabs, while
                    the stucco adheres with difficulty to a smooth facing, and is very liable to
                    fall away. The modern practice of raking out the joints to form a key was not
                    employed by the Romans, but before the mortar was hard they studded the face of
                    the wall with marble plugs and iron or bronze nails driven into the joints, so
                    as to give a hold for the stucco—a great waste both of labour and material.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Roman method of
                    applying stucco to walls with a wooden “float,” ex-1 actly as is done now, is
                    shown in a painting from Pompeiifsee <hi rend="italic">Ann. Inst.,</hi> 1881).
                    </p></note> The quality of the mortar varies according to its date: during the
                    1st and 2d centuries it is of most remarkable hardness,—made of lime with a
                    mixture of coarse pozzolana of a bright red colour; in the 3d century it began
                    to be inferior in quality; and the pozzolana used under the later empire is
                    brown instead of red.</p>
                <p>Concrete was at first always made of lumps of tufa; then travertine, lava, broken
                    bricks, and even marble were used, in fact all the chips and fragments of the
                    mason’s yard. Under the empire the concrete used was of travertine or lava
                    mostly for foundations, of tufa or broken bricks for walls, and of tufa or
                    pumice-stone (for the sake of lightness) for vaults. Massive walls were cast in

                    and 10 to 14 feet long, were set in rows on each face of the future wall; planks
                    9 to 10 inches wide were nailed to them, so as to form two sides of a sort of
                    box, into which the semi-fluid mass of stones, lime, and pozzolana was poured.
                    When this was set the timbers were removed and refixed on the top of the
                    concrete wall; then fresh concrete was poured in; and this process was repeated
                    till the wall was raised to the required height. Usually such cast-work was only
                    used for foundations and cellar walls, the upper parts being faced with brick;
                    but in some cases the whole wall to the top was cast in this way and the brick
                    facing omitted. In strength and durability no masonry, however hard the stone or
                    large the blocks, could ever equal these walls of concrete when made with hard
                    lava or travertine, for each wall was one perfectly coherent mass, and could
                    only be destroyed by a laborious process like that of quarrying hard stone from
                    its native bed. Owing to this method of forming the Roman buildings the progress
                    of the work from day to day can often be traced by a change in the look of the
                    concrete. About 3 feet high appears to have been the average amount of wall
                    raised in a day.</p>
                <p>Marble linings were fixed very firmly to the walls with long clamps of metal,
                    hooked at the end so as to hold in a hole made in the marble slab. Fig. 5 gives
                    an example, of the time of Augustus, fixed against a stone wall.</p>
                <p>The quantity of rich marbles which, for at least three centuries, were being dug

                <p>Scarcely a church is without columns and wall - linings stolen from ancient
                    buildings, and the more magnificent chapels, such as those of the Borghese,
                    Corsini, and Cibo families, with the whole church of S. Maria della Vittoria,
                    owe their splendour entirely to their wall-linings of ancient marbles, porphyry,
                    and alabaster. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Yet for

                    those of modern London, were enacted by several of the emperors. These fixed the
                    materials to be used, the thickness of walls, the minimum width of streets, the
                    maximum height allowed for houses, and the like. After the great fire in Nero’s
                    reign, 64 a,d., an Act was passed requiring external walls to be faced with
                    fire-proof materials, such as peperino or burnt brick; this Act was being
                    prepared long before the fire,—strong evidence as to this being a wilful act on
                    Nero’s part, as is asserted by Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Kero,</hi> 38).</p>
                <p>t Enormous accumulations of statues and pictures enriched Rome &gt;f during its
                    period of greatest splendour. In the first place, the numerous statues of the
                    republican and even of the regal period were religiously preserved at a time
                    when, from their archaic character, they must have been regarded rather as
                    objects of sacred or archaeological interest than as works of art (Plin., <hi
                    rend="italic">H.K,</hi> xxxiv. 9-16, XXXV. 7). Secondly came the large
                    Graeco-Roman class, mostly copies of earlier Greek works, executed in Rome by
                    Greek artists. To this class belongs most of the finest existing sculpture
                    preserved in the Vatican and other museums. Thirdly, countless statues and
                    pictures were stolen from almost every important city in Greece, Magna Graecia,
                    Sicily, and western Asia Minor. These robberies began early, and were carried on
                    for many centuries. The importations included works of art by all the chief
                    artists from the 5th century downwards. Long lists are given by Pliny <hi
                    rend="italic">(H.K.,</hi> xxxiii.-xxxvi. ), and pedestals even now exist with
                    the names of Praxiteles, Timarchus, Polycletus, Bryaxis, and others (see <hi

                    These accumulated works of sculpture were of all materials—gold and ivory
                    (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Tit.,</hi> 2), of which seventy-four are mentioned in

                    untold numbers (Paus., viii. 46). Nor were the accumulated stores of Greek
                    paintings much inferior in number; not only were easel pictures by Zeuxis,
                    Apelles, Timanthes, and other Greek artists taken, but even mural paintings were
                    carefully cut off ’ their walls and brought to Rome secured in wooden frames

                <p>The basalt <hi rend="italic">(silex)</hi> roads were made of polygonal blocks of
                    lava neatly fitted together and laid on a carefully prepared bed, similar to
                    that used for mosaic paving (see Mosaic and Roads). Roads thus made were called
                    “viae stratae.” One portion only exists in Rome of early date, when the blocks
                    were fitted together with the utmost accuracy viz., a piece of the Clivus
                    Capitolinus in front of the temple of Saturn (see fig. 6, which also shows the
                    massive travertine curb which bordered the road; in some cases the curb was of
                    lava). The other best preserved viae stratae in Rome are those leading up to the
                    Palatine from the Summa Sacra Via and that which follows the curved line of
                    shops in Trajan’s forum. Many others exist, but have all been relaid in later
                    times, with badly fitting joints. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Via Flaminia, its first half-mile or so after leaving the Servian Porta Ratumena
                    was known as the Via Lata; it afterwards passed out of the Aurelian P. Flaminia,
                    and with many branches led to the chief towns of Northern Italy, and so into
                    Cisalpine Gaul; (9) Via Aurelia, issued from the trans-Tiberine P. Aurelia and
                    passed through Pisa to Gaul; (10) Via Portuensis, from the gate of that name,

                <p>The most important existing relics of the time when Roman history first begins,
                    though dimly, to take a definite shape are the so-called “wall of Romulus,”
                    forming the circuit of the famous Roma Quadrata of the Palatine. Unfortunately
                    the accounts of the extent of the Pomcerium <hi rend="italic">Postmarvum')</hi>
                    or sacred enclosure give but little help towards defining its circuit. Even its
                    precise nature is a matter of doubt, in spite of the accounts of it given by
                    Varro (Z.i., v. 143), Livy (i. 44), and Dionysius (i. 88), as is usually the
                    case with descriptions in ancient writers of what was in their time purely an
                    archaeological matter. It is, however, certain that the Pomoerium in some way or
                    other followed the circuit of the primitive city, called from its shape Roma
                    Quadrata. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Dionys.,

                    was uncovered and exposed to view (see Plut., <hi rend="italic">Rom.,</hi> 14;

                    Sacellum Laram, and lastly the Forum Romanum. Unfortunately the known points in
                    this description, namely the two fora, are precisely those which mark that part
                    of the circuit known from existing remains of the walls. It is therefore to the
                    scanty relics of the wall which still exist on the other sides that we must turn
                    to determine the extent of Roma Quadrata. These enable us to fix its line along
                    the whole valley of the Velabrum, on the west of the hill, and along the valley
                    of the Circus Maximus as far as the so-called Domus Gelo-tiana, about half-way
                    on the south side (see fig. 17). The doubtful point has been whether the line of
                    the wall from north to south included the whole extent of the hill, or passed
                    across it, along the line of that deep natural valley which once divided the
                    Palatine into two parts, and was in later times filled up and built upon by
                    Domitian in the construction of his great palace. Recent excavations have,
                    however, disclosed at several points the existence of this ancient wall
                    extending along the south-eastern part of the Palatine; moreover, there is
                    strong evidence as to Roma Quadrata being coextensive with the whole hill from
                    Cicero, <hi rend="italic">De Rep.,</hi> ii. 6, and Aul. Gell., xiii. 14. Traces
                    of the wall have been found running eastwards from the Porta Mugonia, and that
                    piece of wall by the Domus Gelotiana which starts to run northwards across the
                    middle of the hill has been found to be merely a projecting spur, which again
                    turns eastwards, so as to include apparently the rest of the Palatine where the
                    palace of Severus now stands.</p>
                <p>The most perfect remains of the Romulean wall are those near the west angle of
                    the hill (see fig. 7). These show that the fortifications of Roma Quadrata were
                    formed in the usual manner of Etruscan cities, in which the natural strength
                    given by cliffs was increased by artificial means. The wall was set neither at
                    the top nor at the foot of the hill, but more than half-way up, a level terrace
                    or shelf all round being cut in the rock on which the base of the wall stood.
                    Above that the hill was cut away into a cliff, not quite perpendicular but
                    slightly “battering” inwards, to give greater stability to the wall, which was
                    built up against it, like a retaining wall, reaching to the top of the cliff,
                    and probably a few feet higher. The stones used in this wall are soft tufa, a
                    warm brown in colour, and full of masses of charred wood. The cutting to form
                    the steep cliff probably supplied part of the material for the wall; and ancient
                    quarries, afterwards used as reservoirs for water, exist in the mass of rock on
                    which the so-called temple of Jupiter Victor stands. It has been asserted that
                    these tufa blocks are not cut but split with wedges; this, however, is not the
                    case. Tufa does not split into rectangular masses, but would be shattered to
                    pieces by a wedge; moreover, distinct tool-marks can be seen on all the blocks
                    whose surface is well preserved and in the quarries themselves. Chisels from
                    one-fourth to three-fourths of an inch in width were used, and also a
                    sharp-pointed pick or hammer. The wall is about 10 feet thick at the bottom, and
                    increases in thickness above as the scarped cliff against which it is built
                    recedes. It is built of blocks laid in alternate courses of headers and
                    stretchers, varying in thickness from 22 to 24 inches, in length from 3 to 5
                    feet, and in width from</p>
                <p>19 to 22 inches. These blocks are carefully worked on their beds, but the face is
                    left rough, and the vertical joints are in some cases open, spaces of nearly
                    2</p>
                <p>inches being left be tween block and block; in other cases the ver tical joints
                    are worked true and close like the beds. The open vertical joints are peculiar
                    to the masonry of this early period; in the wall of</p>
                <p>Servius they always fit closely, at least on the visible face of the wall.</p>
                <p>Nomortarwasused. At two points on the side of the Velabrum (see 8</p>
                <p>and 9 on the plan of the</p>
                <p>Palatine, fig. 17) wind ing passages are exca vated in the tufa cliff, the
                    entrance to which was once closed by the ancient wall. One of these (No. 8) in
                    early times (before water in abundance was brought to the Palatine on aqueducts)
                    was used as a reservoir to collect surface water, probably for use in case of
                    siege; circular shafts for buckets are cut downwards through the rock from the
                    top of the hill; fig. 7 shows it in section. An exactly similar rock-cut cistern
                    with vertical shafts, of very early date, exists at Alba Longa. Opposite the
                    church of S. Teodoro a series of buttresses belonging to the wall of Romulus
                    exists, partly concealed by a long line of buildings of the later years of the
                    republic and the early empire, to make room for which the greater part of the
                    then useless wall was pulled down, and only fragments left here and there, where
                    they could be worked into the walls of the later houses.</p>
                <p>Three accesses only to the ancient city can now be traced. One is the so-called
                    Scalae Caci, a long sloping ascent cut through the rock (see fig. 17) from the
                    side of the Circus Maximus; some remains of the earliest wall still exist along
                    the sides of this steep ascent or staircase. The upper part of this has remains
                    of a basalt pavement, added in later times, probably covering the more ancient
                    rock-cut steps. The name of the gate which led at this point into Roma Quadrata
                    is unknown. The only two gates whose name and position can be (with any degree
                    of probability) identified are the Porta Romanulaand the Porta Mugionis (Plin.,
                    <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> iii. 5, 9). The former of these, called Porta
                    Romana by Festus (ed. Müller, p. 262), was at the foot of the Clivus Victoriae
                    (see fig. 17), at the angle next the Forum Romanum. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The present entrance to Caligula’s palace is
                    probably exactly on the site of the ancient Porta Romana. </p></note> According
                    to Festus it was so called by the Sabines of the Capitol because it was their
                    natural entrance to Roma Quadrata (see also Varro, Z.i., v. 164, vi. 24). The
                    original approach to it was by a road running up the lower extra-mural part of
                    the hill from the direction of the Velabrum. In later times a more direct ascent
                    to it was made from the Forum by a flight of steps, probably the Scalae
                    Anulariae of Suetonius <hi rend="italic">{Aug., Ί2</hi>; see figs. 16 and 17 and
                    plan of the Forum, Plate VII.). The lower part of these stairs, now buried under
                    S. Maria Libératrice, is shown in the marble plan of Rome; the upper part, that
                    from the Nova Via to the Clivus Victoriae, still exists, and has recently been
                    exposed. Traces of the Porta Mugionis or Mugonia (see Sol., i. 24) have been
                    discovered near the temple of Jupiter Stator, where a basalt paved road leads up
                    into the Palatine from the Summa Sacra Via and the Summa Nova Via, which join
                    near the arch of Titus; exposure to weather has now destroyed the soft tufa
                    blocks of which this gate was built. This is probably the “veterem Jtortam
                    Palatii” of Livy (i. 12) through which the Romans fled when defeated by the
                    Sabines. A third entrance, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the east side is precipitous. The buildings of the emperors have, however, made
                    such radical changes in the form of the ground that any degree of certainty on
                    this point is impossible. This third gate, according to Varro, who mentions
                    (Z.Z., v. 164-5) all three, was called Janu-alis. <note anchored="true"

                <p>The most important remains of the regal period are the great wall, principally
                    the work of Servius Tullius, by which he included within one circuit the
                    separately fortified hills which were then inhabited,—the Palatine, Capitoline,
                    Aventine, Quirinal, and Ccelian, and added two more, the Esquiline and Viminal.
                    These seven hills formed the Septimontium <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Atan early date the term “Septimontium" Iiadadifferent

                    L.,</hi> iv. 41, vi. 24). Of even earlier date was the fort (Liv., i. 33) on the
                    top of the Jani-culum, connected by walls with the Pons Sublicius, some massive
                    foundations of which still exist, though now buried near the church of S. Pietro
                    in Montorio. Existing remains show that the great wall is of more than one date;
                    part is probably earlier than Servius, and may be remains of the wall which,
                    according to Livy (i. 36, 38) and Dionysius (iii. 37), was planned and in part
                    carried out by Tarquinius Priscus; it would seem impossible that a work of such
                    gigantic magnitude could have been begun and completed in the lifetime of one
                    man. It should, however, be remembered that a complete circuit of new wall was
                    not required in this undertaking; each, probably, of the five hills first
                    inhabited had its own fortifications, and these were utilized in the line of the
                    new avail. The space thus included was divided by Servius for political,
                    military, and religious purposes into four regiones ( Varro, <hi rend="italic"
                    >L. L.,</hi> v. 46-54)— (1) the Suburana, including the Coelian, and probably
                    most of its adjacent valleys, with the Subura, the Carinae, and part of the
                    Esquiline—the derivation of Suburana from <hi rend="italic">sub urbe</hi> is
                    from Junius, quoted by Varro; (2) Esquilina, the main part of the Esquiline,
                    including the Oppius and Cispius (es-quil-iae, dwellings <hi rend="italic"
                    >outside,</hi> cf. in-quil-inus); (3) Collina, the Viminal and Quirinal, which
                    were called “colles” in contradistinction to the other five hills, which were
                    called “montes”; (4) Palatina, the Palatine and its adjacent spurs, the Velia
                    and Germalus. It will be observed that these four regiones do not include the
                    Aventine, the Capitol, and some of their adjacent valleys,—an omission for which
                    it is not easy to account. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Becker suggests <hi rend="italic">(Handbuch,</hi> i. 386) that the
                    Capitoline Hill was excluded on account of its sacred character, while the
                    Aventine was not yet thickly populated, and the Janiculum was only occupied by
                    the fort; see also <hi rend="italic">Ann. Inst.,</hi> 1861, p. 61.

                <p>Excavations of the last fifteen years have done much to determine the line of the
                    Servian wall (see Plate VI.), especially the great works undertaken in laying
                    out a new quarter of the city on the Quirinal, Esquiline, and Viminal, which
                    have laid bare and then mostly destroyed long lines of wall, especially along
                    the agger. Beginning from the Tiber, which the Servian wall touched at a point
                    near the present Ponte Rotto, and separating the Forum Olitorium (outside) from
                    the Forum Boarium (inside), it ran in a straight line to the Capitoline Hill,
                    the two crests of which, the Capitolium and the Arx, with the intermediate
                    valley the Asylum, were surrounded by an earlier fortification, set (Dionys.,
                    ix. 68) eτrt <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">0φοLs . . . καl πέτραι,ς
                    άττοτόμοις.</hi> In this short space there were three gates,—(1) the Porta
                    Flumentana next the river (see Cic., <hi rend="italic">Ad Att.,</hi> vii. 3;
                    Liv., xxxv. 19, 21); (2) Porta Triumphalis, site unknown and usually only
                    mentioned in connexion with triumphal processions (see Cic., <hi rend="italic"
                    >In Pis.,</hi> 23; Joseph., <hi rend="italic">BM. JuJ,</hi> vii. 5, 4),— it was
                    probably not used except on the occasion of triumphs; (3) Porta Carmentalis,
                    close to the Capitolium. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Sol., i. 13; Liv., ii. 49, xxiv. 47, xxv. 7; Ascon., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ad Cic. in Toga,</hi> p. 90, Orelh </p></note> From the Capitoline Hill the
                    wall passed to the Quirinal along a spur of elevated ground, afterwards
                    completely cut away by Trajan. Close to the Capitol was the gate afterwards
                    called the Porta Ratumena, whence issued the Via Lata (Plut., <hi rend="italic"
                    >In Publ.,</hi> 13; Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> viii. 42). Remains of
                    the wall and foundations of the gate exist in Via di Marforio, Nos. 81 C and 81
                    E. After passing Trajan’s forum, the first remains of the walls are on the slope
                    of the Quirinal in the Colonna gardens. Near the foot of the Quirinal was the
                    Porta Fontinalis (Liv., XXXV. 10). A piece of the wall has been exposed in the
                    new Via Nazionale, and also an archway under the Palazzo Antonelli, which has
                    been thought to be the Porta Fontinalis. This arch is, however, only 6 feet 6
                    inches wide and (to the springing of the arch) 5 feet high, which seems too
                    small for one of the principal gates. The Porta Sanqualis (see Festus, ed.
                    Müller, p. 345) was also on the Quirinal, probably on the slope between the
                    Trevi fountain and the royal palace. Its position is indicated by the existence
                    of some tombs which give the line of the road. On the north-west of the Quirinal
                    was the Porta Salutaris (Festus, p. 327; Liv., ix. 43), probably near the
                    “Quattro Fontane.” In the Barberini palace gardens, and especially in those of
                    the ViUa Bar-berini (Horti Sallustiani), extensive remains of the wall have been
                    recently exposed and destroyed,—which was also the fate of that fine piece of
                    wall that passed under the new office of finance, with the Porta Collina, which
                    was not on the line of the present road, but about 50 yards to the south (see
                    Dionys., ix. 68; Strabo, v. 3). Thus far in its course from the Capitol the wall
                    skirted the slopes of hills, which were once much more abrupt than they are now;
                    but from the Porta Collina to the Porta Esquilina it crossed a large tract of
                    level ground; and here, by the construction of his great agger, Servius gained
                    the strength which elsewhere was given by the natural formation of the hills.
                    The whole line of this agger has been recently traced and mostly destroyed.
                    About the middle of it the Porta Viminalis was found in 1872; it stood, as
                    Strabo says, <hi rend="italic">υπό μiσω τφ χώματι,</hi> and from it led a road
                    which passed through the Porta Chiusa (ancient name unknown) in Aurelian’s wall.
                    Foundations of the Porta Esquilina were found in 1876 close behind the arch of
                    Gallienus. The further course of the wall across the valley of the Colosseum,
                    with its Porta Querquetulana and Porta Ccelimontana, probably a little beyond,
                    is the least known part of the circuit. Hence the wall skirts the slopes of the
                    Ccelian to the valley along which the Via Appia passed through the Porta Capena,
                    near the church of S. Gregorio. Its line along the Aventine is fairly distinct,
                    and near S. Balbina and in the Vigna Torlonia are two of the best-preserved
                    pieces,—the former 11 courses high (22 feet), the latter 25 (50 feet). Under the
                    Aventine it appears to have touched the river near the existing foundations
                    supposed to be those of the Pons Sublicius. The Porta Trigemina was close by the
                    bank. Hence to our starting-point the river formed the defence of the city, with
                    its massive quay wall, —the <hi rend="italic">κά\η &amp;κτη</hi> of Plutarch <hi
                    rend="italic">(born.,</hi> 20). A fragmentary passage of Varro <hi rend="italic"
                    >(L. L.,</hi> v. 163) mentions two other gates, Naevia and Rauduscula, “the
                    bronze gate,” but their positions are unknown. The site of the Porta Navalis is
                    also very doubtful; it was probably not in the Servian wall.</p>
                <p>The wall is built of blocks of tufa, usually the softer kinds, but varying
                    according to its position, as in most cases the stone used was that quarried on
                    the spot. In some places a good deal of peperino is used. The blocks average
                    from 23 to 24 inches in thickness—roughly 2 Roman feet—and are laid in alternate
                    courses of headers and stretchers. The best preserved piece of wall—that on the
                    Aventine in the Vigna Torlonia—has one complete arch and the starting of
                    another; their sills are about 34 feet from the ground outside, and probably
                    level with the ground inside (see fig. 8).</p>
                <p>These arches, though built of the harder stone, are not later insertions, but are
                    contemporary with the wall itself. The blocks, both beds and Verticaljoints, are
                    very carefully worked and set in mortar; in most cases they are bevelled round
                    the joints. Some blocks are of great length, — <hi rend="italic">άμάξιοι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">ιθoι</hi> Dionysius calls them. At this
                    place the wall is backed with a thick mass of concrete; the use of the arched
                    openings is doubtful: they may have been embrasures for catapults. The
                    discoveries of recent years have shown the correctness of the description given
                    by Dionysius (ix. 68) of the great agger, with its wall and foss, begun by the
                    earlier kings and completed by the last Tarquin. Fig. 9 shows it in section; the
                    earth taken from the foss (which was IOO feet wide at the bottom by 30 deep) was
                    heaped up to form the agger, and was kept in its position by a lofty retaining
                    wall on the front and a lower one behind. The outer wall was in places
                    strengthened with massive buttresses closely set, or with towers; in other
                    places it had no projections. The back wall, the position of which shows the
                    thickness of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n839/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0839-0814"/>agger, is in parts about 33 feet from the front
                    one, but it varies in this respect; in other parts the agger appears to have
                    been more than 50 feet thick. Between the railway station and the Dogana a fine
                    lofty piece of the front wall remains, with traces of the Porta Viminalis and of
                    the lower back wall. Unfortunately the whole of the bank or agger proper has
                    been removed, and the rough back of the great retaining wall exposed. Both tufa
                    and peperino are used; the blocks vary in length, but average in depth the usual
                    2 Roman feet. The railway cutting which has destroyed a great part of the agger
                    showed clearly the section of the whole work: the strata of different kinds of
                    soil which appeared on the sides of the foss appeared again in the agger, but
                    reversed as they naturally would be in the process of digging out and heaping
                    up. Dionysius (ix. 68) states the length of the agger to have been 7 stadia—that
                    is, about 1400 yards—which agrees (roughly speaking) with the actual
                    discoveries. Originally one road ran along the bottom of the foss and another
                    along its edge; the latter existed in imperial times. But the whole foss appears
                    to have been filled up, probably in the time of Augustus, and afterwards built
                    upon; houses of mixed brick and opus reticulatum still exist against the outside
                    of the great wall, which was itself used as the back wall of these houses, so
                    that we now see painted stucco of the time of Hadrian covering parts of the wall
                    of the kings. Another row of houses seems to have faced the road mentioned above
                    as running along the upper edge of the foss, thus forming a long street. As
                    early as the time of Augustus a very large part of the wall of the kings had
                    been pulled down and built over, so that even then its circuit was difficult to
                    trace (Dionys., iv. 13). A very curious series of masons’ marks exists on the
                    buildings of the regal period, es pecially on the stones of the agger wall and
                    those of the small cellae on the Palatine near the Scalae Caci.</p>
                <p>They are deeply incised, usually on the ends of the blocks, and aver age from 10

                    of sewers exists under a great part of the Servian city. Some of these are not
                    built with arched vaults, but have triangular tops formed of courses of stone on
                    level beds, each projecting over the one below,—a very primitive method of
                    construction, employed in the Tullianum (see fig. 11). The great quay wall of
                    tufa and peperino which lined both banks of the Tiber for a ∣ considerable
                    distance also belongs to the regal period, and was a work of gι∙eat solidity and
                    strength; it is noAv mostly destroyed by the action of the river. In later times
                    this massive wall was extended, as the city grew, all along the bank of the
                    Campus Martiusand, having lost its importance as a line of defence, had frequent
                    flights of stairs built against it, descending to the river. Some of these are
                    shown in one of the fragments of the marble plan (see Jordan, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Forum Romanum or Magnum, as it was called in late times to distinguish it
                    from the imperial fora, occupies a valley which extends from the foot of the
                    Capitoline Hill to the north-east part of the Palatine. Till the construction of
                    the great cloacae it was, at least in wet seasons, marshy ground, in which were
                    several pools of water. In early times it was bounded on two sides by rows of
                    shops and houses, dating from the time of the first Tarquin (Liv., i. 35). The
                    shops on the south-west side facing the Sacra Via, where the Basilica Julia
                    afterwards was built, were occupied by the Tabernae Veteres. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Livy (xliv. 16), who
                    mentions a house of P. Africanus, “pone veteres ad Vortumni signum,” which was
                    bought by T. Sempronius to clear the site for the Basilica Sempronia in 169 b.c.
                    This basilica appears to have been afterwards absorbed in the Basilica Julia.
                    </p></note> The shops on the northern side, being occupied by silversmiths, were
                    called Tabernae Argentariae (see Liv., xxvi. 27, xl. 51), and in later times,
                    when rebuilt after a fire, were called Tabernae Novae. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence these two sides of the Forum are
                    frequently referred to in classical writings as “sub veteribus” and “sub novis.”
                    </p></note> An altar to Saturn (Dionys., i. 34, vi. 1), traditionally set up by
                    the companions of Hercules, and an altar to Vulcan, both at the end towards the
                    Capitol, with the temple of Vesta and the Regia at the opposite end, were among
                    the earliest monuments grouped around the Forum. The Lacus Curtius vanished, as
                    Varro says (Z.Z., v. 148-149), probably with other stagnant pools, when the
                    cloacae were constructed (Liv., i. 38, 56). <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In later times it appears to have been an enclosed space
                    containing an altar; it is described by Ovid <hi rend="italic">(Fast.,</hi> vi.
                    403); according to one tradition it marked the spot where Curtius’s
                    self-immolation filled up the chasm which had opened in the Forum (see Dionys.,
                    ii. 41). </p></note> Another pool, the Lacus Servilius, near the Basilica Julia,
                    was preserved in some form or other till the imperial period. Under Sulla it was
                    used as a place to expose the heads of many senators murdered in his
                    proscriptions (Cic., <hi rend="italic">Rose. Am.,</hi> 32; Seneca, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Prov.,</hi> 3). The Vulcanal or Hephaesteum was an open area,
                    so called from the early altar to Vulcan, and was (like the Comitium) a place of
                    public meeting, at least during the regal period. <note anchored="true"

                    on the lower slope of the Capitoline Hill behind the arch of Severus; but its
                    exact form and position are very doubtful. It was probably much encroached upon
                    when the temple of Concord was enlarged in the reign of Augustus.</p>

                <p>Unlike the fora of the emperors, each of which was surrounded by a lofty wall and
                    built at one time from one design, the architectural form of the Forum Romanum
                    was a slow growth. The marshy battle-field of the early inhabitants of the
                    capitol and Palatine became, when the ground was drained by the great cloacae,
                    under a united rule the most convenient site for political meetings, for

                <p>The Curia or senate-house passed through many vicissitudes. At first called Curia
                    Hostilia from its founder Tullus Hostilius (Liv., i. 30), it lasted till 52 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when it was burnt at the funeral of Clodius, and was
                    then rebuilt by the son of Sulla, and from his gens called Curia Cornelia (Dion
                    Cass., xl. 50; Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxiv. 12). It was again
                    rebuilt by Augustus (29 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> under the name of the
                    Curia Julia, as recorded in the inscription of Ancyra (see Angora)—CVRiAM. <hi

                    and Chalcidicum; Dion Cassius (Ii. 22) mentions the group. In the reign of
                    Domitian the Curia Julia was again rebuilt (Prosp. Aquit., p. 571), and lastly
                    by Diocletian. There is strong evidence to show that the existing church of S.
                    Adriano is the Curia of Diocletian, though of course much altered, and with its
                    floor raised about 20 feet above the old level. Fig. 12 shows the front existing
                    towards the Forum, omitting later windows and doors. As late as the time of Du
                    Perac ( <hi rend="italic">Vesiigj di Roma)</hi> the old entrance and level were
                    preserved. He gives a drawing <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    enriched mouldings in stucco, and the sham marble facing, also of stucco, if
                    compared with similar details in the baths of Diocletian, leave little doubt as
                    to this being a work of his time, and not, as has been usually assumed, the work
                    of Pope Honorius I., who (625-633 A.D.) consecrated it as the church of S.
                    Adriano.</p>
                <p>From the Curia a flight of steps led down to the Co-mitium (Liv., i. 36), the
                    level of which appears from the existing steps and pavement near the arch of
                    Severus (see Plate VII.) to have been about 2 feet below that of the Forum, and
                    not above it, as Bunsen and others have asserted. On the Comitium stood the
                    ancient rostra till they were rebuilt on a new site by Julius Caesar in 44 B.c.
                    The ancient rostra were so called in 338 b.c., when Camillus and Mcenius
                    defeated the Latin fleet at Antium, and the beaks (rostra) of the captured ships
                    were fixed to an existing platform on the Comitium for orators. It was also
                    called a “templum” because the structure was consecrated by the augurs (Cic.,
                    <hi rend="italic">De Orat.,</hi> iii. 3). Other rostra, named for distinction
                    Rostra Julia, were so called from the beaks of ships taken at Actium and affixed
                    by Augustus to the podium of the temple built by him in honour of the deified
                    Julius. Both are mentioned by Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Aug.,</hi> 100).
                    There were several other platforms or tribunals for orators in and about the
                    Forum, but they were not called rostra. From the original rostra Cicero
                    delivered his <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Third Catiline
                    Orations,</hi> and they were the scene of some of the most important political
                    struggles of Rome, such as the enunciation of their laws by the Gracchi. Beside
                    the Comitium another monument was erected, also adorned with beaks of ships, to
                    commemorate the same victory at Antium. This was the Columna Moenia, so called
                    in honour of Mcenius (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxiv. 11, vii. 60).
                    The Columna Duilia was a similar monument, erected in honour of the victory of
                    C. Duilius over the Punic fleet in 260 B. c.; a fragment of it with inscription
                    (restored in imperial times) is preserved in the Capitoline Museum.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The column itself is a copy
                    made by Michelangelo; it is at the foot of the stairs of the Palazzo dei
                    Conservatori. </p></note> Columns such as these were called “columnae
                    rostratae.”</p>
                <p>Near the Comitium, on the side towards the Capitol, was the Graecostasis, a
                    platform where foreign ambassadors stood to hear the speeches (see Varro, <hi
                    rend="italic">loc. cit. <hi rend="superscript">y</hi> ).</hi> It appears
                    probable that, like the rostra, the Graecostasis was moved in the 1st century
                    b.c.; and this name has been given with some probability to the curved
                    marble-faced platform behind the existing rostra.</p>
                <p>The Senaculum appears to have been a place of preliminary meeting for the Senate
                    before entering the Curia (Liv., xli. 27; Val. Max., ii. 2, 6); it adjoined the
                    temple of Concord, and when this was rebuilt on an enlarged scale in the reign
                    of Augustus it appears probable that its large projecting portico became the
                    Senaculum (Dionys., i. 34, vi. 1). It may possibly have once been identical with
                    the Area Concordhe mentioned by Livy (xl. 19) in connexion with the Area Vulcani
                    (comp, xxxix. 46).</p>
                <p>A great part of the north-east side of the Foram was occupied by a. two
                    basilicae, which were more than once rebuilt under different names. The first of
                    these appears to have been adjacent to the Curia, on its south side; it was
                    called the Basilica Porcia, and was founded by the elder Cato in 184 b.c. (see
                    Liv., xxxix. 44, and Plut., <hi rend="italic">Cato Major,</hi> 19); it was burnt
                    with the Curia at Clodius’s funeral. Adjoining it another basilica, called
                    Aemilia et Fulvia (A arro, vi. 4), was built in 176 b.c. by the censors M.
                    Fulvius and M. Aemilius Lepidus; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Livy (xl. 51),</p>
                <p>“post argentarias novas,” the line of silversmiths’ shops along the north-east
                    side of the Forum. In 50 b.c. it was rebuilt by L. Aemilius Paulus (Plut., <hi
                    rend="italic">Caes.,</hi> 29; Appian, <hi rend="italic">Bell. Civ.,</hi> ii.
                    26), and was more than once restored within the few subsequent years by members
                    of the same family. Its later name was the Basilica Pauli, and it was remarkable
                    for its magnificent columns of Phrygian marble (Plin., <hi rend="italic"
                    >H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 24) or pavonazetto.</p>
                <p>Near the middle of the north-east side of the Forum stood also Ί the small bronze

                    brass of Nero shows it as a small cella, with richly ornamented frieze and
                    cornice. Another aedicula near that of Janus was the shrine of Venus Cloacina
                    (or the Purifier), probably on the line of the great cloaca (Liv., iii. 48;
                    Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xv. 36). Two or more other shrines of Janus
                    stood on this side, behind the shops of the money-lending argentarii; and the
                    word “Janus” was used to imply the place ofusurers (Hor., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sat.,</hi> ii. 3, 18).</p>
                <p>So far the buildings mentioned have been mostly those whose sites are still
                    buried under the line of modern houses on the northeast of the Forum, the only
                    part which has not yet been excavated. Turning to those of which existing
                    remains are visible, at the north-west end the rostra of Julius Caesar mark the
                    limit of the Forum in this direction, as the arch of Fabius beside the temple of
                    Faustina did in the other.</p>
                <p>Plate VII. shows the plan of the rostra, with the curved Graecostasis 1 behind
                    it. It is an oblong platform about 78 feet long and 11 feet ι high above the
                    level of the Forum; its ground floor, paved with herring-bone bricks, is 2 feet
                    6 inches below the Forum paving. Its end and side walls are of tufa blocks, 2
                    feet thick and 2 feet wide, each carefully clamped to the next with wooden
                    dovetail dowels. Its floor was supported by a series of travertine piers,
                    carrying travertine lintels, on which the floor slabs rested (see fig. 13).
                    Outside it was completely lined with Greek marble and had a richly moulded
                    plinth and cornice; none of the latter is <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> but
                    many pieces lie scattered around. A groove cut in the top of the cornice shows
                    the place where marble cancelli were fixed; one of the cornice blocks is partly
                    without this groove, showing that the screen did not extend along the whole
                    front of the rostra. This agrees with a relief on the arch of Constantine,
                    representing the emperor making an oration from the rostra, with other buildings
                    at this end of the Forum shown behind.</p>
                <p>In this relief the screen is shown with a break in the middle, so that the
                    orator, standing in tho centre, was visible from head to foot. Two tiers of
                    large holes to hold the bronze rostra are drilled right through the tufa wall,
                    and even through the travertine pilasters where one happens to come in the way;
                    these holes show that there were nineteen rostra in the lower tier, and twenty
                    above set over the intermediate spaces of the lower row. The back -wall of the
                    rostra is of concrete faced with brick, which, being probably the work of Julius
                    Caesar in 44 b.c., is the earliest dated example of brickwork in Rome. The
                    inside space, under the main floor of the rostra, is coated thickly with
                    stucco,—the brick wall being studded in the usual way with iron nails to form a
                    key for the plaster.</p>
                <p>In spite of the assertions of Bunsen, Jordan, and others that the <hi
                    rend="superscript">ι</hi> curved platform behind (conjecturally called the
                    Graecostasis) is a work of late date, it is evident from various constructional
                    points, visible at the junction of the two structures, that it existed before
                    the rostra, which when built completely hid its rich lining and the pilasters of
                    porta santa marble which decorated its front,—very strong evidence as to the
                    curved platform being earlier in date. The level </p>

                <p>of the top of this platform and that of the rostra appear to have coincided
                    exactly, so that the whole formed one continuous marble-paved platform, and the
                    rostra would be reached, not by steps, but from the higher ground towards the
                    Capitol, from which access is given to the curved platform and so on to the
                    floor of the rostra. The bronze rostra on this structure of 44 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> were believed to be the original beaks from Antium,
                    moved from the old rostra (Floras, i. 11). On its marble platform stood many
                    statues, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The original
                    rostra had specially honorary statues to those Roman ambassadors who had been
                    killed while on foreign service (Liv., iv. 17); these were probably removed
                    during Cicero’s lifetime (Cic., <hi rend="italic">Phil.,</hi> ix. 2; see also
                    Dion Cass., xliii. 49, and Plin., <hi rend="italic">Η.N.,</hi> xxxiv. 11).
                    Ghastly ornaments fixed to these rostra in the year 43 b.c., shortly after they
                    were built, were the head and hands of the murdered Cicero (Appian, <hi

                    on the original rostra had been fixed many heads of the chief victims of the

                    was once supposed to have a representation of the rostra on its reverse, but it
                    is now generally admitted that the subject is a harbour containing ships, the
                    beaks of which only are shown. Even if the rostra of the Forum are represented

                    statues proving too much for the travertine piers, which are not set on their
                    natural beds but endways, and therefore are very weak, the structure seems to
                    have given way at more than one time and the floor has been supported by piers
                    and arches of brick-faced concrete, inserted either in place of or at the sides
                    of the shattered piers. These later additions, apparently of the 3d and 4th
                    centuries, are omitted in Plate VΠ. for the sake of clearness. The moulded
                    plinth of the curved platform is of Pentelic marble, some of the blocks of which
                    are incised with masons’ marks, namely, the Greek letters Γ, Δ, E, Z, H, Θ, and
                    K. A number of metal pins on the face of the slabs of porta sauta marble which
                    line its front show that emblemata or reliefs, probably of gilt bronze, were
                    once fastened to the marble. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    it appears possible that this is the Graecostasis, transferred, like the rostra,

                    to show that in later times the Graecostasis had some roofed porticus or shelter
                    and was not a mere open platform as it was originally.</p>
                <p>At the northern end of the curved platform there is a cylindrical structure of
                    concrete faced with brick, and lined with thin marble slabs; it is in three
                    stages, each diminishing in size, and appears to be an addition of about the
                    time of Severus. This is usually identified with the Umbilicus Romae, or central
                    point of the city, mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Notitia</hi> and the
                    Einsiedeln MS. (see Preller, -BegZone??, Reg. viii.). According to another
                    theory it is the base of the gilt statue of the Genius Populi Romani set up by
                    Aurelian; but this is contradicted by the form of the structure, which is not
                    that of the pedestal of a statue. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Aureum, a marble column sheathed in gilt bronze and inscribed with the names and

                    gates of Rome (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N,</hi> iii. 9). It was set up by
                    Augustus in 29 b.c. and its position “sub aede Saturai” is indicated by Tacitus

                    indications, being near the start of the Vicus Jugarius, and close under the
                    temple of Saturn. Fragments of a curved marble plinth and frieze with floriated
                    reliefs, now lying in the Basilica Julia, probably belonged to the pedestal of

                    dictator, 501B.c.; but Dionysius (vi. 1) and Livy (ii. 21) attribute it to the
                    consuls A. Sempronius and Al. AIinucius in 497 b.c. It was rebuilt on a larger
                    scale by AIunatius Plancus in the reign of Augustus (Suet., <hi rend="italic"

                    belongs to the last rebuilding in the time of Diocletian. Some of these fine
                    columns are evidently earlier than this rebuilding, but were refixed with rude
                    caps and bases. One of the columns is set wrong way up, and the whole work is of
                    the most careless sort. Part of the inscription, once inlaid with bronze,
                    recording this latest rebuilding still exists on the entablature (see Gori, <hi

                    of the Capitolium (see Liv., xxxv. 21) and on to the Porta Cannen-talis. It was
                    spanned at its commencement by a brick-faced arch lined with marble, the lower

                    stories high, on the south-west side. These rooms, of which considerable remains
                    exist, are built of tufa with travertine pilasters and bands in the tufa wall.
                    This part probably is of the time of Julius Caesar; Augustus surrounded it with
                    an arcade of arches in two stories and engaged Tuscan columns in Luna marble,

                    Suetonius <hi rend="italic">{Cal.,</hi> 37) mentions that it was one of
                    Caligula’s amusements to throw money to the people below from the roof of this
                    basilica, which probably was a link in the bridge by which this maniac connected
                    the Palatine with the Capitolium. ' The line of the bridge, which starts in the
                    upper part of Caligula’s palace, passes over a lofty and massive brick-faced
                    building, once lined with marble, which stands on the lower slopes of the
                    Palatine. Suetonius’s account (C⅛Z., 22) of the bridge makes it very probable
                    that this building is the temple of Augustus, as there is no other possible site
                    for it on the line from the Palatine to the Capitolium. The intermediate stages
                    from the temple to the basilica and thence to the Capitolium were probably
                    merely a wooden structure, as no traces of it now remain. The temple of Augustus
                    was begun by Tiberius and finished by Caligula (Suet., <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Regillus, 496 b.c., and was dedicated in 482 b. c. by the son of A. Postumus
                    (Liv., ii. 20, 42; Dionys., vi. 13; Plut., <hi rend="italic">Coriol.,</hi> 3;
                    Ov., <hi rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> i. 707). In 119 b.c. it was restored by the
                    consul L. Metellus Dalmaticus (Ascon., <hi rend="italic">In Cic. Pro
                    Scaur.,</hi> 46) and finally rebuilt in the reign of Augustus by Tiberius and
                    Drusus, 6 A.n. (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Tib.,</hi> 20; Ov., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fast.,</hi> i. 705; Dion Cass., lv. 8, 27), to which period belong the three
                    existing Corinthian columns and piece of entablature, all very delicate and
                    graceful in detail, and of the finest workmanship, in Pentelic marble; the
                    design is of pure Greek style. One point shows Roman timidity in the use of a
                    lintel: the frieze is jointed so as to form a flat arch, quite needlessly, with
                    the object of relieving the weight on the architrave. Its plan, hexastyle, with
                    only eleven columns on the sides, is shown in Plate VII. and fig. 14. It had a
                    lofty podium, lined with marble, and decorated with a heavy cornice and
                    pilasters, one under each column. The podium is an interesting example of the
                    enormous solidity of Roman buildings of the best period. Solid tufa walls, 8
                    feet thick, are built under the whole of the cella and the front row of columns,
                    while the columns of the sides rest on spurs of similar walling, projecting at
                    right angles from that under the cella; the part immediately under the columns
                    is of travertine, and the spurs are united and strengthened laterally by massive
                    flat arches, also of travertine. With the exception of a small chamber under the
                    steps, entered from the Vicus Tuscus, the entire podium is filled up by a solid
                    mass of concrete, made of broken tufa, pozzolana, and lime, the whole forming a
                    lofty platform, about 22 feet high, solid as a rock, on which the columns and
                    upper structure are erected. Small chambers formed in the concrete basement,
                    such as the one in this temple, occur in many instances, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> in the temples of Saturn, Divus Julius, and Concord. They were
                    probably used as strong rooms, in which money and plate were deposited for safe
                    keeping (see Juv., xiv. 260), a purpose for which Roman temples were frequently
                    used. Two fragments of mosaic, with simple lozenge pattern in white marble and
                    basalt, still exist in the cella of this temple. The level of the mosaic shows
                    that it is of earlier date than the rebuilding of Tiljerius, as it lies
                    considerably below the level of the later floor. It hasall the characteristics
                    of early mosaic—very small tesserae fitted with great accuracy, like the early
                    mosaic in the Regia. The temple of Castor was often used as a meeting-place for
                    the</p>
                <p>Senate, and its lofty podium formed a tribunal for orations. <note

                    Caligula was to connect the temple of Castor with his palace by breaking a door
                    through the back of the cella (Suet., Ca/., 22). Though dedicated to Iioth the
                    Dioscuri, the building was usually called the temple of Castor only (see Suet.,
                    <hi rend="italic">J. Cκs.,</hi> 10). </p></note> Close by it was another
                    tribunal, probably merely a wooden sug-gestus—called the Tribunal Aurelium (see

                    of lyres and garlands, used to enclose somespotstruck by lightning or sacred
                    from other causes. It is shown on a denarius of the gens Scribonia. The Sacra
                    Via, in its course from the Regia towards the temple of Saturn, originally
                    passed in front of the temple of Castor; but in late times its line was changed,
                    and it is now covered at this Jioint by rude paving of travertine and marble,
                    probably not earlier than the 5th century. The ancient line is indicated by the
                    Regia, shown on fig. 16.</p>
                <p>On the other side of the Sacra Via stand the scanty remains of the temple of
                    Divus Julius, erected by Augustus. Though little beyond its concrete core is
                    left, its j&gt;lan can be fairly well made out from the voids in the concrete,
                    which show the position of the tufa foundations under the walls and columns (as
                    in the temple of Castor). The temple itself, a hexastyle prostyle building, with
                    close Jiyknostyle Intercolumniation (Vitr., iii. 2), stood on a lofty j∣odium
                    with a curved recess in the front between two flights of stairs (see Plate
                    VII.). The wall which now fills up the recess is a late addition. It is
                    Jiossible that this very unusual plan was adopted in order that the recess might
                    leave room for the preexisting altar (Aj∣jιian, <hi rend="italic">Bell.
                    Civ.,</hi> ii. 148) or column (Suet., <hi rend="italic">J. Caes.,</hi> 85)
                    erected by the Senate with the inscription PARENTI PATRIAe. The podium, which
                    projects in front of the temple itself, was adorned with beaks from the ships
                    taken at Actium (Dion Cass., Ii. 19), and hence it vas called the Rostra Julia,
                    to distinguish it from the other rostra described above. Both were used for the
                    funeral orations in honour of Augustus (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Aug.,</hi> IOO;
                    see also Dion Cass., liv. 35). Besides the concrete core and the curved tufa
                    wall of the recess, little now exists except a small bit of the mosaic of the
                    cella floor and some fragments of the cornice and pediment, of fine Greek
                    marble. This temj∣le is represented on coins of Augustus and Hadrian.</p>

                    the ancient line of the Sacra Via (0v., <hi rend="italic">Trist.,</hi> iii. 1,
                    28). No shrine in Rome was equal in sanctity to this little circular building,
                    which contained the sacred fire and the relics on which the welfare and even the
                    existence of Rome dejιended. The shrine was an “aedes sacra,” not a “templum” in
                    the strict sense of the word, which means a building so inaugurated that it
                    could be used for meetings of the Senate. The original building was destroyed in
                    390 B. C. by the Gauls; it was burnt again in 241 B.C., again in the great fire
                    of Nero’s reign, and then in the reign of Commodus; after this it was rebuilt by

                    VIL and lig. 15). It consisted of a circular cella, surrounded by eighteen
                    columns, with screens between them; the circular podium, about 10 feet high,
                    still exists, mainly of concrete with some foundations of tufa blocks, which may
                    belong to the original structure. In the time of Pliny (//.W, xxxiv. 7) the
                    tholus or dome over the cella—symbolizing the canopy of heaven (0v., <hi
                    rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> vi. 276)—was covered with Syracusan bronze. Horace’s
                    mention (0&lt;Z., i. 2, 13) of the destruction of the temple by a Tiber flood
                    caused the mistaken notion that the similar round temple still existing near the
                    exit of the Cloaca Maxima was the Aedes Vestae; but the flood of 1877 showed
                    that the waters of the river could still reach this point in the Forum. Its
                    position near the temple of Castor is mentioned by Martial (i. 71-73). <note

                <p>The Regia (see fig. 16), or residence of the pontifex maximus, was on the Sacra
                    Via, close by the temple of Vesta. It also was traditionally founded by Numa,
                    and used as his dwelling-house; it was destroyed in 390 B. c. by the Gauls, and
                    was again burnt in 210 b.c. (Liv., xxvi. 27), when the temple of Vesta narrowly
                    escaped. Julius Caesar, as pontifex maximus, resided here; and when Augustus
                    succeeded to this office in 12 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he gave the Regia
                    to the vestals, having built himself a large house on the Palatine. When the
                    Atrium Vestae or house of the vestals was rebuilt on an enlarged scale the Regia
                    was nulled down and its site partly occupied by the new atrium. Ovid ( <hi
                    rend="italic">Trist.,</hi> iii. 1, 28) describes this end of the Forum thus—</p>
                <p>“Haec est a sacris quae via nomen habet,</p>
                <p>Hic locus est Vestae, qui Pallada servat et ignem,</p>

                <p>The excavations of the last few years have laid bare remains of this very
                    interesting building, and show that it was a large house extending close up to
                    the temple of Vesta,—0μoτotχos, as Dion Cassius (lvi. 27) says. <note

                    It was set at a quite different angle from the Atrium and other later buildings
                    which were built over its foundations; this angle shows the original line of the
                    Sacra Via, which in later tunes was diverted into a different direction. The
                    existing remains are of several dates,—first, walls of soft tufa, part possibly
                    of the earliest building; second, walls of hard tufa, of rather later date; and
                    lastly, concrete walls faced with brick, decorated with painted stucco, and
                    columns of travertine, also stuccoed and painted, <note anchored="true"

                    of that early sort which has very small tesserae put together with great
                    accuracy. This last part probably belongs to the rebuilding by Domitius Calvinus
                    in 35 b.c. (Dion Cass., xliii. 42). These valuable remains were preserved in
                    spite of the erection of later buildings over them because the levels of the
                    later floors were higher than those of the Regia, and thus covered and protected
                    the mosaics and lower parts of the walls and columns (see fig. 16). Besides
                    being a dwelling-house, the Regia contained a sacrarium, in which were preserved
                    the sacred spears of Mars (Aul. Gell., iv. 6), and also the shrine of the Dea
                    Ops Consiva, only entered by the vestals and the sacerdos publicus (Varro, <hi
                    rend="italic">KK,</hi> vi. 21).</p>
                <p>The Atrium Vestae or house of the vestals, like the temple, was many times burnt
                    and rebuilt; the existing building, which was excavated in 1883-84, is of the
                    time of Hadrian, as is shown by the brick stamps. It consists of a large atrium
                    or quadrangle with columns of cipollino. At one end is the tablinum, with three
                    small rooms on each side of it,—probably for the six vestals. A bathroom,
                    bakehouse, servants’ offices, and some rooms lined with rich marbles extend
                    along the south-west side. This extensive building is set against the side of
                    the Palatine, which is cut away to admit the lower story. Thus the level of the
                    first upper floor is nearly the same as that of the Nova Via, on which it faces,
                    about 23 feet above the ground floor. The upper floor is in part well preserved;
                    it contains a large suite of bath and other rooms, which were probably the
                    sleeping apartments of the vestals. All the better rooms and the baths are lined
                    with polished marbles, many of great beauty and rarity; the floors are mostly
                    mosaic of tesselated work. The paving of the tablinum was a beautiful specimen
                    of inlay in porphyry and marble. In many places alterations and clumsy patchings
                    of the 4th and 5th centuries are apparent. A number of statues of the chief
                    vestal, or virgo vestalis maxima, with inscribed pedestals, were found in the
                    atrium, mostly of the 3d century, though a few are earlier; these are of
                    especial interest as illustrating the sacerdotal dress of the vestals. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One of these, a noble figure
                    of the time of Hadrian, is specially remarkable as being the only statue known

                    only worn by the vestal at the moment of offering sacrifice (see Festus, ed.
                    Müller, p. 340; and Varro, <hi rend="italic">L. L.,</hi> vi. 21). Many points of
                    great interest occur in the inscriptions on the pedestals. </p></note> Nothing
                    but the Nova Via separates the Atrium Vestae from the palace of Caligula (see
                    Plin., <hi rend="italic">Ep.,</hi> vii. 19; Aul. Gell., i. 12), which extends
                    over the site of the Lucus Vestae,—“qui a Palatii radice in Novam Viam devexus
                    est” (Cic., <hi rend="italic">De Div.,</hi> i. 45). A curious octagonal
                    structure in the middle of the atrium (see fig. 16) looks very much like a
                    border for flower-beds; and it is possible that this miniature garden was made
                    by the vestals when Caligula built over their extensive grove on the slopes of
                    the Palatine. By the main entrance from the Forum stood a small aedicula,—a
                    large pedestal at the angles of which were columns supporting an entablature.

                    Zosimus (v. 38) as being alive in 394; but the Atrium continued to be partly

                <p>The space between the north-west end of the Forum and the Tabularium is occupied
                    by a range of important buildings (see Plate VII.). The chief of these is the

                    marble plan, founded by Camillus in 367 b.c. (Plut., <hi rend="italic"

                    depth, and a very large projecting portico. Its construction is an interesting
                    example of the Roman use of many different materials. The lower part of the
                    walls was of massive tufa blocks, the upper part of the cella of travertine; and
                    the inner low wall, which supported ranges of internal columns, was of mixed
                    concrete, tufa, and travertine. The whole was lined with marble, white outside,
                    and rich Oriental marbles inside (see fig. 5), which were also used for the
                    pavement. The door-sill is made of enormous blocks of porta santa marble, in
                    which a bronze Caduceus (emblem of Concord) was inlaid. Between the internal
                    columns of the cella stood rows of statues; and the temple also contained a
                    large collection of pictures, engraved gems, gold and silver plate, and other
                    works of art, mostly the work of ancient Greek artists (see Plin., <hi

                    filled with sculpture; and statues were set in the open porch. Though now only

                    temple of Concord, built in 219B.C., stood on the Capitoline Arx (Liv., xxii.
                    33, xxvi. 23); and a bronze aedicula of Concord in the Area Vulcani, which must
                    have been close by the great temple. This was dedicated by Cn. Flavius, 305 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see Liv., ix. 46); according to Pliny <hi

                <p>The temple of Vespasian stands close by that of Concord, abutting on the

                    flight of steps (see fig. 1). It consists of a nearly square cella with prostyle
                    hexastyle portico of the Corinthian order; three of the columns are still
                    standing, with their rich entablature, the frieze of which is sculptured with
                    sacred instru-</p>
                <p>ments. The avails are of enormous blocks of travertine with strong iron clamps;
                    the whole was lined with white Pentelic marble outside, and inside with coloured
                    Oriental marbles. There was an internal range of columns, as in the temple of
                    Concord. This temple was built by Domitian, c. 94 a.d., in honour of his father
                    Vespasian. The inscription on the entablature, given in the Einsiedeln MS.,

                <p>In the narrowspace between the temples of Concordand Vespasian (only about 7 feet
                    in width) a small brick and concrete aedicula stands against the Tabularium.
                    This has been wrongly called a shrine of Faustina, on the authority of a small

                <p>The arch of Severus stands by the rostra, across the road on the north-east side
                    of the Forum; the remains of the ancient travertine curb show that originally
                    the road went along a rather different line, aud was probably altered to make
                    room for this great arch. It was built in 203 a.d., after victories in Parthia,
                    and was originally set up in honour of Severus and his two sons Caracalla (here
                    called M. Aurelius Antoninus) and Geta. Caracalla, after murdering Geta, erased
                    his name from all monuments to his honour in Rome. Representations of the arch
                    on coins of Severus show that its attic was surmounted by a chariot of bronze
                    drawn by six horses, in which stood Severus crowned by Victory; at the sides
                    were statues of Caracalla and Geta, with an equestrian statue at each angle. The
                    arch, except the base, which is of marble-lined travertine, is built of massive
                    blocks of Pentelic marble, and has large crowded reliefs of victories in the
                    East, showing much decadence from the best period of Roman art.</p>
                <p>The central space of the Forum is paved with slabs of travertine, much patched at
                    various dates; it appears to have been marked out into compartments with incised
                    lines (see Plate VII.), the use of which is not known. <note anchored="true"

                    clamp-holes all over the paving show where statues and other ornaments once
                    stood. The recorded number of these is very great, and they must once have
                    thickly crowded a great part of the central area. Two short marble walls or
                    plutei covered with reliefs, discovered in 1872, stand on the north side. Their
                    use and original position are not known, as the rough travertine plinth on which
                    they have been set is evidently of late date. Each of these marble screens has
                    (on the inside) reliefs of a fat bull, boar, and ram, decked out with
                    sacrificial wreaths and vittae—the Suovetaurilia. On the outside are scenes in
                    the life of Trajan: one has the emperor seated on a suggestus instituting a
                    charity for destitute children in 99 a.d.—a scene shown also in one of his first

                    Trajan of some arrears of debt due to the imperial treasury (Spartian, 7). The
                    background here represents again the Basilica Julia, with (on the right) the
                    Ionic temple of Saturn and the Corinthian temple of Vespasian. Between them is
                    an arch, which may be that of Tiberius. On the left the fig-tree and the statue
                    of Marsyas are repeated. Other explanations of these reliefs have been given,
                    but the above appears the most probable. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The seven cubical brick and concrete structures, once faced with marble, which

                    pedestals of honorary columns, such as those shown in the relief on
                    Constantine’s arch, mentioned above. The column erected in honour of the tyrant
                    Phocas by Smaragdus in the eleventh year of his exarchate (608) is still
                    standing. It is a fine marble Corinthian column, stolen from some earlier
                    building; it stands on rude steps of marble and tufa. The name of Phocas is
                    erased from the inscription; but the date shows that this monument was to his
                    honour. Remains of other small marble structures are shown in Plate VII., but
                    what they are is not known. In the 4th century a long brick and concrete
                    building faced with marble was built along the whole south-east end of the
                    Forum, probably a row of shops. They were destroyed by Comm. Rosa’s order a few
                    years ago. Countless fragments of other buildings, reliefs, and statues are
                    strewn all over the Forum. Many of these are of great interest; pieces of large
                    granite columns which probably stood on the seven pedestals mentioned above are
                    lying in various places; some of these appear to have been decorated with bronze
                    reliefs, the iron fastenings of which, run with lead, still exist. <note

                <p>In addition to the walls of Roma Quadrata (see above), a few remains only now
                    exist earlier in date than the later years of the republic; these are mostly
                    grouped near the Scalae Caci (see No. 11 in fig. 17) and consist of small cellae
                    and other structures of unknown use. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>JIany masons’ marks exist on the tufa blocks of the most
                    primitive buildings near the Scalae Caci (see fig. 10). </p></note> They are
                    partly built of the soft tufa used in the wall of Romulus and partly of the hard
                    tufa which resembles peperino. Various names, such as the “hut of Faustulus” and
                    the “Auguratorium,” have been given to these very ancient remains, but with
                    little reason. One thing is certain, that the buildings ιvere respected and
                    preserved even under the empire and were probably regarded as sacred relics of
                    the earliest times. Remains of more than one temple, probably of the early
                    republican period, exist near this ιvest angle of the Palatine; these had
                    peristyles with Tuscan columns of tufa stuccoed and painted. The larger of these
                    (see 14 in fig. 17) has been called Conjecturally the temple of Jupiter Victor
                    (Liv., x. 29; Ov., <hi rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> iv. 621). It stands on a
                    levelled platform of tufa rock, the Ioiver part of which is excavated into
                    quarry chambers, used in later times as water reservoirs. Two ancient
                    ιvell-shafts lined ιvith tufa communicate ιvith these subterranean IioIIoavs.
                    Another extensive building of hard tufa of the republican period exists in the
                    valley afterwards covered by the Flavian palace; part of this can be seen under
                    the so-called Accademia (21 in fig. 17). Not far from the top of the Scalae Caci
                    are the massive remains of some large cella, nothing of which noιv exists except
                    the concrete core made of alternate layers of tufa and f peperino. It was
                    probably once lined ιvith marble. By it a noble colossal seated figure of a
                    goddess ιvas found, in Greek marble, ιvell modelled, a ιvork of the 1st century
                    a.d. The head and arms are missing, but the figure is probably rightly called a
                    statue of Cybele; and from it her name has been Conjecturally given to this
                    temple. Augustus in the <hi rend="italic">Monumcnturn A ncyranum</hi> records
                    AEDEM. MATRIS. MAGNAe . IN . PALATI0 . FECI; but it is more probable that his
                    temple to Cybele formed part of the magnificent group of buildings in the area
                    of Apollo (see below). Some interesting early architectural fragments are lying
                    near this temple; they consist of drums and capitals of Corinthian columns, and
                    part of the cornice of the pediment, cut in peperino, and thickly coated with
                    hard white stucco to imitate marble. Betiveen this and the temple (so called) of
                    Jupiter Victor are extensive remains of a large sort of porticus, with tufa
                    Avails and travertine piers, also republican in date. The use and name of this
                    building are unknown. The temple of Jupiter Stator, traditionally voιved by
                    Romulus during his repulse by the Sabines (Liv., i. 12), stood near the Porta
                    Mugionis, and therefore near the road leading up to the Palatine Sacra A ia.

                <p>Remains of extensive lines of buildings in early opus reticulatum exist on the
                    upper slopes of the Palatine, all along the Velabrum side, and on the south-west
                    side as far as the so-called Domus Gelotiana. These buildings are constructed on
                    the ruins of the Avail of Romulus, a great part of which has been cut away to
                    make room for them; their base is at the foot of the ancient wall, on the shelf
                    cut midway in the side of the hill; their top reached originally above the upper
                    level of the summit. They are of various dates and cannot be identified with any
                    known buildings. Part is apparently of the time of the emperor Tiberius, and no
                    doubt belongs to the Domus Tiberiana mentioned by Suetonius <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Tib.,</hi> 5; comp. Tac., <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> i. 27, and iii. 71);
                    this palace covered a great part of the Avest corner of the hill. Of about the
                    same date is a very interesting and well-preserved private house built wholly of
                    opus reticulatum; it is usually called the house of Livia. It has a small
                    atrium, out of which open the triclinium and the tablinum with a room (α∕α) on
                    each side, all handsomely decorated with good paintings of mythological and
                    domestic scenes, probably the work of Greek artists, as inscriptions in Greek
                    occur,— <hi rend="italic">c.g.</hi> , EPMHC, under the figure of Hermes, in a

                    is divided into a great number of very small rooms, mostly bedrooms. The house
                    is built in a sort of hole against the side of an elevation, so that the upper
                    floor behind is level with an ancient paved road. The dampness caused by this is
                    counteracted and kept off the paintings by a lining of flange-tiles over the
                    external Avails, under the stucco, thus forming an air-cavity all over the
                    surface. From the back of the house, at the upper level, a long subterranean
                    passage leads towards the Flavian palace, and then, turning at right angles and
                    passing by the foundations of the so-called temple of Jupiter Victor, issues in
                    the ancient tufa building mentioned above (20 in fig. 17). Another
                    crypto-porticus starts near this house and communicates with the long
                    semi-subterranean passage by which the palaces of Caligula and Domitian are
                    connected (19 in fig. 17). It is ornamented with very beautiful stucco reliefs
                    of cupids, beasts, and foliage, once painted and gilt. This private house is
                    probably that of Germani-cus, into which the soldiers who killed Caligula in the
                    long crypto-porticus escaped, as described by Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Ant.
                    Jud.,</hi> xix. 1; see also Suet., <hi rend="italic">Cal.,</hi> 58). Some
                    inscribed lead pipes were found in this house; some pieces bear the inscription

                    and marble, mostly the production of the best Greek artists, which adorned this
                    magnificent group of buildings must have made it the chief glory of this
                    splendid city. It was approached from a road leading out of the Summa Sacra Via
                    along the line of the present Via di S. Bonaven-tura; the entrance, probably the
                    Arcus of Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 4, 10), led through lofty
                    propylaea into a very extensive peristyle or porticus, with (at least) fifty-two
                    fluted columns of Numidian giallo; the rest was of white Luna and Athenian
                    marble. In the centre of this enclosure stood the great octostyle peripteral
                    temple of Apollo Palatinus, so called to distinguish it from another temple of

                    Inside the cella were statues of Apollo between Latona and Diana by Scopas,
                    Praxiteles, and Timotheus respectively (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N^.,</hi>
                    xxxvi. 4); round the walls were statues of the nine Muses (Juv., vii. 37). The
                    pediment had sculpture by Bupalus and Arehermus of Chios (Plin., <hi
                    rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 4), and on the apex was Apollo in a quadriga of
                    gilt bronze. The double door was covered with ivory reliefs of the death of the
                    Niobids and the defeat of the Gauls at Delphi. The Ancyra inscription records
                    that Augustus sold eighty silver statues of himself and with the money “offered
                    golden gifts” to this temple, dedicating them both in his own name and in the

                    Round the porticus, between the Numidian marble columns, were statues of the
                    fifty Danaids, and opposite them their fifty bridegrooms on horseback (see

                    was a small temple of Vesta (C ’ .7.A., i. p. 392), dedicated on 28th April 12

                    group of buildings suffered in the fire of Nero, and were restored by Domitian.
                    The whole was finally destroyed in the great fire of 363 (Ammian, xxiii. 3), but
                    the Sibylline books were saved.</p>
                <p>The palace of Caligula occupies the northern angle of the Palatine, and extends
                    over the Clivus Victorhe a long way towards the Clivus Palatinus (see fig. 17).
                    This part of the Palatine was once occupied by the Lucus Vestae, with the
                    Sacellum Volrlpiae and many fine private houses. Among these were the dwellings
                    of Q. Lutatius Catulus, Q. Hortensius, Catiline, Scaurus, Crassus (Plin., <hi
                    rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 3, 24), whose house was afterwards bought by

                    Palatine, so that the cost of the site for Caligula’s enormous palace must have
                    been very great. The part now existing is little more than the gigantic
                    substructures built to raise the principal rooms to the level of the top of the
                    hill. The lowest parts of these face the Nova A <hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                    ia, opposite the Atrium A <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> este, and many stories
                    of small vaulted rooms built in mixed brick and opus reticulatum rise one above
                    the other to the higher levels. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>At this point the Palatine is cut away into four stages like
                    gigantic steps; the lowest is the floor of the Atrium Vestae, the second the
                    Nova Via, the third the Clivus Victoriae, and the top of the hill forms the
                    fourth. </p></note> The palace extends over the Clivus Victoriae, supported on
                    lofty arches so as to leave the road unblocked; many travertine or marble stairs
                    lead to the upper rooms, some starting from the Nova Via, others from the Clivus
                    Victoriae. Its enormous extent is referred to by Pliny <hi rend="italic">{H.
                    N.,</hi> xxxvi. 24). A large proportion of these substructures consist of dark
                    rooms, some with no means of lighting, others with scanty borrowed light. AIany
                    small rooms and stairs scarcely 2 feet wide can only have been used by slaves.
                    The ground floors on the Nova ATa and the Clivus ATctorise appear to have been
                    shops, judging from their wide openings, with travertine sills, grooved for the
                    wooden fronts with narrow doors, which Roman shops seem always to have had,—very
                    like those now used in the East. The upper and j&gt;rincipal rooms were once
                    richly decorated with marble linings, columns, and mosaics; but little of these
                    now remains. By the side of the Clivus Victoriae still exists the start of the
                    bridge by which Caligula joined the Capitolium to the Palatium (Suet., <hi
                    rend="italic">Cal.,</hi> 22); it is partly supported on corbelled arches, richly
                    decorated with delicate stucco reliefs; the floor is of mosaic, and a piece of
                    the open marble screen or balustrade is still <hi rend="italic">in situ.</hi>
                    The intermediate parts of Caligula’s bridge were removed after his death, and
                    the exit from the palace is blocked by a brick-faced wall, very little later in
                    date than the palace itself. Near the bridge are some rooms very handsomely
                    ornamented with a combination of coloured stucco reliefs and painting on the
                    flat. The upper part of the palace, that above the Clivus Victoriae, is faced
                    wholly with brickwork, no opus reticulatum being used, as in the lower portions
                    by the</p>
                <p>Nova Via. This possibly marks a difference of date, and the occurrence of brick
                    stamps of the latter part of the 1st century A.D. in various parts of the palace
                    shows that a large portion of it is later than the time of Caligula.</p>
                <p>The next great addition to the buildings of the Palatine was the magnificent
                    suite of state apartments built by Domitian, over a deep natural valley running
                    across the hill (see fig. 17). The valley was filled up. and the level of the
                    new palace raised to a considerable height above the natural soil. Remains of a
                    house, decorated with painting and rich marbles, exist under Domitian’s
                    peristyle, partly destroyed by the foundations of cast concrete which cut right
                    through it. The floor of this house shows the original level, far below that of
                    the Flavian palace. The south angle of this great building adjoins the palace of
                    Augustus, and it is connected with the palace of Caligula by a branch
                    subterranean passage leading into the earlier crypto-porticus. These two
                    buildings continued to be used as the private apartments of the emperor, the
                    Flavian block consisting only of state rooms; the words AEDES PVBLICA were
                    inscribed upon it by Nerva to show its public character. It consists of a large
                    open peristyle, with columns of Oriental marble, at one end of which is the
                    grand triclinium with magnificent paving of opus sectile in red and green basalt
                    and coloured marbles, a piece of which is well preserved; next to the
                    triclinium, on to which it opens with large windows, is a nymphaeum or room with
                    marble-lined fountain and recesses for plants and statues. On the opposite side
                    of the peristyle is a large throne-room, the walls of which were adorned with
                    rows of pavonazetto and giallo columns and large marble niches, in which were
                    colossal statues of porphyry and basalt; at one side of this is the basilica,
                    with central nave and apse and narrow aisles, over which were galleries. The
                    apse, in which was the emperor’s throne, is screened off by open marble
                    cancelli, a part of which still exists. It is of great interest as showing the
                    origin of the Christian basilica; S. Agnese fuori Ie AIura is exactly similar in
                    arrangement (see Basilica, vol. iii. p. 417). <note anchored="true"

                    On the other side of the throne-room is the Iararium, with altar and pedestal
                    for a statue; next to this is the grand staircase, which led to the upper rooms,
                    now destroyed. The whole building, both floor and walls, was covered with the
                    richest Oriental marbles, including all the varieties mentioned on p. 808.
                    Outside were colonnades or porticus,—on one side of cipollino, on the other of
                    travertine, the latter stuccoed and painted. The magnificence of the whole,
                    crowded with fine Greek sculpture and covered with polished marbles of the most
                    brilliant colours, is difficult now to realize; a glowing description is given
                    by Statius <hi rend="italic">{Silv.,</hi> iv. 11, 18; see also Plut., <hi
                    rend="italic">Poplie.,</hi> 15, and AIart., viii. 36). Doors were arranged in
                    the throne-room and basilica so that the emperor could slip out unobserved and
                    reach by a staircase (30 in fig. 17) the crypto-porticus which communicates with
                    Caligula’s palace. The vault of this passage was covered with mosaic of mixed
                    marble and glass, a few fragments of which still remain; its walls were lined
                    with rich marbles; it was lighted by a series of windows in the springing of the
                    vault. This, as well as the Flavian palace, appears to have suffered more than
                    once from fire, and in many places important restorations of the time of
                    Severus, and some as late as the 4th century, are evident. In 1720-26 extensive
                    excavations were made here for the Farnese duke of Parma, and an immense
                    quantity of statues and marble architectural fragments were discovered, many of
                    which are now at Naples and elsewhere. Among them were sixteen beautiful fluted
                    columns of pavonazetto and giallo, fragments of the porphyry statues, and an
                    immense door-sill of Pentelic marble, now used for the high altar of the
                    Pantheon; these all came from the throne-room. The excavations were carried on
                    by Bianchini, who published a book on the subject. <note anchored="true"

                <p>In the middle of the slopes of the Palatine, towards the Circus AIaximus, are
                    considerable remains of buildings set against the wall of Romulus and covering
                    one of its projecting spurs. This series of rooms with a long Corinthian
                    colonnade has been supposed to be part of the Domus Gelotiana, from which
                    Caligula used to watch the races in the circus below (Suet., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cad.,</hi> 18). Little, however, of the existing remains is as early as the
                    reign of Caligula, and the marble porticus apparently dates from the time of
                    Severus. The rooms were partly marble-lined and partly decorated with painted
                    stucco, on which are incised a number of interesting inscriptions and rude
                    drawTngs. Here, in 1857, was found the celebrated (so-called) caricature of the
                    Crucified Christ, now in the Aluseo Kircheriano, but which, more probably, has a
                    Gnostic meaning. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>. The great stadium of the Palatine (see 50 in fig. 17) was begun by Domitian,
                    mainly built by Hadrian, and much altered or restored by Severus. The greater
                    part of the outer walls and the large exedra or apse at the side, with upper
                    floor for the emperor’s seat, are of the time of Hadiian, as is shown by the
                    brick stamps, and the character of the brick facing, which much resembles that
                    of the Flavian time (bricks 1⅜ inches and joints ⅜ inch thick). <note

                    these piers are of the time of Severus, as are also all the flat piers along the
                    outer wall,—one opposite each of those in the inner line. This shows either that
                    the stadium must have been left by Hadrian in an unfinished state, or else that
                    it Siiftered seriously from a fire or earthquake before the reign of
                    Severus.</p>
                <p>&gt; In addition to the stadium, Hadrian built a number of very handsome rooms,
                    forming a palace on the south-east side and at the south-west end of the
                    stadium. These rooms were partly destroyed and partly hidden by the later palace
                    of Severus, the foundations of which in many places cut through and render
                    useless the highly decorated rooms of Hadrian (53 in fig. 17). The finest of
                    these which is now visible is a room with a large window opening into the
                    stadium near the south angle; it lias intersecting barrel vaults, with deep
                    coffers, richly ornamented in stucco. The oval structure shown in the plan (50
                    in fig. 17), with other still later additions, belongs to the 4th or 5th
                    century, when the stadium was no longer used for races; some of the walls, of
                    opus mixtum, which cut up and disfigure this noble building appear to be the
                    work of Theodoric, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 500.</p>
                <p>The palace of Septiniius Severus was very extensive and of enormous height; it
                    extends not only all over the south angle of the Palatine but also a long way
                    into the valley of the Circus Maximus and towards the Coelian. This part (like
                    Caligula’s palace) is carried on very lofty arched substructures, so as to form
                    a level, uniform with the top of the hill, on which the grand apartments stood.
                    The whole height from the base of the Palatine to several stories above its
                    summit must have been enormous. Little now remains of the highest stories,
                    except part of a grand staircase which led to them. Extensive baths, all richly
                    decorated with marble linings and mosaics in glass and marble, cover a great
                    part of the top of the hill. These and other parts of the Palatine were supplied
                    with water by an aqueduct built by Nero in continuation of the Claudian
                    aqueduct, some arches of which still exist on the slope of the Palatine (56 in
                    fig. 17; see Spart., <hi rend="italic">Sept. Sev.,</hi> 24). The palace of
                    Severus was restored and enlarged by Heliogabalus and Sevems Alexander. <note

                    arched substructures of Severus, and near this, at the foot of the hill, at the
                    south angle, Septimius Severus built an outlying part of his palace, a building
                    of great splendour dedicated to the Sun and Moon, called the Septizonium,
                    probably from its seven stories or zonae (see Jordan, <hi rend="italic">Bull.
                    Inst.,</hi> 1872, p. 145). It has been doubted whether it can really have been
                    as much as seven stories high; but this is not improbable when we consider the
                    enormous height of the rest of Severus’s palace, reaching from the foot of the
                    Palatine to far above its summit. Part of the Septi-zonium existed as late as
                    the reign of Sixtus V. (1585-90), who destroyed it in order to use its marble
                    decorations and columns in the new basilica of St Peter; drawings of it are
                    given by Du Perac, <hi rend="italic">Vestigj di Roma,</hi> 1575, and in other

                <p>The Velia and Germalns were two outlying spurs of the Palatine. <note

                    Velias Conjunxerunt . . . ‘Germalum’ a germanis Romulo et Remo, quod ad ficum
                    Ruminalem ibi inventi” (Varro, <hi rend="italic">L-L.,</hi> y. 54). Varro’s
                    derivation of Velia from “vellera,” the fleeces of the pasturing flocks, is
                    obviously wrong. </p></note> Owing to the great alterations that have been made
                    in the contour of the hill it is now very difficult to identify these ancient
                    districts (see <hi rend="italic">Aim. Inst.,</hi> 1865, p. 347). The Germalus or
                    Cermalus was probably on the side towards the Velabrum, while the Velia may be
                    identified with that elevated ground between the Palatine and the Esquiline on
                    which the temple of Venus and Rome and the arch of Titus now stand. It is
                    evident that this was once much loftier and more abrupt than it is now; a great
                    part of it was cut away when the level platform for the temple of Venus and Rome
                    was formed. The foundations of part of Nero’s palace aloug the road between this
                    temple and the Esquiline are exposed for about 20 to 30 feet in height, showing
                    a corresponding lowering of the level here, and the bare tufa rock, cut to a
                    flat surface, is visible on the site of Hadrian’s great temple; that the Velia
                    was once much loftier is also indicated by the story of the removal of Valerius
                    Publicola’s dwelling. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    “Sacellum Larum” mentioned by Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Aim.,</hi> xii. 24) as
                    one of the points in the line of the pomoerium of Roma Quadrata. The Sacra Via
                    started at the Sacellum Streniae, an unknown point on the Esquiline, probably
                    near the baths of Titus (Varro, A.A. <hi rend="subscript">l</hi> v. 47), in the
                    quarter called Cerolia. Thence it probably (in Iatei times) Jiassed round part
                    of the Colosseum to the slope leading uj to the arch of Titus on the Velia; this
                    piece of its course is lined on one side by extensive baths, attributed to
                    Heliogabalus (45 in fig. 17), and farther back, against the cliff of the
                    Palatine, arc remains of Nero’s enormous palace (see 42 in fig. 17). From the
                    arch of Titus or Summa Sacra Via the original line of the road has been altered
                    (see Plate Λ'II.); the angle at which the scanty remains of the Regia are set
                    probably shows the early direction of the Sacra A ia in passing on to the temple
                    of Vesta. Its later course was more to the north-east, passing at a sharp angle
                    from the arch oi Titus to the front of Constantine’s basilica, and on past the
                    temple of Faustina. It is uncertain whether the continuation of this road to the
                    arch of Severus was in later times called the Sacra Via oi whether it rejoined
                    its old line along the Basilica Julia by the cross-road in front of the Aedes
                    Jiilii. Its original line past the temple of Vesta was completely built over in
                    the 3d and 4th centuries, anti clumsily-fitted pavements of marble and
                    travertine occupy the place of the old basalt blocks. <note anchored="true"

                    angle under the church of S. Maria Libératrice. The rest of its course, gently
                    ascending towards the arch of Titus, is now exposed, as are also the stairs,

                    introduce his name by the side of that of Catulus. It was again burnt by the

                    as to the site of this temple and that of Juno Moneta on the Arx; but there is
                    an overwhelming mass of evidence to show that the Capitolium is the peak where
                    the Palazzo Caflarelli stands, and that the church of Ara Cceli occupies the
                    Arx. Livy (xxxv. 21) mentions the fall of a mass of rock from the Capitolium
                    into the Vicus Jugarius, which passes close under the Caffarelli summit, ami is
                    not near the opposite peak. Moreover, extensive substructions of tufa and
                    peperino have been exposed on the eastern peak, the form of which appears to fit
                    this nearly square triple temple, and in 1875 a fragment of a fluted column was
                    found, of such great size that it could only have belonged to the temple of
                    Jupiter. Its actual limits have not been clearly made out, and therefore the
                    truth of Dionysius’s description (iv. 61) cannot be proved. <note

                    was covered with gold reliefs, which were stolen by Stilicho (c. 390; Zosim., v.

                    the top of the tufa rock, which is cut into a smooth cliff, is visible from the
                    modern Vicolo della Rupe Tarpeia; this cliff is traditionally called the
                    Tarpeian rock, but that must have been on the other side towards the Forum, from
                    whence it was visible, as is clearly stated by Dionysius (vii. 35, viii. 78).

                    observed by the augurs (see Festus, ed. Müller, p. 18). This was moved under the

                    xxii. 33)—and many others, as well as a triumphal arch in honour of Nero, and a
                    crowd of statues and other works of art (see Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.H.,</hi>

                    must have been a mass of architectural and artistic magnificence, the spoils of
                    the whole Hellenic world.</p>
                <p>The so-called Tabularium occupies the central part of the side towards the Forum;
                    it is set on the tufa rock, which is cut away to receive its lower story. It
                    derives its name from an inscription found there in the 15th century, quoted by
                    Poggio (see Gruter, <hi rend="italic">Dιscr.,</hi> 170, 6); but that name was
                    given to many buildings in Rome (Liv., iii. 55, xliii. 16), and there is no
                    reason to suppose that this specially was known as <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                    Tabularium (comp. Virg., <hi rend="italic">Geor.,</hi> ii. 501). Catulus, who
                    was also the dedicator of the great temple of Jupiter (Tac., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hisk,</hi> iii. 72; Dion Cass., xliii. 14), was consul in 78 b.c., but part of
                    this building is probably much earlier in date. Its outer walls are of peperino,
                    its inner ones of tufa or concrete; the Doric arcade has capitals and architrave
                    of travertine. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    whole of the frieze and cornice is missing; it is usually supposed that there

                    except Poggio’s statement. </p></note> A road paved with basalt passes through
                    the building along this arcade, entered at one end from the Clivus Capitolinus,
                    and at the other probably from the Gradus Monetae, a flight of steps leading
                    from the temple of Concord and the Forum up to the temple of Juno Moneta on the
                    Arx (see Plate VII.). The entrance from the Clivus Capitolinus is by a wide flat
                    arch of peperino most beautifully jointed; the other end wall has been mostly
                    destroyed. The back of this building overlooked the Asylum or depression between
                    the two peaks. From this higher level a long steep staircase of sixty-four steps
                    descends towards the Forum; the doorway at the foot of these stairs has a flat
                    arch, with a circular relieving arch over it; it was completely blocked up by
                    the temple of Vespasian (see fig. 1). This was probably the door where the
                    Vitellian rioters broke into the Capitolium (Tac., <hi rend="italic">HiM.,</hi>

                    the clearest evidence that that aerarium was in or part of the temple of Saturn

                    this building by the additions of Boniface VIIL and Nicholas V., as well as by
                    its being used as a salt store, by which the walls were much corroded. <note

                    was called the Forum Transitorium or Forum Palladium, from the temple to Minerva
                    which it contained. It was begun by Domitian, and dedicated by Nerva in 97 (see

                    a rich entablature with sculptured frieze. Two columns and part of this wall

                    represented all the previous emperors who had been deified, and by each was a
                    bronze column inscribed with his “res gestae” (Lamprid., <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Aug.: Seυ. Alex.,</hi> 28).</p>
                <p>The forum of Trajan with its adjacent buildings was the last and, at least in
                    size, the most magnificent of all; it was in progress from 100 to 117. A great
                    spur of hill, which connected the Capitoline with the Quirinal, was cut away to
                    make a level site for this enormous group of buildings. It consisted (see fig.
                    20) of a large dipteral peristyle, with curved projections, lined with shops on
                    the side. That against the slope of the Quirinal, three stories high, still
                    partly exists. The main entrance was through a triumphal arch (Dion Cass.,
                    Ixviii. 29), from which probably were taken most of the fine reliefs used by
                    Constantine to decorate his arch. Aurci of Trajan show this arch and other parts
                    of his forum. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Aul.

                    possibly means that the cliff of the Quirinal was cut back to a slope reaching

                    On the shaft are reliefs arranged spirally in twenty-three tiers, scenes of
                    Trajan’s victories, containing about 2500 figures. Trajan’s ashes were buried in
                    a gold urn under this column (Dion Cass., Ixviii. 16); and on the summit was a
                    colossal gilt bronze statue of the emperor, now replaced by a poor figure of St
                    Peter, set there by Sixtus V. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Suarium), bread (Forum Pistorium), and fish (Forum Piscarium), all of which,

                <p>Besides the temples mentioned in previous sections remains of many others still
                    exist in Rome. The circular temple by the Tiber in the Forum Boarium, formerly
                    thought to be that of Vesta, may be the temple of Hercules mentioned by
                    AIacrobius <hi rend="italic">{Saturn.,</hi> iii. 6), Solinus <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Colled.,</hi> i. 11), and Livy (x. 23). Its design is similar to that of the
                    temple of Vesta in the Forum (fig. 15), and, except the entablature and upper
                    part of the cella, which are gone, it is well preserved (see Piale, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tempiodi Vesta,</hi> 1817). The neighbouring Ionic temple,
                    popularly called of Fortuna Virilis, is of special interest from its early date,
                    probably the end of the 2d century b.c. The complete absence of marble and the
                    very sparing use of travertine, combined with the simple purity of its design,
                    are all proofs of its great antiquity. It has a prostyle tetrastyle portico of
                    travertine, and a short cella of tufa with engaged columns; the bases of these
                    and of the angle columns are of travertine. The frieze has reliefs of ox skulls
                    and garlands. The whole was originally stuccoed and painted so that the
                    different stones used would not show. Fig. 21</p>
                <p>gives the plan, showing the hard travertine used at the points of greatest
                    pressure, while the main walls with the half columns are of the weaker and
                    softer tufa. The dedication of this temple is doubtful; on the whole it appears
                    most probable that it is the temple to Fortuna (without any affix) founded by
                    Servius Tullius (Dionys., iv. 27) in the Forum Boarium, not the one to <hi
                    rend="italic">Τύχη ’ λv5ρeια</hi> (Fors Fortuna ?) mentioned as being by the
                    river (comp. Plut., <hi rend="italic">De Fork Rom.,</hi> 5). Ten columns of what
                    is probably the temple of Ceres, Liber, and Libera exist wι∙ <hi rend="italic"

                    Cosmedin. These have well sculptured composite capitals and wide
                    Intercolumniation,—probably a survival of the original design of this temple,
                    which was Tuscan in style (Vitr., iii. 3, 5; Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi>
                    XXXV. 45). Itwas founded by Aulus Postumius, dictator in 497 b.c., and dedicated
                    by Spurius Cassius, consul in 494 B. C.</p>
                <p>(Dionys,, vi. 17, 94). In 31 B.C. it was burnt (Dion Cass., 1. 10), and was
                    rebuilt by Augustus and Tiberius (Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> ii. 49);
                    but the existing columns belong to a still later restoration. The temple stands
                    close to the carceres of the Circus AIaximus, in the Forum Boarium. Within the
                    walls of S. Niccolo in Carcere (see fig. 22) in the Forum Olitorium are
                    preserved remains of the tufa cellae and travertine columns of three small
                    hexastyle peripteral temples, two Ionic and one Tuscan, set close side by side.

                    the Porticus Octaviae, two of which, dedicated to Juno Regina and Jupiter
                    Stator, with part of the enclosing porticus and the adjoining temple of Hercules
                    AIusarum, are shown on a fragment of the marble plan. The Porticus Octaviae, a
                    large rectangular space enclosed by a double line of columns, was built in
                    honour of Octavia by her brother Augustus on the site of the Porticus AIetelli,
                    founded in 146 b.c. This must not be confounded with the neighbouring Porticus
                    Octavia founded by Cn. Octavius, the conqueror of Perseus (Liv., xlv. 6, 42), in
                    168 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and rebuilt under the same name by Augustus,
                    as is recorded in the Ancyraean inscription. The whole group was one of the most
                    magnificent in Rome, and contained a large number of works of art by Phidias and
                    other Greek sculptors. The existing portico, which was the main entrance into
                    the porticus, is a restoration of the time of Severus in 203. The church of S.
                    AIichele and the houses behind it conceal extensive remains of the porticus and
                    its temples (see <hi rend="italic">Ann. Inst.,</hi> 1868, p. 108; and

                <p>Remains of a large peripteral Corinthian temple are built into the side of the
                    “Dogana di Terra,” near AIonteCitorio. Eleven marble columns and their rich
                    entablature are still <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> with the corresponding
                    part of the cella wall of peperino; in 1878 a piece of the end wall of the cella
                    was discovered, and, under the houses near, part of a large peribolus wall, also
                    of peperino, forming an enclosure with columns all round the temple nearly 330
                    feet square (see <hi rend="italic">Bull. Comm. Arch. Rom.,</hi> vL, pi. iv.,
                    1878). The dedication of this temple is not known; it has commonly been
                    identified with the temple of Neptune (Dion Cass., Ixvi. 24), built by Agrippa,
                    and surrounded by the Porticus Argonautarum (Dion Cass., Iiii. 27; AIart. iii.
                    20, 11); but its details appear to be later than the reign of Augustus. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This, however, is not
                    conclusive, as the temple of Neptune may have been completely rebuilt after the

                    it was the temple of Hadrian, mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Mirabilia</hi>
                    (Uhlrichs, <hi rend="italic">Codex Topogr.,</hi> Wiirtzburg, 1871, p. 107) as
                    being near this spot.</p>
                <p>The temple of Venus Felix and Roma Aeterna on the Velia (see fig. 23) was the
                    largest in Rome; it was pseudo-dipteral with ten Corinthian columns of Greek
                    marble at the ends, and probably twenty at the sides; it had an outer colonnade
                    round the peribolus of about 180 columns of polished granite and porphyry. Of
                    these only a few fragments now exist; for several centuries the whole area of
                    this building was used as a quarry, while the residue of the marble was burnt
                    into lime on the spot in kilns built of broken fragments of the porphyry
                    columns. A considerable part of the two cellae with their apses, set back to
                    back, still exists; in each apse was a colossal seated figure of the deity, and
                    along the side walls of the cellae were rows of porphyry columns and statues in
                    niches. The vault is deeply coffered with stucco enrichments once painted and
                    gilt. The roof was covered with tiles of gilt bronze, which were taken by Pope
                    Honorius I. (625-638) to cover the basilica of St Peter’s. These were stolen by
                    the Saracens during their sack of the Leonine city in 846. The emperor Hadrian
                    himself designed this magnificent temple, which was partially completed <pb

                    by the architect Apollodorus (Dion Cass., Ixix. 4; Spart., <hi rend="italic"

                    the criticisms of Apollodorus were made before Hadrian’s design was carτied out,
                    and that the emperor had the good sense to adopt the suggestions of his
                    professional critic. </p></note> The temple was probably finished by Antoninus
                    Pius; it was partly burned in the reign of Maxentius, who began its restoration,
                    which was carried OnbyConstantine (Amm. Afarcell., xvi. 10). The existing
                    remains of the two cellae are mainly of Hadrian’s time, but contain patches of
                    the later restorations. Between the south angle of this temple and the arch of
                    Constantine stand the remains of a fountain, usually known as the Meta Sudans.
                    This was a tall conical structure in a large circular basin, all lined with
                    marble. From its brick facing it appears to be a work of the Flavian period.</p>
                <p>That part of the Ccelian Hill which is near the Colosseum is covered with very
                    extensive remains,—a great peribolus of brickfaced concrete, apparently of
                    Flavian date, and part of a massive travertine arcade, somewhat similar to that
                    of the Colosseum; most of the latter has been removed for the sake of the stone,
                    but a portion still exists under the monastery and campanile of SS. Giovanni e
                    Paolo. What this extensive building was remains doubtful till further
                    excavations are made. According to one theory it is the temple of Claudius,
                    built by Vespasian (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Vesp.,</hi> 9); but Bunsen’s
                    suggestion is much more probable <hi rend="italic">(BescE,</hi> iii. p. 476),
                    that it was the house of Vectilius, bought and probably enlarged by Commodus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hist. Aug.: Comm.,</hi> 16), and connected with the Colosseum by
                    a subterranean passage. Such a passage actually exists, and has been partly
                    cleared out.</p>
                <p>The so-called temple of Minerva Medica on the eastern slope of the Esquiline (so

                    curiously planned building, with central decagonal domed hall, probably of the
                    time of Gallienus 263-268 (see Canina, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Top.,</hi> p.
                    161). Somewhat similar ruins beside the neighbouring basilica of S. Croce have
                    been supposed to belong to a nyrnphaeum of Severus Alexander, mentioned in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Notitia,</hi> Regio v., but are more probably part of the
                    Sessorium, a court of justice on the Esquiline. The remains on the Quirinal in
                    the Colonna gardens of massive marble entablatures richly sculptured were
                    formerly thought to belong to Aurelian’s great temple of the Sun, but it now
                    appears certain that they belong to the very extensive thermae of Constantine,
                    part of the site of which is now occupied by the Quirinal palace and
                    neighbouring buildings. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The excavations of recent years have brought to light, and in many cases
                    destroyed, a large number of domestic buildings; many of these are recorded in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Notizie degli Scavi</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Bull.
                    Comm. ArcE Rom.,</hi> 1872-1876. The extensive cutting away of the Tiber bank
                    for the new embankment exposed sonic very ornate houses near the Villa
                    Farnesina, richly decorated with marble, fine wall-paintings, and stucco
                    reliefs, equal in beauty to any works of the kind that have ever been found.
                    Some of these were cut oil the wall, and will be exhibited in a new museum about
                    to be formed to contain all ancient works of art found in Rome; but the houses
                    themselves have been destroyed. The laying out of the new Quirinal and Esquiline
                    quarters also has exposed many fine buildings. One handsome villa, built over
                    the Servian wall, may possibly be the house of Maecenas. A very remarkable
                    vaulted room, decorated with paintings of plants and landscapes, has been shown
                    to be a greenhouse; <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    with a series of step-like stages lor flowers. This one room has been preserved,
                    though the rest of the villa has been destroyed; it is on the road leading from
                    S. Maria Maggiore to the Lateran. The walls are a very fine specimen of tufa
                    opus reticulatum, unmixed with brick, evidently earlier than the Christian era.
                    Among the numerous buildings discovered in the Horti Sallustiani near the
                    Quirinal is a veιy fine house of the 1st century a.d., in concrete faced with
                    brick and opus reticulatum. It has a central circular domed hall, with many
                    rooms and staircases round it, rising several stories high. This house was set
                    in the valley against a cliff of the Quirinal, so that the third floor is level
                    with the upper part of the hill. It is nearly on the line of the Servian wall,
                    which stood here at a higher level on the edge of the cliff. This is identified
                    as the house of Sallust, which at his death became crown property, and was used
                    as a residence by Nero (Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> xiii. 47) and other
                    emperors till the 4th century. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    long line of houses was discovered during the making of a new road. Some of
                    these were of opus reticulatum of the 1st century B.c.; others had the finest
                    kind of brick-facing, probably of the time of Nero; all had been richly
                    decorated with marble linings and mosaics. The line of the street was parallel
                    to that of the later Aurelian wall, which at this part was built against the
                    back of this row of houses. At the same time, behind the line of houses, were
                    uncovered fine peperino and tufa piers of the aqueduct rebuilt by Augustus, one
                    arch of which, forms the Porta S. Lorenzo. These interesting remains have all
                    been completely destroyed. A fine house of the end of the 1st century a.d., with
                    richly decorated walls, was exposed in June 1884 against the slope of the
                    Quirinal, near the Palazzo Colonna; it was immediately destroyed to make room
                    for new buildings.</p>
                <p>The praetorian camp was first made permanent and surrounded with a strong wall by
                    the emperor Tiberius (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Tib.,</hi> 37). Owing to the camp
                    being included in the line of the Aurelian wall a great part of it still exists;
                    it is a very interesting specimen of early imperial brick-facing. The wall is
                    only 12 to 14 feet high, and has thinly scattered battlements, at intervals of
                    20 feet. The north gate <hi rend="italic">(Porta Pmneipalis Dextra)</hi> is
                    ιvell preserved; it had a tower on each side, now greatly reduced in height, in
                    which are small windows with arched heads moulded in one slab of terracotta. The
                    brick-facing is very neat and regular,—the bricks being about 1⅜ inches thick,
                    with ⅜-inch joints. On the inside of the wall are rows of small rooms for the
                    guards. Part of the Porta Decumana also remains. This camp was dismantled by
                    Constantine, who removed its inner walls; the outer ones were left because they
                    formed part of the Aurelian circuit. The present wall is nearly three times the
                    height of the original camp wall. The upper part was added when Aurelian
                    included it in his general circuit wall round Rome. The superior neatness and
                    beauty of Tiberius’s brick-facing make it easy to distinguish where his work
                    ends and that of the later emperors begins. Owing to the addition of the later
                    wall it requires some care to trace the rows of battlements which belong to the
                    camp.</p>
                <p>The Pantheon is the most perfect among existing classical buildings in Rome (see
                    fig. 24). It was built by Agiippa in 27 B.C., as is recorded on the frieze of
                    the portico. What its original purpose was is not clear; on the one hand, it
                    forms part of the great thermae built by Agiippa, and in position and design
                    closely resembles the great circular calidarium in the thermae of Caracalla; on
                    the other hand, it lias no Iiypocaust or hot-air flues, and was certainly
                    consecrated as a temple , to Mars, Venus, and other supposed ancestors of
                    Caesar’s family very soon after it was built (Dion Cass., Iiii. 27); it was used
                    as the meeting-place of the Fratres Aiwales before they began to meet in the
                    temple of Concord (see Henzen, <hi rend="italic">Acta Frat. Arval.,</hi> 1868,

                    and the general effect is probably much the same as it was, not in the time of
                    Agrippa, but after the restorations of Hadrian (Spart., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hadr.,</hi> 181) and Severus, when the magnificently coloured porphyries and

                    About 608 the Pantheon was given by Phocas to Boniface IV., who consecrated it
                    as the church of S. Maria ad Martyres. In 1881-82 the destruction of a row of
                    houses behind the Pantheon exposed remains of a grand hall with richly
                    sculptured entablature on Corinthian columns, part of the great thermae of
                    Agrippa, which extend beyond the Via della Ciambella (fig. 24). A great part of
                    the thermae appears from the brick stamps to belong to an extensive restoration
                    in the reign of Hadrian, and bricks of his time are even said to have been found

                    moved by Vespasian, with head and attributes altered to those of Apollo
                    (Helios), on to the Velia; and it was moved again by Hadrian, when the temple of
                    Rome was built, on to the base which still exists near the Colosseum. Several
                    coins show this colossus by the side of the Colosseum.</p>
                <p>Under the Palazzo Doria, the church of S. Maria in Via Lata, and other
                    neighbouring buildings extensive remains exist of a great porticus, with long
                    rows of travertine piers; this building appears to be represented on fragments
                    of the marble plan with the words SAEPT ... LIA. This is probably the Septa
                    Julia, begun by Julius Caesar, and completed by Agrippa in 27 b,c., as the
                    voting place for the Comitia Centuriata, divided into compartments, one for each
                    century. The building contained rostra, and was also used for gladiatorial
                    shows. Under the later empire it became a bazaar and resort of
                    slave-dealers.</p>

                    It was restored in 327 and 174 b.c. (Liv., viii. 20; xli. 27). In the reign of
                    Julius Caesar it was rebuilt with (for the first time) lower seats of stone
                    (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 24), the upper being still of wood

                    Nero, and again under Domitian, by whom it was restored wholly in stone and
                    marble, and lastly it was restored and enlarged by Constantine. In its later

                    structure were found in the 16th century under the Palazzo Mattel. In the Middle
                    Ages its long open space was used as a rope-walk, hence the name of the church

                    was called from the latter emperor the Stadium Alexandrinum. That it was a

                    prejudice existed in republican Rome against the introduction of the Greek

                    Scipio Nasica, the Senate demolished a Iialf-Iinished stone theatre which had
                    been begun by the censor C. Cassius Longinus. Even Pompey had to build a temple
                    to Venus in the upper part of his theatre as a sort of excuse for having seats
                    and steps of stone leading up to it (Tertull., <hi rend="italic">De Spec.,</hi>

                    contained a temple to Venus Victrix, and" in front of it was a great ρorticus
                    called Hecatostylum from its hundred columns. This is shown on the marble plan.

                    completed by Caligula. The scena was again burnt in 80 a.d., and restored by
                    Titus. According to Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H. K.</hi> , xxxvi. 24), it held
                    40,000 spectators. In 1864 the colossal gilt bronze statue of Hercules, now in
                    the Vatican, a work of the 3d century, was found near the site of the theatre of
                    Pompey, carefully concealed underground. The theatre of Marcellus is much more
                    perfect; complete foundations of the cunei exist under the Palazzo Savelli, and
                    part of the external arcade is well preserved. This is built of travertine in
                    two orders, Tuscan and Ionic, with delicate details, very superior to those of
                    the Colosseum, the arcade of which is very similar to this in general design.
                    This theatre was begun by J. Caesar, and finished by Augustus in 13 B.C., who
                    dedicated it in the name of his nephew Marcellus. <note anchored="true"

                <p>It stands partly in the Fomm Olitorium, a large extent of the travertine paving

                    and in the Via di S. Maria in Caeaberis, No. 23, there is a small portion of the
                    external arcade of the portions which belonged to this theatre; the lower story
                    has travertine arches with engaged columns, and the upper has brick-faced
                    pilasters. It was built by Cornelius Balbus in 13 b.c. (Suet., <hi rend="italic"

                    >(H.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 2, 24). The same writer mentions an almost incredible
                    building, which consisted of two wooden theatres made to revolve on pivots, so
                    that the two together made an amphitheatre; this was erected by C. Curio in 50
                    b.c.</p>
                <p>The first stone amphitheatre in Rome was that built by Statilius Taurus in the
                    reign of Augustus. Its ruins are supposed to form the elevation called Monte
                    Giordano, but none of it is visible. For the Colosseum see Amphitheatre, vol. i.
                    The Amphitheatrum Castrense is in the line of the wall of Aurelian near tlιe
                    Porta Asinaria; it is built of concrete, faced with neat brickwork, and was
                    decorated with friezes and other ornaments in moulded terracotta. Its exterior
                    had two tiers of arches between engaged Corinthian columns, all, even the
                    foliage of the capitals, very neatly executed in terra-cotta. Only one piece
                    with the upper order still exists on the outside of the Aurelian line. This
                    amphitheatre is mentioned in the regionary catalogues under Regio v. It is
                    supposed to have been erected for the amusement of the troops in the
                    neighbouring camp, hence its name. From the character of the brick-facing the
                    building appears to date from the early part of the 2d century.</p>

                    erected by Domitian to commemorate the conquest of Judaea by Titus in his
                    father’s reign. Reliefs inside the arch represent the triumphal procession—Titus
                    in a chariot, and on the other side soldiers bearing the golden candlestick,
                    trumpets, and table of prothesis, taken from the Jewish temple. The central part

                    other respects it follows the Corinthian order. </p></note> ° Another arch in
                    honour of Titus had previously been built (80 a.d.) in the Circus Maximus; its

                    Corn. Dolabella (10 A.D.) and of the flamen martialis, C. Junius Silanus. In
                    later times Nero’s aqueduct was built over it. It may possibly have been an

                    which was used for games when the Campus Martius was flooded. The so-called arch
                    of Drusus by the Porta Appia also carries the specus of an aqueduct,—that built
                    by Caracalla to supply his great thermae. Its coarse details show, however, that
                    it is much later than the time of Drusus (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Claud.,</hi>
                    1). It was usual to ornament specially the arch of an aqueduct that happened to
                    cross a road, ami this arch was probably built by Caracalla with the rest of his
                    branch of the Aqua Marcia. Adjoining the church of S. Giorgio in Velabro a rich
                    though coarsely decorated marble gateway with flat lintel still exists,—built,
                    as its inscription records, in honour of Severus and his sons by the argentarii
                    (bankers and silversmiths) and other merchants of the Forum Boarium in 204. It
                    formed an entrance from the Forum Boarium into the Velabrum. The figure of Geta
                    in the reliefs and his name have been erased by Caracalla; the sculpture is poor
                    both in design and execution <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    most beautiful existing specimens of Roman or Graeco-Roinan sculpture; while

                    intersection of two roads, such as was called by the Romans an arch of Janus
                    Quadrifons. Though partly built of earlier fragments, it is of the worst style
                    of work; it cannot be earlier than the time of Constantine, and probably is of
                    still later date. The finest existing arch is that by the Colosseum erected by
                    Constantine. It owes, however, little of its beauty to that artistically
                    degraded period. Not only most of its reliefs but its whole design and many of
                    its architectural features were stolen from an earlier arch erected by Trajan as
                    an entrance to his forum (see p. 826 above). The arch of Claudius, built in 43
                    to commemorate his supposed victories in Britain, stood across the Via Lata
                    (modern Corso) between S. Francesco Saverio and the Palazzo Sciarra. Its exact

                <p>The column of Antoninus Pius was a monolith of red granite, erected after his
                    death by his adopted sons Al. Aurelius and L. Verus. One fragment of it is
                    preserved in the Vatican with an interesting quarry inscription, recording that
                    it was cut in the ninth year of Trajan’s reign, under the supervision of
                    Dioscurus and the architect Aristides. The rest of its fragments were used by
                    Pius VI. to repair the obelisk of AIonte Citorio, set up by Augustus in the
                    Campus AIartius as the gnomon of a sun-dial (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi>
                    xxxvi. 15). The marble pedestal of the Antonine column is now in the Vatican; it
                    has reliefs of the apotheosis of Faustina and Antoninus Pius, and processions of
                    soldiers. This and the column of AI. Aurelius were both surmounted by colossal
                    portrait statues of gilt bronze. The column of AL Aurelius is very similar in
                    size and design to that of Trajan. Its spiral reliefs represent victories in
                    Germany from 167 to 179, arranged in twenty tiers. Like the column of Trajan, it
                    is exactly IOO Roman feet high, without the pedestal. The pedestal was
                    originally much higher than at present, but is now partly buried; it is shown by
                    Gamucci, Du Perac, and other 16th-century writers. This column stood in front of
                    a temple to AL Aurelius, and within a great peribolus, forming a forum similar
                    to that of Trajan, though much smaller; the remains of this temple probably form
                    the elevation now called AIonte Citorio. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The recent discovery of a cemetery of prehistoric (Etruscan) date is mentioned
                    above, p. 812. Few tombs exist of the Roman period earlier than the 1st century
                    B. C. ,—probably owing to the great extension of the city beyond the Servian
                    limits, which thus obliterated the earlier burial places. The tomb of the
                    Cornelian Scipios is the most important of early date which still exists. It is
                    excavated in the tufa rock at the side of the Via Appia, outside the Porta
                    Capena. Interments of the Scipio family went on here for about 400 years,
                    additional chambers and passages being excavated from time to time. The peperino
                    sarcophagus of Cornelius Lucius Scipio Barbatus (Liv., x. 12, 13), consul in 298
                    b.c., is now in the Vatican; its inscription, in rude Saturnian verse, is
                    perhaps the most important existing specimen of early Latin epigraphy. _ Alany
                    other inscribed slabs were found in the 17th century, covering the “loculi” in
                    which lay the bodies of later members of the family. Tliose now existing in the
                    tomb are modern copies, with blundered inscriptions. All are given by AIommsen
                    (C ’ .∕.X., i. p. 11 <hi rend="italic">sq. <hi rend="superscript">y</hi> }.
                    .</hi> This burial-place of the Scipios is unlike those of other families, owing
                    to the gens Cornelia keeping up the early custom of interment without burning;
                    thus stone sarcophagi or loculi (rock-cut recesses) were required instead of
                    mere pigeon-holes to hold the cinerary urns. The tomb of Bibulus, a few yards
                    outside the Porta Ratumena, and remains of two recently discovered during the
                    destruction of the Aurelian towers at the Porta Salara, date from about the
                    middle of the 1st century b.c., as does also the curious tomb of the baker
                    Eurysaces outside the Porta AIaggiore. In 1863 an interesting tomb of the
                    Sempronia gens was discovered on the Quirinal, below the royal palace, near the
                    site of the Porta Sanqualis. It is of travertine, with a rich entablature and
                    frieze sculptured with the</p>

                <p>The mausoleum of Augustus, built 28 b.c., stands in the north part of the Campus
                    AIartius, between the Tiber and the Via Flaminia. It is a massive cylindrical
                    structure of concrete, faced with opus reticulatum; over that it was lined with
                    marble slabs; inside were a series of radiating chambers, in plan like a wheel.
                    On the top was a great mound of earth, planted with trees and flowers (Tac., <hi
                    rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> iii. 9). As late as the 16th century its external form

                    great thermae of Caracalla. The great fire of 191 was one of the causes of these
                    extensive works (see Lanci-ani, <hi rend="italic">Bull. Comm. Arch. born.,</hi>
                    1882). </p></note> The first buiial in the mausoleum of Augustus was that of
                    AIarcellus, 22 B.O., and it continued to be the imperial tomb till the death of
                    Nerva, 98 A.D., after whose interment there w⅛s no more room. It was sacked by
                    Alaric in 409, and in the 12th century was made into a fortress by the Colonna
                    family, and suffered much from constant party struggles.</p>
                <p>The mausoleum of Hadrian, begun in 135 as a substitute for that built by
                    Augustus, was a large circular building on a square podium; its walls, of
                    enormous thickness, are of concrete faced with blocks of peperino, the whole
                    being lined with Parian marble and surrounded by a colonnade with rows of
                    statues,—a work of the greatest magnificence. The bronze pine-cone, now in the
                    Vatican, was (according to Vacca) found near the mausoleum, and probably
                    surmounted its conical dome. The splendour of the whole is described by
                    Procopius (J5. <hi rend="italic">G.,</hi> i. 22), who mentions its siege by the
                    Goths, when the defenders hurled the statues on to the heads of the enemy. In
                    the 6th century it was made into a papal castle called S. Angelus inter Nubes,
                    and all through the Aliddle Ages it suffered much from constant attacks. The
                    interior chambers are still well preserved, but its outside has been so often
                    wrecked and refaced that little of the original masonry is visible.</p>
                <p>Several of the grander sepulchral monuments of Rome were built in the form of
                    pyramids. One of these still exists, included in the Aurelian wall, by the Porta
                    Ostiensis. It is a pyramid of concrete, 118 feet high, faced with blocks of
                    white marble, and contains a small chamber decorated with painted stucco. An
                    inscription in large letters on the marble facing records that it was built as a
                    tomb for C. Cestiusa praetor, tribune of the people, and Septemvir of the
                    epulones (officials who supervised banquets in honour of the gods)—an office
                    founded in 196 b.c. (Liv., xxxiii. 42). It was erected, according to Cestius’s
                    will, by his executors, in the space of 330 days. It dates from the time of
                    Augustus <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Near the tomb

                    carefully stacked, with apertures at intervals for ventilation. Many theories
                    have been advanced to account for this enormous mass of broken pottery; but by
                    far the most probable explanation is that the broken earthenware of Rome was
                    collected and stored here for use in the making of the stucco called opus
                    signinum (Vitr., viii. 6, 14), with which the specus or channels of aqueducts
                    were lined, and also the concrete in which marble and mosaic pavings were bedded
                    (nucleus). This latter is the opus testaceum of Vitruvius (vii. 1, 5); and the
                    universal use of pounded earthenware for floors and aqueducts must have used up
                    immense quantities of broken pots and bricks (teste tunsae). A good account of
                    the potsherds of Monte Testaccio and their stamps is given in <hi rend="italic"

                    popularly known as the tomb of Romulus, stood between the mausoleum of Hadrian
                    and the basilica of St Peter. It was destroyed in the 15th century during the
                    rebuilding of the long bridge which connects the former building with the
                    Vatican.</p>
                <p>The earliest bridge was a wooden drawbridge called the Pons Sublicius from the

                    an important part of the defence of Rome from the Aventine to the Porta
                    Fluminalis (see plan of Servian wall, fig. 8), no permanent bridges were made
                    till the Romans were strong enough not to fear attacks from without. The Pons

                    b.c., when the conquest of Etruria and the defeat ot Hannibal had put an end to
                    fears of invasion; it was called the Pons Aemilius, after the pontifex nιaximus

                    founder. It was also called Pons Lapideus to distinguish it from the wooden
                    Sublician bridge. The modern Ponte Rotto is on the site of this; but the
                    existing three arches are mediaeval. An ancient basalt-paved road still exists,
                    leading to the bridge from the Forum Boarium. The Pons Fabricius unites the city
                    and the island (Insula Tiber-ina); Livy (ii. 5) gives the fable of the formation
                    of this island from the Tarquin com, cut from the Campus Martius and thrown into
                    the river. The bridge derived its name from L. Fabricius, a curator viarum in 62
                    B.c.; its inscription, twice repeated, isL. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fabricivs</hi>

                    other existing bridges, it is built of great blocks of peperino and tufa, with a
                    massive facing of travertine on both sides. Corbels to support centering were
                    built in near the springing of the arches, so that they could be repaired or
                    even rebuilt without a scaffolding erected in the river-bed. The well-preserved
                    Pons Cestius, probably named after L. Cestius, praefectus urbi in 46 B.c.,
                    unites the island and the Janiculan side; on the marble parapet is a long
                    inscription recording its restoration in 370 by Gratian, Valentinian, and
                    Valens. The next bridge, Ponte Sisto, is probably on the site of an ancient
                    bridge called in the <hi rend="italic">Kotitia</hi> Pons Aurelius. Marliano
                    gives an inscription (now lost) which recorded its restoration in the time of
                    Hadrian. The Pons Aelius was built in 135 by Hadrian to connect his mausoleum
                    with the Campus Martius; it is still well preserved, and is now called the Ponte
                    S. Angelo (see Dante, <hi rend="italic">Infer.,</hi> xviii. 28-33). Its

                    greater part of which were then thickly inhabited. This enormous work was begun
                    in 271, to defend Rome against sudden attacks of the Germans and other northern
                    races when the great armies of Rome were fighting in distant countries. <note

                    Theodoric (about 500), by Belisarius (about 560), and by various popes during
                    the 8th and 9th centuries, and in fact all through the Middle Ages. A great part
                    of the Aurelian wall still exists in a more or less perfect state; but it has
                    wholly vanished where it skirted the river, and a great part of its
                    trans-Tiberine course is gone. The most perfect piece is that in the gardens of
                    the Villa Ludovisi. Other well-preserved pieces are by the Porta Appia, and
                    between the Lateran and the Amphitheatrum Castrense. The wall, of concrete, has
                    the usual brick-facing and is about 12 feet thick, with a guards’ passage formed
                    in its thickness. Fig. 25 shows its plan: on the inside the passage has tall
                    open arches, which look like those of an aqueduct, and at regular intervals of
                    about 45 feet massive square towers are built, projecting on the outside of the
                    wall, in three stories, the top story rising above the top of the wall. The
                    height of the wall varies according to the contour of the ground; in parts it
                    was about 60 feet high outside and 40 inside. Necessaria, supported on two
                    travertine corbels, projected from the top of the wall on the outside beside
                    most of the towers. The Einsiedeln MS. gives a description of the complete
                    circuit, counting all the gates, fourteen in number, as follows :—</p>
                <p>Porta S. Petri (destroyed); P. Flaminia (in use); P. Pinciana (closed); P.
                    Salaria (destroyed in 1870); P. Nomentana (closed); P. Tiburtina (in use, now
                    called P. S. Lorenzo); P. Praenestina (in use, now Porta Maggiore); P. Asinaria
                    (closed); P. DIetrovia (closed); P. Latina (closed); P. Appia (in use, now
                    called P. S. Sebastiano); P. Ostiensis (in use, now P. S. Paolo). On the
                    Jani-culan side, P. Portensis (destroyed); P. Aurelia (in use). One gate, known
                    as the P. Chiusa, is omitted in this list, owing to its being blocked up in the
                    time of the Einsiedeln writer. Its ancient name is not known.</p>
                <p>These existing gates are mostly of the time of Honorius; each is flanked by a
                    projecting tower, and some are double, with a second pair of towers inside.
                    Several have grooves for a portcullis <hi rend="italic">Gata-rctxta)</hi> in the
                    outer arch. The handsomest gate is the P. Appia, with two massive outer towers,
                    three stages high, the upper semicircular in plan. DIany of the gates of
                    Honorius have Christian symbols or inscriptions. The general design of all these
                    gates is much the same,—a central archway, with a row of windows over it and two
                    flanking towers, some square, others semicircular in plan. In many of the gates
                    older materials are used, blocks of tufa, travertine, or marble. The doors
                    themselves swung on pivots, the bottom ones let into a hole in the threshold,
                    the upper into projecting corbels.</p>
                <p>At many points along the line of the Aurelian wall older buildings form part of
                    the circuit,—near the Porta Asinaria a large piece of the Domus Laterana, a
                    house of the 3d century which gave its name to the Lateran basilica, and a
                    little farther on, by S. Croce in Gerusalemme, the Amphitheatrum Castrense; the
                    latter, of about the end of the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> has
                    two tiers of arches and engaged columns of moulded brick on the outside. Between

                    Tepula. The Praetorian Camp forms a great projection near the P. Nomentana.

                    single travertine arch, built by Augustus where the aqueduct carrying the Aqua
                    Marcia, Tepula, and Julia crossed the Via Tiburtina. The inner gateway, built of
                    massive travertine blocks by Honorius, was pulled down by Pius IX. in 1S68 for
                    the sake of the material. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    they describe a large number of ancient monuments which no longer exist. Some of
                    these, especially those earliest in date, exist only in MS. in the libraries of
                    the Vatican, the Uffizi, Milan, and elsewhere; a very valuable MS. of Ligorio
                    (16th century) is preserved in the Bodleian at Oxford. Among these MSS. are
                    drawings of ancient buildings by Raphael, Bramante, Bramantino, Baldassare,
                    Sallustio Peruzzi, Andrea Sansovino, Palladio, and in fact by nearly all the

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">From the Jjth to the Kith Century.</hi></p>
                <p>The era of church building in Rome may be said to begin with the reign of
                    Constantine and the peace of the church. Before then Christian worship was
                    conducted with various degrees of secrecy either in private houses or in the
                    Catacombs <hi rend="italic">Gj.v.</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> ac cording as the
                    reigning emperor viewed the sect with tolerance or dislike.</p>
                <p>The type of church which in the beginning of the</p>
                <p>4th century was adopted with certain modifica tions from the pagan basilica,
                    though varying much in size, had little or no variety in its general form and ar
                    rangement. One fixed model was strictly ad hered to for many cen turies, and, in
                    spite of numberless alterations and additions, can be traced in nearly all the
                    ancient churches of</p>
                <p>Rome.</p>
                <p>Fig. 26 shows a typical example, omitting all later changes. <note

                    of S. Clemente is shown under Basilica, fig. 13, vol. iii. p. 417; other plans
                    of early basilicas are given in the same </p></note> The plan is that of the
                    lower church of S. Clemente, built in the 4th century, probably in the reign of
                    Constantine; an existing inscription records its restoration by S.</p>
                <p>Siricius (384-398). The fittings, altar, choir-screen, &amp;c., are not now <hi
                    rend="italic">in situ,</hi> but were moved into the upper church when that was
                    built, between IlOO and 1118.</p>
                <p>They were then rather carelessly put together, ι and the proper positions of the
                    gospel and the epistle ambo reversed.</p>
                <p>The figure shows these fittings replaced in the ancient church as they originally
                    stood; they are rather later than the building itself, being made under Pope
                    John, probably the second of that name (532-535); his monogram is sculptured on
                    the marble slabs which form the low walls of the choir. In the 13th century
                    ornaments of mosaic inlay were added on these 6th-century screens by one of the
                    Cos-mati. The baldacchino which now exists in the upper church is of c. 1100,
                    but two of the columns of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> much older canopy are
                    preserved by being used in the construction of a fine 15th-century tomb near the
                    high altar. These have richly carved caps of semi-classical style, and, as well
                    as the high altar, have an inscription recording their gift to the church by the
                    priest Mercurius in the pontificate of Hormisdas (514-523). The paintings of the
                    9th century, and even earlier, which cover the walls of the lower church are
                    among the most important existing specimens of early Christian ait. <note

                    of S. Prassede and S. Cecilia in Trastevere still have it in a modernized form,
                    and so has the church of the Quattro Santi Incoronati, which also possesses the
                    triforium galleries, like those of S. Agnese fuori. </p></note> when space was
                    limited three sides of the atrium were omitted, leaving only a long pillared
                    narthex or porch which extended along the whole width of the nave. The apse or
                    presbyteriuιn, which was raised above the nave, contained a central marble
                    throne for the celebrant and a long bench for the rest of the clergy. The high
                    altar stood a little forward from the apse; and over it was a square canopy or
                    baldacchino supported on four marble columns; each of the four arches of the
                    canopy had a curtain, which was drawn close during the consecration of the
                    elements; at other times these curtains were twisted round the four columns of
                    the baldacchino. The celebrant stood with his back to the apse, looking
                    eastwards towards the people over the altar. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The custom (adopted some centuries later) of
                    the celebrant standing between the altar and the people necessitated a reversal
                    of orientation, and the high altar was then placed at the east end. </p></note>
                    The high altar stood over the tomb of some saint or confessor, hence called the
                    “confessio”; this was so arranged as to be at least partly visible, and usually
                    was reached by a few steps descending from the nave. In later times the
                    confessio became frequently a spacious crypt containing a small altar of its
                    own. At this point cancelli or marble screens ran across the whole width of the
                    church, both nave and aisles; and hence the part thus railed off was called the
                    “chancel.” The choir occupied most of the western half of the nave, and was
                    raised one step above it; it was completely surrounded by a low marble wall or
                    screen, along two sides of which a marble bench was fixed. On the right <note

                    book-rest usually distinguished by a sculptured eagle, and beside it the tall
                    paschal candlestick. On the left was the epistle ambo. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An analogous arrangement of the choir exists
                    in most of the Spanish cathedrals, in which it occupies a great part of the
                    nave. </p></note> The font was frequently an ancient marble or porphyry bath, as
                    in the Lateran baptistery and that of S. Maria Maggiore; but in early times an
                    ordinary parish church had no font; baptisms were only performed in one or two
                    of the great basilicas, and then in a separate building, usually octagonal in
                    shape. In the centre of the open atrium stood a fountain for ablutions performed
                    before entering the church, as in an Oriental mosque.</p>
                <p>The walls of these early churches were mostly built of concrete, faced with
                    brick, left structurally quite plain, and decorated only with painted stucco or
                    glass mosaics,—especially (internally) in the apse and on the face of its arch,
                    and (externally) on the east or entrance wall, the top of which was often built
                    in an overhanging curve to keep off the rain. The windows were plain, with
                    semicircular arches, and were filled with pierced marble screens, or in some
                    cases with slabs of translucent alabaster·; the latter was the case at S.
                    Lorenzo fuori Ie Mura, and examples of the former still exist in the very early
                    church formed in the rooms of some tliermae on the Esquiline (possibly those of
                    Trajan), below the 6th-century church of S. Martino ai Monti. Almost the only
                    bit of external architectural ornament was the eaves cornice, frequently (as at
                    the last-named church) formed of marble cornices stolen from earlier classical
                    buildings. Internally the nave columns, with their capitals and bases, were
                    usually taken from some classical building, and some churches are perfect
                    museums of fine sculptured caps and rich marble shafts of every material and
                    design. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>S. Lorenzo and
                    S. Agnese fuori, S. Maria in Trastevere, Ara Cceliand numberless other churches
                    are very rich in this respect. </p></note> At first the nave had no arches, the
                    columns supporting a horizontal entablature, as at S. Clemente, S. Maria
                    Maggiore, and S. Maria in Trastevere, but afterwards, in order to widen the
                    intercolumniation, simple round arches of narrow span were introduced, thus
                    requiring fewer columns. The roof was of the simple tie-beam and kingpost
                    construction, left open, but decorated with painting or metal plates. The floor
                    was paved either with coarse mosaic of large tesserae (as at S. Pudentiana) or
                    with slabs of marble stripped from ancient buildings. A later development of
                    this plan added a small apse containing an altar at the end of each aisle, as in
                    S. Maria in Cos-medin and S. Pietro in Vincoli. <note anchored="true"

                <p>The type of church above described was used as a model for by far the majority of
                    early churches not only in Rome but also in England, France, Germany, and other
                    Western countries. Another form was, however, occasionally used in Rome, which
                    appears to have been derived from the round temple of pagan times. This is a
                    circular building usually domed and surrounded with one or more rings of
                    pillared aisles. To this class belong the combined church and mausoleum of
                    Costanza (see fig. 27) and that of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus, both built by
                    Constantine, the former to hold the tomb of his daughters Constantia and Helena,
                    the latter that of his mother Helena. The latter is on the Via Labicana, about 2
                    miles outside</p>
                <p>Rome; it is a circular domed building, now known as the Torn Pignattara, from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jdgnatte</hi> or amphorae built into the concrett dome to
                    lighten it. The mausoleum of S. Cos tanza, close by S. Agnese fuori, is also
                    domed, with circular aisle, or rather ambulatory, the vault of the latter
                    decorated with mosaic or classical style</p>
                <p>(see Mosaic, vol. xvi. p.</p>
                <p>852). The red porphyry sarcophagi, sculptured richly with reliefs, from these
                    mausolea are now in the Vatican. On a much larger scale is the church of S.

                <p>tondo on the Ccelian, built by Pope Simplicius (468-</p>
                <p>483), with a double ring of pillared aisles, the outer one of which was pulled
                    down and a new enclosure wall built by</p>
                <p>Nicholas V. Other round churches are S. Teodoro</p>
                <p>(by the Vicus Tuscus), of the 8th century, and S.</p>
                <p>Bernardo, which is one of the domed halls of Diocletian’s tliermae, consecrated
                    as a church in 1598.</p>
                <p>Space will not allow any individual description of the very numerous and
                    important churches in Rome which are built on the above-described plan. The

                <p>Though the apses and classical columns of the naves in these churches were built
                    at the dates indicated, yet in many cases it is difficult to trace the existence
                    of the ancient walls; the alterations and additions of many centuries have
                    frequently almost wholly concealed the original structure. With the exception of
                    S. Clemente, the early choir, placed as shown in fig. 26, has invariably been
                    destroyed; the side walls have often been broken through by the addition of rows
                    of chapels; and the whole church, both within and without, has been overlaid
                    with the most incongruous architectural features in stucco or stone. The open
                    roof is usually concealed either by a wooden panelled ceiling or by a stucco
                    vault. The throne <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some
                    of these marble thrones which still exist are very interesting relics of

                    Athens, whence probably some of those in Rome were brought in classical times.
                    Examples of these Greek thrones exist at S. Pietro in Vincoli, S. Stefano
                    Rotondoand in the Lateran cloister. </p></note> and marble benches in the apse
                    have usually given place to more modern wooden fittings, to suit the later
                    position of the choir, which has always been transferred from the nave to the
                    apse. In many cases the mosaics of the apse and the columns of the nave are the
                    only visible remains of the once simple and stately original church. <note

                    the end of the 12th that any important revival began. The 13th century was,
                    however, one of great artistic activity, when an immense number of beautiful
                    works, especially in marble enriched with mosaic, were produced in Rome. This
                    revival, though on different lines, was very similar to the rather later one
                    which took place at Pisa (see Pisano), and, like that, was mainly due to the

                    family, but unsigned, exist in Rome. These are mainly altars and baldacchini,
                    choir-screens, paschal candlesticks, ambones, tombs, and the like, all enriched
                    with sculpture and glass mosaic of great brilliance and decorative effect.</p>
                <p>Besides the more mechanical sort of work, such as mosaic patterns and
                    architectural decoration, they also produced mosaic pictures and sculpture of
                    very high merit, especially the recumbent effigies, with angels standing at the
                    head and foot, in the tombs of Ara Cceli, S. Maria Maggiore, anti elsewhere. One
                    of their finest works is in S. Cesareo; this is a marble altar richly decorateel
                    with mosaic in sculptured panels, and (below) two angels drawing back a curtain
                    (all in marble) so as to expose the open grating of the confessio. The
                    magnificent cloisters of S. Paolo fuori Ie Mura, built about 1285 by Giovanni,
                    the youngest of the Cosmati, are one of the most beautiful works of this school.
                    The baldacchino of the same basilica is a signed work of the Florentine Arnolfo
                    del Cambio, 1285, “cum suo socio Petro,” probably a pupil of the Cosmati. Other
                    works of Arnolfo, such as the Braye tomb at Ohvieto (g ’ .v.), show an intimate
                    artistic alliance between him and the Cosmati. The equally magnificent cloisters
                    of the Lateran, of about the same date, are very similar in design; both these
                    triumphs of the sculptor-architect’s and mosaicist’s work have slender marble
                    columns, twisted or straight, richly inlaid with bands of glass mosaic in
                    delicate and brilliant patterns. The shrine of the Confessor at AVestminster is
                    a work of this school, executed about 1268 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mosaic).
                    The general style of works of the Cosmati school is</hi></p>
                <p>Gothic in its main lines, especially in the elaborate altar-canopies, with their
                    pierced geometrical tracery. In detail, however, they differ widely from the
                    purer Gothic of northern countries. The richness of effect which the English or
                    French architect obtained by elaborate and carefully worked mouldings was
                    produced in Italy by the beauty of polished marbles and jewel-like mosaics,—the
                    details being mostly rather coarse and often carelessly executed.</p>
                <p>Chiefly to the 13th century belong the large number of beautiful campanili, which
                    are the most conspicuous relics of the mediaeval period in Rome. The finest of
                    these are attached to the churches of S. AIaria Nuova, SS. Giovanni e Paolo, and
                    S. Maria Maggiore. Others belong to the basilicas of S. Lorenzo fuori and S.
                    Croce in Gerusalemme, and to S. Giorgio in Velabro, S. Maria in Cosmedin, S.
                    Alessio, S. Giovanni ad Portam Latinam, S. Cecilia, S. Crisogono, and S.
                    Pudentiana. They occupy various positions with regard to the church, being all
                    later additions; that of SS. Giovanni e Paolo stands at some distance from it.
                    In design they are very similar, consisting of many stages, divided by brick and
                    marble cornices; in the upper stories are from two to four windows on each side,
                    with round arches supported on slender marble columns. They are decorated with

                    The walls are built of fine neat brickwork. One campanile (that of S. Maria
                    Maggiore), the largest and once the handsomest of all, has string-courses of
                    enamelled and coloured terra-cotta. The slender columns of the windows have
                    often proved insufficient to support the weight, and so many of the arches are
                    built up. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See De

                    arches and marble columns. The windows were usually formed of large marble slabs
                    with trefoilshaped heads or cusped arches. As a rule the upper stories projected
                    slightly over the lower wall, and were supported on small ornamental
                    machicolations. The top story frequently had an open loggia, with rows of
                    pointed arches. AVhen vaulting was used it also was of the pointed form, usually
                    in simple quadripartite bays, with slightly moulded groin-ribs. The finest
                    existing specimen ol this style is the palace built about 1300 by Boniface VIIL
                    (Gaetanc family), enclosing the tomb of Cecilia AIetella on the Via Appia, with
                    a graceful little chapel within the precincts of the castle. This building is
                    very worthy of study; the remaining part is well preserved. Many houses of this
                    period, though generally much injured by alterations, still exist in Rome. They
                    are mostly in out-of-the-way alleys, and, not being mentioned in any books, are
                    seldom examined. The Ghetto and the quarter near the Ponte Rotto contain many of
                    these interesting buildings, as well as some of the most crowded parts of the
                    Trastevere district; all are rapidly disappearing under the wholesale
                    destruction of old streets now in progress. Among those which may possibly
                    escape for a while is the 13th-century house -where Giulio Romano lived, near
                    the Palazzo di Venezia, and the Albergo del Orso, at the end of the Via di
                    Tordi-nona, of the same period, which was an inn in the 16th century and is one
                    still; this has remains of a fine upper loggia, with rich cornices in moulded
                    terra-cotta; the lowest story has pointed vaulting resting on many pillars.

                    property of the emperors, was given by Constantine as a residence for S.
                    Sylvester; it was very much enlarged at many periods during the next ten
                    centuries; in 1308 a great part was burnt, and in 1586 the ancient palace was
                    completely destroyed by Sixtus V., and the present palace built by Domenico
                    Fontana. The Cappella Sancta Sanctorum (see list of Cosmati works) is the only

                    remains.</p>
                <p>The Vatican palace also appears to have originated in a house which existed in
                    the time of Constantine. This was rebuilt by Innocent III. (c. 1200) and
                    enlarged by Nicholas III. (1277-80). It did not, however, become the fixed
                    residence of the popes till after the return from Avignon in 1377. In 1415 John
                    XXIIL connected the Vatican and the castle of S. Angelo by a covered passage
                    carried on arches. But little of the existing palace is older than the 15th
                    century; Nicholas V. in 1447 began its reconstruction on a magnificent scale,
                    and this was earned on by Sixtus IV. (Sistine chapel), Alexander VI.
                    (Appartamenti Borgia), Julius II. and Leo X. (Bramante’s cortile and paintings
                    by Raphael), and Paul III. (Sala Regia and Cappella Paolina by Antonio da
                    Sangallo). Sixtus V. and his successors built the lofty part of the palace on
                    the east of Bramante’s cortile. The Scala Regia was built by Bernini for Urban
                    VIII., the Aluseo Pio-Clementino under ClementXIV. and Pius VI., the Braccio
                    Nuovo under Pius A <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> IL, and lastly the grand stairs

                <p>The Quirinal palace, now occupied by the king of Italy, is devoid of
                    architectural merit. It stands on the highest part of the hill, on the site of
                    part of thé baths of Constantine. This palace was begun in 1574, under Gregory
                    XIII., by Flaminio Ponzio, and was completed by Fontana and AIaderna under
                    subsequent popes.</p>

                    classical buildings; it has a long but somewhat unintelligible inscription over

                <p>The only important church in Rome which is wholly Gotliic in style is S. Maria
                    sopra Minerva, the chief church of the Dominican order. This was not the work of
                    a Roman architect, but was designed by two Dominican friars from Florence—Fra
                    Ristoro and Fra Sisto-about 1289, who were also the architects of their own
                    church of S. Maria Novella. It much resembles the contemporary churches of the
                    same order in Florence, having wide-spanned pointed arches on clustered piers
                    and simple quadripartite vaulting. Its details resemble the early French in
                    character. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The absence
                    of a triforium is one of the chief reasons why the large Gothic churches of

                    most elaborate specimen of ecclesiastical Gothic in Rome is that part of S.
                    Maria in Ara Cceli which was rebuilt about 1300, probably by one of the Cosmati,
                    namely, the south aisle and transept. For at least two centuries after the death
                    of Giovanni Cosmas no native Roman appears to have excelled in any branch of the
                    fine arts. The sculptured effigy and reredos of Cardinal Alençon in S. Maria in
                    Trastevere, executed about 1400 by a certain Paulus Romanns, is a fair example
                    of the decadence which took place during this period; the effigy is a very
                    clumsy and feeble copy of the fine recumbent figures of the Cosmati.</p>

                <p>The long period of almost complete artistic inactivity in Rome was broken iu the
                    15th century by the introduction of a number of foreign artists, chiefly
                    Florentines, who during this and the succeeding century enriched Rome with an
                    immense number of magnificent works of art. The dawn of this brilliant epoch may
                    be said to have begun with the arrival of Fra Angelico (see Fiesole) in 1447,
                    invited by Nicholas V. to paint the Avails of his small private chapel in the
                    Vatican dedicated to S. Lorenzo.</p>
                <p>To Mino da Fiesole (see Mino nι Giovanni, vol. xvi. p. 477), who spentseveral
                    years in Rome between 1470 and 1484, and other Florentine sculptors are due
                    almost all the very beautiful sculptured tombs which λvere made for a large
                    number of the Roman churches during the last thirty years of the 15th century,
                    as well as many altar frontals, reredoses, tabernacles, and the like. Though
                    varied in details, most of these tombs are designed after one type, that
                    employed by Mino in his fine monuments in the Badia at Florence. A life-sized
                    recumbent effigy lies on a richly ornamented sarcophagus, over which is an
                    arched canopy decorated with reliefs; the piers which support this (usually)
                    have statuettes in two or more tiers. Forgrace and refined beauty no type of
                    sepulchral monument has ever equalled this Florentine design. The peaceful
                    attitude and calm face of the effigy are frequently of the most perfect beauty,
                    and the minute statuettes and reliefs are finished with ivory-like delicacy.
                    Though the influence of Mino, very strongly marked, may be traced in all these
                    numerous works (there are in Rome more than a hundred tombs of this class), yet
                    a very small proportion can be actually by his hand. Mino created and trained a
                    large school of sculptor-pupils in Rome, some of whom appear almost to have
                    equalled their master in skill; and it is to them that most of these works must
                    be referred. A very long list of churches containing sculpture of this class
                    might be given; perhaps the richest are S. Maria in Monserrato (the cloisters)
                    and S. Maria del Popolo. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    for Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, and probably designed the Sistine chapel
                    for Sixtus IV. in 1473. Other buildings were carried out by another Florentine,
                    Giuliano da Majano (see Ferrerio, <hi rend="italic">Palazzi di Ronιa,</hi>
                    1825). The Palazzo di Venezia, begun for Cardinal Barbo, afterwards Paul IL,
                    about 1455, a very massive and stately building of mediaeval character, was
                    designed by Francesco di Borgo San Sepolcro.</p>
                <p>During the latter part of the 15th and the first few years of the succeeding

                    seen. With the most consummate skill, he combined the delicacy of detail and the
                    graceful lightness of the Gothic style with the measured stateliness and
                    rhythmical proportions of classic architecture. Though lie invariably used the
                    round arch and took his mouldings from antique sources, his beautiful cloisters
                    and Ioggie are Gothic in their general conception. Moreover, he never committed
                    the prevalent blunder of the 16th century, which was a fruitless attempt to
                    obtain magnificence by mere size in a building, without multiplying its parts.
                    His principal works in Rome are the magnificent Palazzo della Cancelleria, built
                    for Cardinal</p>
                <p>Riario in 1495, with its stately church of S. Lorenzo in Damaso; the so-called
                    Palazzo di Bramante in the Governo Vecchio, built in 1500; and the Palazzo
                    Giraud, near St Γeter ’ s, once the residence of Cardinal Wolsey, built in 1506.
                    He also built the cortile of S. Damaso in the Vatican, the toy-like tempietto in
                    the cloister of S. Pietro in Montorio, and'the cloisters of S. Maria della Pace,
                    1504. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The upper· story
                    of the latter is varied by having horizontal lintels instead of arches on the

                    made complete designs for it, with a plan in the form of a Greek cross. The
                    piers and arches of the central dome were the only parts completed at the time
                    of his death in 1514, and subsequent architects did not carry out his design.

                    and the Palazzo Vidoni (usually attributed to Raphael) are from his designs.

                    so soon began, owing mainly to the rapidly growing love for the dull
                    magnificence of the pseudo-classic style. This falling oft' in architectural
                    taste was due to Michelangelo (g ’ .τ.) more than to any other one man. His
                    cortile of the Farnese palace, though a work of much stately beauty, was one of
                    the first stages towards that lifeless scholasticism and blind following of
                    antique forms which were the destruction of architecture as a real living art,
                    and in the succeeding century produced so much that is almost brutal in its
                    coarseness and neglect of all true canons of proportion and scale. During the
                    earlier stage, however, of this decadence and throughout the 16th century a
                    large number offine palaces and churches were built in and near Rome by various
                    able artists, such as the Villa Madama by Raphael, part of the Palazzo Farnese
                    by Antonio da Sangallo the younger, S. Giovanni de’ Fiorentini by Jac.

                    Fontana (1634-1714), and others architectural beauty in Rome steadily declined,
                    till the prevalent style became a mere caricature of classical forms, twisted
                    and contorted into every possible incongruous and ridiculous shape, void of all
                    sense of harmony of proportion and unredeemed by any grace or even decency of
                    detail. Clumsy weightiness and extravagance of outline, with the frequent
                    introduction of the most ungraceful curves, are the main characteristics of this
                    unhappy period, which, unfortunately, was one of great activity in building. The
                    degraded taste of the 17th and 18th centuries could see no beauty in the stately
                    simplicity of the early basilicas, in the delicate grace and rich ornament of
                    the Cosmati period, or even in the refined harmonious beauty of the Renaissance.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Even the frescos of the
                    chief earlier artists were not spared; those by Pinturicchio in the 3d chapel
                    (south) of S. Maria del Popolo were covered by wretched stucco ornaments, only
                    removed in 1850; and numberless works of art by Giotto and other early painters
                    were wilfully destroyed. </p></note> Every church in Rome is more or less
                    disfigured inside with extravagant stucco pilasters and reliefs, transfiguring
                    the whole interior, while outside many have clumsy façades stuck on without the
                    slightest reference to the structures they are meant to decorate. The Lateran
                    basilica is one of the most conspicuous instances of this sad treatment of a
                    grand old building; and the hideous façades which disfigure the fine churches of
                    S. Marcello and S. Maria in Via Lata (both in the Corso) are typical examples of
                    the degradation into which architecture had sunk in its latest stages. In the
                    present century taste has somewhat improved. Since 1870, when Rome became the
                    capital, an immense amount of building has been carried out, mostly innocent in
                    design, though dull and lifeless. The modern architects of Rome possess the rare
                    merit'of acknowledging their own artistic incapacity, and the more important
                    recent buildings have been copies, fairly faithful in design though not in
                    material, of fine palaces of the best 15th and 16th century architects. The
                    Cassa di Risparmio in the Corso and some large houses in the new quarter across
                    the Tiber are good copies of the Strozzi and other Florentine palaces; the Hotel
                    Bristol is from a fine palace at Venice; and Bramante’s Palazzo Giraud has been
                    imitated in a new house near the Piazza Nicosia. Unfortunately stucco is mainly
                    used for the exteriors of these otherwise handsome buildings, a material which,
                    however, lasts fairly well in the mild climate of Rome. The growing rage for the
                    Parisian style of building, with wide straight boulevards, is rapidly destroying
                    all the picturesqueness of the city; and these broad streets, from their want of
                    shade, are not suited to an almost constantly sunny climate.</p>

                    of S. Γaolo fuori Ie Mura, burnt in 1823, in a style of great splendour, though
                    somewhat cold in effect. Its columns are enormous monoliths of grey granite from
                    the Alps; the confessio and transepts are lined with rosso and verde antico from
                    the recently rediscovered quarries in Greece, and with Egyptian alabaster. The
                    reconsecration of this magnificent edifice took place in 1854, after thirty
                    years had been spent in the rebuilding; the east façade, with its new gaudy
                    mosaics, and the atrium are not yet complete. <note anchored="true"

                    the destruction of the ancient apse and its ambulatory, the only part of the
                    church which had escaped complete disfigurement. The priceless mosaics of the
                    apse (1290), among the most 'beautiful in Rome, have been refixed in the new
                    apse, but of course in a sadly modernized and restored form. <note

                <p>The Vatican contains the largest collection in the world of Groeco-Roman and
                    Roman sculpture, with a .few specimens of true Hellenic art. It is also very
                    rich in Greek vases and in objects from Etruscan tombs; this latter division is
                    called the Museo Gregoriano. There is also an Egyptian museum. In the great
                    library are preserved a number of early glass chalices <note anchored="true"

                    well as many fine specimens of later Christian art,—church plate and jewels. The
                    picture gallery, though not as large as some of the private collections in Rome,
                    contains few inferior pictures. The Lateran palace, still, like the Vatican, in
                    the possession of the pope, contains a fine collection of classical sculpture,
                    but is most remarkable as a museum of Christian antiquities. The two Capitoline
                    museums are very rich in classical sculpture, bronzes, coins, pottery, and the
                    contents of early Etruscan and Latin tombs. A large hall has lately been added,
                    and is filled with sculpture found on the Esquiline since 1870. The picture
                    gallery contains a few masterpieces and a large number of inferior works. A new
                    museum is now (1886) being formed in the great cloister of S. Maria degli Angeli
                    to hold the numerous fine examples of classical painting and sculpture found
                    along the Tiber during the excavations for the new embankment, and in other
                    places in Rome. The university of Rome possesses fine collections of minerals,
                    fossils, and other geological specimens, and examples of ancient marbles used in
                    the buildings of Rome.</p>
                <p>A new Museo Artistico has recently been formed in a monastery in the Capo Ie
                    Case, to contain mediaeval works of art; it will probably be rapidly increased.
                    The Museo Kircheriano is in some respects unique of its kind. It contains an
                    unrivalled collection of prehistoric objects found in Italy and its islands, in
                    stone, bronze, iron, and pottery. The collection of aes grave is the finest yet
                    made; and the museum also contains a large quantity of interesting classical
                    antiquities of various kinds. Another branch is the Ethnological Museum, as yet
                    of no great importance. Unfortunately all these museums are badly adapted for
                    purposes of study, being neither well arranged nor catalogued.</p>
                <p>Among the private collections of pictures the Borghese is quite unrivalled. The
                    next in importance is that in the Doria palace, which, however, like most
                    Italian collections, contains a large proportion of very inferior works. The
                    Corsini picture gallery, lately bought by the municipality of Rome, is chiefly
                    rich in the works of the Bolognese and other third-rate painters. The Bar-berini
                    and Sciarra-Colonna palaces contain a few fine paintings; those in the latter
                    collection are now’ arranged in the ow <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ner's
                    private apartments, and are not visible to the public.</p>
                <p>The largest private collection of sculpture is that of the Villa Albani, which,
                    among a large mass of inferior Roman sculpture, contains a few gems of Greek
                    art. The original Albani collection was stolen and brought to Paris by Napoleon
                    I., and was there dispersed; one relief, the celebrated Antinous, is the only
                    piece of sculpture from the original collection which was sent back from Paris.
                    The owner of this is now Prince Torlonia, who also possesses a very large
                    collection of classical sculpture formed by himself; it contains several very
                    fine works, but unfortunately the greater number are much injured and falsified
                    by restorations. The casino in the Borghese gardens possesses a great quantity
                    of sculpture, mostly third-rate Roman works. The small collection of the Villa

                    few works of Greek sculpture of the highest importance, of which the chief are
                    the Pergamean group of the suicide of the Gaulish chief, a relief of Medusa’s
                    head, and a male terminal figure. Many other palaces, such as that of the
                    Colonna family, contain less important collections of sculpture and
                    painting..</p>

                    elapsed since Rome became the capital of Italy (1870-1886) the population has
                    largely increased, chiefly owing to the introduction of a great number of
                    Government officials with their families from Northern Italy. Under the last
                    papal census the number of inhabitants was 216,000; in 1881 it had increased to
                    276,463. Education of the working classes has much improved in these years, and
                    there are now nearly 170 parochial schools. The streets are remarkable for their
                    cleanliness, and are mostly well paved with hard lava and well lighted with gas.
                    For municipal purposes Rome is still divided into the fourteen mediaeval
                    “rioni”; these, though corresponding in number with the fourteen regiones of
                    Augustus, include very different areas. The climate is mild and sunny, in winter
                    averaging 10° Fahr, above the temperature of London; but the variation between
                    day and night is very great. The coldest months are December and Febmary
                    (average temp. 47°); the hottest are Julyand August (average 75°). The rainfall
                    is slight, averaging 16,,th inches annually, and the rainy days are few
                    proportionally. On the whole Rome is a healthy city, in spite of some malaria,
                    usually confined to its more open parts. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    uninhabitable during the summer from this cause; but the malaria is much checked
                    by the planting of eucalyptus trees, which grow rapidly in and about the city. A
                    very remarkable instance of this is the Trappist nιonasteιy of the Tre Fontane,
                    about 4 miles from Rome on the Ostian road, which a few years ago was quite
                    uninhabitable in the summer, while since a number of these trees have been
                    planted the monks reside there with impunity throughout the year. Though almost
                    free from typhus, there is a good deal of enteric fever in Rome, partly owing to
                    the very unwholesome arrangement of the drainage in each house, though the
                    general system of sewerage is good. That this disease is not more prevalent is
                    probably owing to the magnificent water-supply <note anchored="true"
