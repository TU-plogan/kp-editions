                    Comte de</hi> (1797-1875), French politician and man of letters, was born at
                    Paris on the 13th March 1797.. His father, also Comte de Rémusat, of a good
                    though not very dis-! tinguished family in the district of Toulouse, was a man
                    of! considerable literary taste, of much administrative ability, and of moderate
                    Liberal views in politics. He was chamberlain to Napoleon, but disapproved of
                    the emperor’s absolutist government and aggressive policy, and after the
                    restoration became prefect first of the Haute Garonne and then of the Nord. His
                    wife (mother of Charles) was a still more remarkable person, whose full
                    abilities have only recently been made known. Her maiden name was Claire
                    Elisabeth Jeanne Gravier de Vergennes. She was born in 1780, and was early
                    introduced to the salons, which reopened after the cessation of the Terror. She
                    married the Comte de Rémusat when she was very young, and was! long attached to
                    the service of Josephine, to whom she was <pb break="no"

                    Talleyrand was a particular admirer of hers, and she was generally recognized as
                    a woman of great intellectual capacity as well as of much personal grace and
                    charm. After her death (1824) an <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">VLfucation des Femmes</hi> was published and received an academic
                    <hi rend="italic">couronne.</hi> But it was not till 1879, when her grandson M.
                    Paul de Remusat published her memoirs, which have since been followed by some
                    correspondence with her son, that justice could be generally done to her
                    literary talent. The light thrown on the Napoleonic court by this remarkable
                    book was great, and !Madame de Remusat appeared as hardly the inferior of the
                    best memoir and letter writers of the previous century. The same documents
                    contained much information on the youth and education of her son Charles. He
                    very early developed political views more decidedly Liberal than those of his
                    parents, and, being bred to the bar, published in 1820 a short pamphlet on jury
                    trial. He was also an active journalist, showing in philosophy and literature
                    the special influence of Cousin. He was, however, at the same time a thorough
                    man of the world, and is said to have furnished to no small extent the original
                    of Balzac’s brilliant egoist Henri de Marsay. He took no active part in politics
                    till the revolution of July, when he signed the journalists’ protest against the
                    Ordinances, and in the following October was elected deputy for Toulouse. He
                    then ranked himself with the “doctrinaires,” and supported (being a speaker of
                    no small power) most of those measures of restriction on popular liberty which
                    rapidly made the July monarchy unpopular with French Radicals. In 1836 he became
                    under-secretary of state for the interior, but did not hold the post lo <hi
                    rend="subscript">v</hi> ng. He then became an ally of Thiers, and in 1840 held
                    the ministry of the interior for a short time. In the same year he became an
                    Academician.</p>
                <p>For the rest of Louis Philippe’s reign lie was in opposition till he joined
                    Thiers in his brief and hopeless attempt at a ministry in the spring of 1848.
                    During this time Remusat constantly spoke in the chamber, but was still more
                    active in literature, especially on philosophical subjects,—the most remarkable
                    of his works being his book on <hi rend="italic">Abélard</hi> (1845). In 1848 he
                    was elected, and in 1849 re-elected, for the department of Haute Garonne and sat
                    on the Conservative side. But he would not support Louis Napoleon, and had to
                    leave France after the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état;</hi> nor did he re-enter
                    political life at all during the second empire, though his son M. Paul de
                    Remusat stood for the Haute Garonne, and was very nearly elected, in 1869. Nor
                    would he at first accept the advances made him after the establishment of the
                    third republic. In 1871 he was appointed minister of foreign affairs and
                    accepted the post. Although minister he was not a deputy, and on standing for
                    Paris in September 1873 he was beaten by M. Barodet. A month later he was
                    elected (having already resigned with Thiers) for the Haute Garonne by a very
                    great majority. He died at Paris on the 6th April 1875.</p>
                <p>During his long abstention from political life Remusat continued to write on his
                    favourite subjects of philosophical history and especially English philosophical
                    history. <hi rend="italic">Saint Anselme de Cantor-béry</hi> appeared in 1854;
                    <hi rend="italic">L’Angleterre au XVII Feme siècle</hi> in 1856 (2d ed.
                    enlarged, 1865); <hi rend="italic">Bacon, sa vie, son temps, dec.,</hi> in 1858;
                    <hi rend="italic">Channing, sa vie et ses oeuvres,</hi> in 1862; <hi
                    rend="italic">John Wesley</hi> in 1870; <hi rend="italic">Lord Herbert of
                    Chcrbury</hi> in 1874; <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la philosophie en
                    Angleterre depuis Bacon jusqu’à Locke,</hi> in 1875; besides other and minor
                    works. The impression derived from these and from the political records of his
                    life is that he was on the whole one of those men whose performances are unequal
                    to their powers. He wrote well, was a forcible speaker, and an acute critic; but
                    his adoption of the indeterminate eclecticism of Cousin in philosophy and of the
                    somewhat similarly indeterminate liberalism of Thiers in politics probably had a
                    bad effect on him, though both no doubt accorded with his critical and
                    unenthusiastic turn of mind.</p>
