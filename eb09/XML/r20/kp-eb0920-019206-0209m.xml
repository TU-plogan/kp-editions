                <p><label type="entry">RABBIT</label>. This animal, one of the best known and most
                    frequently seen of all wild British mammals, is, with the hare, a member of the
                    Rodent genus <hi rend="italic">Lepus,</hi> which contains about twenty-five
                    other species spread over the greater part of the world, and whose more
                    important characters have already been referred to (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hare,</hi> vol. xi. p. 476, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> vol. xv. p.
                    421).</p>
                <p>The rabbit <hi rend="italic">(Lepus cuniculus),</hi> speaking for the present of
                    the wild race only, is distinguished from the hare externally by its smaller
                    size, shorter ears and feet, by the absence or reduction of the black patch at
                    the tip of the ears so characteristic of the hare, and by its greyer colour. The
                    skull is very similar to that of the hare (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> fig. 99), but is smaller and lighter, and has a slenderer muzzle
                    and a longer and narrower palate. Besides these characters, however, the rabbit
                    is sharply separated from the hare by the fact that it brings forth its young
                    naked, blind, and helpless; to compensate for this, it digs a deep burrow in the
                    earth in which they are born and reared, while the young of the hare are born
                    fully clothed with fur, and able to take care of themselves in the mere shallow
                    depression or “form” in which they are born. The weight of the rabbit is from 2|
                    to 3 lb, although individuals perfectly wild have been recorded up to more than
                    5. Its general habits are too well known to need a detailed description here. It
                    breeds from four to eight times a year, bringing forth each time from three to
                    eight young. Its period of gestation is about thirty days, and it is able to
                    bear when six months old. It attains to an age of about seven or eight
                    years.</p>
                <p>The geographical distribution of the rabbit presents many most interesting
                    peculiarities. It is believed to be originally a native of the western half of
                    the Mediterranean basin only, and still abounds in Spain, Sardinia, southern
                    Italy and Sicily, Greece, Tunis, and Algeria; and many of the islands adjoining
                    these countries are quite overrun with it. Thence it has spread, partly by man’s
                    agency, northwards throughout temperate western Europe, increasing rapidly
                    wherever it gains a footing; and this extension is still going on, as is shown
                    by the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0210-0193"/>case of Scotland, in which sixty years ago rabbits
                    were little known, while they are now found in all suitable localities up to the
                    extreme north. It has also gained admittance into Ireland, and now abounds there
                    as much as in England. Out of Europe the same extension of range has been going
                    on. In New Zealand and Australia rabbits, introduced either for profit or sport,
                    have increased to such an extent as to form one of the most serious pests that
                    the farmers have to contend against, as the climate and soil seem to suit them
                    perfectly and their natural enemies are too few and too lowly organized to keep
                    their numbers within reasonable bounds. In other cases rabbits introduced into
                    islands have become or remained more or less distinct from their parent stock;
                    thus the rabbits both of the Falkland Islands and of Jamaica still show traces
                    of their descent from domesticated varieties, and have never reverted to the
                    ordinary brownish-grey type. And again, as was pointed out by Mr Darwin, <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Variation</hi><hi rend="italic">of Animals and Plants,</hi> 2d ed., i. p. 119.
                    </p></note> the rabbits in the island of Porto Santo, near Madeira, whose
                    ancestors were introduced from Spain in 1418 or 1419, have formed quite a
                    distinct diminutive race, barely half the bulk or weight of English rabbits, and
                    differing in certain slight details of colour and habits.</p>
                <p>The rabbit has been domesticated by man from a very early period. No doubt exists
                    amongst naturalists that all the varieties of the domestic animal are descended
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Lepus cuniculus.</hi> The variations which have been
                    perpetuated and intensified by artificial selection are, with the exception of
                    those of the dog, greater than have been induced in any other species of mammal.
                    For not only has the weight been more than quadrupled in some of the larger
                    breeds, and the structure of the skull and other parts of the skeleton greatly
                    altered, but the proportionate size of the brain has been considerably reduced
                    and the colour and texture of the fur altered in the most remarkable manner. The
                    establishment of these extreme variations is dependent on the highly artificial
                    conditions under which the animals are kept, their great prolificacy, and the
                    rapidity with which the generations succeed each other, which enable the process
                    of artificial selection by the preservation of those most suited to the purposes
                    of the breeder to be carried into effect with facility.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lop-eared</hi> breed is the oldest English fancy variety;
                    it has been cultivated carefully for about a century, the aim of the breeder
                    being chiefly directed to the development of the size of the ears, and with such
                    success that they sometimes measure more than 23 inches from tip to tip and
                    exceed 6 inches in width. This development, which is accompanied by great
                    changes in the structure of the skull, that have been carefully described by
                    Darwin in his <hi rend="italic">Variation of Animals,</hi> &amp;c., depends on
                    breeding the animals in warm damp hutches, without which the best developed
                    parents fail to produce the desired offspring. In colour the lop-eared rabbits
                    vary greatly.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Belgian hare</hi> is a large variety of a hardy and
                    prolific character, which closely resembles the common hare in colour, and is
                    not unlike it in form. Some few years since many of these animals were sold as
                    leporides or hybrids, produced by the union of the hare and the rabbit; but the
                    most careful experimenters have failed to obtain any such hybrid, and the naked
                    immature condition in which young rabbits are born as compared with the clothed
                    and highly developed young hares renders it exceedingly unlikely that hybrids
                    could be produced. Nor does the flesh of the Belgian rabbit resemble that of the
                    hare in colour or flavour. A closely allied variety, though of even larger size,
                    is known by the absurd name of <hi rend="italic">Patagonian</hi> rabbit; it has
                    no relation to the country after which it is called.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Angora</hi> rabbit is characterized by the extreme
                    elongation and fineness of the fur, which in good specimens reaches 6 or 7
                    inches in length, requiring great care and frequent combing to prevent it from
                    becoming matted. The Angoras most valued are albinos, with pure white fur and
                    pink eyes; in some parts of the Continent they are kept by the peasants and
                    clipped regularly.</p>
                <p>Amongst the breeds which are valued for the distribution of colour on the fur are
                    the <hi rend="italic">Himalayan</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Dutch.</hi> The
                    former is white, but the whole of the extremities—viz., the nose, the ears,
                    tail, and feet—are black or very dark in colour. This very pretty breed has no
                    connexion with the mountain chain from whence it has taken its name, but is a
                    variety produced by careful breeding and selection as fully described by Darwin
                    ( <hi rend="italic">op. cit.).</hi> Though but recently produced by crossing, it
                    now generally breeds true to colour, at times throwing back, however, to the
                    silver greys from which it was derived. The rabbits known in Great Britain as
                    Dutch are of small size, and are valued for the disposition of the colour and
                    markings. The entire body behind the shoulder-blades is uniformly coloured, with
                    the exception of the feet; the anterior part of the body, including the fore
                    legs, neck, and jaws, is white, the cheeks and ears being coloured. In some
                    strains the coloured portion extends in front of the fore legs, leaving only a
                    ring of white round the neck. The more accurately the coloured portion is
                    defined the higher is the animal esteemed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Silver grey</hi> is a uniform coloured variety, the fur of
                    which is a rich chinchilla grey, varying in depth of colour in the different
                    strains. From the greater value of the fur silver greys have been frequently
                    employed to stock warrens, as they breed true to colour in the open if the
                    ordinary wild rabbits are rigorously excluded. Other colours known, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Silver cream</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Silver brown,</hi> are
                    closely allied varieties.</p>
                <p>As an article of food the domesticated rabbit is of considerable importance. From
                    100 to 200 tons are imported into London from Ostend every week during the
                    colder months of the year, having been reared in hutches by the Belgian
                    peasants. They are forwarded without their skins, which are half the value of
                    the flesh. A plan has been recently devised by Major Morant, which is known as
                    “hutch-farming in the open.” The animals are kept in large hutches with
                    projecting roofs, floored with coarse galvanized iron netting, through which the
                    grass projects to be eaten by the rabbits. The hutches are shifted twice or
                    thrice a day, so that the animals are constantly on clean ground and have fresh
                    food. The young, when old enough to leave the mother, are reared in somewhat
                    larger hutches of a similar description and killed for market under three months
                    of age.</p>
