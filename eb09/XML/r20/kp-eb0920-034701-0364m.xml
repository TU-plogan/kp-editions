                    (1811-1878), was born on July 21, 1811, at Aix-la-Chapelle. His early life was a
                    struggle with poverty. When a boy he went to Paris, and after a time succeeded
                    in obtaining a situation in a large drapery establishment, where he remained,
                    occupying every spare hour in study, until he was in his twentieth year. Then he
                    entered the École Polytechnique, and, after making the best use of his increased
                    opportunities, passed in 1832 to the Ecole des Mines, where he developed an
                    aptitude for experimental chemistry.</p>
                <p>A few years later he was appointed to a professorship of chemistry at Lyons, and
                    devoted himself to research amongst organic compounds. He paid little attention
                    to theories and cared only for facts; but, by his unequivocal proof of the
                    substitution of chlorine for hydrogen in hydrocarbons, he greatly assisted his
                    countrymen Laurent and Dumas in establishing the type-theory of organic
                    compounds. Regnault’s most important chemical work was a series of researches,
                    commenced in 1835, on the haloid and other derivatives of unsaturated
                    hydrocarbons. This made him the discoverer of the vinyl group of compounds,
                    carbon tetrachloride (CC1 <hi rend="subscript">4</hi> ), and of perchlorether (C
                    <hi rend="subscript">4</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript">10</hi> O). He studied many
                    of the natural alkaloids and organic acids, introduced a classification of the
                    metals according to the facility with which they or their sulphides are oxidized
                    by steam at high temperatures, and effected a comparison of the chemical
                    composition of atmospheric air from all parts of the world.</p>
                <p>In 1840 Régnault was recalled to Paris by his appointment to the chair of
                    chemistry in the École Polytechnique; at the same time he was elected a member
                    of the Académie des Sciences, in the chemical section, in room of M. Robiquet;
                    and in the following year he became professor of physics in the Collège de
                    Prance, there succeeding Dulong, his old master, and in many respects his model.
                    From this time Régnault devoted almost all his attention to practical physics;
                    but in 1847 he published a four-volume treatise on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chemistry</hi> which was highly esteemed and has been translated into many
                    languages.</p>
                <p>Régnault is perhaps best known by his careful redetermination of the specific
                    heats of all the elements obtainable, and of many compounds—solids, liquids, and
                    gases—by which he was enabled to correct the values obtained by Dulong and
                    Petit, and to reduce the number of exceptions to their law that <hi
                    rend="italic">the specific heat of an element varies inversely as its atomic
                    weight</hi> , <hi rend="italic">and of a compound as its molecular weight.</hi>
                    He investigated the expansibility of gases by heat, determined the coefficient
                    for air as 003663־, and showed that, contrary to previous opinion, no two gases
                    had precisely the same rate of expansion. By numerous delicate experiments he
                    proved Boyle’s law that <hi rend="italic">the volume of a gas is inversely as
                    the pressure it supports</hi> to be only approximately true, and that those
                    gases which are most readily liquefied diverge most widely from obedience to the
                    law. Régnault studied the whole subject of thermometry critically; he introduced
                    the use of an accurate air-thermometer, and compared its indications with those
                    of a mercurial thermometer, determining the absolute dilatation of mercury by
                    heat as a step in the process. He also paid attention to hygrometry and devised
                    a hygrometer in which a cooled metal surface is used for the deposition of
                    moisture.</p>
                <p>In 1854 he was appointed to succeed Ebelman as director of the celebrated
                    porcelain manufactory at Sèvres. He carried on the great research on the
                    expansion of gases in the laboratory at Sèvres, but all the results of his
                    latest work were destroyed during the Franco-German War, in which also his son
                    Henri (noticed above) was killed. Régnault never recovered the double blow, and,
                    although he lived until January 19, 1878, his scientific labours ended in 1872.
                    He wrote more than eighty papers on scientific subjects, and he made fine
                    researches, many of them of importance, in conjunction with other workers. His
                    greatest work, bearing on the practical treatment of steam-engines, forms vol.
                    xxi. of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences.</hi></p>
                <p>Régnault was great as a laborious worker; in all his researches he overcame every
                    difficulty by his determined perseverance, his unusual natural ingenuity in
                    devising apparatus, and his rare power of manipulation. Although few discoveries
                    are associated with his name, the mass of physical constants which he determined
                    with the utmost accuracy constitutes a powerful instrument of further advance,
                    and the thorough training which he gave his students has provided many
                    painstaking and exact workers in the field of physics.</p>
