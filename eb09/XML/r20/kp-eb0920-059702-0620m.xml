                <p><label type="entry">ROBERTSON</label> Frederick William (1816-1853), one of the
                    most brilliant and influential preachers of modern times, was born in London, on
                    3d February 1816. The first five years of his life were passed at Leith Fort,
                    where his father, a captain in the Royal Artillery, was then resident. The
                    impressions made upon the child in those early years were never effaced; the
                    military spirit entered into his blood, and throughout life he was characterized
                    by the qualities of the ideal soldier,—courage, self-devotion, sense of duty,
                    hatred of cruelty and meanness, chivalrous defence of the weak. In 1821 Captain
                    Robertson retired to Beverley, where the boy was educated first at home, then at
                    the grammar-school. At the age of fourteen he spent a year at Tours, from which
                    he returned to Scotland and continued his education at the Edinburgh Academy and
                    university. His father, who had remarked and fostered his singular nobility of
                    character, his passion for purity and truthfulness, and his deepening religious
                    feeling, noλv proposed that he should choose the church as his profession, but
                    received the decisive answer, “Anything but that; I am not fit for it.” At the
                    age of eighteen he was accordingly articled to a solicitor in Bury St Edmunds,
                    but the uncongenial and sedentary employment broke down his health in a year’s
                    time. It was then resolved to yield to his deep-rooted craving for a military
                    career: his name was placed upon the list of the 3d Dragoons then serving in
                    India, and for two years he devoted himself with ardour to the work of preparing
                    for the army. But, by a singular conjuncture of circumstances and at the
                    sacrifice of his own natural bent to his father’s wish, he matriculated at
                    Braze-nose College, Oxford, just two weeks before his commission was put into
                    his hands. Oxford he did not find wholly congenial to his intensely earnest
                    spirit, but he read hard, and, as he afterwards said, “Plato, Aristotle, Butler,
                    Thucydides, Sterne, Jonathan Edwards, passed like the iron atoms of the blood
                    into my mental constitution.” At the same time he made a careful study of the
                    Bible, committing to memory the entire New Testament both in English and in
                    Greek. The Tractarian movement had no attraction for him, although he admired
                    some of its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n621/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0621-0598"/>leaders. He was at this time a moderate Calvinist
                    in doctrine and enthusiastically evangelical. Ordained in July 1840 by the
                    bishop of Winchester, he at once entered on ministerial work in that city, and
                    during his ministry there and under the influence of Martyn and Brainerd, whose
                    lives he affectionately studied, he carried devotional asceticism to an
                    injurious length, rising early, refraining from meat, subduing his nature by
                    self-imposed austerities, and binding himself to a system of prayer. In less
                    than a year he was compelled to seek relaxation; and going to Switzerland he
                    there met and married Helen, third daughter of Sir George William Denys, Bart.
                    Early in 1842, after a few months’ rest, he accepted a curacy in Cheltenham,
                    which he retained for upwards of four years. “It was during this period that the
                    basis of his theological science was entirely changed; his principles of thought
                    attained, but not as yet systematized; his system of interpreting the Bible
                    reduced to order; his whole view of the relation of God to man and man to God
                    built up into a new temple on the ruins of the old.” The questioning spirit was
                    first aroused in him by the disappointing fruit of evangelical doctrine which he
                    found in Cheltenham, as well as by intimacy with men of varied reading. But, if
                    we are to judge from his own statement, the doubts which now actively assailed
                    him had long been latent in his mind: “a man who had read theological and
                    philosophical controversy long before with painful interest—a man who at
                    different times had lived in the atmosphere of thought in which Jonathan
                    Edwards, Plato, Lucretius, Thomas Brown, Carlyle, Emerson, and Fichte lived—who
                    has steeped his soul and memory in Byron’s strongest feelings—who has walked
                    with Newman years ago to the brink of an awful precipice, and chosen rather to
                    look upon it calmly, and know the worst of the secrets of the darkness, than
                    recoil with Newman, in fear and tenderness, back to the infallibility of
                    Romanism—such a man is not likely to have been influenced by a few casual
                    statements of difficulties which he had read of a thousand limes before.” This
                    was written from Heidelberg in 1846. The crisis of his mental conflict had just
                    been passed in Tyrol, and he was now beginning to let his creed grow again from
                    the one fixed point which nothing had availed to shift: “the one great certainty
                    to which, in the midst of the darkest doubt, I never ceased to cling —the entire
                    symmetry and loveliness and the unequalled nobleness of the humanity of the Son
                    of Man.” After this mental revolution he felt unable to return to Cheltenham,
                    but after doing duty for two months at St Ebbe’s, Oxford, he entered in August
                    1847 on his famous ministry at Trinity Chapel, Brighton. Here he stepped at once
                    into the foremost rank as a preacher. His church was thronged with thoughtful
                    men of all classes in society and of all shades of religious belief, with those
                    also who relished brilliant and sometimes impassioned oratory, and with those
                    who felt their need of sympathetic and helpful teaching. But his closing years
                    were full of sadness. His sensitive nature was subjected to extreme suffering,
                    partly from the misconstruction and hatred of the society in which he lived,
                    partly from his inability to accomplish the heavy work of his position. He was
                    crippled by incipient disease of the brain, which at first inflicted
                    unconquerable lassitude and depression, and latterly agonizing pain. On the 5th
                    June 1853 he preached for the last time; and on the 15th August of the same
                    year, at the age of thirty-seven, he found relief in death.</p>
                <p>The causes of his success as a preacher are obvious. His fine appearance, his
                    flexible and sympathetic voice, his manifest sincerity, the perfect lucidity and
                    artistic symmetry of his address, and the brilliance with which he illustrated
                    his points would have attracted hearers even had he had little to say. But he
                    had much to say. No sermons were ever more compact. They were the utterance of a
                    full, vivid, and penetrating mind. He was not, indeed, a scientific theologian;
                    but his insight into the principles of the spiritual life is unrivalled; and for
                    men approaching the truth from the same side as himself he is an invaluable
                    guide. His own lonely and independent struggle had taught him where foothold was
                    secure, and had enabled him to throw light on many a forgotten stepping-stone of
                    truth. As his biographer says, thousands have found in his sermons “a living
                    source of impulse, a practical direction of thought, a key to many of the
                    problems of theology, and above all a path to spiritual freedom.” In his hands
                    spiritual facts assume an aspect of reasonableness which is irresistible.
                    Religion is felt to be no longer a mystery for the exercise of professional
                    minds, nor an extravagance suitable for enthusiastic temperaments, but an
                    essential of life for all, and in line with the order of things in which we now
                    are. For his sermons obtained their large circulation partly because they were
                    new in kind. They marked the transition from the period in which religion was
                    treated as a series of propositions to that in which it is presented as an
                    essence penetrating the whole of human life. The accusations of heretical and
                    dangerous teaching which were persistently brought against him, though possibly
                    not so malignant as he himself supposed, were certainly more mischievous than
                    the teaching against which they were levelled. Few men have ever more perfectly
                    understood the spirit of Christ, and few have so fully made that spirit their
                    own.</p>
