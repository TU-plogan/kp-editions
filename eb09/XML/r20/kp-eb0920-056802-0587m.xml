                    adventurer, was born of noble parents in the province of Groningen in the
                    Netherlands, in 1680, and was educated in the college of the Jesuits at Cologne.
                    Shortly after leaving the college he married a Protestant, and assumed the
                    Protestant creed. In 1715 he was sent by the states on an embassy to Spain.
                    Having gained the favour of Philip V., he resigned the office of Dutch
                    ambassador, became a penitent convert to the Catholic faith, and took up his
                    permanent residence in Madrid. He made use of every influence to advance himself
                    to the first position at court, and if possible to supplant Alberoni, who,
                    provoked by his intrigues, deprived him of his pension and estate. After the
                    fall of Alberoni he succeeded in ingratiating himself with the queen, Elizabeth
                    of Parma. Returning from an embassy to Vienna in 1725, he pretended to the queen
                    that he had effected her favourite scheme of betrothing her son Don Carlos to
                    the eldest archduchess. His immediate elevation to a dukedom and to the office
                    of prime minister compelled him to persist in this imposture. Lie was backed up
                    by lie; the nation was impoverished to furnish him with hush-money; and he
                    continued to try every bungling shift until, in May 1726, he was deprived of his
                    offices, and sent a prisoner to Segovia. Making his escape after two years’
                    imprisonment, he went to England. His hopes of influence there having been
                    overthrown by the treaty of Seville in 1729, he finally collected his property
                    and set sail for Holland, arriving at The Hague in November 1731. Thence he
                    sailed to Morocco, where he was welcomed by the emperor Muley Abdallah, and,
                    becoming a Mohammedan, was placed at the head of the administration of the
                    country. But his royal patron was soon driven from the throne, and he himself
                    was glad to escape with his head to Tetuan, where he could find no better
                    employment for his restless spirit than that of asserting himself to be the last
                    and greatest of the prophets. He died at Tetuan towards the end of 1737.</p>
