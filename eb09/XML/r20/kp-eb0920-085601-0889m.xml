                    was born in 1439. At the age of fourteen he became a pupil of Neri di Bicci, and
                    in 1460 he worked as assistant to his cousin Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli. The
                    first work of Cosimo mentioned by Vasari still exists in S. Ambrogio, in
                    Florence, over the third altar on the left. It is an Assumption of the Virgin, a
                    youthful and feeble work of but little merit. In the same church, on the wall of
                    one of the chapels, is a fresco by Cosimo which Vasari praises highly,
                    especially for a portrait of the young scholar Pico of Mirandola. The scene, a
                    procession bearing a miracle-working chalice, is painted with much vigour and
                    less mannerism than most of this artist’s work. A picture painted by Rosselli
                    for the church of the Annunziata, with figures of SS. Barbara, Matthew, and the
                    Baptist, is now in the Academy of Florence. Rosselli also spent some time in
                    Lucca, where he painted several altar-pieces for various churches, none of any
                    great importance. A picture attributed to him, taken from the church of S.
                    Girolamo at Fiesole, is now in the National Gallery of London. It is a large
                    retable, with, in the centre, St Jerome in the wilderness kneeling before a
                    crucifix, and at the sides standing figures of St Damasus and St Eusebius, St
                    Paolo and St Eustachia; below is a predella with small subjects. Though dry and
                    hard in treatment, the figures are designed with much dignity. The Berlin
                    Gallery possesses three pictures by Rosselli, the Virgin in Glory, the
                    Entombment of Christ, and the Massacre of the Innocents. In 1480 Rosselli,
                    together with the chief painters of Florence, was invited by Sixtus IV. to Rome
                    to assist in the painting of the frescos in the Sistine Chapel. Three of these
                    were executed by him—the Destruction of Pharaoh’s Army in the Red Sea, Christ
                    Preaching by the Lake of Tiberias, and the Last Supper. The last of these is
                    still well preserved, but is a very mediocre work. Vasari’s story about the pope
                    admiring his paintings more than those of his abler brother painters has
                    probably but little foundation. Rosselli’s Sistiue frescos were partly painted
                    by his assistant Piero di Cosimo, who was so called after Cosimo Rosselli. His
                    chief pupil was Fra Bartolommeo. According to Vasari, Rosselli died in 1484, but
                    this is evidently a mistake, as his will still exists dated November 25, 1506
