                <p><label type="entry">RICHARD III</label>. (1452-1485), king of England, third son
                    of Richard, duke of York, and Cicely Nevil, was born at Fotheringay on October
                    2, 1452. Having been sent out of England for safety on the death of his father
                    in 1460, he was recalled next year by his brother Edward IY., who created him
                    duke of Gloucester and appointed him lord high admiral. He remained faithful to
                    his brother during the latter’s reign, sharing in his flight in 1470, and aiding
                    him on his return in the victories of Barnet and Tewkesbury. In 1474 he married
                    Anne, daughter of the earl of Warwick and widow of Prince Edward. In 1482 he led
                    an army into Scotland to aid the duke of Albany against James III., occupied
                    Edinburgh and captured Berwick. On the death of Edward IV. (April 9, 1483)
                    Richard at once made himself master of the situation by seizing Prince Edward,
                    his nephew. Having assumed the title of Protector, he rapidly developed his
                    plans for securing the crown. Under the pretext of a plot against his life, he
                    seized and beheaded Hastings, Grey, and others (June 13), forced the queen
                    mother to give up her younger son Richard, and, on June 26, 1483, assumed the
                    crown. The children of Edward IV. were set aside on the plea that their father
                    was illegitimate. On July 6 Richard w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> as crowned
                    king. Shortly afterwards it was publicly reported that the sons of Edward IV.
                    were dead; their actual fate is to the present day unknown. In October 1483 the
                    rebellion of the duke of Buckingham was put down; the duke himself was executed
                    on November 2. A parliament which met in January 1484 acknowledged Richard as
                    king, in return for which he assented to an Act abolishing benevolences. His
                    only legitimate son, Edward, died on April 9, 1484, and in March 1485 the boy
                    was followed by his mother. To strengthen his position Richard had made treaties
                    with Scotland and Brittany (1484), and he now proposed to marry his niece
                    Elizabeth. From this course, however, he was dissuaded. His short reign was
                    mainly occupied in preparing to resist the invasion of Henry of Richmond. L <hi

                    Richard met his rival in battle at Bosworth (August 22), and at the same moment

                <p>Tradition is divided as to Richard’s personal appearance, and the story of his
                    deformity is possibly derived from Lancastrian malignity and from a
                    misunderstanding of his nickname Crouchback. His courage, energy, and ability
                    would have made a great and honoured name had not those qualities been matched
                    by extreme ferocity and unscrupulousness, and perverted to an evil use by the
                    turbulente of the time and his own nearness to the throne.</p>
