                        rend="smallcaps">Sallee,</hi> a city of Morocco, on the coast of the
                    Atlantic, 130 miles south of Cape Spartel at the mouth of the Bú Raḳraḳ, which
                    separates it from Sallee proper on the northern bank. It is a commercial town of
                    about 26,000 to 30,000 inhabitants, occupying a rocky plateau and surrounded by
                    massive but dilapidated walls, strengthened by three forts on the seaward side.
                    The old citadel, overhanging the mouth of the river, is still, though partially
                    in ruins, an imposing building, with huge arched gateways, square towers, and
                    masses of rich red-brown masonry; and to the south of the town lies a modern
                    palace defended by earthworks after the European fashion. The conspicuous
                    feature in the view from the sea is the Hasan tower, a beautiful square-built
                    minaret 180 feet high, which stands at an elevation of about 65 feet above the
                    sea to the west of the walled town, and in the midst of gardens and orchards
                    whose vegetation partly hides the ruined columns of the ancient mosque to which
                    it was attached. It is constructed of soft reddish-brown stone, and each side is
                    adorned with a different design. At one time the Bú Raḳraḳ afforded a much
                    better harbour than it does now: the roadstead is quite unprotected, and there
                    is a dangerous bar at the mouth of the river. Rabát trades with Fez and the
                    interior of Morocco, with the neighbouring coast-towns and Gibraltar, and with
                    Marseilles, Manchester, and London. The principal articles of export are wool,
                    hides, and wax, and the products of that local manufacture of leather, carpets,
                    mats, woollen and cotton stuffs, pottery, and circular brass trays which makes
                    Rabát the greatest industrial centre in Morocco. Cotton goods and loaf-sugar are
                    first among the imports. The average value of the exports in the ten years 1872
                    to 1881 was £47,236, and of the imports £73,945. In 1883 the figures were
                    £39,596 and £50,222 respectively.</p>
                <p>Sallee (Salá), on the north side of the river, is also enclosed with walls. Much
                    of the interior, however, is vacant and the houses are mean; and, unlike their
                    neighbours of Rabát, the inhabitants (about 30,000) down to quite recent times
                    distinguished themselves by particular hostility to Christians, who were thus
                    prevented from entering their gates. To the north a ruined aqueduct extends for
                    miles.</p>
                <p>Rabát was founded by Yak'úb al-Manṣúr (ob. 1306); but Sallee was then an ancient
                    city, and on the scarped hills to the west of Rabát stand the ruins of Sala, a
                    Roman colony. Sheila, as the place is now called, was the seat of the mausoleum
                    of the Bení-Merín dynasty.</p>
