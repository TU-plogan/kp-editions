                    he was sent at the age of sixteen to Catherine Hall, Cambridge, whence he
                    removed to Trinity College after about one year and three-quarters. His tutor at
                    Trinity was Dr Duport, regius professor of Greek, and his intimate friend and
                    fellow-pupil the celebrated Isaac Barrow. Ray was chosen minor fellow of Trinity
                    in 1649, and in due course became a major fellow on proceeding to the master’s
                    degree. He held many college offices, becoming successively lecturer in Greek
                    (1651), mathematics (1653), and humanity (1655), prelector (1657), junior dean
                    (1657), and college steward (1659 and 1660); and according to the habit of the
                    time he was accustomed to preach in his college chapel and also at Great St
                    Mary’s before the university, long before he took holy orders. Among his sermons
                    preached before his ordination, which was not till 23d December 1660, were the
                    famous discourses on <hi rend="italic">The Wisdom of God in the Creation,</hi>
                    and on the <hi rend="italic">Chaos, Deluge, and Dissolution of the World.</hi>
                    Ray’s reputation was high also as a tutor; he communicated his own passion for
                    natural history to several pupils, of whom Francis Willughby is by far the most
                    famous.</p>
                <p>Ray’s quiet college life came to an abrupt close when he found himself unable to
                    subscribe to the Act of Uniformity of 1661, and was accordingly obliged to give
                    up his fellowship in 1662, the year after Isaac Newton had entered the college.
                    We are׳ told by Dr Derham in his <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of Ray that the
                    reason of his refusal <hi rend="italic">“</hi> was not (as some have imagined)
                    his having taken the ‘ Solemn League and Covenant,’ for that he never did, and
                    often declared that he ever thought it an unlawful oath; but he said he could
                    not declare for those that had taken the oath that no obligation lay upon them,
                    but feared there might.” From this time onwards he seems to have depended
                    chiefly on the bounty of his pupil Willughby, who made Ray his constant
                    companion while he lived, and at his death left him £60 a year, with the charge
                    of educating his two sons.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1663 Ray started together with Willughby and two other of his
                    pupils on a Continental tour, from which he returned in March 1666, parting from
                    Willughby at Montpellier, whence the latter continued his journey into Spain. He
                    had previously in three different journeys (1658, 1661, 1662) travelled through
                    the greater part of Great Britain, and selections from his private notes of
                    these journeys were edited by George Scott in 1760, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mr Ray’s Itineraries.</hi> Ray himself published an account of his
                    foreign travel in 1673, entitled <hi rend="italic">Observations topographical,
                    moral, and physiological, made on a Journey through part of the Low Countries,
                    Germany, Italy, and France.</hi> From this tour Ray and Willughby returned laden
                    with collections, on which they meant to base complete systematic descriptions
                    of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Willughby undertook the former part, but,
                    dying in 1672, left only an ornithology and ichthyology, in themselves vast, for
                    Ray to edit; while the latter used the botanical collections for the groundwork
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Metliodus plantarum nova</hi> (1682), and his great <hi
                    rend="italic">Ilistoria generalis plantarum</hi> (1685). The plants gathered on
                    his British tours had already been described in his <hi rend="italic">Catalogus
                    plantarum Angtise</hi> (1670), which work is the basis of all later English
                    floras.</p>
                <p>In 1667 Ray was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1669 he published
                    in conjunction with Willughby his first paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> on “Experiments concerning the Motion of Sap in
                    Trees.” They demonstrated the ascent of the sap through the wood of the tree,
                    and supposed the sap to “precipitate a kind of white coagulum or jelly, which
                    may be well conceived to be the part which every year between bark and tree
                    turns to wood, and of which the leaves and fruits are made.” Immediately after
                    his admission into the Royal Society he was induced by Bishop Wilkins to
                    translate his <hi rend="italic">Real Character</hi> into Latin, and it seems he
                    actually completed a translation, which, however, remained in manuscript; his
                    <hi rend="italic">Metliodus plantarum nova</hi> was in fact undertaken as a
                    !)art of Wilkins’s great classificatory scheme.</p>
                <p>In 1673 Ray married Margaret Oakley of Launton (Oxford); in 1676 he went to
                    Sutton Coldfield, and in 1677 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n318/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0318-0301"/>to Falborne Hall in Essex. Finally, in 1679, lie
                    removed to Black Notley, where he afterwards remained. His life there was quiet
                    and uneventful, but embittered by bodily weakness and chronic sores. He occupied
                    himself in writing books and in keeping up a very wide scientific
                    correspondence, and lived, in spite of his infirmities, to the age of
                    seventy-six, dying on 17th January 1705.</p>
                <p>Ray’s first book, the <hi rend="italic">Catalogas plantarum circa Cantabrigiarn
                    nascentium</hi> (1660, followed by appendices in 1663 and 1685), was written in
                    conjunction with his “ainicissimus et individuus comes,” John Nid. The plants,
                    626 in number, are enumerated alphabetic-ally, but a system of classification
                    differing little from Caspar Bauhin’s is sketched at the end of the book; and
                    the notes contain many curious references to other parts of natural history. The
                    stations of the plants are minutely described; and Cambridge students still
                    gather some of their rarer plants in the copses or chalk-pits where he found
                    them. The book shows signs of his indebtedness to Joachim Jung of Hamburg, who
                    had died in 1657 leaving his writings unpublished; but a MS. copy of some of
                    them was sent to Ray by Hartlieb in 1660. Jung invented or gave precision to
                    many technical terms that Ray and others at once made use of in their
                    descriptions, and that are now classical; and his notions of what constitutes a
                    specific distinction and what characters are valueless as such seem to have been
                    adopted with little change by Ray. The first two editions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogus plantarum A nglise</hi> (1670, 1677) were likewise
                    arranged alphabetic-ally; but in the <hi rend="italic">Synopsis stirpium
                    Britannicarum</hi> (1690, 1696, also re-edited by Dillenius 1724, and by Hill
                    1760) Ray applied the scheme of classification which he had by that time
                    elaborated in the <hi rend="italic">Mcthodus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia plantarum.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Mcthodus plantarum nova</hi>
                    (1682) was largely based on the works of Csesalpini and Jung, and still more on
                    that of Morison of Oxford. The greatest merit of this book is the use of the
                    number of cotyledons as a basis of classification; though it must be remembered
                    that the difference between the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous embryo was
                    detected by Grew. After dividing plants into flowerless and flowering, Ray says,
                    “Floríferas dividemus in Dicotyledones, quarum semina sata binis foliis
                    anomalis, seminalibus dictis, quae cotyledonorum usum pnestant, e terra exeunt,
                    vel in binos saltern lobos dividuntur, quamvis eos supra terram foliorum specie
                    non efferent; et Monocotyledones, quae nec folia bina seminalia efferent nee
                    lobos binos condunt. Hsec divisio ad arbores etiam extendi potest; siquidem
                    Palmre et congeneres hoc respectu eodem modo a reliquis arboribus different quo
                    Monocotyledones a reliquis herbis.” But a serious blemish was his persistent
                    separation of trees from herbs, a distinction whose falsity had been exposed by
                    Jung and others, but to which Ray tried to give scientific foundation by denying
                    the existence of buds in the latter. At this time he based his classification,
                    like Caesalpini, chiefly upon the fruit, and he distinguished several natural
                    groups, such as the grasses, <hi rend="italic">Labiatse, Umbelliferse,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Papilionacese.</hi> The classification of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mcthodus</hi> was extended and improved in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia plantarum,</hi> but was disfigured by a large class of <hi
                    rend="italic">Anómala,,</hi> to include forms that the other orders did not
                    easily admit, and by the separation of the cereals from other grasses. The first
                    volume of this vast book was published in 1685, the second in the next year, and
                    the third in 1704; it enumerates and describes all the plants known to the
                    author or described by his predecessors, to the number, according to Adanson, of
                    18,625 species. In the first volume a chapter “De plantis in genere” contains an
                    account of all the anatomical and physiological knowledge of the time regarding
                    plants, with the recent speculations and discoveries of Csesalpini, Grew,
                    Malpighi, and Jung. And Cuvier and Dupetit Thouars, declaring that it was this
                    chapter which gave acceptance and authority to these authors’ works, say that
                    “the best monument that could be erected to the memory of Ray would be the
                    republication of this part of his work separately.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stirpium Europee-arum extra Britannias nascentium Sylloge</hi> (1694) is a much
                    amplified edition of the catalogue of plants collected on his own Continental
                    tour. In the preface to this book he first clearly admitted the doctrine of the
                    sexuality of plants, which, however, he had no share in establishing. Here also
                    begins his long controversy with Rivinus, which chiefly turned upon Ray’s
                    indefensible separation of ligneous from herbaceous plants, and also upon what
                    he conceived to be the misleading reliance that Rivinus placed on the characters
                    of the corolla. But in the second edition of his <hi rend="italic">Methodus</hi>
                    (1703) he followed Rivinus and Tournefort in taking the flower instead of the
                    fruit as his basis of classification: he was no longer a fructicist but a
                    corollist.</p>
                <p>Besides editing his friend Willughby’s books, Ray wrote several zoological works
                    of his own, including <hi rend="italic">Synopses of Quadrupeds</hi> (1693), that
                    is to say, both mammals and reptiles, of <hi rend="italic">Birds,</hi> and of
                    <hi rend="italic">Fishes</hi> (1713); the last two were published posthumously,
                    as was also the more important <hi rend="italic">Historia Insectorum</hi>
                    (1710). The <hi rend="italic">History of Insects</hi> embodied a great mass of
                    Willughby’s notes, and the <hi rend="italic">Synopses of Birds and Fishes</hi>
                    were mere abridgments of the “Ornithology” and “Ichthyology.”</p>
                <p>Most of Ray’s minor works were the outcome of his faculty for laborious compiling
                    and cataloguing; for instance, his <hi rend="italic">Collection of English
                    Proverbs</hi> (1670), his <hi rend="italic">Collection of out-of-the-way English
                    Words</hi> (1674), his <hi rend="italic">Collection of Curious Travels and
                    Voyages</hi> (1693), and his <hi rend="italic">Dictionariolnm trilingue, or
                    Nomenclátor classicus</hi> (1675). The last was written for the use of
                    Willughby’s sons, his pupils; it passed through many editions, and is still
                    useful for its careful identifications of plants and animals mentioned by Greek
                    and Latin writers. But Ray’s permanent influence and reputation have probably
                    depended most of all upon his two books entitled <hi rend="italic">The Wisdom of
                    God manifested in the Works of the Creation</hi> (1691), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miscellaneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the
                    World</hi> (1692). The latter includes three essays, on “The Primitive Chaos and
                    Creation of the World,” “The General Deluge, its Causes and Effects,” and “The
                    Dissolution of the World and Future Conflagrations.” The germ of these works was
                    contained in sermons preached long before in Cambridge. Both books obtained
                    immediate popularity; the former, at least, was translated into several
                    languages; and to this day their influence is apparent. For, as Sir J. Smith
                    says in his biography of Ray, “this book <hi rend="italic">[The Wisdom of
                    God,</hi> &amp;c.] is the basis of all the labours of following divines, who
                    have made the book of nature a commentary on the Book of Revelation.” In it Ray
                    recites innumerable examples of the perfection of organic mechanism, the
                    multitude and variety of living creatures, the minuteness and usefulness of
                    their parts. Many, if not most, of the familiar proofs of purposive adaptation
                    and design in nature were suggested by Ray. The structure of the eye, the
                    hollowness of the bones, the camel’s stomach, the hedgehog’s armour, are among
                    the thousand instances cited by him of immediate creative interpositions. But,
                    though his application of natural history to apologetic theology has made his
                    reputation peculiarly wide, it must be acknowledged that none of his scientific
                    discoveries at all equal in value those of the physiological botanists who
                    immediately preceded him, and that even in classificatory insight he was
                    surpassed by several of his contemporaries.</p>
