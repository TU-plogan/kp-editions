                    the last seven years of his life that he made his mark. He was never, as he
                    admitted himself, very successful as an actor. He tried his hand also at writing
                    plays, and a farcical comedy by him, <hi rend="italic">A Night's Adventure,</hi>
                    was produced at the Olympic under Farren’s management as early as 1851. But this
                    did not make good his footing, and he remained for some years longer in the
                    provinces, varying, his work as an actor with miscellaneous contributions to
                    newspapers. In 1860 he went to London with the intention, it is said, of making
                    his living by journalism and light literature. He edited a mining journal and
                    contributed to it a novel afterwards dramatized with the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shadow Tree Shaft.</hi> He wrote a farce entitled <hi rend="italic">A
                    Cantab,</hi> which was played at the Strand in 1861. Then, in 1864, came his
                    first marked success, <hi rend="italic">David Garrick,</hi> produced at the
                    Haymarket with Sothern in the principal character.. It was not, however, till
                    the production of <hi rend="italic">Society</hi> at the Prince of Wales Theatre
                    in 1865, under the management of Miss Marie Wilton, afterwards Mrs Bancroft,
                    that the originality and cleverness of the dramatist were fully recognized.
                    Play-writer and company were exactly suited one to another; the plays and the
                    acting together—the small size of the playhouse being also in their favour—were
                    at once recognized as a new thing, and, while some critics sneered at the
                    “cup-and-saucer comedy,” voted it absurdly realistic, said there was nothing in
                    it but commonplace life represented without a trace of Sheridanian wit and
                    sparkle, all London flocked to the little house in Tottenham Street, and the
                    stage was at once inundated with imitations of the new style of acting and the
                    new kind of play.</p>
                <p>Robertson, although his health was already undermined, followed up <hi
                    rend="italic">Society</hi> in quick succession with the series of characteristic
                    plays which made the reputation of himself, the company, and the theatre. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ours</hi> was produced in 1866, <hi rend="italic">Caste</hi> in
                    1867, <hi rend="italic">Play</hi> in 1868, <hi rend="italic">School</hi> in
                    1869, <hi rend="italic">M.P.</hi> in 1870. For twenty years there probably has
                    not been a week, hardly a night, in which some one of Robertson’s plays has not
                    been produced somewhere in Great Britain,.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n622/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0622-0599"/>
                <p>and still they show no sign of abating popularity. The masterly stage-craft is
                    undoubtedly one of the elements in this remarkable conquest of the play-going
                    public; the purity and generous morality of the plays another; the
                    dialogue—which is always bright and clever, without any straining after or
                    indeed much attaining to wit—a third; the humour, distinctness, and typical
                    representativeness of the characters a fourth. That there is more art and
                    individuality in the plays than critics at first were willing to admit is clear
                    from the fact that none of Robertson’s numerous imitators have succeeded in
                    catching his happy knack. Another proof of something like genius—dramatic genius
                    if not literary genius—is the skill with which he repeats the same idea with
                    such variations that each time it is as fresh as if it were new. Again and again
                    his situations owe their point to the contrast between generous kindness of
                    heart and sordid worldliness, or between the ardent trustful affections of youth
                    and the cynicism of disenchanted middle age. Pleasant sunny brightness and
                    ingenuity within a narrow range constitute Robertson’s distinction rather than
                    breadth or fertility or striking brilliancy of wit. He knew his powers and
                    worked steadily within them, not striving to go beyond. With the exception of
                    <hi rend="italic">David Garrick</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Home,</hi> written
                    for the Haymarket, and <hi rend="italic">Dreams</hi> for the Gaiety, all his
                    well-known plays were written for the Prince of Wales Theatre, with which his
                    distinctive style of comedy is identified. Unhappily he did not live long to
                    enjoy his success, but died in London in February 1871.</p>
