                <p><label type="entry">RICHARD I</label>. (1157-1199), king of England, called even
                    before his death “the Lion” or “Coeur de Lion,” was the third son of Henry II.
                    and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was born, probably at Oxford, on September 8, 1157.
                    When little more than eleven years old he was invested with the duchy of
                    Aquitaine, and imbibed in southern France the spirit of the adventurer and the
                    troubadour which characterized him through life. In 1173 he joined the league
                    against Henry II., but when the rebellion was suppressed in 1171 he was pardoned
                    by his father. Shortly afterwards he was affianced to Alice, the daughter of
                    Louis VII. The death of his brother Henry in 1184 made Richard heir to the
                    throne. From this time he was the centre of the disturbances which troubled the
                    last five years of Henry II.’s reign. The pretext for his quarrel with his
                    father was the refusal of the latter to allow the barons to do fealty to Richard
                    as heir, and Henry’s wish to transfer Aquitaine to his younger son John. War was
                    for some time averted by the preparations for the third crusade, and Richard
                    himself took the cross (1187). Next year, however, a quarrel between Richard and
                    his neighbour the count of Toulouse led to the final breach. I <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> hilip, king of France, took advantage of this quarrel
                    to invade Berri, whence he was driven out again by Richard, who so far was
                    acting in concert with his father. A truce <pb break="no"

                    the opportunity to separate Henry from his son. In November 1188 Richard did
                    homage to Philip for his French provinces, and the latter demanded that Henry
                    should acknowledge him as heir. Henry hesitated, and Richard openly joined
                    Philip. In the spring of 1189 the allies overran Maine and Touraine, and forced
                    Henry, in a meeting at Colombières, to submit to their demands. Two days later
                    Henry died at Chinon (July G, 1189), and Richard became king of England.</p>
                <p>Richard’s reign falls into two equal divisions—the one comprising his crusade and
                    captivity, the other his wars against Philip in France. On his father’s death he
                    was at once acknowledged as duke of Normandy and count of Anjou. On September 3,
                    1189, he was crowned with great pomp at Westminster. This is the first English
                    coronation of which we have a full account, and the formalities then adopted
                    have been followed with little alteration ever since. Richard at once set to
                    work to collect funds for the crusade. He sold ecclesiastical and temporal
                    offices, released the king of Scotland from the vassalage to which Henry II. had
                    subjected him; and, having by these means and by taxation collected a large sum
                    of money, he crossed to Calais on December 12. Soon afterwards he met Philip at
                    St Remy and made a treaty with him for a joint crusade. On June 27, 1190, the
                    two armies assembled at Vezelai, whence they marched together as far as Lyons.
                    There Philip took the route to Genoa, while Richard went by Marseilles. Visiting
                    Naples on the way, he landed at Messina on September 23, where he found the
                    French army and his own fleet awaiting him. The two kings remained in Sicily
                    during the winter. William IL, king of Sicily, husband of Richard’s sister
                    Joanna, had died shortly before, and Tancred, nephew of William, had seized the
                    throne. During the negotiations for the recovery of Joanna and her dowry,
                    disturbances broke out which ended in Richard’s forcing his way into Messina at
                    the head of his army. His real enemy was, however, not Tancred, but Philip. The
                    natural jealousy of the two kings grew into mutual hatred during their stay in
                    Sicily, and Tancred informed Richard of French intrigues. In March 1191 Richard
                    made a treaty with Tancred, and recognized him as king of Sicily. At the same
                    time he repudiated Alice, Philip’s sister, and betrothed himself to Berengaria
                    of Navarre. Philip was the first to leave Sicily. He arrived at Acre early in
                    April. On April 10 Richard set sail, and a month later reached Cyprus, where he
                    married Berengaria (May 12). He then proceeded to conquer Cyprus, took Isaac
                    Comnenus and his daughter prisoners, and set out again for the Holy Land,
                    reaching Acre on June 8. Guy of Lusignan, who claimed the throne of Jerusalem,
                    had besieged that fortress since 1189, but the Christian army was itself hemmed
                    in by the forces of Saladin. Richard’s arrival encouraged the besiegers, and on
                    July 11 Acre surrendered. The two kings now settled the dispute between Guy of
                    Lusignan and Conrad of Montferrat about the throne of Jerusalem and on August· 3
                    Philip left the Holy Land. Saladin having failed to fulfil the terms on which
                    Acre had surrendered, Richard ordered the massacre in cold blood of some three
                    thousand Mohammedan prisoners. Soon afterwards he set out for Jaffa, and on the
                    way thither won the battle cf Arsuf. Having rebuilt Jaffa, he started for
                    Jerusalem. About Christmas 1191 he arrived at Beit-nûba, within sight of the
                    Holy City, but, owing to the reluctance or desertion of his French allies, he
                    found it impossible to besiege it, and therefore withdrew to the coast. In April
                    1192, at the instance of his followers, he recognized Conrad as king of
                    Jerusalem, indemnifying Guy with the crown of Cyprus. The murder of Conrad
                    immediately afterwards was laid, probably without sufficient ground, to the
                    charge of Richard, who conferred the vacant throne on Henry, count of Champagne.
                    Bad news from England now made him anxious to go home, but he resolved on one
                    more attempt to save Jerusalem. He set out on June 4, arrived again within sight
                    of the city, and again retired without venturing to attack. Jaffa, which had
                    been taken by Saladin, was retaken on August 1. This was Richard’s last exploit
                    in the East. On September 1 he made a three years’ truce with Saladin, on the
                    basis of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>; and on October 9 he sailed for
                    home, leaving behind him a name long remembered by the Saracens, but, beyond the
                    capture of Acre, having accomplished none of the objects with which he set
                    out.</p>
                <p>Fearing to go through France, Richard sailed up the Adriatic, and made his way on
                    foot, as a pilgrim and almost alone, to Erdburg near Vienna. Here he was
                    discovered (December 21, 1192) by Leopold, duke of Austria, of whom, while at
                    Ascalon, he had made a bitter enemy. After being confined for some time at
                    Dürrenstein on the Danube, he was surrendered in March 1193 to the emperor Henry
                    VI., who imprisoned him first at Trifels and afterwards at Worms. Legend was
                    already rife about him, but the story of his discovery by Blondel only dates
                    from the following century, and is of French origin. In order to liberate
                    himself, Richard resigned his crown to Henry VI. as overlord of Christendom,
                    promised to pay a yearly tribute, and received back the crown as a vassal of the
                    emperor. At Easter a diet was held at Spires, at which Richard was charged with
                    various misdoings,—the recognition of Tancred, the conquest of Cyprus, the
                    murder of Conrad, even with the betrayal of the Holy Land to Saladin. He
                    defended himself eloquently, and the charges were dropped. Shortly afterwards a
                    treaty was made at Worms (July 29) for Richard’s release on payment of a ransom
                    of 150,000 marks, with other conditions. Great efforts were made in England to
                    collect the money, two-thirds of which was paid over to Henry, hostages being
                    given for the rest. Philip and John were able, however, by offers of money and
                    other means, to induce the emperor to detain Richard till the following spring.
                    At length he was liberated. On March 13, 1194, he set foot again in England. He
                    found his dominions in great confusion owing to the intrigues of Philip and
                    John. He rapidly made himself master of the castles which held out for John, and
                    on April 17, 1194, he was crowned a second time. He then collected more money
                    from the impoverished country for the rest of his ransom and for an expedition
                    to France, and on May 12 left England again never to return. Philip retired
                    before him; John submitted and was pardoned. For the remaining five years of his
                    reign Richard kept up an intermittent struggle with Philip, a struggle marked by
                    no great battles, and interrupted only by fruitless negotiations and truces
                    which were never kept. Neither party was strong enough to inflict a severe blow
                    upon the other. In the autumn of 1198 the war went decidedly against Philip, but
                    in January 1199 a peace for five years was made, each side retaining what it
                    held. Shortly afterwards Richard, while besieging the castle of Chaluz near
                    Limoges, which was held against him by one of his vassals, was wounded by an
                    arrow. He died on April 6, 1199, and was buried at Fontevraud. His brother John
                    succeeded him.</p>
                <p>In person Richard was tall, muscular, ruddy, with light brown hair. He was
                    lavish, generous, and fearless; a skilful commander, but incapable of extensive
                    combinations or far-reaching plans; more religious than his father or brothers,
                    but equally vicious; a bad husband and a bad son, with much of the ferocity that
                    characterized his race;</p>

                <p>in fact, a typical representative of the faults as well as the virtues of the
                    chivalry of his day. His reign was signalized by no great legal or
                    administrative reform, and England owes him nothing but barren fame.</p>
