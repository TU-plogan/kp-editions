                    177 miles north-west of Berlin by railway, 80 miles north-east of Lübeck, and
                    106 miles south of Copenhagen. The city consists of three parts—the old town to
                    the east, and the middle and new towns to the west—of which the first retains
                    some of the antique features of an old Hanse town, while the last two are for
                    the most part regularly and even handsomely built. There are several fine
                    squares in Rostock, among them the Blücher Platz, with a statue of Field-marshal
                    Blücher, who was born in the town in 1742. Rostock was at one time a fortress of
                    some strength, but the old fortifications have been razed, and their site is
                    noλv occupied by a promenade. Within the last twenty years the suburbs have
                    considerably extended themselves. Rostock has five old parochial churches :—St
                    Mary’s, dating from 1398-1472, one of the most imposing Gothic buildings in
                    Mecklenburg; St Nicholas’s, begun about 1250 and restored in 1450; St Peter’s,
                    with a lofty tower built in 1400, which serves as a landmark to ships 20 miles
                    at sea; St James’s, completed in 1588; and the church of the Holy Rood, begun in
                    1270, but now no longer used for service. St Mary’s church contains a monument
                    marking the original tomb of Grotius, who died in Rostock in 1645, though his
                    remains were afterwards removed to Delft. Among the other interesting buildings
                    are the curious 14th-century Gothic town-house, the façade of which is concealed
                    by a Renaissance addition; the palace of the grand duke of
                    Mecklenburg-SchAverin, built in 1702; the law courts, built in 1878-79; and the
                    new university buildings, erected in 1867-70. The university of Rostock was
                    founded in 1418 by the dukes Johann III. and Albrecht V. From 1437 till 1443 it
                    had its seat at Greifswald in consequence of commotions at Rostock; and in 1760
                    it was again removed—on this occasion to Bützow. The professors appointed by the
                    city, however, still taught there, so that there were practically two
                    universities in the duchy until 1789, when they were reunited at the original
                    seat. In winter 1884-5 the university had a teaching staff of 39, with 265
                    students; and it possesses a library of 145,000 volumes, various collections and
                    museums, and a number of scientific and literary auxiliary institutions. Rostock
                    is the seat of the supreme court for both the duchies of Mecklenburg, and is
                    well equipped with schools, hospitals, and other institutions. The population in
                    1810 was 10,979; in 1880 it was 36,967, of whom only 224 were Roman Catholics,
                    and only 221 were Jews; in 1885 it was 39,212.</p>
                <p>Although the population, commerce, and wealth of Rostock have all declined since
                    its palmy days as a flourishing Hanse town in the Middle Ages, it has still a
                    very considerable trade, and no Baltic port possesses so large a merchant fleet.
                    In 1882 314 ships, with a total burden of 97,447 tons, were registered as
                    belonging to Rostock; and in 1832 730 ships, with a total burden of 80,578 tons
                    entered, and 724 ships, with a total burden of 82,537 tons, cleared, the port.
                    Ships of more than 200 tons burden must discharge part of their cargo at
                    AVarnemiinde, at the mouth of the Warnow, the port of Rostock, a fishing village
                    and watering place with 1766 inhabitants, who are distinguished by a peculiar
                    dialect and costume. By far the most important export of Rostock is grain, which
                    goes almost entirely to British ports; but wool, flax, and cattle are also
                    shipped. The chief imports are coal from Great Britain, herrings from Sweden,
                    petroleum from America, timber, wine, and colonial goods. Rostock has an
                    important fair at Whitsuntide, lasting for fourteen days, and also a frequented
                    wool and cattle market. The industries of the town are very varied. One of the
                    chief ^is shipbuilding, which, however, has declined of late years. Cotton,
                    straw hats, tobacco, carpets, soap, cards, chocolate, and dye-stuffs are among
                    the manufactures of the town, which also contains distilleries, saw-mills,
                    oil-mills, tanneries, and breweries.</p>
                <p>Local historians assert that a village existed on the site of Rostock as early as
                    329 A.υ., but no certain proofs have been traced of any earlier community than
                    that founded here by Pribislaw IL in the 12th century, which is said to have
                    received town rights in 1218. The earliest signs of commercial prosperity date
                    from about 1260. For a time Rostock was under the dominion of the kings of
                    Denmark. Soon after returning into the protection of Mecklenburg in 1317, it
                    joined the Hanseatic League; and in fact was one of the original members of the
                    powerful and prosperous AVendish Hansa, in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n895/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0895-0862"/>which it exercised an influence second only to
                    that of Lübeck. The most prosperous epoch of its commercial history began in the
                    latter half of tho 15th century, precisely at the period when its political
                    power began to wane. Rostock, however, never entirely lost the independence
                    which it enjoyed as a Hanse town; and in 1788, as the result of long contentions
                    with the rulers of SIecklenburg, it secured for itself a peculiar and liberal
                    municipal constitution, administered by three burgomasters and three chambers.
                    In 1880 this constitution was somewhat modified, and the city became less like a
                    state within a state. The badge of Rostock is the figure’7; and a local rhyme
                    explains that there are 7 doors to St Mary’s church, 7 streets from the market
                    place, 7 gates on the landward side and 7 wharves on the seaward side of the
                    town, 7 turrets on the town-house, which has 7 bells, and 7 linden trees in the
                    park.</p>
