                    come from the Slav provinces to the south of the Danube (provinces with which
                    the crusades had given France much intercourse) in the first half of the 14th
                    century. Baudouin de Ronsard or Rossart was the founder of the French branch of
                    the house, and made his mark in the early stages of the Hundred Years’ War. The
                    poet’s father was named Loys, and his mother was Jeanne de Chaudrier, of a
                    family not only noble in itself but well connected. Pierre was the youngest son.
                    Loys de Ronsard was <hi rend="italic">maître Phbtel du roi</hi> to Francis I.,
                    whose captivity after Pavia had just been softened by treaty, and he had to quit
                    his home shortly after Pierre’s birth. The future Prince of Poets was educated
                    at home for some years and sent to the College de Navarre at Paris when he was
                    nine years old. It is said that the rough life of a mediaeval school did not
                    suit him. He had, however, no long experience of it, being quickly appointed
                    page to the duke of Orleans. When Marguerite of France was married to James V.
                    of Scotland Ronsard was attached to the king’s service, and he spent three years
                    in Great Britain. The latter part of this time seems to have been passed in
                    England, though he had, strictly speaking, no business there. On returning to
                    France in 1540 he was again taken into the service of the duke of Orleans. In
                    this service he had other opportunities of travel, being sent to Flanders and
                    again to Scotland. After a time a more important employment fell to his lot, and
                    he was attached as secretary to the suite of Lazare de Baif, the father of his
                    future colleague in the Pléiade and his companion on this occasion, Antoine de
                    Baïf, at the diet of Spires. Afterwards he was attached in the same way to the
                    suite of the Cardinal du Bellay-Langey, and his mythical quarrel with Rabelais
                    dates mythically from this period. His apparently promising diplomatic career
                    was, however, cut short by an attack of deafness which no physician could cure,
                    and he determined to devote,himself to study. The institution which he chose for
                    the purpose among the numerous schools and colleges of Paris was the Collége
                    Coqueret, the principal of which was Daurat—afterwards the “dark star” (as be
                    has been called from his silence in France) of the Pléiade. Baïf accompanied
                    Ronsard; Belleau shortly followed; Joachim du Bellay, the second of the seven,
                    joined not much later. Muretus, a great scholar and by means of his Latin plays
                    a great influence in the creation of French tragedy, was also a student
                    here.</p>
                <p>Ronsard’s period of study occupied seven years, and the first manifesto of the
                    new literary movement, which was to apply to the. vernacular the principles of
                    criticism and scholarship learnt from the classics, came not from him but from
                    Du Bellay. The <hi rend="italic">Défense et Illustration de la Langue
                    Française</hi> of the latter appeared in 1549, and the Pléiade may be said to
                    have been then launched. It consisted, as its name implies, of seven writers
                    whose names are sometimes differently enumerated, though the orthodox canon is
                    beyond doubt composed of Ronsard, Du Bellay, Baïf, Belleau, Pontus de Tyard (a
                    man of rank and position who had exemplified the principles of the friends
                    earlier), Jodelle the dramatist, and Daurat. Ronsard’s own work came a little
                    later, and a rather idle story is told of a trick of Du Bellay’s which at last
                    determined him to publish. Some single and minor pieces, an epithalamium on
                    Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne de Navarre, a “Hymne de la France,” an “Ode à la
                    Paix,” preceded the publication in 1550 of the four first books (“first” is
                    characteristic and noteworthy) of the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> of Pierre de
                    Ronsard. This was followed in 1552 by the publication of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amours</hi> with the fifth book of <hi rend="italic">Odes.</hi> These books
                    excited a violent literary quarrel. Marot was dead, but he left a numerous
                    school, some of whom saw in the stricter literary critique of the Pléiade, in
                    its outspoken contempt of merely vernacular and mediaeval forms and so forth, an
                    insult to the author of the <hi rend="italic">Adolescence Clémentine</hi> and
                    his followers. The French court, and indeed all French society, was just then
                    much interested in literary questions, and a curious story is told of the
                    rivalry that ensued. Mellin de St Gelais, it is said, the chief of the “École
                    Marotique” and a poet of no small merit, took up Ronsard’s book and read part of
                    it in a more or less designedly burlesque fashion before the king. It may be
                    observed that if he did so it was a distinctly rash and uncourtier-like act,
                    inasmuch as from Ronsard’s father’s position in the royal household the poet was
                    personally known and liked both by Henry and by his family. At any rate
                    Marguerite the king’s sister, who afterwards became duchess of Savoy, is said to
                    have snatched the book from St Gelais and insisted on reading it herself, with
                    the result of general applause. Henceforward, if not before, his acceptance as a
                    poet was not doubtful, and indeed the tradition of his having to fight his way
                    against cabals is almost entirely unsupported. It is quite true that he more
                    than any other poet has had to suffer detraction from a remarkably different
                    series of opposing forces. But none of these interfered with his popularity in
                    his own time, which was overwhelming and immediate, or with his prosperity,
                    which was unbroken. He published his <hi rend="italic">Hymns,</hi> dedicated to
                    Marguerite de Savoie, in 1555, the conclusion of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amours</hi> in 1556, and then a collection of <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres
                    Complètes</hi> said to be due to the invitation of Mary Stuart, queen of Francis
                    IL, in 1560.</p>
                <p>The rapid change of sovereigns did Ronsard no harm. Charles IX., who Succeededhis
                    brother after a very short time, was even better inclined to him than Henry and
                    Francis. He gave him rooms in the palace; he bestowed upon him divers abbacies
                    and priories; and he called him and regarded him constantly as his master in
                    poetry. Neither was Charles IX. a bad poet. This royal patronage, however, had
                    its disagreeable side. It excited violent dislike to Ronsard on the part of the
                    Huguenots, who wrote constant pasquinades against him, strove (by a ridiculous
                    exaggeration of the Dionysiac festival at Arcueil, in which the friends had
                    indulged to celebrate the success of the first French tragedy, Jodelle’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Cleopatre)</hi> to represent him as a libertine and an
                    atheist,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n875/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0875-0842"/>
                <p>and (which seems to have annoyed him more than anything else) set up his follower
                    Du Bartas as his rival. According to some words of his own which are quite
                    credible considering the ways of the time, they were not contented with this
                    variety of argument, but attempted to have him assassinated. During this period
                    Ronsard’s work was considerable but mostly occasional, and the one work of
                    magnitude upon which Charles put him, the <hi rend="italic">Franciade,</hi> has
                    never been ranked, even by his most devoted admirers, as a chief title to fame.
                    The metre (the decasyllable) which the king chose could not but contrast
                    unfavourably with the magnificent alexandrines which Du Bartas and Agrippa
                    d’Aubigné were shortly to produce; the general plan is feebly classical, and the
                    very language lias little or nothing of that racy mixture of Scholarliness and
                    love of natural beauty which distinguishes the best work of the Pléiade. The
                    poem could never have had an abiding success, but at its appearance it had the
                    singular bad luck almost to coincide with the massacre of St Bartholomew, which
                    had occurred about a fortnight before its publication. One party in the state
                    were certain to look coldly on the work of a minion of the court at such a
                    juncture, the other had something else to think of. The death of Charles made,
                    indeed, little difference in the court favour which Ronsard enjoyed, but,
                    combined with his increasing infirmities, it seems to have determined him to
                    quit court life. During his last year he lived chiefly at a house which he
                    possessed in Vendôme, the capital of his native province, at his abbey at Croix
                    Val in the same neighbourhood, or else at Paris, where he was usually the guest
                    of Jean Galland, well known as a scholar, at the Collège de Boncourt. It seems
                    also that he had a town house of his own in the Faubourg Saint Marcel. At any
                    rate . his preferments made him in perfectly easy circumstances, and he seems
                    neither to have derived nor wished for any profit from his books. A half-jocular
                    suggestion that his publisher should give him money to buy “du bois pour se
                    chauffer·” in return for his last revision of his <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres
                    Complètes</hi> is the only trace of any desire of the kind. On the other hand he
                    received not merely gifts and endowments from his own sovereign but presents
                    from many others, including Elizabeth of England. His last years were, however,
                    saddened not merely by the death of many of his most intimate friends, but by
                    constant and increasing ill health. This did not interfere with his literary
                    work in point of quality, for he was rarely idle, and some of his latest work is
                    among his best. But he indulged (what few poets have wisely indulged) the
                    temptation of constantly altering his work, and many of his later alterations
                    are by no means for the better. Towards the end of 1585 his condition of health
                    grew worse and worse, and he seems to have moved restlessly from one of his
                    houses to another for some months. AVhen the end came, which, though in great
                    pain, he met in a resolute and religious manner, he was at his priory of Saint
                    Cosme at Tours, and he was buried in the church of that name on Friday, December
                    27.</p>
                <p>The character and fortunes of Ronsard’s works are among the most remarkable in
                    literary history, and supply in themselves a kind of illustration of the
                    progress of French literature during the last three centuries. It was his
                    fortune to be almost always extravagantly admired or violently attacked, and it
                    is only recently that he has been set in his proper place. At first, as has been
                    said, the enmity, not altogether unprovoked, of the friends and followers of
                    Marot fell to his lot, then the still fiercer antagonism of the Huguenot
                    faction, who, happening to possess a poet of great merit in Du Bartas, were able
                    to attack Ronsard in his tenderest point, that of his reputation as the greatest
                    living French poet. But fate had by no means done its worst with him in his
                    lifetime. After his death the classical reaction set in under the auspices of
                    Malherbe, a man of correct and narrow spirit who seems to have been animated
                    with a sort of personal hatred of Ronsard, though it is not clear that they ever
                    met. After Malherbe (who by no means himself produced the effect which some
                    well-known but quite Unhistorical lines of Boileau would convey) the rising
                    glory of Comeille and his contemporaries obscured the tentative and equal work
                    of the Pléiade, which was, moreover, directly attacked by Boileau himself, the
                    dictator of French criticism in the last half of the 17th century. Then Ronsard
                    was, except by a few men of taste, like La Bruyère and Fénelon, forgotten when
                    he was not sneered at. In this condition he remained during the whole 18th
                    century and the first quarter of the 19th. The romantic revival, seeing in him a
                    victim of its special <hi rend="italic">bête noire</hi> Boileau, and attracted
                    by his splendid diction, rich metrical faculty, and combination of classical and
                    mediaeval peculiarities, adopted his name as a kind of battle cry, and for the
                    moment exaggerated his merits somewhat. The critical work, however, first of
                    Sainte-Beuve in his <hi rend="italic">Tableau de la Littérature Française au
                    16ème Siècle,</hi> and since of others, has established Ronsard pretty securely
                    in his right place, a place which may be defined in a few sentences.</p>
                <p>For the general position of the Pléiade reference may be made to the article on
                    the literature of France (vol. ix. p. 650). Ronsard, its acknowledged chief and
                    its most voluminous poet, was probably also its best, though a few isolated
                    pieces of Belleau excel him in airy lightness of touch. Several sonnets of Du
                    Bellay exhibit what may be called the intense and voluptuous melancholy of the
                    Renaissance more perfectly than anything of his, and the finest passages of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tragiques</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Divine Scpmaine</hi>
                    surpass his work in command of the alexandrine and in power of turning it to the
                    purposes of satirical invective and descriptive narration. But that work is, as
                    has been said, very extensive (we possess at a rough guess not much short of a
                    hundred thousand lines of his), and it is extraordinarily varied in form. He did
                    not introduce the sonnet into France, but he practised it very soon after its
                    introduction and with admirable skill—the famous “Quand vous serez bien vieille”
                    being one of the acknowledged gems of French literature. His odes, which are
                    very numerous, are also very interesting and in their best shape very perfect
                    compositions. He began by imitating the Strophic arrangement of the ancients,
                    but very soon had the wisdom to desert this for a kind of adjustment of the
                    Horatian ode to rhyme, instead of exact quantitative metre. In this latter kind
                    he devised some exquisitely melodious rhythms of which, till our own day, the
                    secret died with the 17th century. His more sustained work sometimes displays a
                    bad selection of metre; and his occasional poetry—epistles, eclogues, elegies,
                    &amp;c.—is injured by its vast volume. But the preface to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Franeiadeps</hi> a very fine piece of verse, far superior (it is in
                    alexandrines) to the poem itself. Generally speaking, Ronsard is best in his
                    amatory verse (the long series of sonnets and odes to Cassandre, Marie, Genevre,
                    Helène, &amp;c. ), and in his descriptions of the country (the famous “Mignonne
                    allons voir si la rose,” the “Fontaine Bellerie,” the “Forêt de Gastine,” and so
                    forth), which have an extraordinary grace and freshness. No one used with more
                    art than he the graceful diminutives which his school set in fashion. He knew
                    well too Iiowtomanage the gorgeous adjectives (“marbrine,” “cinabrine,”
                    “ivoirine,” and the like) which were another fancy of the Pléiade, and in his
                    hands they rarely become stiff or cumbrous. In short, Ronsard shows eminently
                    the two great attractions of French 17th-century poetry as compared with that of
                    the two following ages,— magnificence of language and imagery and graceful
                    variety of metre.</p>
                <p>The chief separately published works of Ronsard are noted above. He produced,
                    however, during his life a vast number of separate publications, some of them
                    mere pamphlets or broadsheets which from time to time he collected, often
                    striking out others at the same time, in the successive editions of his works.
                    Of these he himself published seven— the first in 1560, the last in 1584.
                    Between his death and the year 1630 ten more complete editions were published,
                    the most famous of which is the folio of 1609. A copy of this presented by
                    Sainte-Beuve to Victor Hugo, and now in the possession of M. Maxime du Camp, has
                    a place of its own in French literary history. From 1630 Ronsard was not again
                    reprinted for more than two centuries. Just before the close of the second,
                    however, Sainte-Beuve printed a selection of his poems at the end of the
                    above-mentioned <hi rend="italic">Tableau.</hi> There are also selections by M.
                    Noel (in the <hi rend="italic">Collection Bidot)</hi> and Becq de Fouquiferes.
                    In 1857 M. Prosper Blanchemain, who had previously published a volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeuvres Inédites de Ronsard,</hi> undertook a complete edition for
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Elzevirienne.</hi> The eighth and last volume
                    of this appeared ton years later. It is practically complete; a few pieces of a
                    somewhat free character which are ascribed with some certainty to the poet are,
                    however, excluded. The chief separate volume of criticism on Ronsard is that of
                    M. Gandar (Metz, 1854), which considers him chiefly in his relation to the
                    ancients. (G. SA.)</p>
