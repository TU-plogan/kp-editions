                    </p></note> of the foremost rabbi of his age in Germany, viz., Rabbenu Meir b.
                    Barukh, better known under the name of R. Meir of Rotheuburg, whose tragic fate
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The persecutions and
                    massacres of the Jews in many parts of Germany in the 13th century made life so
                    UnendurabIethat the wealthier of them determined to quit the land of their birth
                    and to emigrate to that of their ancient fathers. R. Meir of Rothenburg, being
                    at the head of the emigration, had in the spring of 1286, with his whole family
                    and several other families, already arrived in Lombardy. But one Kinppa, or
                    Knippa, or Konpil, <hi rend="italic">i.e., Koppe]</hi> ( = Jacot), a converted
                    Jew, recognizedand betrayed him to his master, the bishop (? ∣)QJ∏) of Basel,
                    who had him arrested by Captain Meinert (Meinhard) of Gorz, who handed him over
                    to the emperor. Rudolph of Hapsburg. who had only a dozen years before or so (to
                    speak in the great German poet’s language) “made an end, after the long
                    destructive strife, to the emperorless, terrible time,” was, though very rich in
                    dignities, as yet comparatively poor in purse. He therefore, in the Iiiidsummer
                    of the same year (to extort money from the Jews), caused the poor rabbi to be
                    imprisoned in the tower of Ensisheiin (in Alsace) and subsequently in other
                    places,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Weissenburg, or Wasserburg (p^)1□K&gt;)).
                    Considerable sums were offered by the Jews for their revered chief, but the
                    negotiations were brought to nought by the command of the rabbi himself, who
                    would not permit more than a trifling sum to be given for his release (Resiial
                    (7.«.), <hi rend="italic">Yarn shel Shelornoh,</hi> on Gittin, iv. 66). He died
                    in prison in 1293. Rudolph's successors, Adolph of Nassau (1291-1298) and
                    Albrecht of Austria (1298-1308), were so heartless as not to deliver up for
                    nearly fourteen years the poor rabbi’s corpse for burial, hoping to extort from
                    the Jews even greater sums than they had originally offered to Rudolph for the
                    rabbi alive. In 1307, however, a rich and pious but childless man, Alexander
                    SUsskind Wimpfen of Frankfort, offered an enormous sum on the condition that the
                    congregation of Worms should bury the rabbi s coιpse and should allow at his own
                    death his body to rest near it (see Lewysohn, <hi rend="italic">Sechzig
                    Epitaphien . . . tu Worms,</hi> Frankfort-on-Main, 1855, 8vo, pp. 35-41). R.
                    Meir of Rothenburg was not merely a flue Biblical and Rabbinic scholar but also
                    a great Cabbalist, as R. David b. Yehudah Hasid testifies in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mar’oth Hassobeoth</hi> (Camb. Univ. MS. Add. 664, leaf 72a). Most
                    of his literary productions are incorporated with works of his disciples and the
                    disciples of these disciples. For instance, some of his massoretico-ethical
                    explanations are to be found in R. Ya’akob b. Asher’s so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">Ra'al Hatturim,</hi> and part of his commentary on the Mishnah is
                    to be found in R. Yomtob Lipmann Heller’s <hi rend="italic">Tosephoth
                    Yomtob</hi> (see Mishnah). Other Rabbinic work of his is to be found in <hi
