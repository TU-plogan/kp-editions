                <p><label type="entry">RIVER ENGINEERING</label>. The improvement of rivers may be
                    considered under two aspects, for rivers form the natural channels for conveying
                    the surplus rainfall from the districts through which they pass to the sea, and
                    they can also be utilized for the purposes of inland navigation. If a river,
                    owing to the small section of its channel, or the slight inclination of its bed,
                    is incapable of discharging the whole volume of water which drains into it in
                    rainy seasons, the lands along its banks become flooded, frequently to the great
                    detriment of the crops, and sometimes with disastrous results to life and
                    property. If, on the other hand, a river is impeded by rapids, by shoals, or by
                    a bar at its mouth, it is prevented from serving as a natural highway for the
                    traffic of the district through which it flows. Accordingly the mitigation of
                    floods and the regulation of rivers are the problems which have ‘to be grappled
                    with in the engineering of rivers. The first aims at remedying an existing evil,
                    and the second deals with the development of the resources and trade of a
                    country by the improvement of its water communications.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Floods.—</hi> Floods are of two" kinds, according to the nature
                    of the country traversed by the rivers producing them. Torrential rivers,
                    flowing over impermeable strata and having a rapid fall, rise rapidly after a
                    heavy rainfall, and produce a high flood which quickly subsides. Gently flowing
                    rivers on the contrary rise slowly, and do not attain the same height as
                    torrential rivers; but their floods subside slowly, and consequently, though
                    less high, remain longer <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n595/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0595-0572"/>on the land than torrential floods. The valleys,
                    moreover, of torrential rivers are steeper and less fertile than the alluvial
                    plains of gently flowing rivers; and, consequently, the high short floods of the
                    former are less injurious than the long continuing lower floods of the latter.
                    The long duration of a flood is also the more prejudicial, as sometimes a flood
                    remains long enough on the land for a second flood to come down before the first
                    has subsided, thereby producing an increased rise.</p>
                <p>Floods are generally largest in the winter months, for, owing to the absence of
                    evaporation, a much larger proportion of rainfall finds its way into the rivers
                    at that period; and the greatest floods occur when rain falls on melting snow.
                    High floods, however, sometimes occur in the summer after an exceptionally heavy
                    rainfall; and they are necessarily far more injurious at that time of the year,
                    devastating the crops on the land which they inundate.</p>
                <p>Floods are due to the inadequacy of the river channel to carry off the water
                    poured into it within a given period. The bed of a river, being formed and
                    maintained by its stream, is merely adequate to carry the ordinary discharge.
                    Large floods occur at too distant intervals to scour a sufficient channel for
                    their passage, and consequently they overflow the banks and inundate the
                    adjacent districts. Other causes, moreover, tend to aggravate this evil.</p>
                <p>A river carries down a large amount of solid matter which has been either ground
                    from the mountain rocks by glaciers, washed from the land by the inflowing
                    streams, or thrown into it as refuse from towns and manufactories. This material
                    tends to settle in the channel wherever the current is checked, and consequently
                    raises its bed and impedes the flow of the stream. Moreover, a river flowing
                    through a plain gradually increases its serpentine course, thereby diminishing
                    its fall and reducing its velocity. Accordingly the tendency of rivers is to
                    deteriorate when left to themselves; and the discharging capacity of their
                    channels becomes less, whilst the extension of subsoil drainage causes the rain
                    to flow more rapidly and completely into the river upon whose basin it
                    falls.</p>
                <p>The available fall of the river is frequently diminished by the erection of fixed
                    weirs across the channel, at various places, for the purpose of forming a head
                    of water for mills, or of providing still-water navigation. These weirs are
                    generally constructed with high sills, and of inadequate width; and where flood
                    openings closed by draw-doors are adopted the doors are frequently not fully
                    raised till a flood has actually arrived. These weirs consequently not merely
                    reduce the discharging capacity of the channel by diminishing the available fall
                    of the water surface, but also actually restrict the section of the channel. The
                    result is that floods occur more frequently, rise higher, and remain on the land
                    for a longer period.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prevention of Floods.—</hi> The entire prevention of floods
                    would entail a larger expenditure than the results would justify. In most cases,
                    the prevention of summer floods and the mitigation of winter floods would
                    suffice; for, whilst summer floods are always very injurious, winter floods
                    prove sometimes beneficial in depositing the mud which they bring down, provided
                    they do not remain very long upon the land. Occasionally, however, where large
                    tracts of low-lying country are exposed to inundation, and especially where
                    portions of towns are below the flood level, it is necessary to extend the
                    protection so as to ensure entire immunity from floods.</p>
                <p>There are three methods by which floods may be prevented or mitigated,
                    namely,—(1) improvement of channel; (2) embankment of channel; (3) pumping.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Improvement of Channel.—</hi> The discharging capacity of a
                    river may be increased by enlarging the section of its channel; by the formation
                    of straight cuts, which reduce its length, and consequently increase its fall;
                    by dredging away shoals, and thus rendering the fall of its bed more uniform;
                    and by removing obstacles to its flow at weirs.</p>
                <p>The channels of the English Fen rivers have been enlarged and straightened, and
                    additional straight drains have been excavated for the more effectual drainage
                    of the low-lying Fen country. Catchwater drains have also been formed to collect
                    the rainfall of the higher lands and convey it into the river lower down, thus
                    gaining a better fall than could be obtained if the upland waters were allowed
                    to flow down to the low lands, besides relieving the low lands of this
                    additional discharge.</p>
                <p>Straight cuts are very useful when the fall is slight and the velocity of flow is
                    consequently small; but they are not so suitable for more rapid streams, and,
                    besides modifying the flow, and thus tending to produce shoals below, their
                    straight course is liable to be altered by the irregularities of the current,
                    especially if joining a sharp bend above. The banks in such cases need
                    protection against erosion, which adds considerably to the cost of the works.
                    The improvement of the upper Mississippi by cut-offs has not proved
                    satisfactory; and it has been found preferable to train the river by brushwood
                    mattresses and dykes.</p>
                <p>Solid weirs across a river form serious impediments to its flow; and draw-door or
                    movable weirs should be provided with adequate waterways, and sills level with
                    the bed of the river. Old bridges, also, with wide piers and narrow arches
                    retard the discharge of a river, and their rebuilding with wide openings would
                    afford considerable relief. All obstacles in the river bed, such as weeds,
                    fallen trees, and refuse, should be periodically removed; and fish-traps at
                    weirs should be discarded, as they collect floating leaves and rubbish in their
                    meshes and thus soon become entirely blocked up.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Embankment of Channel.—</hi> When it is essential that the
                    lands bordering a river should be absolutely protected from inundation, the
                    enlargement of a river bed to an adequate extent for discharging the greatest
                    floods would be too costly, especially when the fall is small; and it becomes
                    necessary to resort to the expedient of increasing the channel, above the
                    surface of the ground, by forming embankments along each side. By making the
                    banks with material excavated from the channel, the earthwork serves the double
                    purpose of enlarging the river bed and forming a bank. A flood channel of
                    considerable dimensions can be readily obtained by placing the embankments some
                    distance back from the margin of the river, thus greatly enlarging the section
                    when the waters rise above the level of the land, whilst leaving the natural
                    river bed unaltered for the ordinary flow. In some cases merely low embankments
                    are constructed, which retain small floods but are submerged when large floods
                    come down. Embankments, however, formed to secure the surrounding country from
                    inundation must be high enough to exceed the highest flood level of the river,
                    strong enough to resist the pressure of the water at that level, and perfectly
                    watertight. If water can percolate through the bank, a breach is readily formed;
                    and if a high bank is overtopped by the river, the rush of the stream over it
                    soon destroys a portion of the embankment and produces a disastrous inundation
                    from the large volume of water suddenly liberated. The Fens of Lincolnshire, a
                    large portion of Holland, the valley of the Po, and large tracts of low-lying
                    land bordering the Mississippi are protected by embankments.</p>
                <p>The defects in the system of embanking rivers are—that weak points in the banks
                    are liable to be breached; that the banks are liable to be overtopped by
                    unusually high floods; and that the muddy waters of the river in flood <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n596/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0596-0573"/>deposit their sediment in the bed of the river,
                    instead of spreading it over the adjacent land, and thus gradually raise the
                    river bed and consequently the height of the floods. The remedies for these
                    defects are strong high banks made of the best materials, and a periodical
                    cleansing of the river bed. Neglect of these precautions has led to serious
                    disasters. Large tracts in the Fens have been occasionally flooded by the
                    bursting or overtopping of badly constructed banks. Numerous breaches have
                    occurred in the embankments of the Po, resulting in the devastation of its
                    valley; and the flood level of the Po has been so much raised that it has been
                    decided not to heighten the embankments for fear of occasioning still greater
                    disasters. The gradual silting up of the river Theiss, near Szegedin, produced a
                    rise in its flood level which led to the overtopping of the protecting
                    embankment in 1879, and the formation of a breach; and the water thus set free
                    destroyed a portion of Szegedin, and inundated a tract of 200 square miles. The
                    rise of the bed of some rivers in Japan, from the deposit of silt, has been
                    followed up by the gradual raising of the embankments; and this system has been
                    carried out to such a degree, and the accumulated deposit is so great, that some
                    of these embanked rivers have their beds as much as forty feet above the level
                    of the plains over which they flow. These high embankments necessarily require
                    constant attention; and any failure is attended with serious inundations. They
                    serve as a warning against the extensive raising of embankments to counteract
                    the silting up of a river.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Pumping.—</hi> When lands are very flat and low, lying
                    sometimes actually below the general drainage level of the district and the
                    waterlevel of the streams, it is impossible for rivers to perform their ordinary
                    function of draining the land by gravitation. It is necessary in such cases to
                    create an artificial fall by pumping the drainage waters up so as to be
                    discharged into the adjacent streams. This method has the advantage of ensuring
                    the effectual drainage of the lands, provided adequate pumping power is
                    supplied; but it forms an additional tax on the land, as steam has to be applied
                    to do what is under ordinary conditions effected by nature, and the land has
                    also to be surrounded by banks.</p>
                <p>This system has been adopted for the drainage of the Haarlem Meer reclamation,
                    and also for the lands reclaimed from Lake Y in the construction of the
                    Amsterdam ship canal. The drainage of the Fens is, in several instances,
                    supplemented by pumping; and a portion of the Witham basin has been secured
                    against floods by this means.</p>
                <p>The formation of large reservoirs in river valleys has been proposed for storing
                    the surplus waters till a flood has subsided. A reservoir has indeed been
                    formed, by constructing a high masonry dam across a narrow gorge of the Furens
                    valley, which both supplies the town of St Étienne with water and preserves it
                    from inundation. It is also proposed to prevent the floods of the river Chagres
                    from interfering with the Panama Canal, by impounding its flood waters in an
                    extensive reservoir to be formed by building a high dam across a suitable point
                    of its valley. In these cases, however, the deep valleys with their narrow
                    gorges are peculiarly well adapted for the formation of reservoirs having a
                    considerable capacity, whereas most river valleys are unsuitable for reservoirs,
                    and the construction of the long lengths of the banks that would be required
                    would entail a very large expenditure, so that this system could only have a
                    very restricted application.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Improvements of the Upper Portions of Rivers.—</hi> Most rivers
                    are not suitable by nature for navigation in their non-tidal portion, or, in the
                    case of tideless rivers, at a considerable distance from their mouths, as the
                    fall of their bed increases towards their source, and they generally present
                    irregularities in depth and flow, with occasional sharp bends. Even where the
                    depth is adequate, an irregular or rapid flow offers a great obstacle to
                    up-stream traffic. Moreover, the fall of the waterlevel in dry seasons would
                    often make a river too shallow for navigation. Accordingly, whilst improving the
                    worst bends and removing shoals, it is frequently necessary to retain the water,
                    when the flow is small, so as to maintain a sufficient depth. This is
                    accomplished by dividing the river into a series of sections or reaches, and
                    pounding up the water at the end of each reach by means of a dam or weir.</p>
                <p>Formerly rivers used to be penned in by a series of stanches near shoal places,
                    which held up the water, and, when several boats were collected in the pool
                    above a stanch, it was suddenly opened, and the sudden rush of water floated the
                    boats over the shallows below. This primitive method of navigation, termed
                    flashing, was formerly practised on the Thames and the Severn, and also on some
                    of the rapidly flowing rivers in France, such as the Yonne. The stanches on the
                    Severn were removed in 1842; but a few still exist across the Thames above
                    Oxford, where the barge navigation follows a lateral canal. These stanches,
                    consisting of beams swung across the river and supporting a series of spars and
                    paddles, were easily removed in flood time or for the passage of boats. The
                    stanches on the Yonne, which were more recently erected, were of a more
                    elaborate description, known as needle weirs, and are still retained as weirs
                    for holding up the water, though the process of flashing has been
                    discontinued.</p>
                <p>As the demands of navigation increased, these primitive methods proved
                    inadequate, and, moreover, they were quite unsuited for up-stream traffic.
                    Accordingly weirs were substituted for stanches, to hold up the water in each
                    reach; and locks were constructed, in suitable side channels, for enabling
                    vessels to be passed from one reach to the next with little loss of water, and
                    with equal facility either up or down. Rivers have been thus converted into
                    still-water navigations, with level reaches forming a series of steps, having a
                    fall at each lock, in place of the natural inclination of the river bed; so that
                    the up-river traffic is in a great measure relieved from the serious hindrance
                    of an opposing current. In order that the water held back by the weir may be
                    retained within the channel, it is necessary to raise the banks on each side for
                    some distance above the weir; and, as the gradual rise in the river bed towards
                    the upper end of the reach reduces the depth, it is necessary to deepen the
                    river along the upper portion of the reach to secure a uniform draught of water.
                    A river is thus practically converted into a canal, with this sole difference
                    that it has still to discharge the drainage waters of its basin. This primary
                    object of rivers, to which indeed they owe their existence, was in many
                    instances somewhat overlooked when rivers were utilized for navigation; and
                    weirs appear to have been often regarded merely as dams for retaining the water,
                    rather than as regulators of its flow.</p>
                <p>Weirs.—Locks have been already considered in the article on Canals (g.vf; so that
                    it will suffice here to describe briefly the different forms of weirs, which are
                    essentially river works.</p>
                <p>Weirs have been divided into three classes, namely, overfall weirs, draw-door
                    weirs, and movable weirs. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Overfall Weirs.—An overfall weir is a solid barrier placed across a stream for
                    the purpose of raising the waterlevel (Plate V. fig. 1 <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The fig. references in the present article
                    all indicate Plate V. </p></note> ), and only affords an outlet for the
                    discharge of the river when the water rises above its crest. The waterlevel of
                    the river is thus permanently raised, not merely in dry seasons, but also in
                    flood time,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n597/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0597-0574"/>
                <p>and its fall is correspondingly reduced. Accordingly, the discharging capacity of
                    a river is materially diminished by the erection of overfall weirs; and this is
                    only partially remedied by the deepening of the channel for navigation,
                    especially as deposit more readily accumulates in the lower part of a reach,
                    owing to the reduction in velocity of the current by the conversion of the river
                    into level reaches. Endeavours have been made to alleviate this defect by
                    placing the weir in a wide place on the river, and at an angle to the cross
                    section of the channel, thereby increasing the length of its sill, and
                    consequently the discharge over it for any definite height of the river (fig.
                    2). The gain in length of an oblique weir is somewhat neutralized by the weir
                    not being at right angles to the direction of the current; and, even if the
                    cross section of the channel above the sill of the weir is as large as the
                    average section of the river bed, the change in shape, and the small hydraulic
                    radius of the section over the weir, check the discharge of the stream.</p>
                <p>Draw-door Weirs.—In order to afford a freer flow than is attainable with the
                    best-designed overfall weir, draw-door weirs are sometimes adopted, which serve
                    equally well to retain the water above during dry weather, and provide a large
                    opening for the discharge of the stream in floods. Draw-door weirs consist of a
                    row of doors, or sluice gates, sliding vertically in grooves formed at the sides
                    of frames, piles, or piers, which are shut down when the flow is small, but are
                    raised to admit the passage of flood waters. These weirs generally serve to
                    supplement an ordinary overfall weir; and, whilst the overfall weir regulates
                    the flow in dry weather, the draw-door weir provides for its more rapid
                    discharge in flood time. The relief, however, afforded by draw-door weirs
                    depends entirely on the opening they furnish; they are rarely, if ever, made
                    equal in section to the river channel, and their sills are usually raised some
                    feet above the bed of the river; but, nevertheless, they are much superior to
                    overfall weirs in respect of drainage, especially when the river has a small
                    fall and low banks.</p>
                <p>A large oblique overfall and draw-door weir has been erected across the Thames,
                    by Mr Leach, at the limit of its tidal flow at Teddington, having a total length
                    of 480 feet. This weir is divided into four bays, the two side bays being
                    overfalls, whilst the two central bays, 172∣ feet and 69 j feet wide
                    respectively, are closed by large iron draw-doors sliding in grooves at the
                    sides of strong iron frames supporting a foot bridge from which the doors are
                    raised. The frames rest upon piles, and on the top of a rubble mound raised
                    about a foot above low-tide level. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    </p></note></p>
                <p>The friction of large draw-doors against the grooves, in being lifted, is
                    considerable when there is a head of water on one side; but this has been much
                    reduced by Mr F. Stoney, in a large weir in Brazil, by making the doors, 20 feet
                    in width, bear on each side against a row of free rollers suspended in the
                    grooves. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Minutes of

                <p>Movable Weirs. —Although draw-door weirs afford a much freer discharge for a
                    river than overfall weirs, the vertical frames or piers in which the doors slide
                    offer more or less impediment to the flow. This defect is avoided by movable
                    weirs, which, whilst equally efficient in retaining the water when raised, can
                    be entirely lowered or removed so as to leave the channel quite open in
                    floodtime.</p>
                <p>There are three types of movable weirs which have been regularly adopted abroad,
                    whilst other forms have been occasionally tried. The two types most extensively
                    used are the frame or needle weiland the shutter weir, whereas the drum weir has
                    been only erected on the Marne.</p>
                <p>The ∕rατne weir consists of a series of movable iron frames, placed at intervals
                    across the channel of a river end on to the current, carrying a foot bridge at
                    the top, and supporting a wooden watertight barrier which forms the actual weir.
                    Till recently the barrier was always composed of a series of long square wooden
                    spars, or needles, placed close together and nearly vertical, resting against a
                    sill at the bottom and against a horizontal bar connecting the frames near the
                    top (fig. 3). This type of weir has, accordingly, been very commonly called a
                    needle weir {barrage a aiguilles)g but this term would not now include every
                    form of the frame weir. The first needle weir was erected across the Yonne in
                    1834; and till 1881 all the weirs on the Seine below Paris were of this form.
                    The needle weir is opened by lifting each needle successively from the foot
                    bridge; one of the end frames is then disconnected from the rest by unfastening
                    and withdrawing the connecting bars, the corresponding portion of the foot
                    bridge is taken up, and the frame, which is hinged at the bottom, is lowered by
                    chains on to the apron of the weir, and the whole of the frames are similarly
                    lowered in succession, leaving the passage quite clear. The weir is closed again
                    by a precisely reverse series of operations.</p>
                <p>As the weight of the needle, which should be readily lifted by one man, imposes a
                    limit to the height of the weir, the large frame weir recently erected at
                    Pσrt-Villez near Vernon, having a height of 18 feet, has been closed by a sort
                    of wooden hinged shutter which spans the interval of 3⅛ feet between each frame,
                    and can be rolled up from the bottom and removed when the weir is to be
                    opened.</p>
                <p>A series of similar hinged shutters are designed to close double intervals
                    between the frames, about 7 feet wide, of the frame weir in progress at Poses,
                    the next weir above Martot weir which is at the boundary of the tidal Seine
                    above Rouen. Poses weir has a form quite distinct from all frame weirs hitherto
                    constructed, for its vertical frames are suspended from an overhead girder, and
                    rest against a sill at the bottom when down, but can be raised entirely out of
                    water into a horizontal position when the weir is open. The girders carry a foot
                    bridge, from which the frames and hinged shutters are raised and lowered, and
                    rest on masonry piers dividing the river into seven bays, the two navigable
                    passes being 106⅛ feet and the five shallower passes 99 feet wide. The girders
                    spanning the two navigable passes leave a clear headway of 17⅛ feet above the
                    navigable high water, whilst the rest of the girders are merely placed above
                    flood level. The fall at the weir is 13 feet. The system is costly, with its
                    girders and piers, but it secures all the movable parts of the weir from injury
                    in flood, and enables the weir to be worked with perfect ease and safety.</p>
                <p>Sliding panels have been adopted for closing the frame weir across the Rhone at
                    Mulatière, near Lyons, erected in 1882; and a comparison is being made of the
                    relative durability of sliding panels and hinged shutters by placing the two
                    systems side by side at Suresnes weir just below Paris.</p>
                <p>The earliest form of shutter weir consisted of a gate, or shutter, turning on a
                    horizontal axis at the bottom, supported by a prop when raised against the
                    stream, and falling flat on the apron of the weir when the prop was withdrawn.
                    As considerable force would be required to raise such a shutter against a strong
                    stream, a second up-stream gate is usually provided, which, rising with the
                    stream and being retained by chains, relieves the pressure on the down-stream
                    gate, and enables it to be readily raised and propped up. The waterlevel is then
                    equalized on both sides of the upper gate, which is then lowered; and the lower
                    gate forms the actual weir, which can be opened by merely releasing the prop. In
                    India, where this form of shutter weir has been adopted on a large scale, the
                    strain on the retaining chains was so great, when the upper shutter was raised
                    in a strong current to shut off the river from the irrigation canals, that
                    hydraulic brakes have been substituted, by Mr Fouracres, for controlling the
                    motion of the up-stream shutters. A closed cylinder full of water is fixed on
                    the apron of the weir above the upper shutter, in which a piston, attached to
                    the upper side of the shutter, is fitted. Directly the current tends to lift the
                    shutter, the piston is drawn against the cushion of water in the cylinder, which
                    controls its motion. The pressure of the piston forces the water gradually out
                    of some small orifices along the side of the cylinder, so that the piston is
                    enabled to travel slowly along the cylinder. In its progress, however, it passes
                    by some of the orifices, whereby the rate of efflux of the remaining water is
                    reduced, and a greater resistance offered to the motion of the piston. Whilst
                    therefore the shutter in rising presents a greater surface to the stream, and
                    consequently exerts a greater pull upon the piston, the retarding force is
                    similarly increased, and the shutter is thus gradually raised without any
                    jar.</p>
                <p>At Brûlée Island weir, on the Yonne, the up-stream shutter has been dispensed
                    with; and the shutter forming the weir is raised against the stream by a piston
                    working in a hydraulic press (fig. 4), the water pressure being supplied from an
                    accumulator which is charged by means of a turbine worked by the fall of water
                    at the weir. The weir is closed by seven shutters, 11⅜ feet long and 6 feet
                    high, which can be raised in five minutes; and the power for damming up the
                    stream is actually obtained from the stream itself.</p>
                <p>The form of shutter weir most commonly adopted in France is shown in fig. 5,
                    representing a section of the largest and most recent weir of this type, erected
                    at Port-à-Γ Anglais weir on the Seine, two or three miles above Paris; and weirs
                    on the same system have been erected across the Great Kanawha river in the
                    United States. The shutter revolves upon a horizontal axis placed just above the
                    centre of pressure on the down-stream side of the shutter. The axis is fastened
                    on an iron tressel hinged to the apron of the weir; and the shutter and tressel
                    are supported in position by a wrought-iron prop resting against a cast-iron
                    shoe fixed on the apron. When the weir is closed, the shutter butts against a
                    sill at the bottom, as is shown on fig. 5. The weir can be more or less opened,
                    from the foot bridge, by means of chains fastened to the top and bottom of the
                    shutter; and it can be completely lowered in flood time by releasing the prop
                    from its shoe, when the prop, tressel, and shutter fall flat upon the apron,
                    their fall being regulated by aid of the chains; the frames also supporting the
                    foot bridge, being hinged to the apron, can be lowered as in the ordinary frame
                    weir. The weir is raised by first reinstating the foot bridge, and then raising
                    the shutters, with the connected tressels and props, by means of the chains.

                    is 3∣ feet wide, and rises 12⅜ feet above the sill of the weir. Smaller shutter
                    weirs, of a similar form, are placed on the top of overfalls to regulate the
                    discharge, being so adjusted that the shutters dip when the water attains a
                    certain height above them. Sometimes the regulation of the flow is effected
                    through the large shutters by means of small shutters fixed in their upper
                    panels, called butterfly valves, which open spontaneously when the water rises
                    above the required height. The smaller shutters on the overfalls are entirely
                    lowered in flood-time, like the large shutters, but, being unprovided with a
                    foot-bridge, they are raised by aid of boats on the approach of the dry season.
                    The earlier shutters erected across the navigable passes were similarly raised;
                    but, though a foot bridge adds considerably to the cost of a shutter weir, it
                    greatly facilitates its working.</p>
                <p>The navigable passes in French rivers, which are always closed either by frame or
                    shutter weirs, serve for the passage of vessels during floods when the locks are
                    submerged.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the primitive movable stanches, there is only one example
                    of a movable weir in England. This self-acting shutter weir has been erected
                    across the Irwell at Thostlenest near Manchester; and a section of it is given
                    in fig. 6. The weir consists of a series of shutters turning on a central
                    horizontal axis. When the weir is closed, each shutter is inclined at an angle
                    of 35° to the vertical, as shown in fig. 6, and revolves to a horizontal
                    position for opening the weir. It resembles in fact the French shutter weirs,
                    except that the shutters and their supports are not removed from the channel, so
                    that the waterway at Thostlenest is not so unimpeded as in the French system.
                    The shutters are so adjusted that they open when the river rises 2 j feet above
                    its ordinary level; but, lest the rush of water, which would result from their
                    sudden opening, should injure the river bed, an arrangement has been made for
                    opening any of the shutters by means of a set of chains w <hi rend="superscript"
                    >τ</hi> orked by crabs from each bank, so as to release the pent-up waters more
                    gradually. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Engineer, Sept. 1, 1882. </p></note> This weir, designed by Mr Wiswall, consists
                    of fourteen shutters, each 10 feet wide above the axis and 9 feet below, and 12
                    feet long. The actual height of the weir above the floor is only 10 feet, owing
                    to the inclination of the shutters, so that it presents a surface of 1400 square
                    feet to the stream when closed, which is reduced to 293 feet when open.</p>
                <p>The drum weir, which has been adopted in several instances on the river Marne,
                    consists of an upper and an under iron paddle capable of making a quarter of a
                    revolution round a horizontal central axis. The upper paddle forms the weir, and
                    the under one revolves in a closed recess, shaped like the quadrant of a
                    cylinder, laid below the sill of the weir, from which the term drum is derived
                    (fig. 7). The under paddle and the drum are so formed that a space is left
                    between the upper face of the paddle and the top of the drum when the paddles
                    are horizontal; and a similar space exists between the down-stream face of the
                    paddle and the vertical wall of the drum when the paddles are vertical, as
                    represented in fig. 7. These spaces serve as sluiceways by which water can be
                    admitted into the series of drums on the upper or under side of the under
                    paddles. The weir is closed by placing the upper sluiceway in communication with
                    the upper pool, when the pressure of water on the upper faces of the under
                    paddles overcomes the pressure of the stream upon the upper paddles, causing
                    them to rise, and closing the weir against the stream. The weir is readily
                    opened by shutting off communication between the upper pool and the upper
                    sluiceway, and opening communication with the lower pool; the stream then
                    depresses the upper paddles, or the action can be quickened by opening
                    communication between the upper pool and lower sluiceway. The pressure on either
                    side of the under paddles can be easily adjusted with the utmost precision,
                    enabling the paddles to be placed at any angle, so that the most absolute
                    control is obtained over the discharge at the weir. The largest example of this
                    type of weir is at Joinville, on the Marne, only a few miles above Paris. The
                    weir is formed by forty-two paddles, 3⅜ feet high and 4⅔ feet wide, which are
                    worked with great ease by means of sluice gates on the left bank, being opened
                    or closed in three or four minutes by one man. This type of weir has the defect
                    of not being suited for navigable passes, owing to the depth of the foundations
                    for the drum below the floor of the weir having to exceed the height of the
                    actual weir.</p>
                <p>Movable weirs possess the great merit over other forms of weirs of offering
                    little or no impediment to the passage of floods; and this advantage is still
                    further enhanced by the system of warnings, organized for the Seine, the Loire,
                    and other French rivers, whereby timely information of the approach of a flood
                    is telegraphed to the various weir keepers, so that they may fully open the
                    weirs before its arrival, and thus aid in facilitating its descent. By
                    telegraphic intimation of the rise in the upper tributaries, and of the rainfall
                    in the basin, it is possible to predict with remarkable accuracy the probable
                    rise of the river at places lower down, and to afford valuable warning of a
                    coming flood to the riparian proprietors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tidal and Tideless Rivers.</hi></p>
                <p>Rivers may be broadly divided into two classes in respect of the lower portion of
                    their course, for the tide is propagated up some rivers to a considerable
                    distance from their mouth, commingling with the fresh water and producing an ebb
                    and flow far into the interior; whilst rivers flowing into tideless seas descend
                    with an unimpeded current to their outlet. Tidal and tideless rivers, possessing
                    very distinct physical characteristics, necessarily present different features
                    and require different methods of improvement, and will be therefore separately
                    considered. Tidal rivers are the more numerous, owing to the greater extent of
                    tidal seas. The great differences also in the tidal rise introduce numerous
                    variations in the tidal influence on rivers, and the rise of the river bed
                    determines the distance to which the tidal flow extends. Accordingly, tidal
                    rivers exhibit a greater diversity in their natural condition than tideless
                    rivers, which are only affected by the volume of their fresh-water discharge,
                    the amount of sediment carried in suspension, and the inclination of their bed.
                    These latter conditions affect also the state of tidal rivers, but their
                    influence is greatly modified by the ebb and flow of a large volume of tidal
                    waters. The effect of the tidal ebb and flow is most readily perceived in
                    contrasting the mouths of tidal and tideless rivers. The mouths of the
                    Mississippi, the Nile, the Danube, and the Rhone present very marked differences
                    to the outlets of the St Lawrence, the Seine, the Thames, and the Severn.
                    Tideless rivers divide into a number of mouths, whereas tidal rivers are
                    confined to a single outlet; and the effect of tidal influence on this
                    difference is still further confirmed by the instance of the Maas, which, with a
                    very slight tidal range, exhibits a tendency to deteriorate into the dispersion
                    of mouths of a tideless river. The value of tidal flow in maintaining a river is
                    fully manifested by comparing the navigable condition of the Thames or of the
                    muddy Humber with the delta of the Nile or the Rhone, though the latter rivers
                    possess a much larger fresh-w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ater discharge. The
                    tidal rise also frequently allows of the access of vessels to a river whose
                    entrance is barred at low water.</p>
                <p>The general improvements of the upper portions of both tidal and tideless rivers
                    may be carried out on similar principles, though on approaching their mouths
                    they need a totally different treatment. To give a river a uniform depth, its
                    channel and flow require regulation. Hard shoals may be permanently removed by
                    dredging; but silty shoals, even when dredged away, will re-form unless the
                    channel is contracted. Formerly rivers were regulated by building out jetties at
                    intervals at right angles to the banks, especially in wide shoal places, in
                    order to contract the channel and concentrate the stream, so as to scour a
                    deeper central channel. These cross jetties, however, whilst effecting a
                    deepening in front of their extremities, caused irregularities in the flow of
                    the current in the intervals between them, thus producing differences in depth.
                    Continuous longitudinal jetties, or training banks, though more costly, are much
                    more efficient in regulating a river, and are now generally adopted for
                    procuring a uniform width, and, consequently, a regular depth. Where the fall
                    alters, a corresponding variation must be made in the section of the channel;
                    and, in the case of tidal rivers, the section should gradually increase as it
                    approaches the sea, so as to admit the increasing volume of sea water which
                    enters but does not pass far up the estuary whose upper portion has been filled
                    by the earlier flow.</p>
                <p>Most rivers, whether tidal or tideless, are more or less impeded for navigation
                    by a bar at their mouth. A bar is a ridge or shoal extending across the
                    navigable channel,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n599/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0599-0576"/>
                <p>over which there is a less depth than either above or below it. The lowering of
                    such a bar forms one of the main objects of river improvement, as upon the depth
                    that can be obtained over the bar depend the class of vessels that can enter the
                    river, and, in tidal rivers, the period of time during which the entrance can be
                    navigated. A bar may result from the action of the sea, which tends to form a
                    continuous beach across any inlet, and would obliterate the mouths of rivers if
                    the channels were not maintained by the ebb and flow of the tide and the
                    fresh-water discharge; or it may be formed by the conflict of the sea and river
                    water, which checks the current at the mouth and causes the river to deposit the
                    sediment which it held in suspension. The bars at the mouths of the Mersey, the
                    Liffey, and the Adour are due to the first cause; whilst the bars at the mouths
                    of tideless rivers, such as the Mississippi, the Danube, and the Rhone, are
                    mainly due to the second.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Improvement of Tidal Rivers.</hi></p>
                <p>Tidal rivers differ greatly in their natural characteristics, owing to the
                    variety in the different conditions which affect them. Thus the Mersey, with an
                    extreme tidal rise of 30 feet at its mouth, is only tidal for 46 miles, whilst
                    the Seine, with a rise of 22 feet, is tidal for 91 miles, and the Scheldt, with
                    a rise of only 13 J feet, is tidal up to Ghent, a distance of 105 miles. These
                    differences are mainly due to the different falls of the riverbeds, but they are
                    also affected by the facility of entry afforded to the flood tide, and the form
                    of the channel up which it flows. The tidal capacity of a river depends on the
                    rise of the tide and the configuration of the banks. The tidal flow into the
                    Mersey amounts to 710,000,000 cubic yards at a high spring tide, whilst the flow
                    into the Scheldt at Flushing, with less than half the tidal rise, reaches
                    475,000,000 cubic yards. The tidal capacity of the Seine, together with its
                    estuary, formerly exceeded that of the Mersey, but it has been greatly reduced
                    by the training works which have been carried out on it since 1848.</p>
                <p>The tidal ebb and flow passing and returning through the entrance channels of a
                    river twice a day exercise a very important influence on its maintenance. The
                    effect of tidal scour is manifested in the history of the harbours of Calais and
                    Ostend, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>L. F.
                    Vernon-Harcourt, Harbours and Docks, pp. 149 and 155. </p></note> which in old
                    times possessed deep outlet channels, but were injured by reclamation, and in
                    the deterioration of the outfalls of the Fen rivers as soon as the tidal flow
                    was curtailed by the erection of sluices. The power of the tidal scour
                    necessarily varies with the volume of water producing it, and therefore one of
                    the first principles of tidal river improvement is that the tide should be
                    admitted as far up a river as possible, and all obstructions to its flow
                    removed. If, however, the maintenance of an estuary depended solely upon the
                    tidal ebb and flow, the estuary would gradually silt up, for the flood tide
                    brings in matter in suspension which it washes from the adjacent shores and
                    sandbanks, especially during rough weather, when the waves stir up the sand and
                    silt. The impetus of the tide running up the rising bed of an estuary is
                    gradually checked, till at last slack water occurs, and the silt begins to
                    deposit, which the ebb tide, enfeebled by the friction of the tidal water in its
                    passage up and down the estuary, would of itself be unable completely to remove.
                    The erection of any obstructions to the tidal flow, such as sluices and weirs,
                    increases the period of slack tide, and consequently not only reduces the volume
                    of ebb and flow but also promotes the deposit of silt, to the further detriment
                    of the estuary. The maintenance of estuaries is secured by the aid of their
                    freshwater discharge, which, being penned up during the flood tide, reinforces
                    the ebb and preserves an equilibrium.</p>
                <p>The fresh-water discharge of a river, depending upon the area of the basin and
                    the available rainfall, naturally varies greatly in different rivers—being, for
                    instance, greater in the Tyne and the Clyde than in the Mersey, though these
                    rivers have little more than one-thirteenth of the tidal capacity of the Mersey.
                    The Seine, with a drainage area of 30,500 square miles, nearly six times the
                    size of the Thames basin, has a discharge of 28,000,000 cubic yards, on the
                    average, each tide (about twenty-eight times that of the Mersey), though this
                    volume sinks into insignificance when compared with the flow of the Danube with
                    a basin of ten times the size, or still more of the Mississippi with a basin
                    forty times as large. A large freshwater discharge is of great value to the
                    maintenance of an estuary, especially when, as in the case of the Seine, it
                    carries little silt in suspension; whilst a small discharge in proportion to the
                    size of an estuary, of which the Mersey is a notable instance, renders the state
                    of the estuary very delicate, and necessitates great vigilance in maintaining
                    its tidal capacity, to which its existence is almost wholly due.</p>
                <p>The silt brought down by tidal rivers, instead of being carried to their mouths
                    and there deposited, is met by the incoming tide at points varying daily with
                    the states of the tides; and, moreover, except during slack tide, it is
                    maintained in constant motion up and down the estuary, till at length it gets to
                    the sea. Accordingly, though the sediment of tidal rivers is more or less
                    deposited wherever the velocity of the current is checked, it does not tend to
                    accumulate in one particular part, as in the case of tideless rivers, and
                    therefore the formation of a bar at the mouth is mainly due to the drift by
                    waves along the beach. A flood also, though more largely charged with silt, by
                    giving additional power to the ebb, scours the channel and lowers the bar. The
                    Humber, whose waters are densely burdened with mud which is readily deposited in
                    still water, is nevertheless free from a bar.</p>
                <p>The best form of estuary for a tidal river is when it enlarges gradually as it
                    approaches the sea, thus affording an increasing capacity for the admission of
                    the tide, and promoting a regular flow. The estuaries approximating to such a
                    form are generally free from bars—as, for instance, the Thames, the Severn, and
                    the Scheldt. When, however, a river expands abruptly into a wide estuary on a
                    sandy coast, it winds through the enlarged estuary in an unstable shallow
                    channel, owing to the reduced velocity of the ebb in expanding out, and the
                    checking of the flood tide on reaching the head of the wide estuary. Thus the
                    Seine, with a deep stable channel from Rouen to La Mailleraye, had formerly a
                    shallow shifting dangerous channel from thence to the sea; the Ribble, with a
                    good depth at Preston, has a shoal irregular channel towards its mouth; and the
                    Dee, with a moderate channel at Chester, is almost barred to vessels, except at
                    high tide, below Connah’s Quay. These estuaries do not possess a well-defined
                    bar, but their long shallow winding channels offer a still more serious
                    impediment to navigation. The worst form is a very irregular estuary with abrupt
                    expansions and contractions, of which the Mersey is a prominent example, for, in
                    spite of its large rise of tide, it possesses a shallow, irregular, and shifting
                    channel above Liverpool, and is encumbered by a wide bar below.</p>
                <p>There are three obstructions to which tidal rivers are subject, namely, a bar, a
                    shifting channel, and inadequacy of depth; and there are three general methods
                    which may be resorted to for their improvement, namely, jetties, training walls,
                    and dredging, in addition to the regulation of their upper portion by
                    longitudinal jetties, or banks, as previously mentioned.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n600/mode/1up"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Jetties.—</hi> A bar being caused by the littoral drift, and by
                    the impotence of the expanded current to scour the channel over it to the same
                    depth as elsewhere, it is necessary either to arrest the drift or to concentrate
                    the current across the bar. The drift, which comes from the direction of the
                    prevalent winds, might be temporarily arrested by projecting a groyne, or jetty,
                    from the shore on the windward side of the outlet. The material, however,
                    carried along the coast would accumulate against the jetty, and eventually form
                    a bar beyond, or, sweeping round the end of the jetty,, deposit in the channel
                    under its shelter. Accordingly a second jetty is added, on the opposite side of
                    the outlet, to direct and concentrate the current over the bar, and thus
                    increase the depth of the channel, and also to drive into deep water any
                    material that may be carried round the windward jetty, or convey it within the
                    influence of any littoral current farther out. The jetties are either made
                    parallel, or slightly diverging, so as to form a sort of continuation of the
                    banks of the river across the beach, or they are commenced far apart and made to
                    converge towards their extremities, so as to admit a larger volume of tidal
                    water and concentrate the flow into a narrow channel over the bar. The parallel
                    jetty system has been adopted for the new outlet of the Maas (fig. 13), the
                    mouth of the Adour near Bayonne (fig. 16), and the mouths of the Wear at
                    Sunderland, the Yare at Yarmouth, and the Ouse at Newhaven; whilst the
                    converging jetty system has been carried out at Charleston (figs. 17 and 18) and
                    Aberdeen, and at the mouths of the Liffey, the Tyne (fig. 8), and the Tees.</p>
                <p>The ordinary form of jetty is a timber pier resting upon a base of rubble stone,
                    like the jetties of the North Sea jetty harbours of Calais, Dunkirk, and Ostend,
                    so that the solid lower portion may concentrate the ebb, whilst the open upper
                    portion permits the passage of the littoral currents in order that a rapid
                    advance of the foreshore may be prevented. Such structures, however, simply
                    delay, and do not stop, the advance of the foreshore, as manifested at Newhaven
                    and Dunkirk, where the accumulation of shingle in the one case and of sand in
                    the other brought low-water mark out to the extremities of their western
                    jetties. The solid northern jetties of the Wear and the Yare have naturally
                    produced a similar advance of their northern beaches, both being exposed to a
                    north-easterly drift.</p>
                <p>A special form of jetty has been constructed at the mouth of the Adour to combine
                    the advantages of open and closed jetties. These jetties consist of a row of
                    cylindrical columns placed at intervals and carrying iron girders on the top.
                    Grooves are formed at the sides of the columns, down which panels can be lowered
                    from the roadway above to confine the issuing current, whilst when the panels
                    are open the spaces between the columns admit the flood tide and the passage of
                    the currents. Nevertheless there are indications of an advance of the foreshore;
                    the sand passing through the spaces in the northern jetty has encroached upon
                    the channel, and the depths are reduced beyond the end of the jetties (fig.
                    16).</p>
                <p>The most important examples of training jetties, including converging jetties,
                    have been made solid, though sometimes they have not been raised to high-water
                    level at their outer ends, in order to provide for the freer admission of the
                    flood tide. The converging jetties, or walls, at the mouth of the Liffey consist
                    of mounds of rubble stone, and the outer portion of the northern jetty is only
                    raised to half-tide level. The jetties at the mouth of the Maas (figs. 13 and
                    15) are formed of fascine mattresses; and the Charleston jetties (figs. 17 and
                    18) are similar in construction; in both these cases the outer portions have not
                    been raised above half-tide level. The converging jetties or piers at Aberdeen,
                    the Tyne (fig. 8), and the</p>

                    channels from the littoral drift, and promoting scour over the bar, as the less
                    solid structures at Dublin and Charleston. The Tees breakwaters are random
                    mounds of slag; the Aberdeen breakwaters at the mouth of the Dee are upright
                    walls of concrete; and the Tynemouth piers are masonry and concrete-block walls
                    upon a rubble foundation. The breakwaters afford a much better shelter for
                    vessels and for dredging operations, but the lower fascine-work jetties at the
                    mouth of the Maas are equally effective in directing the current.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Training Walls.—</hi> The wandering shallow channel of a river
                    through a wide sandy estuary may be improved by training the channel, in a
                    suitable direction, by means of longitudinal mounds of rubble stone, commonly
                    termed training walls. These walls fix the channel and prevent the current
                    eroding the sandbanks and thus changing its course. Moreover, by guiding the
                    channel into a more direct line, making the ebb and flow follow the same course,
                    and concentrating the current, the scouring capacity of the stream is increased
                    and the channel is deepened. The flood tide ascends the trained channel more
                    readily, and therefore is able to extend its influence farther up; whilst the
                    ebb tide flows out of the improved and deepened channel earlier, and thus lowers
                    the low-water line and increases the tidal capacity in the channel.</p>
                <p>The trained channel must be gradually widened out and carried into deep water,
                    otherwise the abrupt expansion which occurs beyond the ends of the training
                    walls would so enfeeble the ebbing current that a shallow shifting channel would
                    be formed only a short distance below. Training walls which stop in the middle
                    of a wide sandy estuary, like the walls carried out on the Seine (fig. 10) and
                    the Ribble, can be only regarded as incomplete works, which sooner or later will
                    have to be extended if the full benefit of a trained channel is to be realized.
                    When the channel is to follow close along one shore of the estuary, a single
                    training wall on the outer side is sufficient; and a single wall is sometimes
                    adequate for maintaining a channel in the middle of an estuary, when placed
                    along the concave side of a bend.</p>
                <p>The proper width between the training walls depends upon the fall, the tidal
                    range, and the fresh-water discharge, and should gradually increase down stream
                    so as to admit as much tidal water as possible with a steady flow. As the scour
                    of the fresh-water discharge is greater with a contracted channel, the tendency
                    is to place the training walls too close together, which, though improving the
                    depth in the channel between the walls, reduces the volume of tidal water that
                    can get up the channel and thus compromises the maintenance of the outlet beyond
                    the walls. The training walls on the Seine and on the Ribble, whilst improving
                    the trained channels, have been prejudicial to the channels beyond; and an
                    extension of the works has been authorized on the Ribble. The widths also
                    adopted between these walls are not compatible with an adequate widening out
                    towards their outlet for the free admission of the flood tide, so that these
                    estuaries will eventually be deficient in tidal capacity.</p>
                <p>The training of a wandering channel is always beneficial to the maintenance and
                    depth of the channel. The wanderings, however, of the channel, which are thus
                    arrested, though very prejudicial to navigation, are advantageous in preventing
                    the silting up of an estuary by the constant erosion and stirring up of the
                    sandbanks which they effect in shifting their position, and which they carry by
                    gradual stages throughout the whole of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0601-0578"/>estuary. The scouring current predominates at one
                    time in one part and at another time elsewhere, so that slack water is never
                    permanent in any part of the estuary, and accretion cannot progress for a long
                    period without disturbance. When, however, a channel is permanently fixed by
                    training walls, the condition of the estuary is completely transformed. The
                    flood tide, indeed, comes in with its burden of silt as before, rising sooner up
                    the improved channel, and therefore dispersing with a somewhat gentler flow over
                    the rest of the estuary. The ebb tide, however, is mainly concentrated along the
                    trained channel, especially when it attains its maximum scouring efficiency
                    towards low water. Accordingly, whilst the flow in the trained channel is
                    increased, stagnation occurs more or less over the rest of the estuary, and
                    silting-up inevitably occurs, resulting eventually in a large reduction of tidal
                    capacity. The accretion, moreover, is not confined to the portion of the estuary
                    behind the training walls, but gradually creeps down, on each side of the
                    estuary, for a considerable distance beyond the ends of the walls. Low training
                    walls hardly rising above the adjacent sandbanks have been tried with the object
                    of preventing this accretion, but the improved flow in the trained channel and
                    the reduced velocity elsewhere still promote accretion behind the low walls, and
                    the deposit, rising first along the shores of the estuary, gradually attains
                    high-water level over a great portion of the area at the back of the training
                    walls, and from thence slopes down to the top of the walls on each side of the
                    channel. Though the process of accretion is less rapid with low training walls,
                    the ultimate result is only delayed and not prevented, as clearly manifested by
                    observations on the Seine and other rivers, so that the view formerly
                    entertained by some engineers, that if training walls were kept down to the
                    level of the existing sandbanks no accretion would take place, has been proved
                    to be erroneous by the results of experience; and it may be accepted as a
                    general law that training walls, whether high or low, inevitably lead to
                    accretion if the flood tide is charged with silt.</p>
                <p>The most careful consideration should be given to all the conditions of an
                    estuary before training works are commenced, for when once begun they must be
                    eventually carried out to deep water; and, if ports exist along the shores of
                    the estuary, they are liable to be injured by the accretion resulting from the
                    works unless the trained channel can be led close along them. The training works
                    of the Seine estuary, though very advantageous to the inland port of Rouen, are
                    compromising the approach channels to Honfleur and Havre, and have silted up the
                    port of Harfleur, so that the extension of the training walls to Honfleur has
                    been urged in the interests of that port, whilst large works have been executed
                    to preserve its entrance, and a new direct channel into the sea is being
                    proposed for Havre. Though the training works on the Dee have not been carried
                    out hitherto in a judicious direction, having been formed mainly with a view to
                    land reclamation, it would be advantageous for the ports of Chester and Connah’s
                    Quay to extend these works towards the sea, as there are no ports below the
                    present limits of the training walls to be injured by the effects of their
                    prolongation, and the navigable channel would be much improved, provided the
                    works were carried out to deep water. The training walls in the Ribble estuary
                    must eventually be extended, even beyond the limits at present authorized, if a
                    good navigable channel is to be secured to Preston, but these works will produce
                    an entire transformation in the estuary, of which large portions have been
                    already reclaimed as a consequence of the works already accomplished. The Mersey
                    estuary would need a very comprehensive scheme for its improvement, owing to the
                    very defective natural condition of the estuary, and the situation of the ports
                    along its banks. The mere training of the channel in the upper estuary, for the
                    benefit of the up-river ports, would result in the reclamation of the wide
                    estuary between Runcorn and Liverpool, and thus deprive the channels between
                    Liverpool and the sea of their natural scouring reservoir of tidal water; whilst
                    the training of a channel below Liverpool out to the bar would necessitate very
                    extensive works in deep water and in an exposed situation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dredging.—</hi> The improvements effected within recent years
                    in the ordinary dredging machinery, and the introduction of the sand-pump
                    dredger, have facilitated and cheapened dredging operations to such an extent
                    that some of the most remarkable river improvements have been effected by
                    dredging. The great increase in depth realized on the Tyne and the Clyde has
                    been effected by means of steam bucket-dredgers aided by hopper barges, whilst
                    the maintenance of the entrance channel to St Nazaire on the Loire, and the
                    deepening of the approaches to Dunkirk and Calais, have been accomplished by
                    sand pumps, which have the advantage of being able to work when exposed to
                    moderate waves. Dredging merely consists in removing material from the river bed
                    and thus enlarging and deepening it; and the extent to which this method of
                    improvement may be carried simply depends upon the economical consideration as
                    to how far the improvement of the traffic on the river by an increase of depth
                    will afford an adequate return for the outlay. Dredging, however, furnishes a
                    cheap method of excavation owing to the small cost of carriage by water.
                    Dredging, being a purely artificial means of improvement, generally necessitates
                    regular maintenance; whereas the improvement from scour effected by jetties and
                    training walls is permanent, being realized by natural means. Frequently,
                    however, training walls and jetties are supplemented by dredging, for the walls
                    and jetties render the deepening by dredging easier and more permanent; whilst,
                    on the other hand, dredging enables a greater depth to be attained, and even
                    maintained, than could have been effected by scour alone.</p>
                <p>The improvements on the Tyne and on the Clyde have mainly resulted from very
                    extensive dredging operations, but they have been aided by training walls on the
                    Clyde, and by the Tynemouth piers on the Tyne, which protect the entrance
                    channel from drift and the dredgers from waves, and concentrate the scour over
                    the bar. The three methods of improvement described above have been resorted to
                    on the Tees: for training walls have been formed through the wide estuary below
                    Middlesborough for fixing the channel; converging jetties are being constructed
                    for sheltering the channel from wave-borne sand, and for directing the scour
                    over the bar; and dredging is being employed for deepening the trained and
                    sheltered channel. On the Maas also, and at Charleston, dredging is being used
                    for attaining a depth for navigation which the jetties alone were unable to
                    produce.</p>
                <p>River Tyne Improvement Works.</p>
                <p>The Tyne lias a drainage area of 1053 square miles; its tidal flow extends 18
                    miles from its mouth, and the range of spring tides at its outlet is 14∣ feet.
                    Being by nature a small winding irregular river, with little tidal capacity and
                    no estuary, its depth was small and variable, and a bar existed at its mouth,
                    which opens directly on to the sea-coast. The first improvement works, commenced
                    in 1843, consisted in training the river by cross jetties, subsequently
                    connected by low training walls, so as to regulate the width an∣l consequently
                    the depth of the river. Λs, however, the volume of water in the river was small,
                    the scour was not adequate to effect a great improvement in the depth; the bed
                    of the river between Newcastle and the sea, in 1860, was in many places above
                    low-water level; and the depth on the bar at low tide was only 6 feet (fig. 9).
                    The piers at the mouth were commenced in 1856,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n602/mode/1up"

                <p>for the purpose of facilitating the removal of the bar and for sheltering vessels
                    entering the river, and were originally designed to terminate in a depth of 13
                    feet at low water; but eventually a larger scheme was adopted for forming a
                    refuge harbour in combination with the improvement of the river, and the piers,
                    which are still in progress, are to extend into a depth of 30 feet. In 1861
                    extensive dredging operations were commenced for improving the depth of the
                    river, and a maximum of 3,515,000 cubic yards was removed in 1866; the work has
                    been regularly continued, and the total amount dredged since the commencement,
                    in 1838, reached 49,668,000 cubic yards in 1884, being an average of nearly
                    2,000,000 cubic yards annually since 1861, when systematic dredging operations
                    were begun. The improvement in depth that was effected between 1860 and 1884 is
                    shown on the longitudinal section of the river (fig. 9); and the deepening of
                    the river between Newcastle and Hedwin Streams, a distance of 8⅛ miles, is in
                    progress, being carried on by six dredgers. The river has also been regulated by
                    making a straight cut across Lemington Point, and widening the channel from 150
                    feet to 400 feet opposite Blaydon; the obstruction offered to the Tyne by the
                    old Newcastle Bridge has been removed by rebuilding the bridge with larger
                    openings; and a sharp bend in the river has been eased by removing the high
                    projecting rock at Bill Point (fig. 8). The tidal capacity of the. river lias
                    been increased by 14,000,000 cubic yards; the bar has been lowered 14 feet since
                    1860; and the least depth at low water up to Newcastle is 20 feet, and 18 feet
                    for 3 miles above. The deepening of the channel has produced a very beneficial
                    lowering of the flood line in the river, thereby preserving the adjacent lands
                    from inundation. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>P. J.

                <p>River Clyde Improvement Works.</p>
                <p>The Clyde is a small river, with a drainage area of only 945 square miles, and a
                    tidal flow of about 20 miles; it opens, however, into a deep well-sheltered
                    estuary, or arm of the sea, called the Firth of Clyde, and is free from a bar.
                    The rise of spring tides at its mouth is about 10 feet. The Clyde was by nature
                    an insignificant stream, with numerous hard gravel shoals, and a ford 12 miles
                    below Glasgow which could be crossed on foot. The regulation of the river by
                    cross jetties, and the removal of hard shoals, was commenced in 1773. Early in
                    the present century the jetties were made more uniform, others were added, and
                    their ends were eventually connected by low training walls which were gradually
                    raised as deposits formed behind. The river had to be subsequently widened to
                    accommodate the increasing trade and a larger size of vessels. As scour alone
                    could only produce a very moderate depth, systematic dredging operations were
                    commenced in 1844, and reached a total of 28,648,000 cubic yards by the middle
                    of 1884, the maximum accomplished in a single year (1878-79) reaching 1,502,000
                    cubic yards. Dredging is - still being continued with six dredgers in order to
                    maintain as well as deepen the river; for the channel up to Glasgow has been
                    deepened so far beyond its natural limit that any matter in suspension which
                    enters the river is readily deposited. Of the 1,041,000 cubic yards dredged in
                    1883-84, as much as 703,000 cubic yards consisted of deposit, or more than
                    two-thirds of the whole quantity removed. The river has a depth of 24 feet at
                    high water from Glasgow to Port Glasgow, and from 13 to 15 feet at low water.
                    The tide falls 8 feet lower at Glasgow than it did before any works were begun,
                    which not merely adds to the tidal capacity of the river, but also prevents the
                    fresh-water floods which formerly inundated the low-lying portions of Glasgow.
                    The improved depth has caused the average tonnage of the vessels frequenting the
                    port of Glasgow to rise from 199 tons in 1863 to 315 tons in 1883; whilst the
                    total tonnage entered and cleared has increased from 1,757,000 tons in 1863 to
                    5,544,000 tons in 1883.</p>
                <p>River Tees Improvement Works.</p>
                <p>The Tees was formerly a very irregular winding river between Stockton and
                    Middlesborough, and after passing that town it opens out into a wide sandy,
                    estuary about 6 miles long and 3 miles across at its widest part. It is tidal
                    for about 17 miles, and the rise of spring tides at its mouth is 15 feet. The
                    improvement of the river between Stockton and the estuary was commenced in 1810
                    by making a straight cut near Stockton; another cut was made in 1830, and the
                    river was also regulated by cross jetties. These works provided a more direct
                    channel, and increased the depth by about from 2 to 5 feet. The channel,
                    however, between the jetties was irregular in depth; and the navigable channel
                    through the estuary was shallow and variable, with a rocky shoal across it, and
                    a bar at the mouth of the river. Accordingly, in 1853 training walls were
                    commenced, both for connecting the ends of the cross jetties, and also for
                    guiding the channel through the estuary. Dredging was commenced in 1854 for
                    removing shoals and deepening the channel; and the ridge of rock across the
                    estuary channel has been removed by blasting. The total amount dredged up to
                    Oct. 31, 1884, reached 13,145,000 cubic yards, and a maximum of 1,220,000 cubic
                    yards was dredged in 1883-84. Vessels of 3000 tons, drawing 21 feet of water,
                    can leave Middlesborough fully laden; the average tonnage of vessels frequenting
                    the Tees has risen from 169 tons in 1873 to 303 tons in 1883; and the total
                    tonnage entered and cleared has increased from 1,212,000 tons in 1873 to
                    2,528,000 tons in 1883. It is proposed at present to deepen the channel by
                    dredging, so as to obtain a depth at low water of 12 feet up to Middlesborough,
                    and 10 feet from thence up to Stock-ton; and it is hoped that eventually 2 feet
                    additional depth may be attained by the same means. Two breakwaters have been
                    designed, starting from opposite sides of the estuary and converging over the
                    bar, in order to protect the entrance, to facilitate dredging, and to keep out
                    drifting sand. The southern breakwater has been completed, and the northern
                    breakwater is in progress. The breakwaters and the training walls are
                    constructed of slag obtained free of charge from the neighbouring
                    iron-works.</p>
                <p>Training Walls on the Tidal Seine.</p>
                <p>The Seine has a very winding course between Rouen and the sea, as well as in its
                    upper portion, but it possesses a good natural depth between Rouen and La
                    Mailleraye, a distance of about 37 miles. Below this point, however, the natural
                    condition of the river was very unsatisfactory, for the channel through the
                    estuary was constantly shifting, and high shoals existed at Aizier and
                    Villequier with a depth over them of only 10 feet at spring tides, so that
                    vessels of from 100 to 200 tons found the passage difficult, and even dangerous
                    at times. Training walls, formed of mounds of chalk obtained from the
                    neighbouring cliffs, were commenced in 1848, and were gradually extended along
                    both sides of the channel, as shown in fig. 10 <hi rend="subscript">i</hi> and
                    were terminated at Berville in 1869, a further extension of the northern wall
                    for lj miles having been refused in 1870 for fear of endangering Havre. These
                    works have effected a remarkable increase in depth in the channel between the
                    λvalls, as shown by a comparison of the longitudinal sections of the river in
                    1824 and 1875 (fig. 11); for dredging has only been used for deepening the worst
                    shoals. The improvement, however, ceases beyond the termination of the works;
                    and the channel between Berville and the sea is still changeable and shallow.
                    High walls were for the most part adopted down to Tancarville on the right bank
                    and to La Roque on the left bank. These walls, however, produced such rapid
                    accretion behind them that low walls, raised only from 3 to 5 feet above low
                    water of spring tides, w ’ ere adopted below these points. This precaution,
                    however, has not arrested the accretion in the estuary, which is still
                    proceeding, though sixteen years have elapsed since the works were stopped. The
                    accretion resulting from the training works had reduced the tidal capacity of
                    the estuary by 274,000,000 cubic yards in 1875; and a survey in 1880 showed that
                    a still further loss of over 40,000,000 cubic yards had occurred between 1875
                    and 1880. More than 28,000 acres of land have been reclaimed in the upper part
                    of the estuary, as shown by cross lines on the plan; whilst large tracts have
                    been raised to high-water level, as indicated by dotted lines, extending as much
                    as 8⅜ miles below the ends of the training walls. The walls were originally
                    merely rubble chalk mounds; but the bore and the currents injured the mounds, so
                    that the walls are being strengthened by pitching or concrete on the river
                    slope, with an apron of concrete, and piling at the toe (fig. 12). The
                    regulation of the river, by bringing deep water about 25 miles nearer the sea,
                    enables vessels of about 2000 tons, and drawing about 20 feet, to pass the
                    shallow estuary between the sea and Berville at high tide and thus reach Rouen.
                    The prolongation of the training walls has been frequently urged; but the fear
                    of injuring Havre, and the difficulty of devising a suitable channel which would
                    effectually serve both Honfleur and Havre on opposite sides of the estuary, have
                    hitherto prevented the continuation of the work. The Tancarville Canal is in
                    progress for connecting Havre with the Seine at Tancarville (fig. 10), so as to
                    enable river craft to avoid the dangers of the lower estuary; and the canal is
                    being made so as to be capable of being readily converted into a ship-canal if
                    the growing accretions should impede access between Berville and the sea.</p>
                <p>Works at the Mouth of the Maas.</p>
                <p>The Scheur branch of the Maas, which forms the most direct channel to Rotterdam,
                    gradually silted up at its outlet, so that vessels had to seek more southern and
                    circuitous channels. The length of the deepest channel was shortened in 1829 by
                    the construction of the Voorne Canal, but even this course became inadequate for
                    the increasing draught of vessels. Accordingly, in 1862 works were commenced for
                    providing a new direct outlet for the Scheur branch of the river by a straight
                    cut across the Hook of Holland, with fascine-work jetties for training and
                    maintaining <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0603-0580"/>the channel across the samly beach into deep water
                    (fig. 13)'. The cat, three miles long, was only partially excavated, its
                    completion being effected by damming up the old channel and directing the
                    fresh-water discharge and tidal current through the new cut. The scour soon
                    deepened the narrow cut; but some of the sand washed from the cut settled in the
                    wider channel formed by the jetties. The cut also, being scoured deeper than the
                    adjacent channel above and below, was not adequately widened, and consequently
                    impedes the entry of the flood tide up the river (figs. 13 and 11). The desired
                    depth of 23 feet at high water not having been attained as anticipated from the
                    works, dredging has been resorted to for deepening the outlet; and the widening
                    out of the cut to the proper full width would improve the tidal influx. The
                    jetties consist of fascine mattresses secured by piles and stakes and weighted
                    with stone ( fig. 15); and their outer portions have been kept down to half-tide
                    level to promote the freer admission of the flood tide, whilst serving equally
                    to concentrate the latter part of the ebb.</p>
                <p>Charleston Jetties.</p>
                <p>The largest jetty works in the world for lowering a bar in front of a tidal
                    estuary are being constructed at the entrance to Charleston harbour (fig. 17).
                    The jetties are being formed after the type of the Maas jetties, with log and
                    fascine mattresses weighted with rubble stone (fig. 18). They start from the
                    shore about 2j miles apart and converge to a width of about 2000 feet over the
                    bar, which stretches across the entrance to the harbour at If miles from the
                    shore. The object of the works is to concentrate the tidal and fresh-water
                    current from the land-locked estuary, having an area of 15 square miles, into
                    which the Ashley and Cooper rivers flow, and whose mouth forms the entrance to
                    Charleston harbour. The northern jetty, which was commenced in 1878, attained
                    the present length of 14,860 feet in 1881; and the southern jetty had been
                    carried out 14,130 feet towards the end of 1883. The outer portions, lying in
                    the direction of the flood current, are to be raised; but the inner portions are
                    to be kept low, in order to interfere as little as possible with the littoral
                    drift and thus avoid an advance of the foreshore, and also in order to admit
                    freely the flood tide. Though scour has already commenced, it will be necessary
                    to aid it by dredging in order to attain a depth of 21 feet in place of the
                    former depth of 11⅜ feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Improvement of Tideless Rivers.</hi></p>
                <p>Tideless rivers on entering the sea have their velocity checked, and consequently
                    deposit the silt which they previously carried in suspension. In process of time
                    this accumulated deposit forms a tract of low-lying land protruding into the
                    sea, through which the river flows in several shallow channels to the sea owing
                    to the impediments offered to its flow by the sediment which it deposits. The
                    form which these diverging channels assume has led to the term delta being
                    applied to the mouths of tideless rivers and the tract of land which they create
                    (figs. 19 and 22). These deltas are always advancing, and consequently reducing
                    the very small fall of the channels through them by prolonging their course. The
                    rate of advance varies with the amount of sediment brought down, the depth of
                    the sea in front, and the extent to which the delta spreads out. The Rhone delta
                    has at present a yearly average progression of 140 feet; the Kilia mouths of the
                    Danube delta have been estimated to advance 200 feet annually; whilst the
                    Mississippi delta, extending 220 miles into the Gulf of Mexico, is supposed to
                    have taken four thousand four hundred years in forming, which would be
                    equivalent to an average annual advance of 264 feet, the present advance being
                    about 207 feet in a year.</p>
                <p>The only method of improving the outlet of a tideless river is to concentrate the
                    current flowing through one of the channels, and to prolong the banks of the
                    regulated channel into deep water by means of parallel jetties.</p>
                <p>The only other way of remedying the impediments to navigation at the mouths of
                    tideless rivers is by avoiding the delta channels altogether, and constructing a
                    canal connecting the deep river above the delta with the sea at some suitable
                    place beyond the influence of the river alluvium. This expedient has been
                    resorted to for the trade of the Rhone; for, though the discharge of the river
                    was concentrated into a single outlet by forming embankments on each side,
                    between 1852 and 1857, which shut off the other three outlets and extended into
                    the sea at its mouth, the increased discharge brought down the whole sediment of
                    the river, and a bar formed again farther out. Accordingly the St Louis Canal
                    was formed, between 1863 and 1873, going from the head of the delta into the Bay
                    of Foz beyond the limits of the delta. A similar plan was proposed for the
                    Mississippi, but was abandoned in favour of the jetty system. The canal
                    constructed by the emperor Claudius for connecting the Tiber with the harbour of
                    Ostia proved a failure, as its outlet at Ostia was not sufficiently removed from
                    the delta, so that it gradually silted up and is now 2 miles from the coast.</p>
                <p>The success of the jetty system depends upon the existence of a littoral current
                    to carry away the sediment in the stream conveyed by aid of the jetties into
                    deep water, or upon the gradual prolongation of the jetties to keep pace with
                    the progression of the delta. The outlets of the Danube and the Mississippi have
                    both been improved by training one of their minor delta channels into deep
                    water; and hitherto the depth over the bars has been maintained. In the case of
                    the Danube, the southerly current sweeping across the outlet carries away a
                    portion of the issuing sediment. The Mississippi jetties direct the discharge
                    into such deep water, and with so much velocity, that it may be premature to
                    decide to what extent the maintenance of the depth may be due to a westerly
                    current in the gulf; but hitherto from one cause or the other, or probably from
                    both combined, the bar has not formed again in front of the jetties.</p>
                <p>Sulina Piers of the Danube Delta.</p>
                <p>The delta of the Danube commences about 45 miles from the Black Sea, and has an
                    area of 1000 square miles. The river divides into three main branches; the
                    northern or Kilia branch conveys more than three-fifths of the discharge, but it
                    forms an independent delta near its outlet and is consequently unsuitable for
                    improvement (fig. 19). The southern or St George branch is the next largest, and
                    possesses the best channel, but it divides near its outlet into two channels,
                    which are both barred. The central or Sulina branch, though narrower and less
                    good than the St George branch, and conveying less than one-thirteenth of the
                    total discharge, possessed the only navigable outlet in 1858, and was therefore
                    selected for the provisional improvement works begun in that year. The works
                    designed by Sir Charles Hartley consist of piers, starting on each side of the
                    Sulina outlet, which converge till the width between them is 600 feet, and are
                    then carried parallel across the bar (fig. 20). The piers were at first
                    constructed of rubble mounds with piles carrying a platform strengthened at
                    intervals by timber cribs; but subsequently they were consolidated with concrete
                    blocks (fig. 21). These piers serve to concentrate the discharge across the bar,
                    and increased the least depth at the outlet from 9 feet in 1857 to 20 feet in
                    1872, a year after the final completion of the works; and this depth has been
                    since maintained. The sediment-bearing current, moreover, is carried within the
                    influence of the southern littoral current, which, diverting a portion of the
                    deposit, has reduced the rate of advance of the Sulina delta from 94 feet to 44
                    feet in a year. This progression, however, will eventually necessitate the
                    extension of the piers.</p>

                <p>Though the Gulf of Mexico is in communication with the Atlantic Ocean, it is
                    almost tideless, for the average rise of tide in front of the Mississippi delta
                    is only 14 inches, and there is only one tide in a day. The Mississippi,
                    accordingly, is a tideless river, and forms a delta which has an area of 12,300
                    square miles, and has three main channels, or passes, leading the discharge of
                    the river into the gulf (fig. 22). The general features of the delta have been
                    already described, and the various schemes for improving the outlet referred to
                    (see Mississippi). In flood time the river brings down in suspension 2800 cubic
                    feet of solid matter per second; and before the jetties were commenced the
                    annual advance of the bars at the mouths of the passes was 300 feet at the
                    South-West Pass, 260 feet at Pass à ΓOutre, and 110 feet at the South Pass.</p>
                <p>In 1874 Mr Eads offered to make and maintain a channel 28 feet deep across the
                    bar of the South-West Pass, which had only 13 feet of water over it. The South
                    Pass is narrower, having a width of from 600 to 800 feet; it conveys only about
                    a tenth of the total discharge of the river; it was impeded by a shoal at the
                    head of the pass with a depth of only 15 feet over it; and the depth on the bar
                    at its mouth, where it expanded to 2 miles in width, was only 8 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n604/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0604-0581"/>feet. The South Pass, however, was selected by
                    Congress for improvement, partly on account of the smaller cost of the works
                    required, and partly because it was the pass which had been preferred by a
                    previous commission. The depth of the South Pass through the delta, a distance
                    of about 13 miles, was 30 feet; so that the obstructions to be removed were
                    restricted to the head and mouth of the pass. Dredging had been tried for
                    deepening the outlet of the South-West Pass, and had necessarily failed in
                    producing any permanent improvement, for sediment soon filled up again the
                    portion of the channel which had been enlarged beyond its natural limits of
                    maintenance. The object aimed at in the South Pass was to contract the width of
                    the channel at the head and outlet, so that the current might be forced to
                    regain its required section of channel by scouring out in depth what it lost in
                    width. At the mouth of the South Pass this result could be effected by
                    concentrating the current over the bar with parallel jetties, thus prolonging
                    the banks of the pass artificially into deep water, and contracting the current
                    sufficiently to ensure the requisite depth. At the head, however, of the South
                    Pass, the conditions were more complicated; for, as soon as the entrance channel
                    there was contracted, a portion of the discharge tended to desert the impeded
                    pass for the other more open passes, and the head works by themselves would
                    therefore have deprived the South Pass of a portion of its natural floλv, which
                    would have necessarily led to a reduction of the channel below the head.
                    Accordingly the entrances to the other passes had to be correspondingly reduced,
                    so as not to absorb more than their former proportion of the discharge and thus
                    leave the discharge through the South Pass un-diminislied.</p>
                <p>The λvorks consist mainly of willow mattresses, which are specially suitable
                    where osiers are abundant, and where settlement on the soft alluvial bottom is
                    inevitable. The funnel-shaped entrance at the head of the South Pass was
                    contracted across the shoal into a uniform channel, 800 feet wide, by means of
                    mattress dykes; and mattress sills, 30 to 40 feet wide, 60 to 70 feet long, and
                    2 feet thick, were laid right across the entrances to the other two passes to
                    restrict the volume of their discharge to its normal amount.</p>
                <p>The parallel jetties on each side of the mouth of the South Pass consist of tiers
                    of willow mattresses, 100 feet long, from 20 to 50 feet wide, and about 2 feet
                    thick, consolidated with rubble stone, and capped at the outer ends with
                    concrete blocks to secure them against waves (fig. 23). They have been raised to
                    flood-tide level to within 1000 feet of their extremities. The east jetty is 2∣
                    miles long, and the west jetty 1⅛ miles; they terminate at the same distance
                    out, in a depth of thirty feet. They are placed about 1000 feet apart, and are
                    curved slightly towards their extremities, so as to bring the channel at right
                    angles to the westerly littoral current in the gulf. The jetty channel has been
                    contracted to a width of 700 feet by mattress spurs, in order to promote the
                    scour in the central channel, which was lessened at first by leakage through the
                    mattresses owing to their want of consolidation from difficulties in the supply
                    of stone.</p>
                <p>The works were commenced in 1875, and completed in 1879. The channel was to be
                    made, according to the terms of the contract, 26 feet deep and 200 feet wide,
                    with a central depth of 30 feet. According to a survey made in May 1884, the
                    least central depth through the jetty channel is 33 feet, and the width of the
                    26-foot channel is 290 feet; and beyond the jetties the least central depth is
                    31'8 feet, and the least width of the 30-foot channel is 70 feet. At the head of
                    the South Pass there now exists a straight channel with a minimum central depth
                    of 35 feet; and the 30-foot channel has a minimum width of 275 feet. There is
                    now a depth of 30 feet right through the South Pass.</p>
                <p>The latest surveys indicate only a slight shoaling beyond the outlet, showing
                    that hitherto the accelerated current, being protruded into deep water and aided
                    by the littoral current, has not created a fresh bar by the deposit of its
                    sediment. As the littoral current cannot be expected to convey away more than a
                    portion of the sediment brought down, the material must be accumulating beyond
                    the outlet, and after having filled up the deep places in front, will gradually
                    rise beyond the ends of the jetties, where the dispersed river current will be
                    unable to carry it away. This shoaling, however, may be delayed for a
                    considerable time by the distance to which the velocity of the trained current
                    carries the sediment, and the depth in which the sediment is deposited; and when
                    it becomes prejudicial to navigation, it can be readily removed by an extension
                    of the jetties.</p>
                <p>The method of lowering a bar at the mouths of rivers by means of jetties has been
                    applied, as indicated above, to both tidal and tideless rivers; but the systems
                    employed for each type of river are based on different principles which must not
                    be confounded together. A tideless river is maintained solely by its discharge,
                    and therefore the more its channel is contracted the greater is the depth
                    attained. As, however, a tidal river depends largely for its maintenance on its
                    tidal flow, a contraction at its mouth checks the entrance of the flood tide and
                    reduces the tidal flow. The contracted width between the Adour jetties (fig. 16)
                    has reduced the tidal rise at Bayonne in spite of the openings formed in them
                    for the admission of the tide; and the narrow width of the cut at the Maas
                    outlet (figs. 13 and 14), whilst affording an improved depth in the cut, is
                    prejudicial to the depth elsewhere. A parallel channel with high jetties is
                    suitable for tideless river mouths; but a slightly diverging channel, with the
                    outer ends of the jetties below high-water level, is expedient for tidal rivers.
                    Converging jetties, like those of Dublin and Charleston (fig. 17), would be
                    perfectly useless at tideless outlets; but these jetties, by not being unduly
                    contracted at their extremities, and by being kept low towards their ends,
                    freely admit the tidal flow, whilst the increased capacity obtained by their
                    enlarged form increases the tidal scour at the outlet. The comparatively small
                    improvement in depth over Charleston bar, as compared with the magnitude of the
                    works, may be due to the want of concentration of tidal scour, owing to the
                    small elevation of the inner portions of the jetties, which allows of the
                    dispersion of part of the ebb.</p>
                <p>The greatest difficulty in training tidal rivers is so to adjust the width of
                    channel that the free admission of the flood tide may be secured whilst
                    affording adequate scouring power for the current. If the influx of the tide is
                    checked by a sufficient reduction of width to ensure improvement in depth by
                    scour, the capacity of the estuary is eventually reduced, and a portion of the
                    scouring power is lost, as in the case of the Seine. It is better, therefore, to
                    regulate the width so as to ensure a free admission of the tide, and to provide
                    for any deficiency in scour and depth by dredging. Deepening by dredging can be
                    easily and economically effected to any desired extent, as shown by the Tyne and
                    Clyde improvements; whereas tidal capacity in an estuary, when once lost, can
                    never be regained.</p>
