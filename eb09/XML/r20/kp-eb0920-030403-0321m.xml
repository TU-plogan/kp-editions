                    whose law is based upon that of England stands in a peculiar position, which can
                    be understood only by an outline of its history.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History</hi> .—Such terms as “fee” or “homage” carry us far
                    back into feudal times. Rights of common and distress are based upon still older
                    institutions, forming the very basis of primitive law. The conception of tenure
                    is the most fundamental ground of distinction between real and personal estate,
                    the former only being strictly entitled to the name of estate (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Estate).</hi> The division into real and personal is coincident
                    to a great extent with that into immovable and movable, generally used by
                    systems of law founded on the Roman (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Personal
                    Estate).</hi> That it is not entirely coincident is due to the influence of the
                    Roman law itself. The Greeks and the Romans of the republic were essentially
                    nations of citizens; the Teutons were essentially a nation of land-folk; the
                    Roman empire bridged the gulf between the two. It is probable that the English
                    land law was produced by the action of the policy adopted in the lower empire,
                    finally developed into feudalism, upon the previously existing course of
                    Teutonic custom (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Feudalism).</hi> It is sufficient to
                    say here that the distinguishing features of the Teutonic system were enjoyment
                    in common and the absence of private ownership, except to a limited extent. The
                    history of the development of the old English land law before the Conquest will
                    be found under <hi rend="smallcaps">England</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    liberty of alienation, either by will or <hi rend="italic">inter vivos</hi> , of
                    such land as could be alienated, chiefly, if not entirely, bocland, subject
                    always to the limits fixed by the <hi rend="italic">hoc·,</hi> (2) publicity of

                    the application of the same principles in the local courts; (6) subjection of
                    land to the <hi rend="italic">trinoda nécessitas,</hi> a burden imposed for the
                    purpose of defence of the realm. The rudiments of the conceptions of tenure and
                    of the crown as lord paramount were found in the old English system, and
                    laenland was an antici]:&gt;ation of the limited interests which afterwards
                    became of such importance. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    in Germany, Lehn in Denmark. </p></note> The connexion of political privileges
                    with the ownership of land is not peculiar to the pre-Conquest or any other
                    period. It runs through the whole of English history. Originally all freeholders
                    seem to have voted in the county court. Finally the Reform Acts of this century,
                    however they may have lowered the qualification, still require (except in the
                    case of the university vote) the vote to be derived from an interest in land. No
                    amount of consols will give a vote at a parliamentary election. A qualification
                    from land is also necessary in the case of sheriff, justices of the peace, and
                    other public officials.</p>
                <p>The elements of feudalism so far existed in England under the Anglo-Saxon and
                    Danish kings as to make it easy to introduce it in full at the Norman Conquest.
                    Feudalism was not so much a distinct and separate creation, developed at once in
                    its maturity, as a collection of institutions whose origin was to be found in
                    unconnected sources. What the Norman Conquest did was not to change all at once
                    allodial into feudal tenure, but to complete the association of territorial with
                    personal dependence in a state of society already prepared for it. <note

                    “Nulle terre sans seigneur” was one of the fundamental axioms of feudalism.
                    There might be any number of infeudations and subinfeudations to mesne lords,
                    but the chain of seigniory was complete, depending in the last resort upon the
                    king as lord paramount. Land was not owned by free owners owing only necessary
                    militia duties to the state, but was held of the king by military service of a
                    far more onerous nature. The folkland became the king’s land; the soldier was a
                    landowner instead of the landowner being a soldier. Free owners tended to become
                    tenants of the lord, the township to be lost in the manor. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is a disputed point whether the manor
                    organization existed before the Conquest; but its full development seems to have
                    been later than that event. </p></note> The common land became in law the waste
                    of the manor, its enjoyment resting upon a presumed grant by the lord. On the
                    other hand, the whole of England did not become manorial; the conflict between
                    the township and the manor resulted in a compromise, the result of which affects
                    English tenure to this day. But it was a compromise much to the advantage of the
                    privileged class, for in England more than in any other country the land law is
                    the law of the nobility and not of the people. One reason of this is that, as
                    England was never so completely feudalized as were some of the Continental
                    states, the burden of feudalism was not so severely felt, and has led to less
                    agitation for reform.</p>
                <p>The land forfeited to the Conqueror was regranted by him to be held by military
                    service due to the king, not to the mesne lord as in Continental feudalism. In
                    1086 at the council of Salisbury all the landholders swore fealty to the crown.
                    In the full vigour of feudalism the inhabitants of England were either free or
                    not free. The free inhabitants held their lands either by free tenure <hi
                    rend="italic">(liberum tenementum,</hi> franktenement) or by a tenure which was
                    originally that of a non-free inhabitant, but attached to land in the possession
                    of a free man. Franktenement was either military tenure, called also tenure in
                    knight service or chivalry (including barony, the highest tenure known to the
                    law, grand serjeanty and the special forms of escuage, castle-guard, cornage,
                    and others), or socage (including burgage and petit serjeanty), or frankalmoign
                    <hi rend="italic">(libera elee-mosyna</hi> ) or divine service, by which
                    ecclesiastical corporations generally held their land. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Frankalmoign was not always regarded as a
                    distinct tenure. Thus Littleton (§ 118) says that all that is not tenure in
                    chivalry is tenure </p></note> The non-free inhabitants were in Domesday Book
                    <hi rend="italic">servi, cotarii,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bordarii,</hi> later

                    being applied to both free men and serfs. All these were in a more or less
                    dependent condition. The free tenures all exist at the present day, though, as
                    will appear later, the military tenures have shrunk into the unimportant and
                    exceptional tenure of grand serjeanty. The non-free tenures are to a certain
                    extent represented by <hi rend="smallcaps">Copyhold</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.).</hi> The most important difference between the military and socage
                    tenures was the mode of descent. Whether or not a feudal benefice was originally
                    hereditary, it had certainly become so at the time of the Conquest, and it
                    descended to the eldest son. This applied at once in England to land held by
                    military service as far as regarded the capital fief. The descent of socage
                    lands or lands other than the capital fief for some time followed the old
                    pre-Conquest rule of descent. Thus in the so-called “Laws of Henry I.” the lands
                    other than the capital fief, and in Glanvill, who wrote in the time of Henry
                    II., socage lands, if anciently partible <hi rend="italic">(antiquitus
                    divisum</hi> ), were divided among all the sons equally. But by the time of
                    Bracton (Henry III.) the course of descent of lands held by military service had
                    so far prevailed that, though it was a question of fact whether the land was
                    partible or not, if there was no evidence either way descent to the eldest son
                    was presumed. Relics of the old custom still remain in the case of gavelkind
                    (see below). The military tenant was subject to the feudal incidents, from which
                    the tenant in socage was exempt. These incidents, especially wardship and
                    marriage, were often of a very oppressive nature. Alienation of lands by will,
                    except in a few favoured districts, became impossible; alienation <hi
                    rend="italic">inter vivos</hi> was restrained in one direction in the interests
                    of the heir, in another in the interests of the lord. At the time of Glanvill a
                    tenant had a greater power of alienation over land which he had purchased <hi
                    rend="italic">(terra acquietatd)</hi> than over land which he had inherited. But
                    by the time of Bracton the heir had ceased to have any interest in either kind
                    of land. The lords were more successful. It was enacted by Magna Charta that a
                    free man should not give or sell so much of his land as to leave an amount
                    insufficient to perform his services to his lord. In spite of this provision,
                    the rights of the lords were continually diminished by subinfeudation until the
                    passing of the Statute of <hi rend="italic">Quia Emptores.</hi> Alienation by a
                    tenant in chief of the crown without licence was a ground of forfeiture until 1
                    Edw. III. st. 2, c. 12, by which a fine was substituted. The modes of conveyance
                    at this time were only two, feoffment with livery of seisin for corporeal
                    hereditaments, grant for incorporeal hereditaments. Livery of seisin, though
                    public, was not officially recorded like the old English transfer of property.
                    The influence of local custom upon the land law must have become weakened after
                    the circuits of the judges of the King’s Court were established by Henry II.
                    Jurisdiction over litigation touching the freehold was taken away from the
                    lords’ courts by 15 Ric. II. c. 12.</p>
                <p>The common law as far as it dealt with real estate had in the main assumed its
                    present aspect by the reign of Henry III. The changes which have been made since
                    that date have been chiefly due to the action of equity in socage.</p>

                <p>and legislation, the latter sometimes interpreted by the courts in a manner very
                    different from the intention of parliament. The most important influence of
                    equity has been exercised in <hi rend="smallcaps">Mortgage</hi> ( <hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> and trusts (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trust),</hi> in
                    the doctrine of specific performance of contracts concerning real estate, and in
                    relief from forfeiture for breach of covenant. As to legislation, it is
                    impossible in this place to do more than direct attention to the main provisions
                    of the principal statutes among the mass of those which from Magna Charta
                    downwards have dealt with real estate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History of Real Estate Legislation</hi> .—The reign of Edward
                    I. is notable for three leading statutes which are still law, all passed in the
                    interests of the superior lords. The Statute of Mortmain (7 Edw. I. st. 2, c.
                    13) is the first of a long series directed against the acquisition of land by
                    religious and charitable corporations (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Charities).</hi>
                    The statute <hi rend="italic">De Donis Conditionalibus</hi> (13 Edw. I. c. 1)
                    forbade the alienation of estates granted to a man and the heirs of his body,
                    which before the statute became on the birth of an heir at once alienable
                    (except in the case of gifts in frankmarriage), and so the lord lost his
                    escheat. For the mode in which the statute was practically defeated and estates
                    tail in their modern form created see <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail.</hi> The
                    statute <hi rend="italic">Quia Emptores</hi> (18 Edw. I. c. 1) preserved those
                    rights of the lords which were up to that time subject to be defeated by
                    subinfeudation, by enacting that in any alienation of lands the alienee should
                    hold them of the same lord of the fee as the alienor. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tenants in chief of the crown were liable to
                    a fine on alienation until 12 Car. II. c. 24. </p></note> Since 1290 it has been
                    impossible to create an estate in fee-simple to be held of a mesne lord, or to
                    reserve a rent upon a grant of an estate in fee (unless in the form of a
                    rent-charge), or to create a new manor. The statute, however, does not bind the
                    crown. The practical effect of the statute was to make the transfer of land
                    thenceforward more of a commercial and less of a feudal transaction. The writ of

                    the Statute of Westminster II. in 1285 as a creditor’s remedy over real estate.
                    It has, however, been considerably modified by subsequent legislation. From 1290
                    to the I’eign of Henry VIII. there is no statute of the first importance dealing
                    with real estate. The reign of Henry VIII., like the reign of Edward I., is
                    signalized by three Acts, the effects of which continue to this day. The one
                    which has had the most lasting influence in law is the Statute of Uses, 27 Hen.
                    VIII. c. 10 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Conveyancing, Trust).</hi> The Statute of
                    Uses was intended to provide against secrecy of sales of land, and as a
                    necessary sequel to it an Act of the same year (27 Hen. VIII. c. 16) enacted
                    that all bargains and sales of land should be duly enrolled (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sale).</hi> Bargain and sale was a form of equitable transfer
                    which had for some purposes superseded the common law feoffment. It applied only
                    to estates of inheritance and not to terms of years. The unforeseen effect of 27
                    Hen. VIII. c. 16 was to establish as the ordinary form of conveyance until 1841
                    the conveyance by lease and release. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    become legal estate by the Statute of Uses, and therefore no longer devisable,
                    32 Hen. VIII. c. 1 (explained by 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 5) was passed to remedy
                    this inconvenience. It is still law as to wills made before 1838 (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Will).</hi> In the reign of Elizabeth the Acts of 13 Eliz. c. 5
                    and 27 Eliz. c. 4 avoided fraudulent conveyances as against all parties and
                    voluntary conveyances as against subsequent purchasers for valuable
                    consideration. Early in the reign of Charles II. the Act of 1661 (12 Car. II. c.
                    24) turned all the feudal tenures (with the exception of frankalmoign and grand
                    serjeanty) into tenure by free and common socage and abolished the feudal
                    incidents. The Statute of Frauds (29 Car. II. c. 3) contained provisions that
                    certain leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts relating to
                    land, should be in writing (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fraud).</hi> The land

                    were forbidden by the Mortmain Act (9 Geo. II. c. 36). In the next reign the
                    first general Inclosure Act was passed, 41 Geo. III. c. 109 (see <hi

                    >Prescription, Limitation, Tithes)</hi>; fines and recoveries were abolished and
                    simpler modes of conveyance substituted by 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 74; and the laws
                    of inheritance and dower were amended by 3 and 4 Will. IV. cc. 105, 106 (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Inheritance, Husband and Wife).</hi> In the reign of Victoria
                    there has been a vast mass of legislation dealing with real estate in almost
                    every conceivable aspect. At the immediate beginning of the reign stands the
                    Wills Act (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Will).</hi> The transfer of real estate has
                    been simplified by 8 and 9 Vict. c. 106 and by the Conveyancing Acts of 1881 and
                    1882 (see below). Additional powers of dealing with settled estates were given
                    by the Settled Estates Act, 1856, later by the Settled Estates Act, 1877, and
                    the Settled Land Act, 1882 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Settlement).</hi>
                    Succession duty was levied for the first time on freeholds in 1853. The
                    strictness of the Mortmain Act has been relaxed in favour of gifts and sales to
                    public institutions of various kinds, such as schools, parks, and museums. The
                    period of limitation has been shortened for most purposes from tw׳enty to twelve
                    years by the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874 (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Limitation).</hi> Several Acts have been passed dealing with the
                    enfranchisement and commutation of copyholds and the preservation of commons and
                    open spaces (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Commons, Copyhold).</hi> The
                    Naturalization Act, 1870 (33 and 34 Vict. c. 14), enables aliens to hold and
                    transfer land in England. The Felony Act, 1870 (33 and 34 Vict. c. 23),
                    abolished forfeiture of real estate on conviction for felony. The Agricultural
                    Holdings Act, 1883 (46 and 47 Vict. c. 61), gives the tenant of a tenancy within
                    the Act a general right to compensation for improvements, substitutes a year’s
                    notice to quit for the six months’ notice previously necessary, enlarges the
                    tenant’s right to fixtures, and limits distress to a year’s rent. By 47 and 48
                    Vict. c. 71 the law of escheat is extended to incorporeal hereditaments and
                    equitable estates. Among other subjects which have been dealt with by recent
                    legislation may be mentioned Re <hi rend="smallcaps">gistration, Mortgage,

                    which the land law is not altered to a greater or less degree. Bills have been
                    introduced within recent years, but hitherto unsuccessfully, for amending the
                    law by the assimilation of the succession to real and personal estate, and for
                    the compulsory enfranchisement of leaseholds.</p>
                <p>Real estate at the present day is either legal or equitable, a difference resting
                    mainly upon historical grounds (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Equity, Trust).</hi>
                    The following observations apply in general to both kinds of estate. The usual
                    classification of interests in real estate regards either the extent, the time,
                    or the mode of enjoyment. The division according to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >extent</hi> is in the first instance into corporeal and incorporeal
                    hereditaments, a division based upon the Roman law division of <hi rend="italic"
                    >res</hi> into <hi rend="italic">corporales</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >incorporales,</hi> and open to the same objection, that it is unscientific as
                    co-ordinating subjects of rights with the rights themselves. <note

                    the division is adopted by the legislature; see, for instance, 47 and 48 Vict.

                    affect the senses, such as may be seen and handled by the body; incorporeal are

                    less than freehold, such as a term of years, is personalty only. There Aras no
                    room for such an interest in the feudal gradation of tenure; it was regarded as
                    a mere personal contract and was incapable of the incidents of tenure. By the
                    Conveyancing Act, 1881 (44 and 45 Vict. c. 41, s. 65), the residue of a long
                    term of years may in certain casés be enlarged into the fee-simple. A copyhold
                    is in strict law only a tenancy at the will of the lord (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Copyhold).</hi> Estates of freehold are either estates for life
                    or in fee (called also estates of inheritance), the latter being in fee-tail or
                    in fee-simple. An estate for life may he either for the life of the tenant or
                    for the life of another person, the latter called an estate <hi rend="italic"
                    >pur autre vie.</hi> The former kind of estate includes estates of dower and
                    curtesy (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Husband and Wife).</hi> An estate in fee is
                    called a fee simply, an obvious sign of its feudal origin. Estates tail are
                    either general or special, the latter being in tail male or (rarely) in tail
                    female. There may also be a quasi-entail of an estate <hi rend="italic">pur
                    autre vie</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail).</hi> An estate in fee-simple
                    is the largest estate known to English laAV. Its ordinary incidents are an oath

                    >(q.v.</hi> ), and (in a manor) suit of the court baron, and occasionally a
                    small quit-rent and relief. All these are obviously relics of the once important
                    feudal incidents. Incorporeal hereditaments consist chiefly, if not wholly, of
                    rights <hi rend="italic">in alicno solo.</hi> They are divided by Mr Joshua
                    Williams ( <hi rend="italic">Real Property,</hi> pt. ii.) into (1) reversions,
                    remainders, and executory interests, (2) hereditaments purely incorporeal, the
                    last being either appendant, appurtenant, Olin gross. Examples are profits <hi
                    rend="italic">a prendre</hi> (such as rights of common), easements (such as
                    rights of way), <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It

                    Before 1845 corporeal hereditaments were said to lie in livery, incorporeal in
                    grant. But by 8 and 9 Vict. c. 106, s. 2, all corporeal hereditaments are, as
                    regards the conveyance of the immediate freehold thereof, to be deemed to lie in
                    grant as well as in livery. With regard to the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> of
                    enjoyment, estates are either in possession or in expectancy, —that is, in
                    reversion or remainder or executory interests (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Remainder).</hi> With regard to the <hi rend="italic">mode</hi> of enjoyment,
                    estates are either joint, in common, in coparcenary, or in severalty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exceptional Tenures.</hi> —It has been already stated that
                    there are still to be found survivals of the old pre-Conquest customary law.
                    They are found both in the tenure and in the conveyance of land. The only
                    customs of which judicial notice is taken are <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gavelkind</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    in manors, must be proved by evidence. The tenures of frankalmoign and grand
                    serjeanty Avere specially preserved by 12 Car. II. c. 24. Tenure in frankalmoign
                    is the nearest approach in English law to absolute OAvnership. An estate in
                    frankalmoign has no incidents, as it is held simply by divine service and is not
                    subject to escheat. All tenures in frankalmoign must (except where created by
                    the crown) be older than <hi rend="italic">Quia Emptores.</hi> The tenure of
                    grand serjeanty is the holding of lands by doing a personal service to the king,
                    as carrying his banner or sword. Petit serjeanty consists in the payment to the
                    king yearly of a bow, sword, dagger, or such other small things belonging to war
                    (Littleton, § 159). It is in effect socage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Title.</hi> —This is the name given to the mode of acquisition
                    of rights over real estate. Title may arise either by alienation, voluntary or
                    involuntary, or by succession. Voluntary alienation is either <hi rend="italic"
                    >inter vivos</hi> or by will. The former branch is practically synonymous with
                    conveyance, Avhether by way of sale, settlement, mortgage, or otherwise. As a
                    general rule alienation of real estate <hi rend="italic">inter vivos</hi> must
                    be by deed since 8 and 9 Vict. c. 106. Since that Act a deed of grant has
                    superseded the old forms of feoffment and lease and release. Considerable
                    alterations in the direction of shortness and simplicity have been made in the
                    laAV of transfer of real estate by the Conveyancing Acts, 1881, 1882 (44 and 45
                    Viet, c. 41, 45 and 46 Vict. c. 39). The word “grant” is no longer necessary for
                    a conveyance, nor are the old words of limitation <hi rend="italic">“</hi>
                    heirs” and <hi rend="italic">“</hi> heirs of the body.” It is sufficient to use
                    the words “in fee-simple,” “in tail,” “in tail male,” “in tail female.” Many
                    provisions usually inserted in deeds, such as covenants for title by a
                    beneficial OAvner and powers of appointment of neAV trustees, obtain statutory
                    sanction. Forms of mortgage, conveyance, and settlement are appended to the Act.
                    The Solicitors’ Remuneration Act, 1881 (44 and 45 Vict. c. 44), was passed as a
                    necessary sequel to the Conveyancing Act, and the remuneration of solicitors <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">uoav</hi> stands upon a different and more satisfactory basis.

                    arise by the exercise by the state of its right of eminent domain for public

                    —The alienation of real estate may be subject to almost any conditions, provided
                    that such conditions do not contravene the law. As a general rule there can be
                    no restrictions upon the alienation of an estate in fee-simple <hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the tAvo ideas are incompatible. In the case, hoAvever, of a married
                    Avoman a restraint on anticipation is allowed Avithin certain limits. The poAver
                    of imposing such a restraint is preserved by the Married Women’s Property Act,
                    1882 (45 and 46 Vict. c. 75, s. 19), subject to the right of the court to bind
                    the interest of the married woman Avhere it would be for her benefit to do so
                    (44 and 45 Vict. c. 41, s. 39). In another direction the imposition of a course
                    of devolution upon property is forbidden by the law against perpetuities, under
                    Avliich no executory interest can be made to commence unless within the period
                    of any fixed number of existing lives, and an additional period of twenty-one
                    years (with a few months added, if necessary, for the period of gestation).
                    Accumulation of income is forbidden (with a feAv exceptions) by the Thelusson
                    Act (39 and 40 Geo. III. c. 98) for any longer term than the life of the grantor
                    or settlor, or twenty-one years from his death, or during a period of minority.
                    Certain persons are by the general policy of the law disabled from exercising
                    full proprietary rights, such as married women (see above), convicts, infants,
                    and lunatics. Estates tail are in general alienable under the Fines and
                    Recoveries Act (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail).</hi> But in a few cases
                    estates tail are settled inalienably by Act of Parliament, generally as a
                    reAvard for public services. Estates are thus settled to go Avith the titles of
                    Marlborough, Wellington, Abergavenny, and Shrewsbury.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exceptional Modes of Alienation.</hi> —In some of these cases,
                    like those of the exceptional tenures, the influence of the old customary law is
                    to be traced. The transfer of copyholds especially depends to a great extent
                    upon the custom of particular manors, but, subject to that, it usually takes
                    place by surrender and admittance (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Copyhold).</hi>
                    Gavelkind lands may be conveyed by feoffment by any infant above the age of
                    fifteen. For mines in the Forest of Dean a peculiar mode of transfer is provided
                    by 1 and 2 Vict. c. 43. In the Isle of Portland there seems to be a distinct
                    survival of the pre-feudal conveyance. The vendor and purchaser meet in the
                    parish church, where a deed is signed by the parties in the presence of two
                    householders of the island. These deeds are called “church gifts.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Procedure.</hi> —In some cases rights attaching to real estate
                    are protected by peculiar remedies. At an early period it became more convenient
                    to try the right to the possession of, rather than the right to the property in,
                    real estate. Possessory tended to supersede proprietary remedies, from their
                    great simplicity and elasticity. The general mode of trying the right to both
                    property and possession Avas from the time of Henry II. the real action, the
                    form called “Avrit of right” (after Magna Charta gradually confined to the Court
                    of Common Pleas) being used to determine the property, that called “assise of
                    novel disseisin” being the general means by Avhich the possession Avas tried.
                    About the reign of Elizabeth the action of ejectment became the ordinary form of
                    possessory remedy. Real actions existed until 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 27, by which
                    they were finally abolished, with the exception of Avrit of right of dower, writ
                    of dower <hi rend="italic">unde nihil habet, quare impedit,</hi> and ejectment.
                    Of these <hi rend="smallcaps">Quake Impedit</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>
                    appears to be the only one noAv in use. The assise of novel disseisin, the
                    action of ejectment in both its original and its reformed stage (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ejectment),</hi> and finally the action for the recovery of
                    land in use since the Judicature Acts are all historically connected as gradual
                    developments of the possessory action (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Possession).</hi> The action for the recovery of land is still subject to
                    special provisions and is not quite in the same position as an ordinary action
                    (see Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, Ord. xii. rr. 25-29, Ord. xviii. r. 2,
                    &amp;c.). There are certain matters affecting real estate over which the Court

                    Judicature Act, 1873 (36 and 37 Vict. c. 66, s. 34). assigns to the Chancery
                    Division of the High Court of Justice all causes and matters for <hi

                <p>which finally superseded the native law in James I.’s reign, as modified by
                    subsequent legislation. The main difference is in the law of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Landlord and Tenant</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> and the
                    operation of the Landed Estates Court, merged in the High Court of Justice in

                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.</hi> —The law of real estate in the United
                    States is the law of England modified to suit a different state of
                    circumstances. The main point of difference is that in the United States the
                    occupiers of land are generally wholly or in part owners, not tenants, as iu
                    England. This is to a great extent the effect of the homestead laws (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Homestead).</hi> The traces of the feudal origin of the law
                    are, as might be expected, considerably less prominent than in England. Thus
                    estates tail are practically obsolete; in some States they are specially
                    forbidden by the State constitutions. The law of descent is the same in real and
                    personal estate (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Inheritance).</hi> Manors do not
                    exist, except in the State of New York, where they were created by the crown in
                    colonial days (Bouvier, <hi rend="italic">Law Diet.,</hi> “Manor”). Registration
                    of deeds is general (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Registration).</hi> In some States
                    forms of deed are prescribed by statute. Conveyancing is for the most part
                    simpler than in England. The holding of real estate by religious or charitable
                    corporations is generally restricted by the Act creating them rather than by
                    anything like the English law of mortmain. In Pennsylvania such a corporation
                    cannot hold land without an Act of the legislature, and in Territories of the
                    United States it cannot hold real estate of a greater value than $50,000 (Act of
                    Congress of 1st July 1862, c. 126). Perpetuities are forbidden in most States.
                    The right of eminent domain is at once acknowledged and limited by the
                    constitution of the United States. By art. 5 of the Amendments private property
                    is not to be taken for public use without just compensation. A similar provision
                    is found in many of the State constitutions. By an Act of Congress of 9th April
                    1866, c. 31, all citizens of the United States have the same right in every
                    State and Territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit,
                    purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property. In most
                    States aliens may hold land; but in some States they cannot do so without
                    becoming naturalized or at least filing in the specified manner a declaration of
                    intention to become naturalized. For the State laws affecting the capacity of
                    aliens to hold land, see Washburn, <hi rend="italic">Real Property,</hi> vol. i.
                    p. 64.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">International Law</hi> .—The law of the place where real estate
                    is situated <hi rend="italic">(lex loci rei sitae)</hi> governs its tenure aud
                    transfer. The laws of England and of the United States are more strict on this
                    point than the laws of most other countries. They require that the formalities
                    of the <hi rend="italic">locus rei sitae</hi> must be observed, even if not
                    necessary to be observed in the place where the contract was made. The <hi
                    rend="italic">lex loci rei sitae</hi> determines what is to be considered real
                    estate. A foreign court cannot as a general rule pass title to land situated in
                    another country. The English and United States courts of equity have to a
                    certain extent avoided the inconvenience which this inability to deal with laud
                    out of the jurisdiction sometimes causes by the use of the theory that equity
                    acts upon the conscience of the party and not upon the title to the foreign
                    land. Thus in the leading case of Penn <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Lord Baltimore
                    in 1750 (1 Yesey’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 444) the Court of Chancery on
                    this ground decreed specific performance of articles for settling the boundaries
                    of the provinces of Pennsylvania and Maryland. The difficulty always arises
                    that, although the court professes to act upon the conscience, it must
                    indirectly act upon the property, and that it cannot carry its decision into
                    execution without the aid of the local tribunals. (J. W+. )</p>
