                    the Malay Peninsula and islands, and Japan. Rhea is also capable of being grown
                    in temperate latitudes, and has been experimentally introduced into the south of
                    France and Algeria. The most important source of rhea fibre, known also very
                    inappropriately as China grass, or by its Malay name Ramie, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >B. ηiυea.</hi> It is a shrubby plant growing to the height of from 5 to 8 feet
                    with foliage and inflorescence like the common nettle, but destitute of stinging
                    hairs. Some authorities consider the variety cultivated in China to be
                    specifically distinct from the Indian plant. An allied plant called Pooalι or
                    Puya, <hi rend="italic">B. Puya,</hi> found growing wild in the north of India,
                    is also a source of rhea fibre. Among the Chinese much care is bestowed on the
                    cultivation of Chu or Tchou Ma, as rhea is called by them, and they prepare the
                    fibre by a tedious and costly process of selection and manual labour. The plant
                    thrives in hot, moist, shaded situations; propagated from slips or root
                    cuttings, it throws up from three to five crops of stems in the course of a
                    season, although not more than three crops are commonly reckoned on. Each such
                    crop may yield about 250 lb of marketable fibre per acre, that total output
                    being exceeded only by the jute crop. The stems when ripe are cut down, stripped
                    of leaves and branchlets, and, either split or whole, are freed from their
                    cortical layers till the bast layer is exposed. In this state they are made up
                    in small bundles and placed where they receive strong sunlight by day and dews
                    by night for several days, after which the fibrous bast layer is peeled with
                    ease off the woody core, and the separated fibres are thereafter treated with
                    boiling water to remove as far as possible adherent gummy and resinous matter in
                    which the fibres are embedded in the stalks. The fibre so obtained is usually
                    bleached by exposure on the grass, and it comes into the market as brilliant
                    white filaments with a fine silky gloss, having a strength, lustre, and
                    smoothness unequalled by any other vegetable fibre.</p>
                <p>The fibre first appeared in the European market in 1810, and a cord then spun
                    from it was found to sustain a weight of 252 lb, while a similar cord of Russian
                    hemp was estimated by Admiralty test not to bear more than 87 lb. A fibre
                    possessed of such strength and beauty immediately attracted great attention, and
                    throughout the early half of the century numerous efforts were made by the East
                    India Company to introduce it as a textile staple. But many difli<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0524-0507"/>culties have been encountered in its working, some
                    of which are not yet overcome. The fibre itself is very difficult of extraction
                    owing to the large amount of adhesive matter in which it is embedded, and it is
                    proportionately so expensive that it practically comes into competition only
                    with silk and wool. Further, rhea is hard and inelastic, and on the machinery
                    adapted for spinning other textiles it can only be spun into a rough, harsh, and
                    hairy yarn, while fabrics into which it is woven are rigid, and show permanent
                    creases at every fold. In the form of cordage, moreover, it cuts and gives way
                    at sharp knots and twists. Notwithstanding all disappointments and drawbacks,
                    the Indian Government considered the fibre of such importance that in 1869 two
                    prizes of £5000 and £2000 and again in 1877 prizes of £5000 and £1000 were
                    offered for machinery or processes by which the fibre could be prepared at such
                    a cost per ton as would render its introduction into the market practicable.
                    Competitive trials were made at Saharanpur in 1872 and 1879, but no machine was
                    found to satisfy the conditions of success, although in 1872 a reward of £1500
                    wasgranted to Mr John Greig, jun., of Edinburgh, and in 1879 £500 and £100
                    respectively were paid to two of the competitors. The extraction of rhea
                    continues to attract attention, and quite recently (1885) it has been announced
                    that Prof. Frémy of Paris, assisted by M. Urbain, has successfully overcome all
                    difficulties. The raw material used by Prof. Frémy is obtained by a process
                    devised by M. Fevier, which consists in submitting the newly cut stems to
                    low-pressure steam for twenty minutes, after which the whole rind is separated
                    in ribands from its woody core with the utmost ease. These ribands are then
                    dried, and on them Prof. Frémy operates with alkaline solutions which are varied
                    in strength according to the appearance of the material dealt with, and a pure
                    fibre in fine working condition is thus obtained. Rhea has yet to establish its
                    position among European textiles, but in the East its value is well recognized.
                    It is extensively used for cordage, fishing nets, &amp;c.; and it is very little
                    affected by water. The Chinese prepare an exceedingly fine “grass cloth” from
                    single filaments of rhea, knotted or gummed end to end in the way they employ
                    the finest filaments of Manila hemp for making ‘ ‘ Pina” gauze.</p>
