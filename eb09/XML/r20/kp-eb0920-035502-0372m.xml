                    Lave been deeply touched by the relics of departed greatness laid bare by the
                    discovery of a palace in the Crimea which had been built by Mithradates. Many of
                    those who were present at the opening of the tomb of Robert the Bruce at
                    Dunfermline were quite unmanned at the sight of the skull that had toiled for
                    Scot- . land’s weal, and the arm that had struck down Sir Henry de Bohun on the
                    eve of the battle of Bannockburn; and at the funeral of the duke of Wellington,
                    in 1852, the pathetic part of the processional ceremonial was found to lie in
                    the riderless charger, bearing relics of the deceased warrior. In 1802 Napoleon
                    Bonaparte, while making his preparations at Boulogne for the invasion of
                    England, professed to have found a coin of Julius Caesar and a weapon which had
                    belonged to one of the soldiers of William the Conqueror. Napoleon had a
                    profound belief in the power of the imagination. It is needless to dwell upon
                    his object in ostentatiously announcing these discoveries.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, however, that, apart from designs such as that of Napoleon,
                    pretended relics, sometimes associated with real sometimes with legendary
                    events, would be sure to spring from human credulity, from love of the
                    marvellous, and from hopes of gain. Perhaps all settled Governments exhibit
                    relics, such as regalia and the like, of which many are perfectly authentic,
                    while some would not bear close examination. The same may be said of family
                    treasures. We read of ancient Romans exhibiting curiosities, such as fragments
                    of the ship “Argo.” Again, relics are apt to gather round a great name. The town
                    of Lutterworth possessed an ancient chair and a piece of a cope. Each became,
                    despite of want of evidence, and indeed against evidence, associated with the
                    name of Wickliffe.</p>
                <p>It would be strange indeed if religion (which, alike in its good features and in
                    its abuses, penetrates more deeply than anything else into the human heart) were
                    found to be dissociated from relics. Probably all the more widely spread creeds
                    claim some such material links with the past. Let it suffice to mention here the
                    Ka'ba at Mecca, and the tooth of Buddha exhibited in Ceylon.</p>
                <p>We turn to the pre-Christian and Christian dispensations. The Old Testament
                    contains allusions to relics too numerous to mention. We may refer to the
                    language of the epistle to the Hebrews, which speaks of the holy of holies as
                    containing the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, wherein were the
                    golden pot that had manna and Aaron’s rod that budded and the tables of the
                    covenant (Heb. ix. 4, 9; Exod. xxv. 10, 16; Num. xvii. 10). These were believed
                    to have been lost at the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. We also
                    read of the sword of Goliath being preserved· as something sacred (1 Sam. xxi.
                    9).</p>
                <p>Certainly, however, in one respect, perhaps in two (though of seemingly opposite
                    tendencies), Judaism stands in this matter distinguished from contemporary
                    religions. Nowhere else should we read of a valued and most interesting relic
                    being destroyed by a devout ruler because it was found to have been abused and
                    to have led to idolatry, as was done to the brazen serpent by Hezekiah (2 Kings
                    xviii. 4). But it may also be questioned whether the records of any other people
                    contain an account of a miracle WTOUght by the relics of a deceased prophet. We
                    may indeed read of a miracle w <hi rend="superscript">T</hi> rought in
                    heathendom for the defence of <pb break="no"

                    possession of the bones of a departed hero made the condition of a successful
                    war. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We allude to the
                    miracle claimed by two poets, Ovid <hi rend="italic">(Fast.,</hi> iv. 310) and
                    Propertius ( <hi rend="italic">Eleg</hi> ., iv. 14, 51), as also by Livy,
                    Cicero, and Pliny, to have been wrought by Cybele on behalf of the Vestal
                    Claudia, and to the oracular injunction from Delphi to the Spartans to find and
                    carry with them the bones of Orestes as a condition of success against the men
                    of Tegea (Herodotus, i. 67-68). </p></note> But the second book of Kings relates
                    the revival of a dead man by the bones of Elisha,—a narrative rendered the more
                    remarkable by the fact that, as a rule, the contact with a corpse, a bone, or a
                    grave made a man unclean for seven days (Num. xix. 11-22).</p>
                <p>The New Testament does not relate any case precisely similar to that of Elisha.
                    The remains of the protomartyr Stephen are simply committed to the tomb, with
                    much lamentation by devout men (Acts viii. 2); and of the funeral of the first
                    martyred apostle, James, we have no record. It is not, however, to be denied
                    that the book of Acts tells of miracles of healing resembling that of her who
                    was cured by the touch of our Lord’s garment (Matt. ix. 20-22). Even the shadow
                    of Peter, it is implied, may have healed the sick; and handkerchiefs or aprons
                    which had been worn by Paul relieved not only the diseased but the possessed
                    (Acts v. 15; xix. 12).</p>
                <p>To a great extent the homage paid to the tombs and the remains of patriot, sage,
                    or bard was transferred, at an early period in the history of the Christian
                    church, to those of its own heroes, more especially to those of martyrs. Such a
                    result was natural, and almost inevitable. The intercession of the departed on
                    behalf of the living was everywhere recognized, and that of martyrs naturally
                    believed to be especially powerful. But it was further inferred from the
                    instance of Elisha and from the passages of the book of Acts already cited that
                    it might please the Almighty to repeat similar manifestations of miraculous
                    power. Whether the fathers who maintain this view w <hi rend="superscript"
                    >r</hi> ould have written so freely if they could have foreseen the abuses which
                    were to arise may perhaps be doubted. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A set of passages is given by Petavius <hi rend="italic">(De
                    Dogmatibus Theologicis,</hi> “De Incarnatione,” xiv. 11). It certainly includes
                    most of the leading post-Nicene patristic names,—such as Eusebius and many
                    fathers commonly honoured with the prefix of saint, as Gregory of Nazianzus,
                    Gregory of Nyssa, Chrysostom, both the Cyrils, Ambrose, Jerome, and others. Of
                    these St Jerome is the most extreme and vehement; but this is accounted for, not
                    only by the author’s temperament, but by the fact of his writing against an
                    opponent whom he specially disliked on personal as well as theological grounds
                    <hi rend="italic">(Contra Vigilanlium</hi><hi rend="italic">liber unus).</hi>
                    Later writers on the same side with Vigilantius are Claudius of Turin and
                    Agobard of Lyons, but our limits forbid us to discuss their views. Some
                    sectaries ( <hi rend="italic">e.g</hi> ., the Novatianists) appear to have been
                    as anxious as their opponents to collect relics. </p></note> But three or four
                    features in the history of early Christendom conspired to spread the cultus of
                    relics. These were the heathen persecutions, the rise of Gnosticism, the strong
                    and exaggerated feeling about possession and witchcraft, —to which may probably
                    be added the sense of a sort of education connected with visible and tangible
                    links of connexion with the past.</p>
                <p>The way in which these elements of the case would operate is tolerably obvious.
                    If, as at Lyons and Vienne, pagan persecutors burnt the ashes of the martyrs,
                    and threw them into the Ehone, exulting in the idea that they were disproving
                    one of the most important articles of the Christian creed, the resurrection of
                    the body, with still more fervid zeal would the faithful seize every opportunity
                    of honouring those remains which their opponents sought to vilify. Then, again,
                    the other great foe of early Christendom, the heresy of Gnosticism (often
                    denounced as a more subtle and dangerous evil than the open hostility of
                    heathendom), amidst all its varied forms was consistent in representing matter
                    as something essentially evil. The counter teaching, implied in the central
                    doctrine of the</p>
                <p>Christian faith, the mystery of the incarnation, and in the sacraments, might
                    seem to gain some aid from the veneration shown to what was regarded as another
                    form of hallowed matter, the bodies of the saints or the material instruments of
                    Christ’s passion. And, thirdly, the dread of possession found some alleviation
                    in the check to satanic malice which relics were believed to effect.</p>
                <p>It is also conceivable that the interest created by such memorials might have its
                    share in that education of the earlier Middle Ages which was so powerfully
                    assisted by pilgrimages and by biographies. Guizot, in a well-known chapter of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Civilisation en France</hi> has dwelt largely on the value
                    of even the legends of this period. He maintains that, in a world full of
                    violence, disorder, and oppression, the legends of the saints found food for
                    some of the most powerful instincts and invincible needs of the human mind—that
                    exaggeration of details, or even failure in material truth, did not prevent them
                    from being a moral relief and a protest on behalf of many of the rights of man.
                    ]Material memorials, or even supposed memorials, would certainly help to impress
                    such stories upon the mind, as is the case with the facts and the legends of
                    secular history. Leibnitz, among the large concessions in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema Theo-logicum</hi> to the Roman Catholic view of these questions, in
                    some degree anticipates the language of Guizot concerning pious legends.</p>
                <p>In any case, alike for good and for evil,—and it will be necessary to speak
                    presently of the sadder aspects of the question,— relics from the 4th to the
                    16th century occupied a large space in the mind of Christendom. The word relics
                    ( <hi rend="italic">reliquiae, Xeiipavo)</hi> became almost restricted, in
                    theological language, to the bodies (or parts of the bodies) of saints, or, as
                    has been intimated, to memorials of Christ’s passion, or instruments which had
                    been used in the torture and execution of martyrs. Inquiries connected with
                    their genuineness are, as is well known to students of ecclesiastical history,
                    conspicuous in the life of the mother of Constantine, St Helena, who claimed to
                    have discovered the true cross on which our Lord suffered, and in the career of
                    St Ambrose at Milan. Once at least a really glorious series of campaigns, those
                    of the emperor Heraclius against the barbarian Avars and the Persians (622-628),
                    is connected with a successful endeavour to regain the cross (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. pp. 614-615). It is remarkable that
                    the Persians are reported to have kept the cross in its case with the seals
                    unbroken.</p>
                <p>Thus far relics have been regarded as evidencing two marks of a very powerful
                    element of life, namely, the capacity of evoking enthusiasm and of influencing
                    even bystanders or opponents. But it is time to turn to the more painful
                    features of their history in connexion with Christian thought and practice. It
                    must not be supposed that the recognition of such phases is by any means a
                    purely Protestant sentiment, although ־it is no doubt a prominent feature in the
                    Reformation of the 16th century. Thus, for example, one of the most credulous
                    biographies of a saint of the 4tli century, that of St Martin by Sulpicius
                    Severus, mentions (chap, viii.) an instance where the supernatural insight of
                    Martin was exerted in the way of repression of such homage. The country people
                    were exhibiting veneration at the tomb of a supposed saint, but it w־as revealed
                    to the bishop of Tours that it was that of a robber executed for his crimes. St
                    Augustine, in his severe and satiric tractate against certain unworthy monks who
                    made their profession a mere cloak for idleness, clearly insinuates the sale of
                    questionable relics as one of their faults. “Alii membra martyrum, si tamen
                    martyrum, venditant.” The traffic in relics became part of the recognized
                    commerce of Christendom and was countenanced by sovereigns of undoubted
                    excellence. Thus Athelstan was <pb break="no"

                    Exeter. A list occupying more than three columns is given in the Leofric missal.
                    It includes fragments of the candle which the angel of the Lord lit in the tomb
                    of Christ, of the burning bush whence Jehovah spoke to Moses, and of . one of
                    the stones which slew the protomartyr Stephen. Edward the Confessor and Louis
                    IX. of France may be named among the saintly patrons of a commerce which they at
                    least considered meritorious.</p>
                <p>The mention of this last name involves a reference to an event which, above all
                    others of the Middle Ages, spread, fostered, and ultimately injured the
                    veneration of relics. The crusades created a profound excitement in this matter.
                    Pilgrims had already thought it a default to return from Palestine without some
                    such evidence that they had actually visited the Holy Land. Relics, at first
                    probably bought and sold in good faith, became multiplied; and rival possessions
                    of most sacred memorials (as, for instance, the crown of thorns, exhibited both
                    by the abbey of St Denys and by St Louis) were by no means uncommon. Even the
                    crime of theft seems to have been condoned when a relic was in question, and
                    mutilation of a saint’s body to have been hardly thought irreverent. To swear by
                    these relics became the most binding of oaths, as will be remembered by those
                    who have read the life of King Robert II. of France, and the ruse practised on
                    Harold by William, duke of Normandy. Marauding campaigns between monastery and
                    monastery were by no means uncommon; but these sink into insignificance compared
                    with the spoliation exercised by the crusaders from the West who captured and
                    sacked Constantinople in 1203-4. The shameful behaviour of the conquering army
                    is admitted by the Latins themselves; but the condemnation freely uttered
                    against licence, brutality, and profane irreverence seems generally (though not
                    quite universally) hushed when the spoliation concerns treasure in the way of
                    relics. The fact of their abundance shows an agreement on this point, amidst
                    their differences, between the Latin and Greek Churches; but Constantinople
                    roust have been greatly impoverished by the immense supply of relics “that were
                    scattered by this revolution over the churches of Europe.” <note anchored="true"

                    hardly be doubted, an increase of lower motives and of fraud. By the time of the
                    Reformation the condition of matters was such as in many respects to offer a
                    mark for all assailants of the existing state of things, and a practical
                    admission on the part of those in authority that it was to a large extent simply
                    indefensible. Erasmus, on this as on so many other kindred subjects, is found

                    earthly (and sometimes evil) character of the petitions offered to saints and

                    most common and abundant being the “caeleste lac beatge Virginis,” the enormous
                    amount of wealth lying idle at the shrine of St Thomas k Becket—these and
                    similar topics are treated in this author’s caustic and elegant Latinity. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Colloquia</hi> were published in 1522, and from this date a
                    mass of similar literature in the vernacular tongue of various countries, of a
                    coarser kind and more adapted to the popular taste, seems to have been
                    circulated freely throughout Europe.</p>
                <p>The reaction against the homage paid to relics was immense. A practice which has
                    not only been extensively abused, but which appears from its very nature to
                    involve a fatal facility of abuse, can never stand quite where it did after such
                    an exposure as that to wliich reference has been made. Yet it seems doubtful
                    whether the Reformers in all cases intended to do more than check the prominent
                    abuses connected with relics. Those who claimed Holy Scripture as the sole
                    authority could not deny that it might please the Almighty to convey blessings
                    through the instrumentality of such material things, as in the cases already
                    referred to in the second book of Kings and the Acts of the Apostles. Even
                    Luther seems rather to denounce mistakes concerning particular relics than the
                    respect paid to recognized ones. In like manner the English Church, while using
                    severe and contemptuous language in the <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi> with
                    reference to such practices as those satirized by Erasmus, has preserved in its
                    calendar, among minor festivals, the days respectively chosen by the earlier
                    mediaeval church for the discovery of the cross by St Helena (May 3rd) and its
                    recovery by Heraclius (September 14th). Mosheim and other learned foreign
                    Protestants also speak gently on such themes. Thus the devout Lutheran Neander,
                    while mentioning in his <hi rend="italic">Church History</hi> some cases of
                    deliberate fraud, and holding that the superstition concerning saints and relics
                    bordered nearly on paganism, is yet unable to approve of the extreme reaction
                    which in some quarters arose out of it.</p>
                <p>As regards the Church of Rome, although in theory the events of the 16th century
                    may have left its teaching untouched, yet it can hardly be questioned but that
                    this is one of the many departments of religious life in which that great
                    commotion, as De Maistre calls it, has in his words, even among Roman Catholics,
                    <hi rend="italic">opere une revolution tres sensible.</hi> The council of Trent,
                    which must be regarded as, from its own point of view, a reforming council,
                    treated the subject of relics in its twenty-fifth session, held in December
                    1563. It expressed its earnest desire for the removal of abuses, for the
                    abolition of unworthy gain in the veneration of relics, and of revelry on
                    occasion of their visitation. It forbade the acceptance by any church of new
                    relics, without the approbation of the bishop, given after consultation with
                    theologians and other devout men, and referred grave and difficult questions
                    concerning the extirpation of abuses to the judgment of local councils, of
                    metropolitans, and ultimately to the Roman see itself.</p>
                <p>By these steps a great change has been effected. We hear nothing more of the sale
                    of relics (which had indeed been forbidden by the fourth Lateran council in
                    1215), of theft or of war in connexion with them. Some of those most strange
                    memorials to which a passing allusion has been made above have seemingly
                    disappeared from history. And, although leading writers of the Roman obedience
                    in France and Italy do not often make concessions, the Freiburg <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopaedia</hi> admits the non-authenticity of numbers of
                    relics brought home from the crusades and from the conquest of Constantinople;
                    and Addis and Arnold <hi rend="italic">(Roman Catholic Dictionary</hi> , 1884)
                    say that “abuses no doubt have occurred in all ages with regard to relics.” No
                    shock less great than that caused by the Reformation would probably have
                    effected so much as has been done.</p>

                    e believe, in considering the possession of relics an indispensable condition of
                    the performance of the highest acts of public Christian worship. Every altar
                    used for the celebration of mass must, according to Roman Catholic rule, contain
                    some authorized relics. These are inserted into a cavity prepared for their
                    reception, called “the tomb,”</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Authorities.</hi> —Many of the leading authorities have already
                    been named. To these may be added on the Roman Catholic side Perrone, <hi
                    rend="italic">Praclectiones Thcologicae,</hi> vol. ii. “DeCultu Sanctorum,” cap.
                    iv. (ed. Paris, 1863), and Martigny, <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire des
                    Antiquités Chrétiennes (s. v.</hi> “Reliques”). Un the other side the followers
                    of Calvin (on this as on so many other topics) are usually more fiercely
                    anti-Roman than those of Luther. Among Anglican divines those who have published
                    treatises on the Thirty-nine Articles are necessarily brought across the
                    subject. The work of the bishop of Winchester (Dr Harold Browne) will here be
                    found; the fullest and most able as well as the most candid and temperate.
