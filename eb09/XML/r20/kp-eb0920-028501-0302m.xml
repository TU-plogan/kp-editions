                    the richly wooded maritime pro-vince of Gilan, contains from 15,000 to 20,000
                    inhabitants. Eastwick, who was there in 1861, accepts the former estimate, but
                    states that the place was four times as popu-lous before the plague of 1831. The
                    distance from Enzelli, on the southern shores of the Caspian, the actual port of
                    dis-embarkation for passengers and goods from Russia, is about 16 miles, of
                    which 12 (to Pari Bazaar) are accomplished in an open boat, the last part by
                    river, but for the most part over a widespread brackish lake or lagoon ( <hi
                    rend="italic">murdáb</hi> ), abounding in wild fowl, surrounded by reeds, and
                    separated from the sea by a narrow belt of sand. From Pari Bazaar to Rasht the
                    road, piercing through forest and swamp, had for many long years been memorable
                    only for its puddles and pools, its ruts and ruggedness, but it has more
                    recently undergone great improvement. As for the town itself, the tiled houses
                    in the streets, and the lanes, lined with hedge and cottage, in the environs,
                    impart a cheer-fulness to the locality little in unison with the sickly and
                    fever-stricken faces and forms of the inhabitants. Yet the beauty and hazel eyes
                    of the children, with their “true English pink and white complexions” noticed by
                    Eastwick, are not significant of inherited enervation.</p>
                <p>Rasht is the residence of a Russian and an English <pb break="no"

                    by the sháh. It is the centre of the silk trade, which once flourished so
                    greatly in Persia as to show an annual export of nearly a million and a half
                    pounds in weight, valued at £700, 000. In 1882, however, the prevalence of
                    disease among the silkworms caused many of the peasants of Gilan to abandon the
                    culture of silk in favour of rice, which became largely exported to Russia. But
                    the geographical position of Rasht gives it a world-wide reputation irrespective
                    of trade. If the roads by Trebizond, Erzeroum, and Tabriz on the one hand and by
                    Poti, Tiflis, and Tabriz on the other can still be considered the two
                    “commercial highways” from Europe to Persia, the line of land and water
                    communication by Astrakhan and the south-eastern shores of the Caspian has a
                    good claim to be called the true modern highway for travellers and diplomatists
                    moving in the same direction.</p>
                <p>Rasht was visited in 1739 by “two English gentlemen from Petersburg,” whose
                    narrative, published three years later, contains much interesting information on
                    the existing relations of Gilan with Russia. It is noteworthy, but not
                    astonishing, to find that in those days the shah (Nádir Κúli) was himself “in a
                    manner the sole merchant or trader in all Persia.” In 1744 Jonas Hanway came
                    there also; but no fuller account of the capital of Gilan has perhaps ever been
                    recorded than that of Samuel Gmelin in 1771, when Hidáiyat Khan ruled the
                    province, and Karim Khan Zend was sovereign of Persia. Gmelin was received with
                    extraordinary honours, as an imperial officer of Russia, and every opportunity
                    was afforded him of observing the country, its features and produce, and of
                    acquainting himself with the manners and customs of the inhabitants. In 1882 a
                    concession for the construction of a railway from Rasht to Teheran, <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> Kazvin, was granted to a M. Boital. It is probable that
                    no more practical effect will be given to this scheme than to that of Baron de
                    Reuter some ten years before.</p>
