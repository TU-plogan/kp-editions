                <p><label type="entry">RICKETS</label> a disease of childhood characterized chiefly
                    by a softened condition of the bones and by other evidences of perverted
                    nutrition. As regards its nature and causation rickets has been so fully
                    considered under Pathology that all that appears now necessary is to give a few
                    details as to its chief manifestations, and to refer briefly to some points in
                    relation to its prevention and treatment.</p>
                <p>Although, as already indicated, rickets may have its origin (at least in some
                    instances) during intra-uterine life, it is seldom that it can be recognized
                    until several months after birth, and it most commonly attracts attention at
                    about the end of the first year. The symptoms which precede the outward
                    manifestation of the disease are marked disorders of the digestive and
                    alimentary functions. The child’s appetite is diminished, and there is frequent
                    vomiting together with diarrhoea or irregularity of the bowels, the evacuations
                    being clay-coloured and unhealthy. Along with this there is a falling away in
                    flesh. Importance is to be attached, as pointed out by Sir William Jenner, to
                    certain other symptoms present in the early stages, namely, profuse sweating of
                    the head and upper parts of the body, particularly during sleep, with at the
                    same time dry heat of the lower parts and a tendency in the child to kick off
                    all coverings and expose the limbs. At the same time there is great tenderness
                    of the bones, as shown by the pain produced on moving or handling the child. The
                    urine contains a large amount of calcareous salts. Gradually the changes in the
                    shape of the bones become visible, at first chiefly noticed at the ends of the
                    long bones, as in those of the arm, causing enlargements at the wrists, or in
                    the ribs, producing a knobbed appearance at the junction of their ends with the
                    costal cartilages. The bones also from their softened condition tend to become
                    distorted and misshapen, both by the action of the muscles and by the
                    superincumbent weight of the body. Those of the limbs are bent outwards and
                    forwards, and the child becomes “bow-legged” or “in-kneed” often to an extreme
                    degree. The trunk of the body likewise shows various alterations and deformities
                    owing to curvatures of the spine, the flattening of the lateral curves of the
                    ribs, and the projection forwards of the sternum. The cavity of the chest may
                    thus be contracted and the development of the thoracic organs interfered with as
                    well as their functions more or less embarrassed. The pelvis undergoes
                    distortion, which may reduce its capacity to a degree that in the female may
                    afterwards lead to serious difficulties in parturition. The head of the rickety
                    child is large-looking in its upper part, the individual bones of the cranium
                    sometimes remaining long ununited, while the face is small and ill-developed,
                    and the teeth appear late and fall out or decay early. The constitutional
                    conditions of ill-health continue, and the nutrition and development of the
                    child are greatly retarded.</p>
                <p>The disease may terminate in recovery, with more or less of deformity and
                    dwarfing, the bones although altered in shape becoming firmly ossified, and this
                    is the common result in the majority of instances. On the other hand, during the
                    progress of the disease, various intercurrent ailments are apt to arise which
                    may cause death, such as the infectious fevers, bronchitis and other pulmonary
                    affections, chronic hydrocephalus, convulsions, laryngismus stri. dulus,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>An acute form of rickets of rare occurrence has been described by writers on
                    diseases of children, in which all the symptoms are of more rapid development
                    and progress, the result in many instances being fatal.</p>
                <p>The treatment of rickets is necessarily more hygienic than medicinal, and
                    includes such preventive measures as may be exercised by strict attention to
                    personal health and nutrition on the part of mothers, especially where there
                    appears to be any tendency to a rickety development in any members of the
                    family. Very important also is the avoidance of too prolonged nursing, which not
                    only tends directly to favour the development of rickets in the infant nursed,
                    but by its weakening effects upon the mother’s health is calculated to engender
                    the disease in any succeeding children. At the same time it must be admitted
                    that, when the mother is healthy, her milk abundant, and nursing discontinued
                    before the lapse of the first year, there is no better means of preventing the
                    occurrence of rickets than this method of feeding an infant, the disease, as is
                    well known, being far more frequently met with in children brought up by hand.
                    The management of the child exhibiting any tendency to rickets is of great
                    importance, but can only be alluded to in general terms. The digestive disorders
                    characteristic of the setting in of the disease render necessary the greatest
                    care and watchfulness as to diet. Any one system of feeding the infant may at
                    times be found to disagree, and may require to be changed or modified in some
                    particulars. Thus, if the child be not nursed but fed artificially, milk, either
                    fresh or condensed, should be almost the only article of diet for at least the
                    first year, and the chief element for the next. When not digested well, as may
                    at times be shown by its appearance as a curd in the evacuations, it may be
                    diluted with water or lime water, or else discontinued for a short time,
                    carefully-made gruel or barley water being substituted. Many of the so-called
                    “infant’s foods” which are now so extensively used appear to be well adapted for
                    their purpose, but when employed too abundantly and to the exclusion of the due
                    amount of milk are often productive of digestive and intestinal disorders,
                    probably from their containing a greater amount of starchy matter than can be
                    utilized. From the end of the first year light animal soups may occasionally be
                    given with advantage. The medicinal remedies most to be relied on are those
                    which improve the digestive functions and minister to nutrition, and include
                    such agents as the preparations of iron, quinine, and especially cod-liver oil.
                    The administration of lime salts in large quantity has been proposed by some
                    physicians under the idea that in this way the deficient earthy matter might be
                    supplied to the bones. M. Piorry recommended for this purpose powdered fresh
                    bones which contain a large amount of phosphate of lime. No great success can be
                    claimed for this plan, and it is generally recognized that the most useful
                    method of treatment is that which is directed to the feeble assimilative powers,
                    and seeks to supply food of a kind which will be at once readily digested and
                    nutritious. Of no less importance, however, are abundance of fresh air,
                    cleanliness, warm clothing, and attention to the general hygiene of the child
                    and to regularity in all its functions.</p>
                <p>When the disease is showing evidence of advancing, it is desirable to restrain
                    the child from walking, as far as possible. But this precaution may be to some
                    extent rendered unnecessary by the use of splints and other apparatus as
                    supports for the limbs and body, enabling the child to move about without the
                    risk of bending and deformity of the bones which otherwise would probably be the
                    result. (J. 0. A.)</p>
