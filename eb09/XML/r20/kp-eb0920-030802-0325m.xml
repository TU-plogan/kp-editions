                    de</hi> (1683-1757), the eldest son of a French nobleman, was born on 28th
                    February 1683 at La Rochelle and received his early education there. He ·was
                    taught philosophy in the Jesuits’ college at Poitiers, and in 1699, when “hardly
                    seventeen, but already possessed of the prudence of a grown man,” went to
                    Bourges to study civil law and mathematics under the charge of an uncle, canon
                    of La Sainte Chapelle. In 1703 he came to Paris, where he continued the study of
                    mathematics and physics. He soon made his presence felt in the highest circles,
                    and in 1708, at the remarkably early age of twenty-four, was elected a member of
                    the Académie des Sciences. From this time onwards for nearly half a century
                    hardly a year passed in which the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires de VAcadémie</hi>
                    did not contain at least one paper by Reaumur. At first his attention was
                    occupied by mathematical studies, especially in geometry. In 1710 he was
                    appointed to the charge of a great Government Avork—the official description of
                    the useful arts and manufactures—which led him to many practical researches that
                    resulted in the establish ment of manufactures new to France and the revival of
                    neglected industries. For discoveries regarding iron and steel the regent
                    Orleans awarded him a pension of 12,000 livres; but, being content with his
                    ample private income, he requested that the money should be secured to the
                    Académie des Sciences for the furtherance of experiments on improved industrial
                    processes. In 1731 he became greatly interested in meteorology, and invented the
                    thermometer which bears his name. In 1735 family arrangements obliged him to
                    accept the post of commander and intendant of the royal and military order of
                    Saint Louis; he discharged his duties in connexion with it with scrupulous
                    attention, but declined to receive any of the emoluments. Whatever his other
                    occupations Avere, he ahvays found time for the systematic study of natural
                    history, in which he took great delight. He Avas a born naturalist, gifted with
                    rare poAvers of observation and description,—indeed his friends often called him
                    the Pliny of the 18th century. He loved retirement and lived much at his country
                    residences, at one of Avhich, La Bermondière (Maine), he met with an accident, a
                    fall from horseback, the effects of which proved fatal on 17th October 1757. He
                    bequeathed his manuscripts, which filled 138 portfolios, and his natural history
                    collections to the Académie des Sciences.</p>
                <p>Reaumur Avas a man of wide attainments and great industry. His writings,
                    sometimes on trivial topics, were frequently diffuse, yet always interesting.
                    His mind was original and intensely practical. As a rule he avoided theoretical
                    questions, but Avhen he took them up his manner of treatment Avas remarkably
                    clear, chiefly on account of an ingenious use of metaphor, often expanding into
                    allegory. His memory Avas retentive, his information immense, and his kindliness
                    of disposition such that his knowledge and wealth seemed to be amassed only for
                    the benefit of his friends. He always bore a high character, was a great
                    favourite in society, and associated on terms of intimacy Avith the principal
                    great men of the time in Europe.</p>
                <p>Reaumur’s scientific papers are too numerous to be recapitulated; they deal with
                    nearly all branches of science. His first paper, in 1708, was on a general
                    problem in geometry, his last, in 1756, on the forms of birds’ nests. He proved
                    experimentally the fact, afterwards demonstrated theoretically by Du Hamel, that
                    the strength of a rope is less than the sum of the strengths of its separate
                    strands. He examined and reported on the auriferous rivers, the turquoise mines,
                    the forests, and the fossil beds of France. He devised the method of tinning
                    iron that is still employed, and investigated the differences betAveen iron and
                    steel, correctly slioAA'ing that the amount of combustible matter (sulphur in
                    the language of the old chemistry) is greatest in cast iron, less in steel, and
                    least in Avrought iron. His book on this subject (1722) Avas translated into
                    English and German. The thermometer by Avhich he is noAv best remembered Avas
                    constructed on the principle of taking the freezing-point of water as 0°, and
                    graduating the tube into degrees each of which Avas one-thousandth of the volume
                    contained by the bulb and tube up to the zero mark. It Avas purely an accident
                    dependent on the dilatability of the particular quality of alcohol employed
                    which made the boiling-point of Avater 80°; and mercurial thermometers the stems
                    of which are graduated into eighty equal parts between the freezing and boiling
                    points of water are not Reaumur thermometers in anything but name.</p>
                <p>Reaumur Avrote much on natural history. Early in life ho described the locomotor
                    system of the Echinodermata, and shoAved that the supposed vulgar error of
                    Crustaceans replacing their lost limbs Avas an actual fact. In 1710 he Avrote a
                    paper on the possibility of spiders being used to produce silk, which Avas so
                    celebrated at the time that the Chinese emperor Kang-he caused a translation of
                    it to be made. He treated also of botanical and agricultural matters, and
                    devised processes for preserving birds and eggs. He elaborated a system of
                    artificial incubation, and made important observations on the digestion of
                    carnivorous and graminivorous birds; but his greatest work is the Mémoires pour
                    servir à l’Histoire des Insectes, 6 vols., with 267 plates, Amsterdam, 1734-49.
                    It describes the appearance, habits, and locality of all the knoAvn insects
                    except the beetles, and is a marvel of patient and accurate observation. Amongst
                    other important facts stated in this work are the experiments which enabled
                    Reaumur to prove the correctness of Peyssonel’s hypothesis, that corals were
                    animals and not plants, as AA׳as previously supposed.</p>
