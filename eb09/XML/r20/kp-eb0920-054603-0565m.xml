                <p><label type="entry">RICHTER</label> Johann Paul Friedrich (1763-1825), usually
                    called Jean Paul, the greatest German humorist, was born at Wunsiedel, in
                    Bavaria, on the 21st March 1763. His father was a schoolmaster and organist at
                    Wunsiedel, but in 1765 he became a pastor at Joditz, and in 1776 at
                    Schwarzenbach, where he died in 1779. Having attended the gymnasium at Hof for
                    two years, Richter went in 1780 to the university of Leipsic. His original
                    intention was to enter his father’s profession, but theology did not interest
                    him, and he soon devoted himself wholly to the study of literature. Unable to
                    maintain himself at Leipsic, he secretly left it in 1784 and lived with his
                    mother at Hof. From 1787 to 1789 he served as a tutor at Töpen, a village near
                    Hof; and afterwards he taught the children of several families at Schwarzenbach.
                    During all these years he had to struggle with extreme poverty, but he never
                    lost the buoyancy of his temper, nor did he doubt for a moment that his genius
                    would in the end be generally recognized. His hardships left no trace of
                    bitterness on his frank and manly spirit.</p>
                <p>Richter began his career as a man of letters by writing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gronldndisehe Processe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Auswahl aus des
                    Teufels</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n566/mode/1up"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Papieren,</hi> the former of which was issued in 1783-84, the
                    latter in 1789. These works were not received with much favour, and in later
                    life Richter himself had little sympathy with their satirical tone. His next
                    book, <hi rend="italic">Die Unsichtbare Loge,</hi> a romance, published in 1793,
                    had all the qualities which were soon to make him famous, and its power was
                    immediately recognized by some of the best critics of the day. Soon after the
                    appearance of this book he abandoned his work at Schwarzenbach, and lived again
                    with his mother at Hof, occasionally paying long visits to a friend at Baireuth.
                    Encouraged by the reception of <hi rend="italic">Die Unsichtbare Loge,</hi> he
                    sent forth in rapid succession <hi rend="italic">Hesperus</hi> (1794), <hi
                    rend="italic">Biographische Belustigungen unter der Gehirnschale einer
                    Riesin</hi> (1796), <hi rend="italic">Leben des Quintus Fixlein</hi> (1796), <hi
                    rend="italic">Blumen-, Frucht-, und Dornenstikke, oder Ehestand, Tod, und
                    Hochzeit des Armenadvocaten Siebenkas</hi> (1796-97), <hi rend="italic">Der
                    Jubelsenior</hi> (1797), and <hi rend="italic">Das Kampaner Thal</hi> (1798).
                    This series of writings secured for Richter a great place in German literature,
                    and during the rest of his life every work he produced was welcomed by a wide
                    circle of admirers.</p>
                <p>After his mother’s death he went in 1797 to Leipsic, and in the following year to
                    Weimar, where he had much pleasant intercourse with Herder, by whom he was
                    warmly appreciated. He did not become intimate with Goethe and Schiller, to both
                    of whom his literary methods were repugnant; but in Weimar as elsewhere his
                    remarkable conversational powers and his genial manners made him a favourite in
                    general society. He was especially liked by women, and Frau von Kalb, who has
                    also a place in the biography of Schiller, even offered to obtain a divorce in
                    order to marry him. In 1801, however, he married Caroline Mayer, a bright,
                    accomplished, and amiable lady whom he met in Berlin in 1800. They lived first
                    at Meiningen, then at Coburg; and finally, in 1804, they settled at Baireuth.
                    Here Richter spent a quiet, simple, and happy life, constantly occupied with his
                    work as a writer. In 1808 he was fortunately delivered from anxiety as to
                    outward necessities by the kindness of the prince primate, who gave him a
                    pension of a thousand florins. Before settling at Baireuth, Richter had
                    published <hi rend="italic">Das heimliche Klaglied der jetzigen Männer</hi>
                    (1801), and <hi rend="italic">Titan</hi> (1800-3); and these were followed by
                    <hi rend="italic">Flegeljahre</hi> (1804-5). <hi rend="italic">Titan</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Flegeljahre</hi> he regarded as his masterpieces, and this
                    judgment has been confirmed by posterity. His later imaginative works were <hi
                    rend="italic">Dr Katzen-bergeds Badereise</hi> (1809), <hi rend="italic">Des
                    Feldpredigers Schmelze Reise nach Flatz</hi> (1809), <hi rend="italic">Leben
                    Fibels</hi> (1812), and <hi rend="italic">Der Komet, oder Nikolaus Marggraf
                    (1820-22).</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Vorschule der Aesthetik</hi> (1804) he
                    expounded his ideas on art; he discussed the principles of education in <hi
                    rend="italic">Levana, oder Erziehungslehre</hi> (1807); and the opinions
                    suggested by current events he set forth in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Friedenspredigt</hi> (1808), <hi rend="italic">Dämmerungen für Deutschland</hi>
                    (1809), <hi rend="italic">Mars und PEobus Thronwechsel im J. 18lj</hi> (1814),
                    and <hi rend="italic">Politische Fastenpredigten</hi> (1817). In his last years
                    he began <hi rend="italic">Wahrheit aus Jean Paul's Leben,</hi> to which
                    additions from his papers and other sources were made after his death by C. Otto
                    and E. Förster. In 1821 Richter lost his only son, a youth of the highest
                    promise; and he never quite recovered from this shock. He died of dropsy on the
                    14th November 1825.</p>
                <p>Schiller said of Richter that he would have been worthy of admiration “if he had
                    made as good use of his riches as other men made of their poverty.” And it is
                    true that in the form of his writings he never did full justice to his great
                    powers. In working out his conceptions he found it impossible to restrain the
                    expression of any powerful feeling by which he might happen to be moved. He was
                    equally unable to resist the temptation to bring in strange facts or notions
                    which occurred to him; and of such facts and notions he had a vast store, for he
                    was an omnivorous reader, and forgot nothing that had ever touched his fancy or
                    awakened his sympathies. Hence every one of his works is irregular in structure,
                    and in some of them it is hard to detect the governing idea by which the
                    relation of the parts to the whole is supposed to be controlled. His style, too,
                    lacks directness, precision, and grace. With the main idea of a sentence he
                    almost invariably associates a crowd of subordinate ideas; and they are often
                    grouped in an order so capricious and so fantastic that the meaning can be made
                    out only by the closest study. The splendour of Richter’s genius, however, makes
                    it easy for the class of readers to whom he appeals to forgive even these grave
                    defects. His imagination was one of extraordinary fertility, and he had a
                    surprising power of suggesting great thoughts by means of the simplest incidents
                    and relations. No German prose writer has presented more fascinating pictures of
                    childhood and youth, of friendship and love; nor has any one shown more finely
                    how sordid circumstances may evoke the noblest qualities of loyal and generous
                    minds. The love of nature was one of Richter’s deepest pleasures, and he
                    communicates his own delight in its beauty by many a description glowing with
                    all the colour and the radiance of the real world. His expressions of religious
                    feelings are also marked by a truly poetic spirit, for to Richter visible things
                    were but the symbols of the invisible, and in the unseen realities alone he
                    found elements which seemed to him to give significance and dignity to human
                    life. His humour, the most distinctive of his qualities, cannot be dissociated
                    from the other characteristics of his writings. It mingled with all his
                    thoughts, and to some extent determined the form in which he embodied even his
                    most serious reflections. That it is sometimes extravagant and grotesque cannot
                    be disputed, but it is never harsh nor vulgar, and generally it springs
                    naturally from the perception of the incongruity between ordinary facts and
                    ideal laws. There are works of imaginative genius which we may read and enjoy
                    without necessarily thinking of the author. The writer may reflect nature with
                    so much fidelity that at first sight no element may seem to be imported into his
                    conceptions from his personal peculiarities. But we appear always to see
                    Richter’s face and to hear his voice behind the printed page; and his creations
                    are true and suggestive only in so far as they are (manifestations of his own
                    inward life. This means, of course, that his genius was not in any important
                    sense dramatic, and that he was much more closely akin to the romantic than to
                    the classic school; but it does not imply that his works produce a monotonous
                    impression. Richter’s personality was so deep and many-sided that in every new
                    book he had some fresh secret to disclose. And the more he is known through his
                    unconscious selfrevelation the more he is loved and honoured; for we soon learn
                    that with all his wilfulness and eccentricity he was a man of a pure and
                    sensitive spirit, with a passionate scorn for pretence and an ardent enthusiasm
                    for truth and goodness.</p>
                <p>In 1826-38 a complete edition of Richter's works was published in sixty-five
                    volumes, including several posthumous works. The second edition (1840-42) was in
                    thirty-three volumes, the third (1860-63) in thirty-four. There are also a good
                    many volumes of Richter's correspondence. See Döring, <hi rend="italic">Leben
                    und Charakteristik Richters</hi> (1826); Kunz, <hi rend="italic">Jean Paul
