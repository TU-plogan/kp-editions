                    Virginia, is situated in Henrico county, on the north side of the James River,
                    at the point where the lower falls (100 feet in 6 miles) mark the limit of the
                    tide ascending from Chesapeake Bay. On the other side of the river, and in the
                    county of Chesterfield, but connected with Richmond by bridges, is Manchester.
                    By rail the city is 116 miles south-south-west of Washington. At mean high tides
                    vessels drawing 14 feet of water can come up to Rocketts, as the lower district
                    is called. The town proper occupies a group of hills—Gamble’s Hill, Shockoe
                    Hill, Church Hill, &amp;c.—and looks down over the river, from which it is
                    separated by a strip of flat ground. Main Street is a typical street after the
                    old Southern style, the large portion burned in 1865 having been rebuilt in
                    keeping with the remnant that escaped. By far the most conspicuous edifice in
                    the city is the Capitol, on the summit of Shockoe Hill, designed by Thomas
                    Jefferson, after the Maison Carrée of Nîmes. Beneath the dome of <pb break="no"

                    statue of Washington in the uniform of a pre-Revolutionary American general, and
                    in the esplanade near the west gates of Capitol Square is Crawford’s famous
                    bronze equestrian statue of the same hero (1858), surrounded by bronze figures
                    of Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, George Mason, Thomas Nelson,
                    and Andrew Lewis. North of the Capitol stands Foley’s bronze statue of General
                    “Stonewall” Jackson, the gift of English admirers of that great Confederate
                    leader. A governor’s house, a State penitentiary, a custom-house and post
                    office, a city-hall and almshouse, and two market-houses are among the principal
                    public buildings. Libby prison, in which thousands of Federal prisoners were
                    confined during the Civil War, was originally a disused tobacco factory, and is
                    now scarcely distinguishable from the other dilapidated brick warehouses in its
                    vicinity. St John’s Episcopal church on Church Hill was, in 1775, the
                    meeting-place of the Virginia convention to which Patrick Henry addressed his
                    famous “Give me liberty or give me death,” and in 1788 of another convention
                    summoned to discuss the ratification of the Federal Constitution. Monumental
                    Church (Episcopal) commemorates the disastrous burning in 1811 of the theatre
                    which then occupied the site. The State Library, the Virginia Historical
                    Society, Southern Historical Society, Richmond College, and the Medical College
                    (1838) are institutions of note. Holywood Cemetery, occupying a district of
                    great natural beauty to the west of the city, contains the graves of thousands
                    of Confederate soldiers and the monuments of President Monroe and General J. E.
                    B. Stuart, and the Confederate soldiers’ monument. Previous to the Civil War
                    Richmond was the commercial capital of the South and a great entrepot for the
                    produce of the Southern States, Cuba, South America, and Great Britain. Its
                    clipper ships made fast voyages to the Pacific for tea, silk, and other Eastern
                    wares. Its auction sales (monthly or even fortnightly) drew buyers from every
                    part of the Union, even from the northern cities which now supply it with the
                    very commodities they then visited it to purchase. When the war was over
                    Richmond was without ships, merchants, or capital. The tea trade had gone to
                    London, the South-American to New York and Boston, In recent years, however, a
                    new period of commercial prosperity appears to have set in, and, while several
                    of the old sources of wealth have disappeared, the city still remains the
                    natural centre of some of the principal trades of the South. Before the war more
                    tobacco was sold in Richmond than perhaps in any city of the Union (fifty-six
                    manufacturers were numbered in 1857), and this still remains an important
                    staple. The flour trade is also of great extent. There are a large number of
                    iron works, including those of the Tredegar Company; and granite quarries are
                    worked in the vicinity of the city. In 1857 the real estate of Richmond was
                    assessed at $18,259,816, and the personal property at $10,287,278. By 1885 the
                    corresponding figures were $34,502,903 and $15,000,000. The city is the owner of
                    both gas and water works. The population, which was only 5737 in the beginning
                    of the century, has increased as follows:—9785 in 1810; 12,067 in 1820; 16,060
                    in 1830; 20,153 in 1840; 27,570 in 1850; 37,910 in 1860; 51,038 in 1870; 63,600
                    in 1880 (27,832 coloured).</p>
                <p>The first settlement on part of the site of Richmond is said to date from 1609;
                    and Fort Charles was erected as a defence against the Indians in 1644-45. But
                    the real origin of the town, which was incorporated in 1745, was Byrd’s
                    warehouse, erected by Colonel William Byrd in the close of the 17th century. It
                    was still a small village when in 1779 it was made the capital of the State of
                    Virginia. From May 1861 till April 1865, when it was occupied by the Federal
                    army, Richmond was the seat of government of the</p>
                <p>Confederate States. On the capture of Petersburg by General Grant the Confederate
                    leaders thought it impossible to hold the city, in spite of the strength of its
                    fortifications; and Ewell, who commanded the rear-guard of the retreating army,
                    set the great tobacco factories and Hour-mills and the arsenal on fire; the
                    conflagration lasted till the evening of the following day. In September 1870
                    part of the city was laid under water by the floods of the James river.</p>
