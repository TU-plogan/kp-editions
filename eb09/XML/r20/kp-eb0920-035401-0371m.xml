                    schools then gave little attention; but, as he had not mastered the grammar, he
                    soon found this a sore task and took up Arabic. He was very poor, having almost
                    nothing beyond his allowance, which for the five years was only two hundred
                    thalers. But everything of which he could cheat his appetite was spent on Arabic
                    books, and when he had read all that was then printed he thirsted for
                    manuscripts, and in March 1738 started on foot for Hamburg, joyous though
                    totally unprovided, on his way to Leyden and the treasures of the Warnerianum.
                    At Hamburg he got some money and letters of recommendation from the Hebraist
                    Wolf, and took ship to Amsterdam. Here D’Orville, to whom he had an
                    introduction, proposed to retain him as his amanuensis at a salary of six
                    hundred guilders. Reiske refused, though he thought the offer very generous; he
                    did not want money, he wanted manuscripts. But when he reached Leyden (6th June
                    1738) he found that the lectures were over for the term and that the MSS. were
                    not open to him. His money too was gone, and he passed a miserable summer. By
                    and by things mended: D’Orville and A. Schultens helped him to private teaching
                    and reading for the press, by which he was able to live, and his great power of
                    work enabled him still to find time enough for his own studies. He heard the
                    lectures of A. Schultens, and practised himself in Arabic with his son J. J.
                    Schultens. Through Schultens too he got at Arabic MSS., and was even allowed <hi
                    rend="italic">sub rosa</hi> to take them home with him. Ultimately he seems to
                    have got free access to the collection, which he recatalogued—the work of almost
                    a whole summer, for which the curators rewarded him with nine guilders.</p>
                <p>In spite of his hardships Reiske’s first years in Leyden were not unhappy, till
                    he got into serious trouble by introducing divers emendations of his own into
                    the second edition of Burmann’s <hi rend="italic">Petronius,</hi> which he had
                    to see through the press. His patrons withdrew from him, and his chance of
                    perhaps becoming professor was gone. D’Orville indeed soon came round, for he
                    could not do without Reiske, who did work of which his patron, after dressing it
                    up in his own style, took the credit. But A. Schultens was never the same as
                    before to him; Reiske indeed was too independent, and hurt him by his open
                    criticisms of his master’s way of making Arabic mainly a handmaid of Hebrew.
                    Reiske, however, himself admits that</p>
                <p>Schultens, though he had reason to complain of his scholar’s want of respect
                    towards him, always behaved honourably to him. In 1742 by Schultens’s advice
                    Reiske took up medicine as a study by which he might hope to live if he could
                    not do so by philology, and at medicine he worked hard for four years, still
                    continuing the tasks that brought him bread as well as his Greek and Arabic
                    studies. In 1746 he graduated as M.D., the fees being remitted at Schultens’s
                    intercession. It was Schultens too who conquered the difficulties opposed to his
                    graduation at the last moment by the faculty of theology on the ground that some
                    of his theses had a materialistic ring. On June 10, 1746, he left Holland and
                    settled in Leipsic, where he hoped to get medical practice.</p>
                <p>But his shy proud nature was not fitted to gain patients, and the Leipsic doctors
                    would not recommend one who was not a Leipsic graduate. In 1747 an Arabic
                    dedication to the electoral prince of Saxony got him the title of professor, but
                    did not better his circumstances. Neither the faculty of arts nor that of
                    medicine was willing to admit him among them, and he never delivered a course of
                    lectures. He had still to go on doing literary task-work, but his labour was
                    much worse paid in Leipsic than in Leyden. Still he could have lived and sent
                    his old mother, as his custom was, a yearly present of a piece of leather to be
                    sold in retail if he had been a better manager. But, careless for the morrow, he
                    was always printing at his own cost great books which found no buyers. And so
                    for many years he lived in such misery that he often clid not know where to find
                    bread to still his hunger. His academical colleagues were hostile; and Ernesti,
                    under a show of friendship, secretly hindered his promotion. His slashing and
                    unsparing reviews made bad blood with the pillars of the university.</p>
                <p>At length in 1758 the magistrates, of Leipsic rescued him from his misery by
                    giving him the rectorate of St Nicolai, and, though he still made no way with
                    the leading men of the university and suffered from the hostility of men like
                    Ruhnken and J. D. Michaelis, he was compensated for this by the esteem of
                    Frederick the Great, of Lessing, Karsten Niebuhr, and many foreign scholars. The
                    last decade of his life was made cheerful by his marriage with Ernestine Müller,
                    who shared all his interests and learned Greek to help him with collations. In
                    proof of his gratitude her portrait stands beside his in the first volume of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Oratores Grseci.</hi> Reiske died August 14, 1774, and his MS.
                    remains passed, through Lessing’s mediation, to the Danish minister Suhm, and
                    are now in the Copenhagen library.</p>
                <p>Reiske certainly surpassed all his predecessors in the range and quality of his
                    knowledge of Arabic literature. It was the history, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >realia</hi> of the literature, that always interested him; he did not care for
                    Arabic poetry as such, and the then much praised Hariri seemed to him a
                    grammatical pedant. He read the poets for their bearing on history, and cared
                    less for their verses than for such scholia as supplied historical notices. Thus
                    for example the scholia on Jarir furnished him with a remarkable notice of the
                    prevalence of Buddhist doctrine and asceticism in 'Irak under the Omayyads. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Adnotationcs Historicx</hi> to his Abulfeda ( <hi
                    rend="italic">Abulf'. Annalcs Moslcmici,</hi> 5 vols., Copenhagen, 1789-91) he
                    collected a veritable treasure of sound and original research; he knew the
                    Byzantine writers as thoroughly as the Arabic authors, and was alike at home in
                    modern works of travel in all languages and in ancient and medieval authorities.
                    He was interested too in numismatics, and his letters on Arabic coinage (in
                    Eichhorn’s <hi rend="italic">Repertorium,</hi> vols. ix.-xi.) form, according to
                    De Sacy, the basis of that branch of study. To comprehensive knowledge and very
                    wide reading he added a sound historical judgment. He was not, like Schultens,
                    deceived by the pretended antiquity of the Yemenite Kasidas. <note

                <p>point for methodical study of the sources, Reiske’s edition with his version and
                    notes certainly laid the foundation for research in Arabic history. The
                    foundation of Arabic philology, however, was laid not by him but by De Sacy.
                    Reiske’s linguistic knowledge was great, but he used it only to understand his
                    authors; he had no feeling for form, for language as language, or for metre. He
                    was diligent in lexicographic col lections, but cared nothing for etymology or
                    for any speculations that transcended the historical data before him. This
                    narrowness of interest was the counterpart of bis hatred for pedantry and strong
                    love of reality. His greed for historical facts made his studies a sort of vast
                    foray in Arabic literature, but with this he is not to be reproached.</p>
                <p>In Leipsic Reiske worked mainly at Greek, though he continued to draw on his
                    Arabic stores accumulated in Leyden. Yet his merit as an Arabist was sooner
                    recognized than the value of his Greek work, partly perhaps because his talents
                    were really at their best in dealing with a literature which suffers little
                    injustice through lack of interest in its form, but mainly because his
                    contemporaries in Greek learning were narrow and had not the judgment to
                    appreciate him. Reiske the Greek scholar has been rightly valued only in recent
                    years, and it is now recognized that he was the first German since Sylburg who
                    had a living knowledge of the Greek tongue. His reputation does not rest on his
                    numerous editions, often hasty or even made to booksellers’ orders. The text was
                    never his main concern, and he often let received readings stand against his own
                    judgment. The valuable matter lies in his remarks, especially his conjectures.
                    He himself designates the <hi rend="italic">Anvmadversationes in Scriptores
                    Greecos</hi> as <hi rend="italic">flos ingenii sui,</hi> and in truth these thin
                    booklets outweigh his big editions. Closely following the author’s thought he
                    removes obstacles whenever he meets them, but he is so steeped in the language
                    and thinks so truly like a Greek that the difficulties he feels often seem to us
                    to lie in mere points of style. His criticism is empirical and unmethodic, based
                    on immense and careful reading, and applied only when he feels a difficulty; and
                    he is most successful when he has a large mass of tolerably homogeneous
                    literature to lean on, whilst on isolated points he is often at a loss.
                    Phonetics, dialects, orthography were indifferent to him; metre he did not
                    understand. His corrections are often hasty and false, but a surprisingly large
                    proportion of them have since received confirmation from MSS. And, though his
                    merits as a Grecian lie mainly in his conjectures, his realism is felt in this
                    sphere also; his German translations especially show more freedom and practical
                    insight, more feeling for actual life, than is common with the scholars of that
                    age. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For this estimate
                    of Reiske as a Greek scholar the writer is indebted to Prof. U. v.
                    Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. </p></note></p>
                <p>Reiske was essentially a pioneer, who neither left any complete performance
                    behind him nor marked out for others a sharply defined method of research. This
                    was partly due to his unhappy circumstances, but mainly to his passionate
                    interest in all history and all letters, which never allowed him to linger in
                    any one field. The son of the Zorbig tanner, driven by a natural instinct to
                    Arabic lore, devoured by eager desire to view the unknown treasures of distant
                    ages and lands, is an attractive figure amidst the pedants of learned Germany as
                    it then was. Reiske was not amiable, but he was a real character—a character,
                    too, sustained by genuine piety when the deep waters threatened to close over
                    his head.</p>
