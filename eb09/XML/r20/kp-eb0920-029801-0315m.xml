                    division comprises the four districts of Rawal Pindi, Jhelum, Gujrat, and
                    Shahpur, with a total area of 15,435 square miles and a total population (1881)
                    of 2,520,508 (males 1,346,573, females 1,173,935). </p></note> under the
                    jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of the Punjab, lying between 33° and 34°
                    N. lat. and 71° 46'and 73° 41' E. long. It is situated on the southern slopes of
                    the northwestern extremities of the Himalayas, and contains large mountain
                    tracts, with rich valleys traversed by many mountain torrents. Its area is 4861
                    square miles; it is bounded on the N. by Hazdra district, on the E. by the river
                    Jhelum, on the S. by Jhelum district, and on the W. by the Indus. From its
                    north-eastern extremity to its western limits the district is traversed by hills
                    more or less linked together, causing those peculiarities of surface and of
                    climate by which it is distinguished. The eastern range, known locally as the
                    Murree (Marri) Hills, from the sanatorium erected at the north-eastern extremity
                    of the district, is a continuation of the great Himalayan system; it descends in
                    a southerly and westerly direction, and is clothed with magnificent forest trees
                    and a rich undergrowth of brushwood. Southward these hills follow the course of
                    the Jhelum, decreasing in height, but gaining in picturesqueness what they lose
                    in sublimity, until they subside into a comparatively level country. The
                    mountains in the western half of the district belong to the trans-Indus system;
                    the chief range, known as the Chitta Pahar or White Hills, is composed chiefly
                    of nummulitic limestone. To the north lies the fertile valley of Chach, one of
                    the rare oases which relieve the wildness of this savage waste. The Indus and
                    the Jhelum are the chief rivers of Rdwal Pindi. The former bounds the district
                    along its whole western edge, where it is very picturesque, and in parts
                    navigable for steamers; the latter, forming the eastern frontier, is equally
                    picturesque though less important for navigation. Other chief rivers are the
                    Sohan and the Haroh, both tributaries of the Indus. The climate of R&amp;wal
                    Pindi is noted for its salubrity; the mean annual temperature is 69°4־, and the
                    average annual rainfall 33T5 inches. The Punjab Northern State Railway runs
                    through its whole length, with a branch from Golra junction, north of the town
                    of RAwal Pindi, to Khusalgari on the western frontier.</p>
                <p>The population in 1881 was 820,512 (males 449,287, females 371,225), Hindus
                    numbering 86,162, Mohammedans 711,546, Sikhs 17,780, Christians 3822, and
                    “others” 202. The only town with a population exceeding 10,000 is the capital
                    (see below). The inhabitants are mostly scattered in small hamlets over the
                    surface of the country. The staple product is wheat in the spring and bajra in
                    the autumn. Inferior grains are giving place to more valuable cereals, and to
                    cotton and potatoes. Of the total area 1517 square miles are cultivated and 379
                    cultivable. Owing to the nigged nature of the country there is very little
                    commerce, and that little is concentrated principally at the headquarters town.
                    Imports consist of sugar, spices, cotton goods, and salt; while exports are
                    confined to the raw materials of agriculture. The only manufacture of any
                    importance is cotton-weaving. The total revenue of the district in 1882-83 was
                    £105,316, of which the land-tax yielded £68,715.</p>
                <p>Rawal Pindi with the rest of the Sikh dominions passed to the British in 1849,
                    under whose administration it enjoyed comparative peace until the mutiny in
                    1857. The events of that year afforded an outlet for the smouldering passions
                    engendered by ancestral feuds, and the Murree Hills became the scene of an
                    attempted insurrection. The authorities, however, having been warned of this by
                    a faithful native, took steps for defence, so that when the enemy arrived they
                    were compelled to withdraw in disorder, and they shortly afterwards disbanded
                    themselves. Since then the district has remained comparatively tranquil. Among
                    recent events is the great durbar held by the viceroy of India (Earl Dufferin)
                    on 8th April 1885 in honour of the amir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman). The
                    district abounds in objects of great antiquarian interest, chief of which are
                    those of Dehri Shahan (or Shall Dheri), a village situated in 33° 17' N. lat.
                    and 72° 49' E. long. Dehri Shahan has been identified with the site of the
                    ancient city of Taxila or Takshasila, which in the time of Alexander was “a
                    large and wealthy city, the most populous between the Indus and Hydaspes”
                    (Jhelum). The ruins of Taxila consist of several distinct portions, and rank as
                    the most interesting, extensive, and best preserved memorials of antiquity in
                    the Punjab province. </p>
