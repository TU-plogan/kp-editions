                    Lanark, E. by Lanark, S. by Ayr, and W. by the Firth of Clyde. Its greatest
                    length from west-north-west to east-south-east is 30| miles, and its greatest
                    breadth at right angles to this 13J miles. The area is 253793־ square miles or
                    162,427958־ acres, of which 2021179־ acres are foreshore and 3621342־ are water.
                    Except a small portion opposite the burgh of Renfrew, the whole county lies to
                    the south of the Clyde. Twenty-seventh among the Scottish counties as regards
                    extent, it is fifth in point of population, and Midlothian alone is as densely
                    populated, the number of inhabitants to the square mile in 1881 having been 1075
                    in both. For local purposes the county is divided into an upper and a lower
                    ward, the former embracing the two-thirds lying to the east, and having its
                    district centre at Paisley, while the latter contains the parishes of Innerkip,
                    Greenock, Port Glasgow, and Kilmalcolm, and has its district centre at Greenock.
                    The southern border and western part of the county are hilly, but none of the
                    heights rise very much above sea-level, the highest points being Misty Law
                    (1663), East Girt Hill (1673), Hill of Stake (1711), and Burnt Hill (1572), all
                    along the border of Ayrshire. The central part is undulating and, as much of the
                    higher portion of it is well wooded, the scenery is in some places picturesque.
                    Along the greater part of the northern border is a flat tract of clayey
                    carse-land known locally as the <hi rend="italic">“</hi> laich lands,” and very
                    fertile in favourable seasons.</p>
                <p>The principal river is the Clyde, which forms a considerable portion of the
                    northern boundary; and the other chief streams are the White Cart, Black Cart,
                    and Gryfe. The first has its chief sources in the extreme south-east of the
                    county, and flows northward—forming for most of the way the boundary with
                    Lanarkshire— to Cathcart, south of Glasgow, whence it has a westerly course to
                    Paisley, and then again a northerly course till it joins the Clyde a mile
                    north-west of the burgh of Renfrew. The Black Cart issues from Castle Semple
                    Loch near the centre of the southern border of the county, and follows a general
                    north-easterly course to its junction with the White Cart at Inchinnan church a
                    mile west of the burgh of Renfrew. Its most important headwater is the river
                    Calder, which, with smaller streams flowing to it, drains a considerable portion
                    of the southern border and flows into Castle Semple Loch at Lochwinnoch. The
                    Gryfe, which, with a large number of streams flowing to it, drains nearly all
                    the western half of the county, rises at Gryfe Reservoir, 2^ miles south of
                    Greenock, and has a winding easterly course to its junction with the Black Cart
                    at Walkinshaw, 2 miles north-west of Paisley. A number of smaller streams flow
                    direct to the Clyde, the most important being the Kip and the Kelly Burn in the
                    west of the county. The principal lochs arc Loch Thom and Gryfe Reservoir, 2£
                    miles south of Greenock; Castle Semple Loch, near the centre of the southern
                    border; Long Loch and Loch Goin, farther east near the same border; and Balgray
                    and Glen Reservoirs, connected with the Glasgow water supply near the centre of
                    the eastern part of the county. The Glasgow, Paisley, and Johnstone Canal, which
                    formerly united these three towns, has since 1882 been laid dry along the
                    greater part of its course and the bed converted into a railway line.</p>
                <p>The rocks throughout the county are Carboniferous, and almost the whole of the
                    Lower Carboniferous or Calciferous Sandstone series is here represented by a
                    thick set of volcanic deposits. The oldest beds are the red sandstones,
                    cornstones, and conglomerates which occupy the extreme west corner between
                    Innerkip and Loch Thom. Overlying these is the upper portion of the Lower
                    Carboniferous—the cement-stone group—which runs from the hills behind Greenock
                    on the west, south-eastward by the high ground south of Paisley, and so on to
                    the south-east corner of the county and thence into Lanarkshire. The
                    cement-stones form the underlying deposits over nearly two-thirds of the county
                    to the south, west and west; but, though the base of this subdivision here
                    consists of the usual white sandstones and cement-stones, yet the great mass of
                    the rocks are contemporaneous lava-flows—basalts, mela-phyres, and
                    porphyrites—with interbedded tuffs and volcanic agglomerates which have all
                    issued from a line of vents the positions of which may still be traced by the
                    volcanic necks which remain at several points. In the south-east there are
                    intercalated beds of sandstone, shale, and impure limestone. In some places this
                    series of beds passes conformably up into the overlying Carboniferous Limestone
                    series, which occupies a basin covering nearly one-third of the county to the
                    north-east; but the two subdivisions are oftener brought into contact by faults,
                    a double line of which along the valley of the Black Cart brings a narrow tract
                    of the limestones right across the volcanic beds just described. The base of the
                    Carboniferous Limestone subdivision consists of limestones, the middle portion
                    of a series of valuable seams of coal and ironstone, which are extensively
                    worked, and the upper part of limestones. Masses of intrusive volcanic rocks
                    occur to the south of Johnstone and the north-east of Paisley, and to the north
                    of Johnstone and north-west of Paisley are oil-producing shales, which are
                    worked at Clippens and Walkinshaw. Near Pollokshields, at Thornliebank, and to
                    the east of Barrhead there are small outliers of millstone grit consisting of
                    yellow sandstones; and along the extreme north-east corner of the county to the
                    south of Glasgow the true Coal Measures of the great Lanarkshire and
                    Stirlingshire basin are brought in by a fault which throws them down against the
                    Carboniferous Limestone series. Volcanic dykes of Tertiary age run across the
                    older rocks at various points, some very well marked examples occurring near the
                    centre of the southern boi'der. The Glacial deposits are well marked and
                    interesting, the clays at Jordanhill to the north of the Clyde and near Paisley
                    having yielded numerous species of <hi rend="italic">Foraminifcra</hi> and
                    arctic shells. The beds of economic value are all extensively worked. In 1882
                    the eighteen collieries within the county produced 114,324 tons of coal out of a
                    total of 20,515,134 tons for all Scotland, 164,523 tons of ironstone out of a
                    total of 2,404,177 tons, 90,804 tons of oil-shale out of a total of 994,487
                    tons, and 22,554 tons of fireclay out of a total of 435,457 tons. Limestones are
                    also quarried in large quantities for smelting purposes and for the manufacture
                    of lime,— one thin but valuable bed at Orchard, 4 miles south of Glasgow,
                    producing a cement that <hi rend="italic">“</hi> sets <hi rend="italic">”</hi>
                    under water. Copperas is obtained from the iron pyrites got in the shale, and at
                    one time alum-shale was worked at Hurlet in the north-east and copper in the
                    volcanic rocks about Lochwinnoch.</p>
                <p>Farming operations do not differ in detail from those carried on in the adjoining
                    middle and lower wards of Lanarkshire. The climate is very variable; and, as the
                    prevailing west and south-west winds come in from the Atlantic warm and full of
                    moisture, contact with the colder land causes a׳cry heavy rains, and the western
                    part of Renfrewshire is one of the wettest districts in Scotland, the mean
                    annual rainfall amounting to over 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is
                    about 48°. The hilly district has a good deal of moss and moorland, but the
                    soil, which is a light earth, is also over considerable areas deep enough to
                    produce good pasture. In the undulating middle district the soil is generally
                    deeper and <pb break="no"

                    there are tracts of good liaughland, but it is also in many places thin and
                    poor. There is a considerable amount of pasture, and the principal crops are
                    oats and barley. On the Hat lands adjoining the Clyde the soil is a rich
                    alluvium which, except when soured by excessive rain, pro-</p>

                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1884 the total area under crops was

                    There are throughout the shire a large number of excellent roads; and numerous
                    lines and branches of the Caledoniau and the Glasgowand South-Western systems
                    afford ample railway communication along the centre, north, and west for both
                    general traffic and minerals. The population has risen from 78,501 in 1801 to
                    216,947 in 1871 and to 263,374 in 1881 (126,743 males, 136,631 females), more
                    than 100,000 of the increase having taken place between 1851 and 1881. Of the
                    whole number 49,681 men and 21,734 women were engaged in industrial handicrafts
                    or dealt in manufactured substances, and of these 7741 men and 15,547 women were
                    connected with the making of textile fabrics, while 7986 men and 172 women were
                    connected with the working of mineral substances.</p>
                <p>The Redistribution Act passed in 1885 extended the parliamentary representation
                    of the county from one to two members. The only royal burgh is Renfrew, which is
                    separately noticed, as are also the parliamentary burghs of Greenock and
                    Paisley. The county also contains part of the south side of Glasgow and its
                    suburbs, the parliamentary burgh of Port Glasgow, the police burghs of
                    Pollokshaws, Gourock, and Johnstone, and a number of small towns and
                    villages.</p>
                <p>Historically Renfrewshire first appears as part of the territory of the Damnonii,
                    and thereafter it was part of the British kingdom of Strathclyde. The western
                    part, then known as Strathgryfe, was granted by David I. to Walter, the first
                    high stewai-d of Scotland, and the Stewarts had long a local connexion with it.
                    Somerled, Lord of the Isles, was defeated and slain in the neighbourhood of the
                    burgh of Renfrew in 1164; and Marjory Bruce is said to have been killed by a
                    fall from her horse at Knock Hill between Paisley and Renfrew in 1316. In 1404
                    the county, which had previously formed part of Lanark, was erected into a
                    separate jurisdiction by Robert III., who created his son James baron of
                    Renfrew, a title still held by the eldest son of the reigning sovereign. In the
                    end of the 17th century the district was famous for its witches; and in 1685,
                    after the failure of the earl of Argyll’s ill-conducted enterprise, the earl
                    himself was taken prisoner on the bank of the White Cart opposite Inchinnan
                    church, at the spot marked by the <hi rend="italic">“</hi> Argyll Stone,” now
                    within the policies of Blythswood House.</p>
