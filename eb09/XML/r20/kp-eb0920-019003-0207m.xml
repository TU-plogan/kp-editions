                    true explanation is “son of the greatest doctor of the age,” applied to R. Yose
                    b. Halapbta (T. B., <hi rend="italic">Pesαhim,</hi> 100a), R. Shime'on, son of
                    the editor of the Mishnah <hi rend="italic">(Babä Βathra,</hi> 16b), and others.
                    Hence the Talmudic explanation of Exod. xxiii. 2, “thou shalt not gainsay a
                    scholar greater than thyself” (T. B., <hi rend="italic">Synhedriη,</hi> I8b).
                    </p></note><hi rend="italic">Rabbi</hi> ( <hi rend="superscript">,,</hi> 21, <hi
                    rend="italic">pαββei,</hi> Matt, xxiii. 7, &lt;fcc.), “my teacher,” is the title
                    of a teacher fully ordained in Palestine. <hi rend="italic">Rabbän,</hi> “our
                    teacher” or “our lord,” but also “their,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> all
                    Israel’s, teacher (∣21, later form of D21), was the title of the prince
                    (president of the synedrium) from the time of Gamliel I. (the Gamaliel of St
                    Paul) and onward. If a prince-president sprang from any other house than
                    HilleΓs, who was a descendant of David through the female line (as, for example,
                    R. EΓazar b. ’ Azaryah), he was not called by this highest title of honour. The
                    only exception to this rule was Rabbän Yohanan b. Zakkai, to whom Jewish
                    traditional lore owes so much,—nay, its very existence. For he not merely had a
                    distinguished circle of pupils of his own <hi rend="italic">(Aboth,</hi> ii. 8,
                    9), but he saved the lives of the members of the synedrium and secured its free
                    activity. Vespasian, who knew him to have been friendly to the cause of Rome,
                    granted him “Yamnia and its sages” at his request (T. B., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gittiη,</hi> 56b). In Babylonia, again, <hi rend="italic">Rabbana</hi>
                    (Rab-bono) was the title of the Rêsh Gäluthä, or “head of the captivity.” He who
                    bore it was always the reigning descendant of the house of David in the male
                    line. The only person on whom this title was bestowed, though he was not Rêsh
                    Gäluthä, was Rab Ashe (T. B., <hi rend="italic">Kethuboth,</hi> 22a), the
                    principal editor of the Babylonian Talmud, who is reported to have united in his
                    person riches, learning, and virtues such as no man had possessed since the time
                    of “Rabbi,” the principal editor of the Mishnah (T. B., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gittiη,</hi> 59a).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rab,</hi> when the title is not followed by an individual
                    name, denotes <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> Abbä Arëkhâ (Arikha), so
                    called either from the place Arêkhâ in Babylonia, or because of his high
                    stature, or his eminence as a man and scholar. Abbä Arëkhâ was the most
                    successful teacher of the Law and interpreter of the Mishnah in Babylonia,
                    having brought the latter with him from Palestine, where he had received it
                    orally and directly from Rabbi Yehudah Hannasi; he taught it to more than 1200
                    pupils, whom he is related to have housed, fed, and clothed (T. B., <hi
                    rend="italic">Kethuboth,</hi> 106a). He introduced many religious and moral
                    reforms, notably in connexion with marriage, which are law among the Jews of all
                    countries to this day. His Hebrew prose approaches the sublimity of the Old
                    Testament poetry, as may be seen from the tripartite “additional service”
                    recited by all Rabbinic Jews on the two days of the “New Year.” He is also in
                    Babylonia the sole representative of the sublime Palestinian Agadöth, which so
                    closely resemble the words of the Founder of Christianity. In patience with
                    others, and especially with his shrewish wife, he surpassed Job himself. He died
                    as the first head of the academy of Sürä (somewhat later identified with Mäthä
                    Mehasyä) in 247 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> more than eighty years old.</p>

                <p>Rabbāh (רבה), also Rubbo and Rubboh, a title placed in the Palestinian Talmud and
                    Midrashim after the names of certain teachers (T. Y., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Berakhoth,</hi> i. 1; <hi rend="italic">Kilayim,</hi> ix. 3, and elsewhere),
                    corresponds to the Hebrew הנדול in the same connexion in the Babylonian Talmud
                    <hi rend="italic">(Berakhoth,</hi> 6a, and elsewhere), and does not, as has
                    hitherto been supposed, mean “the great” but simply “the elder.” Thus many
                    questionable Talmudic magnitudes disappear. (S. M. S.-S.)</p>
