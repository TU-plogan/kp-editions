                    He was on the eve of obtaining the great prize for engraving when the events of
                    1815 blasted his hopes, for Neufchâtel was restored to Prussia and Robert was
                    struck off the list of competitors as a foreigner. Having fortunately whilst
                    continuing his studies under Girardet never ceased to frequent the studio of
                    David, he now determined to become a painter, and only returned to his native
                    country when his master himself was exiled. At Neufchâtel he had the good
                    fortune to attract the notice of Roullet de Mezerac, who enabled him by a timely
                    loan to proceed to Rome. At Rome Robert soon struck the vein of subject destined
                    to render his talent celebrated. In depicting the customs and life of the
                    people, of southern Italy especially, he showed peculiar feeling for the
                    historical characteristics of their race. All his work of this class was
                    distinguished by an individual style: the actors bore themselves with an air of
                    distinction and something of gravity which witnessed to their ancient lineage,
                    and the rhythmical play of line which characterized all these compositions had a
                    peculiar affinity to the nature of the types which figured in them. The charm of
                    choice in these types, the beauty of this play of line, and the plastic
                    restraint and measure which also marked Robert’s treatment of his favourite
                    subjects were the points to which he owed the wide recognition of his talent,
                    for his command of his own powers was anything but ready and his difficulty in
                    bringing out what he desired to produce shackled him, and especially so because
                    painting requires a sure and ready hand if its means are to be used with
                    brilliant effect. After executing many detached studies of Italian life Robert
                    conceived the idea of painting four great works which should represent at one
                    and the same time the four seasons in Italy and the four leading races of its
                    people. In the Return from the Fête of the Madonna delΓ Arco (Louvre) he
                    depicted the Neapolitans and the spring. This picture, exhibited at the Salon of
                    1827, achieved undoubted success and was bought for the Luxembourg by Charles
                    X.; but the work which appeared in 1831—the Summer Reapers arriving in the
                    Pontine Marshes (Louvre), which became the property of Louis Philippe —
                    established the artist’s reputation, and Robert found himself with all his hopes
                    of honour fulfilled and reckoned as one of the leading masters of his day.
                    Florence and her autumn vineyards should now have furnished him with his third
                    subject. He attempted to begin it, but, unable to conquer his unhappy passion
                    for Princess Charlotte Napoleon (then mourning the violent death of her husband,
                    Robert’s devoted friend), he threw up his work and went to Venice, where he
                    began and carried through the fourth of the series, the Fishers of the Adriatic.
                    This work was not equal to the Reapers. Worn by the vicissitudes of painful
                    feeling and bitterly discouraged, Robert committed suicide before his easel,
                    20th March 1835, on the tenth anniversary of the melancholy suicide of a brother
                    to whom he had been much attached.</p>
