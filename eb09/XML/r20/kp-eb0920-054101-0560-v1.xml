                <p><label type="entry">RICHARD II</label>. (1366-1400), king of England, the only
                    son of Edward the Black Prince and Joan of Kent, was born at Bordeaux, April 13,
                    1366. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his grandfather Edward III., on
                    June 21, 1377. He was crowned on July 16. During the first eleven years of his
                    reign, Richard was in a position of tutelage. His uncles, John of Gaunt, duke of
                    Lancaster, and Thomas, duke of Gloucester, were the most influential persons in
                    the kingdom. The evils naturally inherent in a minority were intensified by war
                    abroad, religious and social troubles at home, the existence of a turbulent
                    nobility, and the intrigues and rivalries which broke up the royal house. Under
                    the incapable rule of Lancaster, the southern coasts were ravaged by French
                    fleets, the northern frontier was harried by the Scots, and the taxes collected
                    for national purposes were wasted or embezzled. The weakness and unpopularity of
                    the Government produced a ferment among the lower classes, which, aggravated by
                    the heavy taxation of 1379 and 1380, culminated in the Peasants’ Revolt of June
                    1381. This revolt gave Richard, then a lad of fifteen, his first opportunity of
                    distinguishing himself. On June 14 he met the rebels at Mile End, and, by
                    promising the abolition of villenage, induced the Essex contingent to return
                    home. Next day he met the Kentish men at Smithfield. In the parley which
                    followed, their leader, Wat Tyler, was killed. The mob were about to avenge his
                    death when the young king, riding forward alone, calmed their irritation and
                    induced them to follθλv him to Islington. Here a body of troops came to the
                    king’s aid, but Richard prevented a conflict, and persuaded the rioters to
                    disperse. His presence of mind, extraordinary in one so young, not only saved
                    his own life but averted a general disaster. In January 1382 he married Anne of
                    Bohemia, daughter of the emperor Charles IV. Meanwhile the influence exerted by
                    John of Gaunt was becoming more and more irksome to him. Charges of conspiracy
                    brought against his uncle in 1384, though denied by Lancaster, so worked upon
                    Richard that he attempted to seize him, but a reconciliation was soon afterwards
                    effected. In 1385 the king led an expedition to Scotland. His refusal to allow
                    the army to penetrate beyond Edinburgh is said to have caused another quarrel
                    with the duke of Lancaster. The efforts made by Richard to form a party of
                    personal adherents, in opposition to his uncles, are to be seen in the elevation
                    of De Vere to the marquisate of Dublin and of De la Pole, the chancellor, to the
                    earldom of Suffolk. After John of Gaunt’s departure to Portugal (July 1386) the
                    quarrel between the king’s party and the opposition headed by Gloucester came to
                    a head. Gloucester, supported by a strong majority in parliament, demanded the
                    dismissal of the chancellor and the treasurer, to which Richard was obliged
                    reluctantly to consent. The blow was followed up by the appointment of a
                    committee of government which, like the baronial committee of 1258, practically
                    superseded the monarchy. Richard submitted, but immediately set about making
                    plans for the recovery of his authority. In November 1387 he came to London in
                    order to overthrow the committee, but was anticipated by Gloucester, who, with
                    Henry of Derby and three others, “appealed,” or impeached the king’s chief
                    adherents of high treason. The party in power always found it easy to manipulate
                    the elections, and the parliament which met in February 1388 was altogether on
                    the side of the “appellants.” The leaders of the king’s party were executed,
                    banished, or imprisoned, and Gloucester won a complete triumph. He failed,
                    however, to establish his power on a firm basis, and in May 1389 Richard threw
                    off the yoke. On the ground that he was now of full age, he suddenly informed
                    his council that he intended to rule alone. Gloucester made no resistance; the
                    nation acquiesced; and Richard was at last really king.</p>
                <p>Richard did not for some time abuse his power. The “appellants” were not
                    punished, and even remained members of the council. William of Wykeham, however,
                    became chancellor, and it was apparently by his advice and that of John of
                    Gaunt, who returned to England in 1389, that Richard regulated his conduct. For
                    eight years he ruled constitutionally. The country was at peace at home and
                    abroad. In June 1394 the queen died. In October of the same year Richard went to
                    Ireland and received the submission of some of the chiefs. He remained in
                    Ireland till May 1395. Next year he concluded a twenty-five years’ truce with
                    France, and engaged to marry Isabella, the French king’s daughter. In September
                    1396 he w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ent to Calais and returned with his
                    bride, a child of eight years old. This alliance seems to have encouraged
                    Richard to carry out a stroke of policy which he had probably long contemplated.
                    In July 1397 he suddenly seized the “appellants,” Warwick, Arundel, and
                    Gloucester. The parliament, which met in September, repealed the acts of 1386,
                    and declared the “appellants” guilty of high treason. Arundel was executed,
                    Warwick imprisoned Gloucester died, probably by violence, in prison. Next year
                    the parliament conferred on Richard tonnage and poundage for life, and delegated
                    their authority to a committee of eighteen, practically chosen by the king, thus
                    making him an absolute monarch. A treasonable conversation between Hereford and
                    Norfolk, reported by the former, gave a pretext for the banishment of both. In
                    February 1399 John of Gaunt died, and Richard seized the Lancaster estates, thus
                    reducing Hereford to desperation. The latter at once began to prepare to recover
                    his inheritance, and Richard, apparently ignorant of the danger, went over to
                    Ireland (May 29), thus leaving the kingdom open to his rival. Henry landed in
                    Yorkshire early in July, and rapidly collected an overpowering force. Richard
                    returned to find Henry in possession of power and himself deserted by the
                    nation. He surrendered to Henry at Flint (August 19) and was conveyed to London.
                    On September 29 he executed a deed by which he resigned the crown. Next day the
                    deed was read in parliament. Formal sentence of deposition was pronounced, and
                    Henry claimed and received the crown. A month afterwards the date king was
                    sentenced to perpetual imprisonment, and was removed to Pontefract. The
                    conspiracy against Henry IV., which was discovered in January 1400, sealed
                    Richard’s fate. The manner of his death is unknown, but there can be little
                    doubt that he died by violence. He is said to have been buried at Langley,
                    February 14, 1400.</p>
                <p>In person Richard was slight, fair-haired, beardless, with rounded face and
                    elegant but rather feminine features. His character, a strange mixture of
                    strength and weakness, courage and irresolution, indolence and energy, remains
                    an enigma to the historian. He protected Wickliffe, encouraged Chaucer, and made
                    a serious attempt to establish an absolute monarchy. His reign, w <hi
