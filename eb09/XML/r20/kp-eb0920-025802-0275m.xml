                    vines after it has come to maturity, Avhere there is sufficient sunshine and
                    heat in the autumn, till the clusters dry on the stocks. Another plan is
                    partially to sever the stalk before the grapes are quite ripe, thus stopping the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Aoav</hi> of the sap, and in that condition to leave them
                    on the vines till they are .sufficiently dry. The more usual process, liOAvever,
                    is to cut off the fully ripe clusters and expose them, spread out, for several
                    days to the rays of the sun, taking care that they are not injured by rain. In
                    unfavourable weather they may be dried in a heated chamber, but are then
                    inferior in quality. In some parts of Spain and France it is common to dip the
                    gathered clusters in boiling Avater, or in a strong potash lye, a practice which
                    softens the skin, favours drying, and gives the raisins a clear glossy
                    appearance. Again, in Asia Minor the fruit is dipped into hot Avater on the
                    surface of which swims a layer of olive oil, which communicates a bright lustre
                    and softness to the skin. Some superior A־arieties are treated with very great
                    care, retained on their stalks, and sent into the market as clusters for table
                    use; but the greater part are separated from the stalks in the process of drying
                    and the stalks AvinnoAved out of the fruit. Raisins come from numerous
                    Mediterranean localities, and present at least three distinct varieties,—(1)
                    ordinary or large raisins, (2) sultana seedless raisins, and (3) currants or
                    Corinthian raisins (see vol. vi. p. 715). The greater proportion of the common
                    large raisins of English commerce comes from the provinces of Malaga, Valencia,
                    and Alicante in Spain; these are knoAvn by the common name of Malaga raisins.
                    Those of the finest quality, called Malaga clusters, are prepared from a variety
                    of muscatel grape, and preserved on the stalks for table use. This variety, as
                    Avell as Malaga layers, so called from the manner of packing, are exclusively
                    used as dessert fruit. Raisins of a somewhat inferior quality, knoAvn as
                    “lexias,” from the same provinces, are used for cooking and baking purposes.
                    Smyrna raisins also come to some extent into the English market. The best
                    quality, knoAvn as Elemé, is a large fruit, having a reddish yelloAv skin with a
                    sweet pleasant flavour. Large-seeded dark-coloured raisins are produced in some
                    of the islands of the Greek Archipelago and in Crete, but they are little seen
                    in the British markets. In Italy the finest raisins are produced in Calabria,
                    inferior qualities in central Italy and in Sicily. From the Lipari Islands a
                    certain quantity of cluster raisins of good quality is sent to England. In the
                    south of France raisins of high excellence—Provence raisins in clusters—are
                    obtained at RoqueA <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> aire, Lunel, and Frontignan.
                    Sultana seedless raisins are the produce of a small variety of yellow grape,
                    cultivated exclusively in the neighbourhood of Smyrna. The vines are groAvn on a
                    soil of decomposed hippurite limestone, on sloping ground rising to a height of
                    400 feet <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n276/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0276-0259"/>above the sea, and all attempts to cultivate
                    sultanas in other raisin-growing localities have failed, the grapes quickly
                    reverting to a seed-bearing character. The dried fruit has a fine golden-yellow
                    colour, with a thin, delicate, translucent skin and a sweet aromatic flavour. A
                    very fine seedless oblong raisin of the sultana type with a brownish skin is
                    cultivated in the neighbourhood of Damascus, but it is rarely seen in the
                    Western markets.</p>
                <p>Raisins are chiefly valuable on account of the large proportion of grape sugar
                    and cream of tartar which they contain. In old dry raisins these substances are
                    found in hard nodular masses. The seeds contain from 15 to 18 per cent, of a
                    bland fixed oil and about 5 per cent, of tannin. The imports into the United
                    Kingdom average in value about £1,000,000 yearly, the quantity imported in 1883
                    having been 588,309 cwt., valued at £1,057,934.</p>
