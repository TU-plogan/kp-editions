                    by piece, on separate looms would be a tedious and expensive process; yet for
                    ages such was the only method of making ribbons. The essential feature of a
                    ribbon loom is the simultaneous weaving in one loom frame of two or more webs,
                    going up to as many as forty narrow fabrics in modern looms. To effect the
                    conjoined throwing of all the shuttles and the various other movements of the
                    loom the automatic action of the power-loom is necessary; and it is a remarkable
                    fact that the self-acting ribbon loom was known and extensively used more than a
                    century before the famous invention of Cartwright. A loom in which several
                    narrow webs could be woven at one time is mentioned as having been working in
                    Dantzic towards the end of the 16th century. Similar looms were at work in
                    Leyden in 1620, where their use gave rise to so much discontent and rioting on
                    the part of the weavers that the states general had to prohibit their use. The
                    prohibition was renewed at various intervals throughout the century, and in the
                    same interval the use of the ribbon loom was interdicted in most of the
                    principal industrial centres of Europe. About 1676, under the name of the Dutch
                    loom or engine loom, it was brought to London; and, although its introduction
                    there caused some disturbance, it does not appear to have been prohibited. In
                    1745 the celebrated John Kay, the inventor of the fly-shuttle, obtained, con <pb

                    improvements in the ribbon loom; and since that period it has benefited by the
                    inventions applied to weaving machinery generally.</p>
                <p>Ribbon weaving is known to have been established near St Étienne (dep. Loire) so
                    early as the 11th century, and that town to the present day continues to be the
                    headquarters of the industry. In the time of Louis XIV. the ribbon trade there
                    gave employment to about 6000 persons; now about 17,000 looms are in operation
                    in the district, 1500 of which are power-looms in factories. Statistics compiled
                    in 1881 give the annual value of the trade at 63,400,000 francs, of which
                    45,000,000 francs was the value of ribbons proper, the remainder being
                    represented by scarfs, trimmings, elastic web, chenille, &amp;c. During the
                    Huguenot troubles, ribbon weavers from St Étienne settled at Basel and there
                    established an industry which now rivals that of the original seat of the trade.
                    In the Basel district the looms number 8000; but one-half of these are
                    power-looms in factories, which have a much greater productive capacity than the
                    domestic looms. Crefeld is the centre of the German ribbon industry, the
                    manufacture of black velvet ribbon being there a specialty. In Vienna about 2000
                    looms are employed. Next to St Étienne and Basel, Coventry is the most important
                    seat of ribbon making, and to some extent the industry is also prosecuted at
                    Norwich and Leicester. The average annual value of the ribbon trade of western
                    Europe and America is £16,000,000. A large proportion of the ribbons now made
                    are mixed fabrics of silk and cotton.</p>
