                    taken to Bristol, where he spent his youth. At a very early age he developed a
                    wonderful capacity for the acquisition of languages, soon becoming familiar not
                    only with Latin and Greek but also with Hebrew, Syriac, Persian, Turkish, and
                    other Eastern tongues. His unusual intelligence and extraordinary acquirements
                    in Oriental languages procured for him in 1803 a nomination to a writership in
                    the Bombay establishment of the East India Company. In 1804 Rich proceeded to
                    Constantinople, where, and at Smyrna, he stayed a considerable time, perfecting
                    himself in the Turkish language. Proceeding to Alexandria as assistant to the
                    British consul-general there, he devoted himself to Arabic and its various
                    dialects, and made himself master of Eastern manners and usages. On leaving
                    Egypt he proceeded by land to the Persian Gulf, disguised as a Mameluke,
                    visiting Damascus, and entering the great mosque undetected. At Bombay, which he
                    reached in September 1807, he was the guest of Sir James Mackintosh, whose
                    eldest daughter he married in January 1808, proceeding soon after to Baghdad as
                    resident. While gaining the respect of Turks of all classes, as well as of
                    Europeans, he now began his investigations into the geography, history, and
                    antiquities of the vastly interesting region in the midst of which he was
                    placed, the results of which give him a high place among Eastern students. He
                    made collections of all kinds, visited and examined the remains of Babylon, and
                    projected a geographical and statistical account of the pashalic of Baghdad. The
                    results of his investigations at Babylon appeared first in the Vienna serial the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mines dx l ’ Oment,</hi> and in 1811 in England, under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Narrative of a Journey to the Site of Babylon in
                    1811.</hi> In 1839 this was republished by his widow, with Major Rennell’s
                    remarks upon it, and a second memoir by Rich in reference to these remarks,
                    together with the narrative of a journey to Persepolis. In 1813-14 Rich spent
                    some time in Europe, and on his return to Baghdad paid special attention to the
                    geography of Asia Minor, and collected much information in Syrian and Chaldaean
                    convents concerning the Yezzidis. He continued, too, to collect manuscripts of
                    all kinds, his collections being probably the most extensive and valuable
                    brought together by any private person up to that time. His collection of
                    coins—Greek, Parthian, Sasanian, and Moslem—as well as of gems and engraved
                    stones, was much enlarged. During this period he made a second excursion to
                    Babylon, and in 1820 he undertook an extensive tour to Kurdistan—from Baghdad
                    north to Sulimania, eastward to Sinna, then west to Nineveh, and thence down the
                    Tigris to Baghdad. The narrative of this journey, which for the first time
                    furnished accurate knowledge (from scientific observation) regarding the
                    topography and geography of the region traversed, was published by his widow in
                    1836. It abounds with information on the country and the people, their history
                    and traditions, the ruins and inscriptions met with, characterized by the
                    profundity and thoroughness of the real scholar and trained observer. He visited
                    many of the ancient Christian churches in Chaldaea, adding largely to his stock
                    of manuscripts, including ancient Syrian and Chaldaean versions of the
                    Scriptures. In 1821 Rich went to Basora, whence he made an excursion to Shiraz,
                    visiting the ruins of Persepolis and the other remains of antiquity in the
                    neighbourhood. An account of these excursions is given in the posthumous
                    publication referred to, which also contains many notes on Rich’s collections
                    and minor excursions as well as a brief memoir. At Shiraz he was struck down by
                    cholera on October 5, 1821. His early death was a vast loss to Oriental
                    investigation. The work he did accomplish was of great value for Eastern
                    archaeology and history.</p>
