                    name, contained 18,571 inhabitants according to the census of 1881. It is
                    situated in the north-east of Italy, in 44º 25' N. 1at. and 12º 12' E. long.,
                    about 4 miles from the Adriatic, with which it is now connected by the Cor-sini
                    Canal, the two small rivers Ronco and Montone no longer serving as means of
                    communication between the city and the sea. A railway, 26 miles long, unites
                    Ravenna with Castel Bolognese on the line from Bologna to Rimini.</p>
                <p>Ravenna owes both its great historic importance in the past and its comparative
                    dulness and obscurity in the present to the same cause,—its position in an
                    alluvial plain, formed and continually extended by the deposits brought down by
                    a number of small and rapid streams from the neighbouring Apennines. Any one who
                    glances at a map of the north-western corner of the Adriatic will see at once
                    the general character of the coast,—broad lagunes sometimes stretching far
                    inland; flat alluvial plains intersected by endless dykes; numerous rivers (of
                    which the Po is by far the largest and makes the most conspicuous delta)
                    descending from the Apennines or the Alps; and, outside of all, a barrier of
                    islands which have a continual tendency to become adherent to the shore through
                    the new deposits which are brought down, and thus to be turned from islands into
                    low hills. This description suits Venice nearly as well as it suits Ravenna, and
                    the chief difference between these two great historic cities is that the lagunes
                    of Ravenna are about twenty centuries older than those of Venice.</p>
                <p>The one transcendent interest of Ravenna to a modern traveller consists in its
                    churches. No other city in the world offers so many and such striking examples
                    of the ecclesiastical architecture of the centuries from the 4th to the 8th. The
                    stylo is commonly called Byzantine, and no doubt from the close connexion of
                    Ravenna with Constantinople considerable influence was exerted by the latter
                    city on the former; but some of the most striking features of the churches of
                    Ravenna—the colonnades, the mosaics, perhaps the cupolas—are not so much
                    Byzantine as representative of early Christian art generally. It is truly said
                    by Mr Freeman:</p>
                <p>“The outside of a Ravennese basilica is an unadorned and unattractive pile of
                    brick. If it has any architectural grouping or outline about it, it owes it to
                    the campanile which a later age has added. But if the churches of Ravenna are
                    thus unattractive without, they are emphatically all glorious within. The eye
                    dwells with genuine artistic delight on the long unbroken rows of pillars and
                    arches, their marble shafts, their floriated capitals, sometimes the work of the
                    Christian craftsman, sometimes the spoils of heathendom pressed into the service
                    of the sanctuary. . . . The whole plan of these buildings allows a great field
                    for void spaces; but the void spaces thus left are filled up by these wonderful
                    mosaic paintings which look down upon us as fresh as they were thirteen hundred
                    years back.”</p>
                <p>Every traveller to Ravenna is impressed by the vividness of these decorations,
                    which were older when Giotto painted his first fresco than Giotto’s frescos are
                    now; but we can here only allude to the subject, referring the reader to the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mosaic</hi> (vol. xvi. p. 852 <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The cathedral (No. 1) has been so much modernized as to have lost its interest;
                    but the baptistery adjoining it, decorated by Bishops Neon and Maximian in the
                    δth and 6th centuries, an octagonal building with mosaics of the apostles on the
                    roof, is still unspoiled. SS. Nazario e Celso (No. 6) is a little building in
                    the form of a Latin cross, and is better known as the mausoleum of Galla
                    Placidia, whose tomb and those of three emperors, her husband, brother, and son,
                    are deposited here. It is surmounted with a cupola surrounded with four
                    semi-domes, on which are depicted figures of the Good Shepherd with His sheep,
                    of evangelists, prophets, &amp;c., and two stags drinking at a fountain. S.
                    Apollinare Nuovo (No. 10) has above the arches of the nave what is perhaps the
                    greatest triumph of mosaic art, two processions of virgins and of martyrs
                    marching, the former from the city of Classis, the latter from the palace of
                    Theodoric, to the Saviour. In the former group Christ sits upon the lap of His
                    mother, and the Magi are interposed between Him and the procession of virgins.
                    In the latter He is enthroned in glory and guarded by four ministrant angels. S.
                    Vitale (No. 11) is doubly interesting as having furnished the model after which
                    Charles the Great built his imperial minster at Aix-la-Chapelle and as
                    containing full-length contemporary portraits in mosaic of Justinian and
                    Theodora, surrounded by ecclesiastics, courtiers, and soldiers of the guard. It
                    is surmounted by a dome, is circular in form, and has eight apsidal chapels all
                    round it, one of which, corresponding to the choir in an ordinary church, is
                    prolonged to about four times the length of the other apses. Unfortunately, only
                    in this choir have the mosaics been preserved, but they are of the highest
                    possible interest. S. Apollinare in Classe (No. 13), once the centre of a busy
                    population of sailors, shopkeepers, and dock-labourers, now stands absolutely
                    alone in a wide and desolate expanse 2 miles from the sea. The decorations of
                    the church have suffered from damp —there are frequently some inches of water on
                    the pavement—but the twenty-four stately marble columns with Corinthian capitals
                    form a magnificent prelude to an apse covered with mosaics, among which is
                    conspicuous a great jewelled cross, symbolizing the Saviour on the Mount of
                    Transfiguration; Moses and Elias lean forth from the clouds on either side, and
                    in the valley below the apostles wait, represented symbolically as sheep. Many
                    mosaic portraits of bishops of Ravenna are on the walls of the church, and a
                    mosaic picture, representing Constantine Pogonatus and his brothers be-stowing a
                    privilegium on Bishop Reparatus about the year 670.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Strabo mentions a tradition that Ravenna was

                    and eventually departed, leaving the city to their allies. Throughout the valley
                    of the Po the Gauls took the place of the Etrurians as a conquering power; but
                    Ravenna may possibly have retained its Umbrian character until, about the year
                    191 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> by the conquest of the Boii the whole of
                    this region passed definitely under the dominion of Rome. Either as a colonia or
                    a municipium, Ravenna remained for more than two centuries an inconsiderable
                    city of Gallia Cis-alpina, chiefly noticeable as the place to which Caesar
                    during his ten years’ command in Gaul frequently resorted in order to confer
                    with his friends from Rome. At length under Augustus it suddenly rose into
                    importance, when that emperor selected it as the station for his fleet on “the
                    upper sea.” Two hundred and fifty ships, said Dion (in a lost passage quoted by
                    Jordanes), could ride at anchor in its harbour. Strabo, writing probably a few
                    years after Ravenna had been thus selected as a naval arsenal, gives us a
                    description of its appearance which certainly corresponds more closely with
                    modern Venice than with modern Ravenna. “It is the largest of all the cities
                    built in the lagunes, but entirely composed of wooden houses, penetrated in all
                    directions by canals, wherefore bridges and boats are needed for the wayfarer.
                    At the flow of the tide a large part of the sea comes sweeping into it, and
                    thus, while all the muddy deposit of the rivers is swept away, the malaria is at
                    the same time removed, and by this means the city enjoys so good a sanitary
                    reputation that the Government has fixed on it as a place for the reception and
                    training of gladiators.” On the other hand, good water was proverbially
                    difficult to obtain at Ravenna,—dearer than wine, says Martial, who has two
                    epigrams on the subject. And Sidonius, writing in the 5th century, complains
                    bitterly of the “feculent gruel” <hi rend="italic">(cloacalis puls)</hi> which
                    filled the canals of the city, and which gave forth fetid odours when stirred by
                    the poles of the bargemen. The port of Ravenna, situated about 3 miles from the
                    city, was named Classis. A long line of houses called Caesarea connected it with
                    Ravenna, and in process of time there was such a continuous series of buildings
                    that the three towns seemed like one.</p>
                <p>The great historical impoi־tance of Ravenna begins early in the 5th century, when
                    Honorius, alarmed by the progress of Alaric in the north of Italy, transferred
                    his court to the city in the lagunes. From this date (c. 402) to the fall of the
                    Western empire in 476 Ravenna was, though not the exclusive, the chief residence
                    of the Roman emperors and the centre of the elaborate machinery of the state.
                    Here Stilicho was slain; here Honorius and his sister Placidia caressed and
                    quarrelled; here Valentinian III. spent the greater part of his useless life;
                    here Majorian w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as proclaimed; here the Little
                    Romulus donned his purple robe; here in the pine-wood <note anchored="true"

                    Odoacer. Through all these changes Ravenna maintained its character as an
                    impregnable “city in the sea,” not easily to be attacked even by a naval power
                    on account of the shallowness and devious nature of the channels by which it had
                    to be approached. On becoming supreme ruler of Italy Odoacer, like the emperors
                    who had gone before him, made Ravenna his chief place of residence, and here
                    after thirteen years of kingship he shut himself up when Theodoric the Ostrogoth
                    had invaded Italy and defeated him in two battles. Theodorie’s siege of Ravenna
                    lasted for three years (489-492) and was marked by one bloody encounter in the
                    pine-wood on the east of it. The Ostrogoth collected a fleet and established a
                    severe blockade, which at length caused Odoacer to surrender the city. The
                    terms, arranged through the intervention of John, archbishop of Ravenna, were
                    not observed by Theodoric, who, ten days after his entry into the city, slew his
                    rival at a banquet in the palace of the Laurel Grove (15th March 493). Ravenna
                    was Theodoric’s chief place of residence, and the thirty-three years of the
                    reign of the great Ostrogoth (493-526) may probably be considered the time of
                    its greatest splendour. In the eastern part of the city he built for himself a
                    large palace, which probably occupied about a sixth of the space now enclosed
                    within the city walls, or nearly the whole of the rectangle enclosed by Strada
                    di Porta Alberoni on the south, Strada Nuova di Porta Serrata on. the west, and
                    the line of the city walls on the north and east. There still remains close to
                    the first-named street and fronting the Corso Garibaldi a high wall built of
                    square Roman bricks, with pillars and arched recesses in the upper portion,
                    which goes by the name of Palazzo di Teodorico. Freeman, on account of the
                    Romanesque character of the architecture, thinks it probable that it really
                    belongs to the time of the Lombard kings; but at any rate it is of the very
                    early mediré val period, and it marks the spot where part of the Ostrogothic
                    palace once stood. A more memorable and clearly authentic monument of Theodoric
                    is furnished by his tomb, a massive mausoleum in the style of the tomb of
                    Hadrian at Rome, which stands still perfect outside the walls near the
                    north-east corner of the city. It is of circular shape and surmounted by an
                    enormous monolith, brought from the quarries of Istria and weighing more than
                    300 tons. In this mausoleum Theodoric was buried, but his body was cast forth
                    from it, perhaps during the troublous times of the siege of Ravenna by the
                    imperial troops, and the Rotunda (as it is now generally called) was converted
                    into a church dedicated to the Virgin.</p>
                <p>“ [The] immemorial wood Rooted where once the Adrian wave flowed o’er,” is
                    probably true; but there is no evidence that it was in historic time that this
                    change took place. Our conjecture is that the <hi rend="italic">Pineta</hi> grew
                    on a large peninsula somewhat resembling the Lido of Venice.</p>
                <p>Nine years after the death of Theodoric Justinian sent an army to Italy,
                    nominally in order to avenge the murder of Theodoric’s daughter Amalasuntlia,
                    but in fact to destroy the Gothic monarchy and restore Italy to the empire. Long
                    after the Goths had lost Rome they still clung to Ravenna, till at length, weary
                    of the feebleness and ill-success of their own kin״, Vitiges, and struck with
                    admiration of their heroic conqueror, they offered to transfer their allegiance
                    to Belisarius on condition of his assuming the diadem of the Western empire.
                    Belisarius dallied with the proposal until he had obtained an entrance for
                    himself and his troops within the walls of the capital, and then threw off the
                    mask and proclaimed his inviolable fidelity to Justinian. Thus in the year 540
                    was Ravenna re-united to the Roman empire. Its connexion with that empire—or, in
                    other words, its dependence upon Constantinople—lasted for more than 200 years,
                    during which period, under the rule of Narses and his successors the exarchs,
                    Ravenna was the seat of Byzantine dominion in Italy. In 728 the Lombard king
                    Luitprand took the suburb Classis; about 752 the city itself fell into the hands
                    of his successor Aistulf, from whom a few years after it was wrested by Pippin,
                    king of the Franks. By this time the former splendour of the city had probably
                    in great measure departed; the alteration of the coast-line and the filling up
                    of the lagunes which make it now practically an inland city had probably
                    commenced, and no historical importance attaches to its subsequent fortunes. It
                    formed part of the Frankish king’s donation to the pope in the middle of the 8th
                    century. It was an independent republic, generally taking the Guelf side in the
                    13th century, subject to rulers of the house of Polentani in the 14th, Venetian
                    in the 15th (1441), and papal again in the 16th,—Pope Julius II. having
                    succeeded in wresting it from the hands of the Venetians. From this time (1509)
                    down to our own days, except for the interruptions caused by the wars of the
                    French Revolution, Ravenna continued subject to the papal see and was governed
                    by a cardinal legate. In 1859 it w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as one of the
                    first cities to give its vote in favour of Italian unity, and it has since then
                    formed a part of the kingdom of Italy.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the period thus rapidly sketched Charles the Great visited
                    the city and carried off the brazen statue of Theodoric and the marble columns
                    of his palace to his own new palace at Aix-la-Chapelle. More than five centuries
                    later (1320) Dante became the guest of Guido Novello di Polenta, lord of
                    Ravenna, and here he died on the 14th September of the following year. The
                    marble urn containing the body of the poet still rests at Ravenna, where what
                    Byron calls “a little cupola more neat than solemn” has been erected over it. In
                    1512 the French army under Gaston de Foix fought a fierce báttle with the
                    Spanish, Venetian, and papal troops on the banks of the Ronco about 2 miles from
                    Ravenna. The French were victorious, but Gaston fell in the act of pursuing the
                    enemy. His death is commemorated by the Colonna dei Frances! erected on the spot
                    where he fell. Lord Byron resided at Ravenna for eighteen months in 1820-21,
                    attracted by the charms of the countess Guiccioli.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi> The most important authority for the history
