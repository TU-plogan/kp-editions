                <p>was a “dirty old blackguard” who liked filth and wallowed in it from choice, that
                    hardly needs comment. His errors in this way are of course, looked at from an
                    absolute standard, unpardonable. But judged relatively there are several, we
                    shall not say excuses, but explanations of them. In the first place, the
                    comparative indecency of Rabelais has been much exaggerated by persons
                    unfamiliar with early French literature. The form of his book was above all
                    tilings popular, and the popular French literature of the Middle Ages as
                    distinguished from the courtly and literary literature, which was singularly
                    pure, can hardly be exceeded in point of coarseness. The <hi rend="italic"

                    >Audigicr</hi> class, the farces of the 15th century, equal (the grotesque
                    iteration and amplification which is the note of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gargantua</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pantagruel</hi> being allowed for, and
                    sometimes without that allowance) the coarsest passages of Rabelais. His
                    coarseness, moreover, disgusting as it is, has nothing of the corruption of
                    refined voluptuousness about it, and nothing of the sniggering indecency which
                    disgraces men like Pope, like Voltaire, and like Sterne. It shows in its author
                    a want of reverence, a want of decency in the proper sense, a too great
                    readiness to condescend to the easiest kind of ludicrous ideas and the kind most
                    acceptable at that time to the common run of mankind. The general taste having
                    been considerably refined since, Rabelais has in parts become nearly unreadable,
                    —the worst and most appropriate punishment for his faults. As for those who have
                    tried to make his indecency an argument for his laxity in religious principle,
                    that argument, like another mentioned previously, hardly needs discussion. It is
                    notoriously false as a matter of experience. Rabelais could not have written as
                    he has written in this respect and in others if he had been an earnestly pious
                    person, taking heed to every act and word, and studious equally not to offend
                    and not to cause offence. But no one in his senses would dream of claiming any
                    such character for him.</p>
                <p>This brings us to the last point—what his religious opinions were. He has been
                    claimed as a freethinker of all shades, from undogmatic theism to atheism, and
                    as a concealed Protestant. The last of these claims has now been very generally
                    given up, and indeed Erasmus might quite as reasonably be claimed for the
                    Reformation as Rabelais. Both disliked and attacked the more crying abuses of
                    their church, and both at the time and since have been disliked and attacked by
                    the more imprudent partisans of that church. But Rabelais, in his own way, held
                    off from the Reformation even more distinctly than Erasmus did. The accusation
                    of freethinking, if not of directly anti-Christian thinking, has always been
                    more common and has recently found much favour. It is, however, remarkable that
                    those who hold this opinion never give chapter and verse for it, and it may be
                    said confidently that chapter and verse cannot be given. The sayings attributed
                    to Rabelais which colour the idea (such as the famous “Je vais chercher un grand
                    peut-être,” said to have been uttered on his death-bed) are, as has been said,
                    purely apocryphal. In the book itself nothing of the kind is to be found.
                    Perhaps the nearest approach to it is a jest at the Sorbonne couched in the
                    Pauline phrase about “the evidence of things not seen,” which the author removed
                    from the later editions. But irreverences of this kind, as well as the frequent
                    burlesque citations of the Bible, whether commendable or not, had been, were,
                    have since been, and are common in writers whose orthodoxy is unquestioned; and
                    it must be remembered that the later Middle Age, which in many respects Rabelais
                    represents almost more than he does the Renaissance, was, with all its
                    unquestioning faith, singularly reckless and, to our fancy, irreverent in its
                    use of the sacred words and images, which were to it the most familiar of all
                    images and words. On the other hand, there are in the book, in the description
                    of Gargantua’s and Pantagruel’s education, in the sketch of the abbey of
                    Thelema, in several passages relating to Pantagruel, expressions which either
                    signify a sincere and unfeigned piety of a simple kind or else are inventions of
                    the most detestable hypocrisy. For these passages are not, like many to be found
                    from the Renaissance to the end of the 18th century, obvious flags of truce to
                    cover attacks,—mere bowings in the house of Rimmon to prevent evil consequences.
                    There is absolutely no sign of the tongue in the cheek. They are always written
                    in the author’s highest style, a style perfectly eloquent and unaffected; they
                    can only be interpreted (on the free-thinking hypothesis) as allegorical with
                    the greatest difficulty and obscurity, and it is pretty certain that no one
                    reading the book without a thesis to prove would dream of taking them in a
                    nonnatural sense. It is not, indeed, to be contended that Rabelais was a man
                    with whom religion was in detail a constant thought, that he had a very tender
                    conscience or a very scrupulous orthodoxy. His form of religious sentiment was
                    not evangelical or mystical, any more than it was ascetic or ceremonial or
                    dogmatic. As regards one of the accepted doctrines of his own church, the
                    excellence of the celibate life, of poverty, and of elaborate obedience to a
                    rule, he no doubt was a strong dissident; but the evidence that, as a Christian,
                    he was unorthodox, that he was even an heretical or latitudinarian thinker in
                    regard to those doctrines which the various Christian churches have in common,
                    is not merely weak, it is</p>
