                    province his family belonged. He entered a cavalry regiment in 1784 and served
                    under Joseph II. and Laudon against the Turks in 1788 and 1789. In 1793 his
                    regiment was sent to the lower Rhine, and from this time onwards Radetzky was
                    engaged in the wars which were continued (with intermission) between Austria and
                    France for the next twenty years. In 1796 he was adjutant to General Beaulieu,
                    over whom Bonaparte won his first victories in Italy. In 1799, when the
                    Austrians with Suwaroffs help reconquered Northern Italy, he distinguished
                    himself at the battles of Novi and the Trebbia, displaying, according to the
                    despatches of General Mêlas, great presence of mind in the midst of extreme
                    danger. After the defeat of Marengo he was removed from Italy to Germany, and
                    there took part in the still more disastrous engagement of Hohenlinden. In 1805
                    Radetzky, now major-general, was back in Italy, serving under the archduke
                    Charles in the successful campaign of Caldiero, the fruits of which were lost by
                    Mack’s capitulation at Ulm and the fall of Vienna. In 1809 he fought at Wagram.
                    In 1813, when all the great powers of Europe combined against Napoleon, Radetzky
                    was chief of the staff under Schwarzenberg, the Austrian commander-in-chief of
                    the allied forces, and he now gained a reputation outside his own country. The
                    plan of the battle of Leipsic is said to have been in great part Radetzky’s
                    work, and in this engagement he was wounded. He entered Paris with the allied
                    sovereigns in March 1814, and returned with them to the congress of Vienna,
                    where he appears to have acted as an intermediary between Metternich and the
                    czar Alexander, when these great personages were not on speaking terms. During
                    the succeeding years of peace he disappeared from the public view and narrowly
                    escaped being pensioned off in 1829. The insurrection of the Papal Legations in
                    1831 brought him, however, into active service again; and on the retirement of
                    General Frimont he was placed in command of all the Austrian forces in Italy,
                    receiving in 1836 the dignity of field-marshal. Radetzky was now seventy years
                    old, but twelve more years were to pass before the really historical part of his
                    career opened. When he was eighty-two the revolution of 1848 broke out. Milan
                    rose in insurrection against its Austrian rulers, and after a struggle of five
                    days Radetzky was forced to evacuate the city. Unable to retain any hold on
                    Lombardy, he concentrated his troops at Verona, the fortifications of which were
                    to a great extent his own creation. Charles Albert, king of Sardinia, now
                    declared war upon Austria, occupied Milan, and laid siege to Peschiera.
                    Radetzky, after the arrival of reinforcements, moved southwards to Mantua, and
                    attempted from that point to turn the Sardinian flank; he was, however, defeated
                    on the Mincio, and Peschiera fell into the enemy’s hands. Radetzky,
                    nevertheless, was secure in the possession of Verona and Mantua; and, after
                    being still further reinforced, he resumed the offensive in July, defeated the
                    Sardinians at Cus-tozza and in several other encounters, and advanced
                    victoriously upon Milan, where, on 6th August, an armistice was concluded, the
                    Sardinian army retiring behind the Ticino. During the succeeding months, while
                    Vienna and the central provinces of the Austrian empire appeared likely to fall
                    into anarchy, Radetzky’s army remained firm in its loyalty to the old order of
                    things, and declined to enter <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0229-0212"/>into relations with the democratic leaders. It was
                    in fact at this time the mainstay of the house of Hapsburg, while everything
                    around the central government tottered; and, when the restoration of authority
                    began, and the young emperor Francis Joseph ascended the throne that had been
                    vacated by his imbecile predecessor, Radetzky gave to the new monarch the
                    prestige of a crushing victory over his Italian enemies. The armistice was
                    denounced by Charles Albert on the 12th of March 1819. On the 20th Radetzky
                    crossed the Ticino at Pavia, and on the 23d he annihilated the Italian army at
                    Novara. Peace followed this brief and decisive campaign, and for the next eight
                    years Radetzky governed upper Italy. He retired from service in 1857, and died
                    at the age of ninety-two in the following year. Radetzky was idolized by the
                    Austrian army, but his reputation as a general has not survived him.</p>
