                    of Tyrol. Before their subjugation by Rome the Rhaetians are described as one of
                    the most powerful and warlike of the Alpine tribes; but little or nothing is
                    known as to their origin and history. It is indeed stated distinctly by Livy (v.
                    33) that they were of Etruscan origin, and a tradition reported by Justin (xx.
                    5) and Pliny (∕∕.A <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ., iii. 24, 133) affirmed that
                    they were a portion of that people who had been settled in the plains of the Po
                    and were driven into the mountains by the irruption of the Gauls, when they
                    assumed the name of Rhaetians from a leader of the name of Rhaetus. Very little
                    value can, however, be attached to such traditions, and the attempts of some
                    modern writers to support them by philological researches have led to no
                    satisfactory result. But the ethnical connexion of the Rhaetians with the
                    Etruscans has been accepted by Niebuhr, and its general reception by the Romans
                    would seem to prove that they were a distinct race from their neighbours the
                    Ligurians as well as from the Gauls and Germans.</p>
                <p>The name of the Rhaetians is first mentioned by Polybius, but merely
                    incidentally, and they played no part in Roman history till after the fall of
                    the republic. It is certain, however, that they continued virtually independent
                    until Augustus undertook their subjugation, in common with that of the
                    neighbouring Alpine tribes bordering upon Italy. The importance he attached to
                    this task is shown by his having deputed its execution to his two step-sons,
                    Drusus and Tiberius, who in a single campaign reduced them all to subjection (15
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), so that their territory was shortly after
                    incorporated as a province in the Roman empire and their name never again
                    appears in history. The exploits of the imperial youths on this occasion have
                    been immortalized in two well-known odes of Horace <hi rend="italic">(Od.,</hi>
                    iv. 4 and 14). In the time of Strabo their territory was considered as extending
                    from the Lakes of Como and Garda to that of Constance (the Lacus Brigantinus),
                    while the allied people of the Vindelici, who had shared in their <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0522-0505"/>contest against the Roman arms, as well as in
                    their final subjugation, extended down the northern slope of the Alps as far as
                    the Danube. By far the greater part of this extensive region was occupied by
                    rugged mountains, the inhabitants of which, when compelled to abandon their
                    predatory habits, subsisted principally upon the produce of their flocks. Some
                    of the valleys, however, which extended on the south side down to the plains of
                    Italy, were rich and fertile, and produced excellent wine, which was considered
                    equal to any of those grown in Italy itself. The most important of these valleys
                    λvas that of the Adige, which descends from the high Alps adjoining the Brenner
                    to Verona; of this the upper portions were held by the Breuni, whose name is
                    still perpetuated in that of the Brenner, while the lower and more fertile
                    region was occupied by the Tridentini, whose chief town of Tridentum was the
                    same as the now celebrated city of Trent. The next people towards the west were
                    the Triumpilini, in the valley still known as Val Trompia; the Camuni in Val
                    Camonica; the Orobii, who appear to have occupied the Val Tellina and adjoining
                    districts; and the Lepontii, between the Lago Maggiore and the Pennine Alps. The
                    tribes in the interior and heart of the mountain ranges cannot be for the most
                    part assigned to definite localities. The Genauni, mentioned by Horace as well
                    as by Strabo, are supposed to have occupied the Val di Non, and the Vennones or
                    Venostes the lofty ranges near the source of the Adige.</p>
                <p>The boundaries of the Roman province were repeatedly changed. At first it appears
                    to have comprised all Vinde-licia, so as to have extended to the Danube from its
                    sources to its confluence with the Inn, which constituted its eastern boundary
                    on the side of Noricum. But at a later period this northern tract was separated
                    from the central mountain region, and the two were named Rhaetia Prima and
                    Rhaetia Secunda, in which form they appear in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notitia.</hi> At the same time the southern valleys were gradually incorporated
                    with Italy and assigned to the territory of the neighbouring municipal towns.
                    Thus Tridentum, which was originally a Rhaetian town, came to be included in
                    Venetia, and is ass.igned by Pliny to the tenth region of Italy. The only
                    important town in the northern part of the province was the Roman colony of
                    Augusta Vindelicorum, which still retains the name of Augsburg. The same is the
                    case with Curia, now Chur or Coire, the capital of the Grisons, and Brigantia
                    (Bregenz), which gave name in ancient times to the lake now called the Lake of
                    Constance.</p>
                <p>The province of Rhaetia was traversed by two great lines of Roman roads,—the one
                    leading from Verona and Tridentum (Trent) across the pass of the Brenner to
                    Innsbruck (Pons Oeni), and thence to Augsburg (Augusta Vindelicorum), and the
                    other from Bregenz on the Lake of Constance, by Coire and Chiavenna, to Como and
                    Milan.</p>
