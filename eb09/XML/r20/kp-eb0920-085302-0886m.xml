                    comprehends 2,003,065 acres, of which only about 220,280 acres are included in
                    Cromarty. Its length from east to west is 67 miles, and from north to south 58
                    miles. The area of the islands is 437,221 acres. Ross includes the northern part
                    Of Lewis (see vol. xiv. p. 492), and other ten islands of the Hebrides, of which
                    eight only were inhabited in 1881 /nine in 1871). The outline of Ross and
                    Cromarty is very irregular, and both east and west coasts are much indented by
                    bays and inland lochs, but except in the more inland recesses of these inlets
                    the coast scenery is comparatively tame and uninteresting. The Moray Firth, an
                    extension of Loch Beauly, separates the county from Xairn; the northern shore of
                    the peninsula of the Black Isle is washed by Cromarty Firth, including the Bay
                    of Xigg and extending from Dingwall to the headlands known as the Sutors of
                    Cromarty; and the extreme northern coast is bounded by the Dornoch Firth, an
                    extension of the river Oykel. On the west coast the inlets are for the most part
                    long, narrow, and irregular, the principal being Loch Broom, Little Loch Broom,
                    Lochs Gruinard, Ewe, Torridon, Carron, and Alsh.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Suifiace and Geology.—</hi> In the north-west of Ross the
                    Arehaean series of rocks, consisting of gneisses, schists, and other crystalline
                    rocks, are well developed. Above them rest Unconformably red conglomerates and
                    sandstones of Cambrian age, rising into the picturesque mountains which form
                    such a striking feature of the scenery of western Ross. Farther east they are
                    overlaid uncon-formably by the quartzites and limestones belonging to the Lower
                    Silurian division. Over these, by enormous terrestrial displacement, the
                    Arehaean and Cambrian rocks have been pushed, sometimes for a horizontal
                    distance of ten miles. New crystalline structures have been superinduced upon
                    all the rocks affected by these movements, and the resulting crystalline schists
                    may consist of what originally were Arehaean, Cambrian, or Silurian rocks of
                    ordinary types. In their present condition, however, these eastern schists are
                    certainly later than the older part of the Silurian system. They cover by far
                    the larger part of the two counties. Along the east coast they are Unconformably
                    covered by the Old Red Sandstone formation. Rocks of Jurassic (Oolitic) age
                    fringe the eastern shores. In the Black Isle peninsula they include a thin coal
                    seam. Near the Sutors of Cromarty they abound in ammonites, belemnites, and
                    other shells, and in the remains of various woods and ferns. Ironstone, chiefly
                    in the form of bog iron ore, is found in considerable quantities. Of the various
                    mineral springs the best known is that of Strathpeffer, characterized chiefly by
                    sulphuretted hydrogen gas and various salts. The surface consists principally of
                    lofty mountain groups, intersected by comparatively narrow valleys, occupied
                    partly by Iakesand rivers; but in the east there is a considerable extent of
                    comparatively level ground. A large number of the mountains are over 3000 feet
                    in height, the highest summits being Carn Eige (3877 feet) and Mam Soul (3862)
                    on the borders of Inverness, while An Riabhachan, wholly within Ross, has a
                    height of 3696 feet, and Sgurr Mor of 3657 feet. Ben Wyvis, remarkable for its
                    immense isolated bulk, has a height of 3429 feet, and another w <hi
                    rend="superscript">τ</hi> ell-known mountain, Ben Attow, attains 3383 feet. A
                    mere fraction of the western district of Ross is under IOOO feet in height. The
                    principal rivers are the Oykel, which, rising in Sutherland, forms for about 20
                    miles the boundary with Ross, from w ’ hich near its mouth it receives the
                    Carron; the Conan, falling into Cromarty Firth; and the Carron, flowing
                    south-west into Loch Carron. Besides Loch Maree (area 7090 acres), which is
                    dominated by the imposing mass of Ben Slioch (3217 feet) on the north, the
                    principal freshwater lakes are Lochs Fannich, Fuir, Luichart, and Glass; but in
                    addition to these there are over a dozen of considerable size, besides a large
                    number of smaller ones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soiland Agriculture.—</hi> The most fertile part of the
                    Countiesis the eastern district, especially that included in the peninsulas of
                    the Black Isle and Easter Ross, the soil varying from a light sandy gravel to a
                    rich deep loam. In this district agriculture is quite as advanced as in any
                    other part of Scotland. In the valleys and along the shores of the western coast
                    there are many patches of good soil, but, partly on account of the excessive
                    rainfall, tillage is not prosecuted with the same enterprise as in the eastern
                    districts. On the higher grounds there is a large extent of good pasturage for
                    sheep. . According to the agricultural statistics for 1885 the total area in
                    Ross and Cromarty under crops, bare fallow, and grass was 134,399 acres, of
                    which 47,639 acres were under grain crops, 26,496 under green crops, 40,819
                    rotation grasses, 19,075 permanent pasture, and 370 fallow. The area under wheat
                    has been gradually diminishing, being 9715 acres in 1857 and only 1185 in 1885,
                    while that under barley on the other hand has increased from 6435 acres to
                    13,681, and that under oats from 16,256 to 31,685. The area under potatoes has
                    also doubled, in the earlier year being only 4471, while in 1885 it was 8982.
                    The area under turnips has increased from 12,228 to 16,557 and that under
                    rotation grasses from 20,869 to 40,819. Horses, principally half-breeds between
                    the old “garrons” and Clydesdales, numbered 7365 in 1885, of which 5874 were
                    used solely for purposes of agriculture; cattle numbered 42,976, of which 17,811
                    were cows and heifers in milk or in calf, and 17,561 under two years old. They
                    are principally the native 1 Iighland breed or crosses. Sheep in 1885 numbered
                    309,590, of which 213,522 were one year old and above. Besides black-faced,
                    crosses with Leicesters and crosses between Leicesters and Cheviots are not
                    uncommon. There is still in Ross and Cromarty a considerable extent of native
                    woodland, the trees being principally firs, oaks, ash, and alder. The area under
                    woods in 1881 was 43,201 acres. The red and roe deer have free scope on the
                    extensive mountain regions, the area under deer forests being 719,305 acres.
                    Foxes, badgers, wild cats, alpine hares, and other wild animals abound. The
                    usual varieties of winged game are plentiful. The golden eagle and osprey are
                    both common, as well as many other birds of prey. Waterfowl of all kinds abound
                    in the extensive sea lochs, and the rivers and inland lochs are specially
                    abundant in trout and salmon. The pearl mussel is found in the bed of the river
                    Conan.</p>
                <p>According to the latest Landowners’ Return, 2043 proprietors possessed 1,971,682
                    acres in the county of Ross, of a gross annual value of £269,342. The owners of
                    less than one acre numbered 1719. The following owned more than 100,000
                    acres:—Sir James AIatheson, 406,070; Alex. Matheson, 220,433; Sir Kenneth S.
                    Mackenzie, 164,680; the duchess of Sutherland, 149,879; and Sir C. W. A. Ross,
                    110,445. ForCromarty separately the Return gives 231 owners, possessing 18,206
                    acres, of £11,966 annual value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade.—</hi> With the exception of
                    distillation, there are no important manufactures within the counties, although
                    home-made woollen cloth is woven in the country districts. The counties depend
                    chiefly on their agriculture and their fishing, which within recent years has
                    greatly developed through improved means of communication with the south.
                    Stornoway and the west coast have regular communication by steamers with
                    Glasgow, and on the east coast a steamer leaves Cromarty and Invergordon for
                    Aberdeen and Leith once a week. Fish, cattle, and sheep are the principal
                    exports. The Highland Railway skirts the Firth of Cromarty by Dingwall and Tain
                    to Bonar Bridge, a branch passing from Dingwall south-westwards to Strome Ferry,
                    whence there is communication with Skye by steamer. Salmon fishing is
                    extensively carried on in the bays and mouths of the rivers, and the deep-sea
                    fishings for herring, and for cod and other large fish, are among the most
                    important in Scotland. They include the districts of Cromarty on the east coast,
                    of Stornoway in Lewis, of Loch Broom and part of Loch Carron on the west coast,
                    the remainder of the Loch Carron district being in Inverness-shire. The Broad
                    Bay of Stornoway is famed for its flounders.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">AdministrationaiulPopulatim.—</hi> The two counties of Ross and
                    Cromarty form one sheriffdom, and return one member to parliament. The burghs of
                    Cromarty, Dingwall, Fortrose, and Tain are included in the Wick district of
                    burghs, which returns one member. From 56,318 in 1801 the population of Ross and
                    Cromarty had increased in 1841 to 78,685, and in 1871 to 80,955; in 1881 it was
                    78,547 (37,027 males and 41,520 females), of whom 56,086 were Gaelic-speaking.
                    It is the fourth most thinly populated county in Scotland, the number of persons
                    to the square mile being 25. The island population amounted to 23,960, of whom
                    23,149 were in Lewis. The town and village population amounted to 28,665, and
                    the rural to 49,882. The police burghs arc Cromarty (population 1352), Dingwall,
                    which is also a royal burgh (1921), Fortrose (869), Invergordon (1092),
                    Stornoway (2627), and Tain (1742). There are thirty-one entire parishes, and
                    parts of two others.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Ross proper, possessed by the
                    Rosses, originally only included the district adjoining the Dornoch and AIoray
                    Firths. The first who bore the title of earl of Ross was AIalcolm Macbeth, upon
                    whom it was bestowed by AIalcolm IV. After his rebellion in 1179 there was a
                    period of chronic insurrection. By Alexander II. the earldom was bestowed on
                    Fearchar AIac an t-Sagairt (the son of the priest), who being abbot of
                    Apple-cross had already possession of the western district. William, fourth
                    carl, was present with his clan at the battle of Bannockburn. The earldom
                    reverted to the crown in 1424, and James I. restored it to the heiress of the
                    line, the mother of Alexander, Lord of the Isles (see Hebkides, vol. xi. 607).
                    The lands of the earldom were in 1481 conferred on PrinceJames, second son of
                    James III., who in 1478 had been created duke of Ross. Ross was constituted a
                    county in 1661, but the sheriffdom of Cromarty is of more ancient date. At
                    Invercarron AIontrose was totally defeated by Colonel Strachan, 27th April 1650;
                    and at Glenshiel, Ilth June 1718, General Wight-man defeated the Jacobites.

                    blown down in a storm in 1847 and broken into three pieces; a smaller one at
                    Nigg churchyard, struck down by the fall of the belfry in 1725, has been
                    re-erected and fenced round; and the third, which formerly stood at Cadboll of
                    Hilltown has been removed for· preservation to the grounds of Invergordon
                    Castle. An ancient vitrified fort, 420 feet by 120, crowns the Iiillof
                    Knockfarrel in Fodderty parish. Among old castles are those of Lochslin, in the
                    parish of Fearn, said to date from the 13th century, which, though very ruinous,
                    still possesses tλvo square towers in good preservation; Balone, in the parish
                    of Tarbat, said to have been built by the earls of Ross; and the remains of
                    Dingwall Castle, the earls of Ross’s original seat. Of the abbey of Fearn,

                    abbot the Reformer Patrick Hamilton, the abbey church, much altered, is still
                    used as the parish church. There are a very large number of fine modern
