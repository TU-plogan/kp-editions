                    miles north-north-west), Niort, and Saintes. There are both a naval and a
                    commercial harbour. The former has the advantage of deep anchorage well
                    protected by batteries at the mouth of the river, and the roadstead is perfectly
                    safe. The windings of the channel, however, between Rochefort and the sea, and
                    the bar at the entrance render navigation dangerous. This harbour and arsenal,
                    which are separated from the town by a line of fortifications with three gates,
                    contain large covered building yards (where eighteen vessels of the first class
                    may be upon the stocks at once), eleven slips, three repairing docks, and on the
                    right bank of the Charente in the Gardette meadows a large timber basin capable
                    of floating 1,766,000 cubic feet of timber. Besides the various establishments
                    implied in the name, the arsenal is the seat of a ropewalk dating from 1666, a
                    school of navigation and pilotage, a signal-tower 98 feet high (once attached to
                    a church), the offices of the maritime prefecture, the navy commissariat, a park
                    of artillery, and various boards of direction connected with the navy. About
                    5000 or 6000 men are usually employed in the arsenal. Other Government
                    establishments at Rochefort are barracks for infantry, artillery, and marines, a
                    provision factory, and the naval hospital· (800 beds) and school of medicine. In
                    the grounds of this last institution is an artesian well, sunk in 1862-66 to a
                    depth of 2800 feet and yielding water at a temperature of 107° Fahr. The
                    commercial harbour, higher up the river than the naval harbour, has two basins
                    with an aggregate area of 5 acres and 3400 feet of quays, and a third basin is
                    being constructed (1885) 25 acres in extent with 3800 feet of quays, capable of
                    admitting large vessels on every day of the year. The town has good public and
                    botanic gardens, and the Place Colbert contains an allegorical group
                    representing the ocean and the Charente mingling their waters. Besides
                    shipbuilding, which forms the staple industry of Rochefort, sailcloth and
                    furniture are the local manufactures, and hemp for cordage is grown in the
                    vicinity. Along with Tonnay-Charente, 4 miles higher up, Rochefort has a trade
                    in brandies, salt, grain, flour, cattle, horses, fish, colonial wares, timber,
                    and coal. There is regular steamboat communication with the United Kingdom. In
                    1882 285 vessels (128,570 tons) entered and 270 (123,501) cleared. The
                    population of the town was 26,022 in 1881 (27,854 in the commune).</p>
                <p>The lordship of Rochefort, held by powerful nobles as early as the 11th century,
                    was united to the French crown by Philip the Fair in 1303; but it was
                    alternately seized in the course of the Hundred Years’ War by the English and
                    the French, and in the wars of religion by the Catholics and Protestants.
                    Colbert having in 1665 chosen Rochefort as the seat of a repairing port between
                    Brest and the Gironde, the town rapidly increased in importance: by 1674 it had
                    20,000 inhabitants; and, when the Dutch admiral Tromp appeared at the mouth of
                    the river with seventy-two vessels for the purpose of destroying the new
                    arsenal, he found the approaches so well defended that he gave up his
                    enterprise. It λvas at Rochefort that the naval school now transferred to Brest
                    was originally founded. The town continued to flourish in the later part of the
                    17th century. In 1690 and in 1703 it escaped from the attempts made by the
                    English to destroy it. Its fleet under the command of La Galissonnière, a native
                    of the place, did distinguished service in the wars of American independence,
                    the republic, and the empire. But the destruction of the French fleet by the
                    English in 1809 in the roadstead of lie d’Aix, the preference accorded to the
                    harbours of Brest and Toulon, and the unhealthiness of its climate have
                    seriously interfered with the prosperity of the place. The convict establishment
                    founded at Rochefort in 1777 was suppressed in 1852.</p>
