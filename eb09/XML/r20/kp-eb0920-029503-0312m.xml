                <p><label type="entry">RAVEN</label> (Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">Hrsefn,</hi>
                    Icelandic <hi rend="italic">Hrafn,</hi> Danish <hi rend="italic">Ravn,</hi>
                    Dutch <hi rend="italic">Raaf</hi> , German <hi rend="italic">Rabe),</hi> the
                    largest of the Birds of the Order <hi rend="italic">Passeres ·,</hi> and, as
                    already shewn <hi rend="smallcaps">(Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 49),
                    probably the most highly developed of all Birds.</p>
                <p>Quick-sighted, sagacious, and bold, it must have followed the prehistoric fisher
                    and hunter, and generally without molestation from them, to prey on the refuse
                    of their spoils, just as it now waits, with the same intent, on the movements of
                    their successors; while it must have likewise attended the earliest herdsmen,
                    who could not have regarded it with equal indifference, since its now notorious
                    character for attacking and putting to death a weakly animal was doubtless in
                    those days manifested. Yet the Raven is no mere dependant upon man, being always
                    able to get a living for itself; and moreover a sentiment of veneration or
                    superstition has from very remote ages and among many races of men attached to
                    it—a sentiment so strong as often to overcome the feeling of distrust not to say
                    of hatred which its deeds inspired, and, though rapidly decreasing, even to
                    survive in some places until the present day. There is no need to dwell on the
                    association of this bird with well-known characters of history sacred or
                    profane—Noah or Elijah, Odin or Flokki, the last of whom by its means discovered
                    Iceland. The Raven is even said to have played its part in the mythology of the
                    Red Indian; and none can wonder that all this should be so, since, wherever it
                    occurs and more especially wherever it is numerous, as in ancient times and in
                    thinly peopled countries it must have been, its size, appearance, and fearless
                    habits would be sure to attract especial attention. Nor has this attention
                    wholly ceased with the advance of enlightenment, for both in prose and verse,
                    from the time of Shakespeare to that of Poe and Dickens, the Raven has often
                    figured, and generally without the amount of misrepresentation which is the fate
                    of most animals which celebrated writers condescend to notice. Notwithstanding
                    all this, however, the Raven has now fallen upon evil days. The superstitious
                    reverence with which it was once regarded has all but vanished and has been very
                    generally succeeded by persecution, which in many districts has produced actual
                    extirpation, so that it is threatened with extinction, save in the wildest and
                    most unpeopled districts. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>That all lovers of nature should take what steps they can to arrest this sad
                    fate is a belief which the present writer fully holds. Without attempting to
                    deny the loss which in some cases is inflicted upon the rearers of cattle by
                    Ravens, it is an enormous mistake to suppose that the neighbourhood of a pair of
                    these birds is invariably detrimental. On this point he can speak from
                    experience. For many years he had an intimate knowledge of a pair occupying an
                    inland locality surrounded by valuable flocks of sheep, and abounding in rabbits
                    and game, and had ample opportunities, which he never neglected, of repeatedly
                    examining the pellets of bones and <hi rend="italic">exuvise</hi> that these,
                    like all other carnivorous birds, cast up. He thus found that this pair of
                    Ravens fed almost exclusively on moles. Soon after he moved from the
                    neighbourhood in which they lived the unreasoning zeal of a gamekeeper (against,
                    it is believed, the orders of his master) put an end to this interesting
                    couple—the last of their species which inhabited the county. </p></note></p>
                <p>The Raven breeds very early in the year, in England resorting to its nest, which
                    is usually an ancient if not an ancestral structure, about the middle or towards
                    the end of January. Therein are laid from five to seven eggs of the common
                    Corvine coloration (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Crow,</hi> vol. vi. pp. 617, 618),
                    and the young are hatched before the end of February. In more northern countries
                    the breeding-season is naturally delayed, but everywhere this species is almost
                    if not quite the earliest of birds to enter upon the business <pb break="no"

                    26 inches in length, and has an expanse of wing considerably exceeding a yard.
                    Its bill and feet are black, and the same may be said of its whole plumage, but
                    the feathers of the upper parts as well as of the breast are very glossy,
                    reflecting a bright purple or steel-blue. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    taken by three allied but well-differentiated species, two of which ( <hi

                    and the Atlantic Islands. Further to the southward in the Ethiopian Region three
                    more species appear, whose plumage is varied with white <hi rend="italic">—C.
