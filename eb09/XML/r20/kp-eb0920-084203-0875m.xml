                    sufficiently visible at some distance. In the comparatively rare cases <pb

                    readily known from the black form of <hi rend="smallcaps">Crow</hi> (vol. vi. p.
                    618) by the rich purple gloss of its black plumage, especially on the head and
                    neck, the feathers of which are soft and not pointed. In a general way the
                    appearance and manners of the Rook are so well known, to most inhabitants of the
                    British Islands especially, that it is needless here to dwell upon them, and
                    particularly its habit of forming communities in the breeding-season, which it
                    possesses in a measure beyond that of any other land bird of the northern
                    hemisphere. Yet each of these communities, or rookeries, seems to have some
                    custom intrinsically its own, the details of which want of space forbids any
                    attempt to set before the reader. In a general way the least-known part of the
                    Rook’s mode of life are facts relating to its migration and geographical
                    distribution. Though the great majority of Rooks in Britain are sedentary or
                    only change their abode to a very limited extent, it is now certain that a very
                    considerable number visit this country in or towards autumn, not necessarily to
                    abide here, but merely to pass onward, like most other kinds of birds, to winter
                    further southwards; and, at the same season or even a little earlier, it cannot
                    be doubted that a large proportion of the young of the year emigrate in the same
                    direction. As a species the Rook on the European continent only resides during
                    the whole year throughout the middle tract of its ordinary range. Further to the
                    northward, as in Sweden and northern Russia, it is a regular summer-immigrant,
                    while further to the southward, as in southern France, Spain, and most parts of
                    Italy, it is, on the contrary, a regular winter-immigrant. The same is found to
                    be the case in Asia, where it extends eastward as far as the upper Irtish and
                    the Ob. It breeds throughout Turkestan, in the cold weather visiting
                    Afghanistan, Cashmere, and the Punjab, and Sir Oliver St John found a rookery of
                    considerable size at Casbin in Persia. In Palestine and in Lower Egypt it is
                    only a winter-visitant, and Canon Tristram noticed that it congregates in great
                    numbers about the mosque of Omar in Jerusalem. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is right to mention that the Canon
                    considers the Rook of Palestine entitled to specific distinction as <hi
                    rend="italic">Corms ayrieola (,Proe. Zook Society,</hi> 1864, p. 444; <hi
                    rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1866, pp. 68, 69). Inlikemanner the Rook of China has
                    been described as forming a distinct species, under the name of <hi

                    the feathers of its face only partially deciduous. </p></note></p>
                <p>There are several moot points in the natural history of the Rook which it is
                    impossible here to do more than mention. One is the cause of the curious
                    shedding on reaching maturity of the feathers of its face, and another the
                    burning question whether Rooks are on the whole beneficial or detrimental to
                    agriculture. In England the former opinion seems to be generally entertained,
                    but in Scotland the latter has long been popular. The absence of sufficient
                    observations made by persons at once competent and without bias compels the
                    naturalist to withhold his judgment on the matter, but the absence of such
                    observations is eminently discreditable to the numerous Agricultural Societies
                    of the United Kingdom, (a. n.)</p>
