                    formerly resided in Portugal. The elder Ricardo bore an honourable character,
                    and was a successful member of the Stock Exchange. The son was placed for two
                    years at a commercial school in Holland, and at the age of fourteen entered his
                    father’s office, where he showed much aptitude for business. About the time when
                    he attained his majority he abandoned the Hebrew faith, and conformed to the
                    Anglican Church, a change which seems to have been connected with his marriage
                    to Miss Wilkinson, which took place in 1793. In consequence of the step thus
                    taken he was separated from his family and thrown on his own resources. His
                    ability and uprightness were known, and he at once entered on such a successful
                    career in the profession to which he had been brought up that at the age of
                    twenty-five, we are told, he was already rich. He now began to occupy himself
                    with scientific pursuits, and gave some attention to mathematics as well as to
                    chemistry and mineralogy; but, having met with Adam Smith’s great work in 1799
                    at Bath, whither he had gone for his wife’s health, he threw himself with ardour
                    into the study of political economy.</p>
                <p>His first publication (1809) was <hi rend="italic">The High Price of Bullion a
                    Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes.</hi> This tract was an expansion of a
                    series of articles which the author had contributed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morning Chronicle.</hi> It gave a fresh stimulus to the controversy, which had
                    for some time been discontinued, respecting the resumption of cash payments.
                    Ricardo argued that the premium on bullion and the unfavourable state of the
                    exchanges could only be explained by the depreciation of the inconvertible paper
                    money then in circulation, which had fallen 2δ per cent, below the value of
                    specie in consequence of its over-issue. A committee to consider the whole
                    question, commonly known as the Bullion Committee, was nominated by the House of
                    Commons in February 1810. Amongst the members were Francis Horner, who was
                    appointed chairman, Alexander Baring (afterwards Lord Ashburton), William
                    Huskisson, and Henry Thornton, author of the well known <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain</hi>
                    (1802). The report, which was presented to parliament in June of the same year,
                    was the joint production of Horner, Huskisson, and Thornton. It asserted the
                    same views which Ricardo had put forward, and recommended the repeal of the Bank
                    Restriction Act. Notwithstanding this, the House of Commons of the following
                    year, on the motion of Mr Vansittart (afterwards Lord Bexley), declared in the
                    teeth of the facts that paper had undergone no depreciation, and negatived
                    Horner’s resolutions founded on the report of the committee. One of the
                    strongest opponents of Ricardo’s opinions was Mr Bosanquet; he published in 1811
                    a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Practical Observations on the Report of
                    the Bullion Committee,</hi> and this drew forth from Ricardo an elaborate reply.
                    Both this tract and its predecessor attracted much attention. They propound no
                    new economic principles, but are based on the doctrines of Smith. They do not
                    give such a systematic and complete view of the subject as Huskisson’s
                    well-known tract <hi rend="italic">(The Question respecting the Depreciation of
                    the Currency Stated and Examined,</hi> 1810), but they are well reasoned, and,
                    as to their main conclusions, convincing. It has, however, been maintained that
                    there were features of the case which Ricardo did not sufficiently take into
                    account, especially the demand for bullion created by the necessity of meeting
                    the foreign payments of England, which, in consequence of the Continental
                    system, could not be otherwise discharged.</p>
                <p>In 1811 he made the acquaintance of James Mill, whose introduction to him arose
                    out of the publication of Mill’s tract entitled <hi rend="italic">Commerce
                    Defended.</hi> The conversation of Ricardo’s new friend seems to have largely
                    influenced his views; Bentham indeed declared him to be Mill’s intellectual
                    child; but, whilst Mill doubtless largely affected his political ideas, he was,
                    on his side, under obligations to Ricardo in the purely economic field; Mill
                    said in 1823 that he himself and J. R. M <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> Culloch
                    were Ricardo’s disciples, and, he added, his only genuine ones.</p>
                <p>In 1815, when the Corn Laws were under discussion, he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of
                    Stock.</hi> This was directed against a recent tract by Malthus entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Grounds of an Opinion on the Policy of Restraining the Free
                    Importation of Foreign Corn.</hi> The reasonings of the essay are based on the
                    theory of rent which has often been called by the name of Ricardo; but the
                    author distinctly states that it was not due to him. “In all that I have said
                    concerning the origin and progress of rent I have briefly repeated, and
                    endeavoured to elucidate, the principles which Malthus has so ably laid down on
                    the same subject in his <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Nature and Progress
                    of Rent.”</hi> We now know that the theory had been fully stated, before the
                    time of Malthus, by Anderson; it is in any case clear that it was no discovery
                    of Ricardo. Even the conception of the soils of a country as comparable to a
                    series of machines of different original powers, though capable of improvement
                    by the application of capital, is quoted from Malthus. Ricardo states in this
                    essay a set of propositions, most of them deductions from the theory of rent,
                    which are in substance the same as those afterwards embodied in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles,</hi> and regarded as characteristic of his system,
                    such as that increase of wages does not raise prices; that profits can be raised
                    only by a fall in wages and diminished only by a rise in wages; and that
                    profits, in the whole progress of society, are determined by the cost of the
                    production of the food which is raised at the greatest expense. It does not
                    appear that, excepting the theory of foreign trade, anything of the nature of
                    fundamental doctrine, as distinct from the special subjects of banking and
                    taxation, is laid down in the <hi rend="italic">Principles</hi> which does not
                    already appear in this tract. We find in it, too, the same exclusive regard to
                    the interest of the capitalist class, and the same identification of their
                    interest with that of the whole nation, which are generally characteristic of
                    his writings. “Rent,” he says, “is in all cases a portion of the profits
                    previously obtained on the land,” a proposition by which, for the sake, it is to
                    be feared, of creating a political prejudice, he obscures his own doctrine that
                    true rent can never be a part of profit; and he alleges what is in a sense true,
                    but has a most invidious effect,—that “the interest of the landlord is always
                    opposed to the interest of every other class in the community,” though the
                    existence of a distinct landlord class is by no means a necessity, and the owner
                    of rent, which somebody must own, could not, even by entirely remitting it,
                    alter the price of food, or increase the profits of the capitalist, except by
                    presenting him with a gift to which he has no economic claim. At the close of
                    the tract he endeavours to show in opposition to Malthus that the danger of
                    dependence on foreign supply for a large part of our food, and the losses on
                    invested capital which would result from a legislative change, could not be so
                    serious as to counterbalance the advantages arising from a free importation.</p>

                <p>Both parts of this proposition are probably true; but he does not establish the
                    first in a very satisfactory manner.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Proposals for an Economical and Secure Currency</hi>
                    (1816) he first disposes of the chimera of a currency without a specific
                    standard, and pronounces in favour of a single metal, with a preference for
                    silver, as the standard. He then puts forward a scheme which had been already
                    briefly indicated in the appendix to the 4th edition (1811) of his <hi
                    rend="italic">High Price of Bullion.</hi> This was that the bank should be
                    obliged to deliver on demand, not coin, but uncoined bullion or gold standard
                    bars, in exchange for its notes, whenever the notes presented together for
                    payment reached a moderate fixed amount. The consequence would be that, all the
                    smaller payments being made in the cheap medium, paper, the country would enjoy
                    the profit derivable from the metallic currency used as a capital; the wear of
                    the coinage, too, would be prevented, and a saving thus effected. By this method
                    the public would secure itself against any variations in the value of the
                    currency beyond those to which the standard itself is necessarily subject; and,
                    at the same time, the circulation would be carried on in the least expensive
                    way. Thus, whilst the use of the precious metals as the medium of exchange was,
                    in the earlier stages of social life, one of the most important steps towards
                    the improvement of commerce and the advancement of civilization, it is proposed
                    to us, and on grounds which it is difficult to gainsay, to banish them once more
                    from such employment in almost all the internal transactions of a country. A
                    kindred revolution, tending to the further elimination of metallic money, Jevons
                    has spoken of as “a return to barter”; but that expression is misleading, for in
                    the modern system of settlement by writing off liabilities against each other a
                    metallic standard is always supposed, and lies at the basis of every
                    transaction, whereas in the primitive method of dealing commodities were
                    directly compared. Ricardo’s plan was in operation for some time, but was then
                    given up on the ground, urged by the bank, of the frequent forgery of one pound
                    notes, and the consequent necessity of replacing them with coin—a very
                    insufficient reason, as experience demonstrates, though a good argument in
                    favour of such an improved manufacture of notes as would effectually defeat
                    fraudulent imitation. In a later tract <hi rend="italic">(Plan for a National
                    Bank)</hi> Ricardo proposes that one pound notes should be confined to the
                    country districts. The general plan has been objected to on the ground that it
                    would not provide for a sufficient metallic reserve to meet sudden emergencies
                    arising from the necessity of foreign payments.</p>
                <p>Ricardo’s chief work, <hi rend="italic">Principles of Political Economy and
                    Taxation,</hi> appeared in 1817. A full account of the general theory expounded
                    in this treatise has been given under Political Economy; a very brief statement
                    must here suffice. The fundamental doctrine is that, on the hypothesis of free
                    competition, exchange value is determined by the labour expended in
                    production,—a proposition not new, nor, except with considerable limitation and
                    explanation, true, and of little practical use, as “amount of labour” is a vague
                    expression, and the thing intended is incapable of exact estimation. Ricardo’s
                    theory of distribution has been briefly enunciated as follows:—“(1) the demand
                    for food determines the margin of cultivation; (2) this margin determines rent;
                    (3) the amount necessary to maintain the labourer determines wages; (4) the
                    difference between the amount produced by a given quantity of labour at the
                    margin and the wages of that labour determines profit.” These theorems are too
                    absolutely stated, and require much modification to adapt them to real life. His
                    theory of foreign trade has been embodied in the two propositions—“(1)
                    international values are not determined in the same way as domestic values; (2)
                    the medium of exchange is distributed so as to bring trade to the condition it
                    would be in if it were conducted by barter.” His views on currency and banking
                    will be gathered from the present article.</p>
                <p>A considerable portion of the work is devoted to a study of taxation, which
                    requires to be considered as a part of the problem of distribution. A tax is not
                    always paid by those on whom it is imposed; it is therefore necessary to
                    determine the ultimate, as distinguished from the immediate, incidence of every
                    form of taxation. Smith had already dealt with this question; Ricardo develops
                    and criticizes his results. The conclusions at which he arrives are deduced from
                    the theory of rent and from the assumptions of a uniform rate of profits and of
                    a rate of wages coincident with the necessary subsistence of the labourer. They
                    are in the main as follows :—a tax on raw produce falls on the consumer, but
                    will also diminish profits; a tax on rents on the landlord; taxes on houses will
                    be divided between the occupier and the ground landlord; taxes on profits will
                    be paid by the consumer, end taxes on wages by the capitalist. These
                    propositions of course participate in the infirmity of the premises from which
                    they are deduced, or must at least be taken with limitations corresponding to
                    those to which the premises are subject. Ricardo adopts and even extols as a
                    “golden maxim” the shallow dictum of Say, that “the very best of all plans of
                    finance is to spend little, and the best of all taxes is that which is of least
                    amount.”</p>
                <p>In 1819 Ricardo, having retired from business and become a landed proprietor,
                    entered parliament as member for Portarlington. He was at first diffident and
                    embarrassed in speaking, but gradually overcame these difficulties, and was
                    heard with much attention and deference, especially when he addressed the house
                    on economic questions. He probably contributed in a considerable degree to
                    bringing about the change of opinion on the question of free trade which
                    ultimately led to the legislation of Sir Robert Peel on that subject.</p>
                <p>In 1820 he contributed to the supplement of the <hi rend="italic">Ency∙ clopaedia
                    Britannica</hi> (6th ed.) an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Funding System.</hi>
                    In this, besides giving an historical account (founded on Dr Robert Hamilton’s
                    valuable work <hi rend="italic">On the National Debt,</hi> 1813, 3d ed., 1818)
                    of the several successive forms of the sinking fund, he urges that nations
                    should defray their expenses, whether ordinary or extraordinary, at the time
                    when they are incurred, instead of providing for them by loans; and, not
                    believing that the system of a sinking fund would ever be consistently and
                    perseveringly carried out, he maintains that the national debt should be paid
                    off by a tax on property—an operation which he thought might be completed in tw
                    <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> o or three years during peace. Thus, by a single
                    effort we might, he says, get rid of those great sources of demoralization, the
                    customs and the excise, and our commerce would be freed from “all the vexatious
                    delays and interruptions which our present artificial system imposes upon
                    it.”</p>
                <p>In 1822 he published a tract <hi rend="italic">On Protection to Agriculture,</hi>
                    which is an able application to controversy of the general principles laid down
                    in his systematic work. Its arguments and conclusions are therefore subject to
                    the same limitations which those fundamental principles require. He does not
                    advocate an absolutely free importation of corn, but proposes, in consideration
                    of the special burdens on agriculture, to impose on the foreign commodity a duty
                    equivalent to the exclusive taxes imposed on home growers, as well as to allow a
                    drawback on exportation equal to the duty. The only point of much interest in
                    the tract, apart from the question of protection, is the assertion of the
                    doctrine that a high rate of interest is <pb break="no"

                    to that held by Child and others in the 17th century. “Profits and interest,” he
                    says, “cannot be too high. Nothing contributes so much to the prosperity and
                    happiness of a country as high profits.” It seems to follow that, the
                    productiveness of labour being given, wages cannot be too low, which can only be

                    the cost of the labourer’s maintenance. The proposition, too, appears to lead to
                    economic pessimism, for, according to his own doctrines, the rate of profits
                    must inevitably decline in the course of the history of any society.</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank,</hi>
                    published posthumously in 1824, he proposes that the issue of the paper currency
                    should be taken out of the hands of the Bank of England, and vested in
                    commissioners appointed by the Government, but not removable except on an
                    address from one or both Houses of Parliament. These functionaries should in no
                    case lend money to the ministers of the crown, who, when they wanted it, should
                    raise it by taxation or have recourse to the general market. The commissioners
                    would act as bankers to all the public departments, but would be precluded from
                    fulfilling the same office for any corporation or individual whatever. Their
                    great business would be to regulate the issue of paper by the price of bullion,
                    so as to keep the value of the former equal to that of the coins it would
                    represent. The tract describes in detail the measures to be adopted for the
                    introduction and working of the new system. A certain step towards realizing the
                    objects of this scheme, though on different lines from Ricardo’s, was taken in
                    Sir Robert Peel’s Act of 1844, by which the discount business of the bank was
                    separated from the issue department.</p>
                <p>Ricardo died on the 11th September 1823, at his seat (Gatcomb Park) in
                    Gloucestershire. He was only fifty-one years of age, and there had been nothing
                    in his general health to give rise to apprehension; the cause of death was a
                    cerebral affection resulting from disease of the ear. He was much regretted, as
                    he had been highly esteemed, both in public and private life. His character is
                    represented in very favourable colours by those who knew him best. He is
                    described as modest, candid, and ever open to conviction,—as affectionate in his
                    family, steady in his friendships, and generous and kind in his wider personal
                    relations. James Mill, who was intimately acquainted with him, says (in a letter
                    to Napier of November 1818) that he knew not a better man, and on the occasion
                    of his death published a highly eulogistic notice of him in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morning Chronicle.</hi> A lectureship on political economy, to
                    exist for ten years, was founded in commemoration of him, M'Culloch being chosen
                    to fill it.</p>
                <p>In forming a general judgment respecting Ricardo, we must have in view not so
                    much the minor writings, to which this article has been in great part devoted,
                    as the Principles, in which his economic system is expounded as a whole. By a
                    study of this work we are led to the conclusion that he was an economist only,
                    not at all a social philosopher in the wider sense, like Adam Smith or John
                    Mill. He had great acuteness, but little breadth. For any large treatment of
                    moral and political questions he seems to have been alike by nature and
                    preparation unfitted; and there is no evidence of his having had any but the
                    most ordinary and narrow views of the great social problems. His whole
                    conception of human society is material and mechanical, the selfish principle
                    being regarded, after the manner of the Benthamites, as omnipotent, not merely
                    in practical economy, but, as appears from his speech on the ballot and his
                    tract on reform, in the whole extent of the social field. Roscher calls him “ein
                    tiefer Menschenkenner”; it would be difficult to characterize him more inaptly.
                    The same writer remarks on his “capitalistic” tone, which, he says, becomes
                    “mammonistic”</p>
                <p>in some of his followers; but the latter spirit is already felt as the pervading
                    atmosphere of Ricardo’s works. He shows no trace of that hearty sympathy with
                    the working classes which breaks out in several passages of the Wealth of
                    Nations; we ought, perhaps, with Held, to regard it as a merit in Ricardo that
                    he does not cover with fine phrases his deficiency in warmth of social
                    sentiment. The idea of the active capitalist having any duties towards his
                    employes never seems to occur to him; the labourer is, in fact, merely an
                    instrument in the hands of the capitalist, a pawn in the game he plays. His
                    principal work is the ultimate expression of what Comte calls “l’ignoble
                    métaphysique qui prétend étudier les lois générales de l’ordre matériel en
                    l’isolant de tout autre.” Against such a picture of industrial life as a mere
                    sordid struggle of conflicting interests contemporary socialism is the
                    necessary, though formidable, protest; and the leaders of that movement have
                    eagerly seized his onesided doctrines and used them for their own ends.</p>
                <p>He first introduced into economics on a great scale the method of deduction from
                    a priori assumptions. The conclusions so arrived at have often been treated as
                    if they were directly applicable to real life, and indeed to the economic
                    phenomena of all times and places. But the truth of Ricardo’s theorems is now by
                    his w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> armest admirers admitted to be hypothetical
                    only, and they are stated as applying, at most, to the existing highly-developed
                    condition of European, and especially of English, commerce. Bagehot, however,
                    seems right in believing that Ricardo himself had no consciousness of the
                    limitations to which his doctrines are subject. Be this as it may, we now see
                    that the only basis on which these doctrines could be allowed to stand as a
                    permanent part of economic science is that on which they are placed by Roscher,
                    namely, as a stage in the preparatory work of the economist, who, beginning with
                    such abstractions, afterwards turns from them, not in practice merely, but in
                    the completed theory, to real life and men as they actually are or have been.
                    But it may w ’ ell be doubted whether it is not better to discard them
                    altogether, and begin, as we end, with an historical method, which, it may be
                    added, will of necessity lead to the introduction of those moral and social
                    considerations which would otherwise be almost certainly overlooked.</p>
                <p>The criticisms to which Ricardo’s general economic scheme is open do not hold
                    with respect to his treatment of the subjects of currency and banking. These
                    form precisely that branch of economics into which moral ideas (beyond the plain
                    prescriptions of honesty) can scarcely be said to enter, and where the operation
                    of purely mercantile principles is most immediate and invariable. They were,
                    besides, the departments of the study to which Ricardo’s early training and
                    practical habits led him to give special attention; and they have a lasting
                    value independent of his systematic construction.</p>
                <p>Ricardo’s collected works were published, with a notice of his life and writings,
                    by J. R. M ’ Culloch in 1846. A French translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principles</hi> by Constancio, with notes by Say, appeared in 1818; the whole
                    works, translated by,Constancio and Fonteyraud, form vol. xiii.(1847) of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collection des Principaux Économistes,</hi> where they are
                    accompanied by the notes of Say, Malthus, Sismondi, Rossi, «fee. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles</hi> was first “naturalized" in Germany, says Roscher
                    (though another version by Von Schmid had previously appeared), by Edward
                    Baumstark in his <hi rend="italic">David Ricardo's Grundgesetze der
                    Volkswirthschaft und der Besteuerung übersetzt und erläutert</hi> (1837), which
                    Roscher highly commends, not only for the excellence of the rendering, but for
                    the value of the explanations and criticisms which are added. (J. K. I.)</p>
