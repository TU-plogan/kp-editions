                    (1656-1686), a mezzotinto engraver, son of the former, was born in 1656. He had
                    the advantage of his father’s instructions, and devoting his attention chiefly
                    to mezzotinto, at an early age gave promise of attaining great excellence, but
                    became idle and dissipated, and it is said involved his father in money
                    difficulties. Among persons of note whose portraits he engraved are Charles II.,
                    Mary princess of Orange, Queen Anne when princess of Denmark, and Charles XII.
                    of Sweden. He died in 1686.</p>

                    British India, now under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of the
                    North-Western Provinces. It lies in 26°-28° 30' N. lat. and 81° 5-83° 15' E.
                    long., and comprises the three districts of FaizAbAd, GondA, and Bharaich. It is
                    bounded on the N. by the independent state of NepAl, on the E. by Gorakhpur
                    district, on the S. by Azimgarh and Sultanpur, and on the W. by BAra Banki,
                    SitApur, and Kheri. Population, according to the census of 1868—Hindus,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">FaizAbAd,</hi> a district of British India in Oudh, under
                    the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, in 26°-27° N. lat. and
                    81°-82° E. long., is bounded on the N. and E. by the Gogra river, on the S. by
                    Azimgarh district, and on the W. by the Gumti river. The area, according to the
                    latest estimate in 1877, is 1649 square miles, and the population 1,024,092
                    souls. FaizAbAd forms a very historical district, lying between the two great
                    rivers of Oudh, and is interesting alike for its calamities and its ruins.
                    AjodhyA, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Oudh, which plays so conspicuous
                    a part in the Sanskrit epics, lies in its northern angle, close to the present
                    city of FaizAbAd. In more modern times the district was the centre of the nawAb
                    vizier’s influence, and contained his capital until the removal of his court to
                    Lucknow in 1775. In 1857 it became the scene of the disaster described below.
                    Since the mutiny, the district has settled down into a peaceful part of the
                    British empire, with an increasing population. It is penetrated throughout its
                    length from north to south by the Oudh and Rohilkhand railway, and does an
                    important trade with the great cities of the north-west. The growth of its
                    population has been the more marked, owing to the previous desertion and decay
                    in the last century on the transfer of the nawAb’s court to Lucknow. The
                    population, classified according to religion, is—Hindus, 922,360, Mahometans,
                    100,410, Christians, 1322, of whom 1267 represent the European soldiers; total,
                    1,024,092; the density of population averaging 621 per square mile. The five
                    largest towns, containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants, are—FaizAbAd, population,
                    37,804; TAnda, 13,543; AjodhyA, 9949; JalAlpur, 6275; and Sajauli, 5614. The
                    railway stations are the following :—MAlipur, Akbarpur, KAnurpur, GosAinganj,
                    Tandauli, BelarghAt, Darsinagar, AjodhyA, FaizAbAd, and Sajauli. The estimated
                    cultivated area in 1875 was 628,690 acres, of which rice was returned as
                    occupying 162,562; wheat, 162,895; other food grains, 248,837; oil-seeds, 6888;
                    sugar, 27,800; cotton, 492; opium, 4982; indigo, 6900; fibres, 202; tobacco,
                    3957; and vegetables, 3522. The total value of the trade of FaizAbAd in 1874-75
                    was exports &lt;£425,115, and imports &lt;£122,511, the chief articles of export
                    being food grains, oil-seeds, country cloth, and silk, and cotton; and of
                    imports, sugar, spices, European piece goods, &amp;c. The revenue of the
                    district in 1874-75 was £151,856, of which £133,243, or 85 per cent., was
                    derived from the land-tax. The machinery for protecting person and property
                    consisted of 15 magisterial and 15 civil and revenue courts. The regular police
                    force consisted of 552 officers and men, maintained at a cost of £8363 out of
                    the imperial revenue; a town and cantonment police numbering 237, and costing
                    £1402 from local sources; and a village police numbering 2277 men, maintained by
                    the villagers or landholders at a cost of £5524. The average daily number of
                    prisoners in jail in 1875 was 791, or one to every 1294 of the populx-tion. The
                    schools in the same year numbered 98, attended by 4461 pupils. Four charitable
                    dispensaries afforded medical aid to 13,463 patients; and a poorhouse furnished
                    assistance to 6752 paupers in the shape of food, clothing, and shelter.</p>

                    hardly a trace remains. The modern Ajodhya contains several Jain and Hindu
                    temples. The city of Faizabil was founded about 1730 by Sa’adat Ali KhAn the
                    first nawAb vizier of Oudh, who made it his capital. The place rapidly grew in
                    importance until 1775, when the court of Oudh was removed to Lucknow. It then
                    rapidly decayed, all the leading merchants, bankers, &amp;c., abandoning the
                    place. In 1839, Butter estimated its population at 100,000 but fast diminishing,
                    owing to the exactions and oppressions by the native officials of the nawAb’s
                    Government. At the time of the census in 1869 FaizAbad contained only 37,804
                    inhabitants; but it is now again advancing in prosperity, and is rapidly
                    becoming an emporium of trade. At the time of the annexation of Oudh in 1856
                    FaizAbAd was made, and still continues to be, a large military station. On the
                    outbreak of the mutiny in 1857, the cantonment contained two regiments of
                    infantry, a squadron of cavalry, and a light field battery of artillery —all
                    natives. Owing to their threatening demeanour after the Meerut massacre, many of
                    the European ladies and children were sheltered by one of the great landholders
                    of Oudh, and others were sent forward to less disturbed parts of the country.
                    The troops rose, as was anticipated, and although they at first permitted their
                    officers to take boats and proceed towards Dinapur, a message was afterwards
                    sent to a rebel force lower down the river to intercept the fugitives. Of four
                    boats, one succeeded in reaching Dinapur safely, having passed the rebels
                    unnoticed. Of the occupants of the other three boats, one person alone escaped.
                    FaizabAd is now a station for European as well as for native troops.</p>
