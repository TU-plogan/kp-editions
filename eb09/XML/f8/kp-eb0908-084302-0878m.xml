                    chronicler, sprung from an Essex family, is said by Bishop Tanner to have been
                    born in London about the middle of the 15th century. Even the date of his death,
                    1512, is an inference from that upon which his will was proved, namely, 12th
                    July 1513. The records of the Draper’s Company, of which he was a member, might
                    have settled these and other chronological doubts; but in consequence of the
                    destruction of the company’s hall by fire, there are no memoranda of a date
                    earlier than 1602. All the ascertained details of his life are given in the
                    biographical preface to Sir Henry Ellis’s admirable edition of Fabyan’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicles.</hi> From this source we learn that Fabyan was
                    aiderman for the ward of Farringdon-Without, and that in 1493 he was appointed
                    to the office of sheriff. In 1502, though he is believed on good grounds to have
                    been very rich, he resigned the former office on the plea of poverty, not
                    wishing probably to be elected to the expensive position of Lord Mayor, as he
                    had a very numerous family. Fabyan’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> extends
                    from the time when “Brute entryd firste the lie of Albion” to the year 1485. In
                    subsequent editions it was continued by unknown authors to the year 1559. There
                    have been five editions of the work,—the first printed in 1516 by Pynson, the
                    second by Rastell in 1533, the third by Reynes in 1542, the fourth by Kyngeston
                    in 1559. The fifth, in the preparation of which all the previous editions were
                    compared, was published by Sir Henry Ellis in 1811. For its exposure of
                    ecclesiastical abuses, Wolsey, it is said, ordered many copies of the first
                    edition to be burnt,—hence its scarcity. The second edition was not published
                    until after the cardinal’s death. A great merit of the work consists in its
                    details of city government and ceremonial. Wharton, indeed, observes that, in
                    the eyes of the chronicler, a lord mayor of London seemed to be as august a
                    personage as a king of England, and a city company’s dinner as important an
                    event as an English victory in France or a constitutional struggle at home.
                    Ellis, it may be added, suggests that the part of the history which may have
                    excited the hostility of Wolsey was an abstract of the Commons Bill, 11th year
                    of Henry IV., for the resumption of ecclesiastical property. But the story of
                    the suppression of the first edition appears to rest on the uncorroborated
                    assertion of Bayle. In coL 256, vol, i. of Anthony a Wood’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athenoe Oxonienses</hi> (Bliss’s edition, 4 vols., 1813-1820) there is an entry
                    to the effect that Fabyan was “born in London, bred in grammatical and something
                    in logicalls in this university.” In this account it is stated that Fabyan died
                    in February 1511.</p>
