                    (1668-1736), one of the most learned, laborious, and useful of bibliographers,
                    was born at Leipsic, November 11, 1668. His father, Werner Fabricius, director
                    of music in the church of St Paul at Leipsic, was the author of several works,
                    particularly <hi rend="italic">Delicice Harmonica?,</hi> published in 1657.
                    Joannes Albertus himself commenced his studies under his father, who on his
                    deathbed recommended him to the care of Valentine Alberti. He studied under
                    Wenceslas Buhl and J. S. Herrichen, and afterwards at Quedlinburg under Samuel
                    Schmidt It was in Schmidt’s library, as he afterwards said, that he found the
                    two works, Barthuiss’s <hi rend="italic">Adversaria</hi> and Morhoffs <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyhistor,</hi> which suggested to him the idea of his
                    Bibliothecae, the kind of work for which he stands pre-eminent among scholars.
                    Having returned to Leipsic in 1686, he was the same year admitted bachelor in
                    philosophy; and in the beginning of 1688 he took the degree of master in the
                    same faculty, shortly after which he published his first work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scriptorum recentium decas,</hi> an attack on ten writers of the day, Thomasius
                    among them. His <hi rend="italic">Decas Decadum, sive plagiarorum et
                    pseudonymorum centuria,</hi> published in the following year, is the only one of
                    his works to which ho signs the name Faber. He then applied himself to the study
                    of medicine, which, however, he relinquished for that of theology; and having
                    gone to Hamburg in 1693, he proposed to travel abroad, when the unexpected
                    tidings that the expense of his education had absorbed his whole patrimony, and
                    even left him in debt to his trustee, forced him to abandon his project. He
                    therefore remained at Hamburg, where J. F. Mayer employed him in the capacity of
                    librarian. In 1696 he accompanied his patron to Sweden; <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0877-0842"/> and, on his return to Hamburg, not long
                    afterwards, he competed for the chair of logic and philosophy. The suffrages
                    being equally divided between Fabricius and Sebastian Edzardi, one of his
                    opponents, the appointment was decided by lot in favour of Edzardi; but in 1699
                    Fabricius succeeded Vincent Placciu3 in the chair of rhetoric and ethics, after
                    which he took the degree of doctor in theology at Kiel. In 1701 J. F. Mayer, who
                    had established himself at Greifswald, caused the chair of theology in that city
                    co be offered to Fabricius; but he refused it on account of his health. But in
                    1708 he accepted the professorship of theology, logic, and metaphysics, and was
                    preparing to enter on his new office, when the senate of Hamburg induced him to
                    remain, by adding to his professorship the office of rector of the school of St
                    John, then held by his father-in-law Schultz. Schultz died in 1709, but
                    Fabricius retained the rectorship two years longer. In 1719 the landgrave of
                    Hesse-Cassel made him so advantageous an offer that he was on the point of
                    accepting it; but this time also the magistrates, by a seasonable increase of
                    salary, prevailed on him to remain with them. An attempt was subsequently made
                    to draw him to Wittenberg; but he refused to listen to the proposals made to
                    him, and remained at Hamburg, where he died April 30, 1736.</p>
                <p>Niceron and Reimar give a list of 128 books by Fabricius, but very many of them
                    were only works which he had edited. One of the most famed and laborious of his
                    works is the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Latina, sive notitia auctorum veterum
                    Latinorum quorumeunque scripta ad nos pervenerunt,</hi> Hamburg, 1697, 8vo, a
                    work which was republished in an improved and amended form by J. A. Ernesti,
                    Leipsic, 1773, in three vols. 8vo. The divisions of the compilation are—the
                    writers to the age of Tiberius; thence to that of the Antonines; and thirdly, to
                    the decay of the language; while a fourth gives fragments from old authors, and
                    chapters on early Christian literature. His <hi rend="italic">chef d'oeuvre</hi>
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Grceca, sive notitia scriptorum veterum
                    Graxorum quorumeunque monumenta integra aut fragmenta edita extant, turn

                    4to, a work which has justly been denominated <hi rend="italic">maximus antiques
                    eruditionis thesaurus.</hi> It was rearranged by Harles, at Hamburg, in 1790.
                    Its divisions are marked off by Homer, Plato, Christ, Constantine, and the
                    capture of Constantinople in 1453, while a sixth section is devoted to canon
                    law, jurisprudence, and medicine. Of his remaining works we may mention— <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliotheca Antiquaria, sive introductio in notitiam scriptorum

                    and <hi rend="italic">Hydro-theology,</hi> in German, 1734, 4to. Among the
                    principal works edited by Fabricius may be named <hi rend="italic">Joannis

                    have borrowed their materials. Niceron’s work is entitled <hi rend="italic"
