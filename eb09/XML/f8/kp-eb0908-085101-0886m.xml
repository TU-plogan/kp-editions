                    antiquary—a contemporary of Fairfax— styles him the “natural” son of Sir Thomas,
                    it has been assumed that the poet was illegitimate, but it is certain that in
                    the time of Queen Elizabeth the term “natural” was often used to signify <hi
                    rend="italic">true</hi> or <hi rend="italic">legitimate, i.e.,</hi> the father’s
                    <hi rend="italic">own</hi> son. We may therefore conclude with Douglas in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Peerage</hi> that Edward was the lawful son of Sir Thomas
                    Fairfax, by Dorothy his wife, daughter of George Gale of Ascham Grange. The date
                    of his birth has not been ascertained. He is said to have been only about twenty
                    years of age when he published his translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gerusalemme Liberata.</hi> This is very doubtful, but it would place his birth
                    about the year 1580. He seems early to have preferred a life of study and
                    retirement to the military service in which his brothers were distinguished.
                    Having married, he lived at Fuystone, a place situated between the paternal seat
                    of Denton and the forest of Knaresborough, and there his time was spent in his
                    literary pursuits, and in the education of his children and those of his elder
                    brother, Sir Thomas Fairfax, afterwards baron of Cameron. His famous translation
                    appeared in 1600,— <hi rend="italic">Godfrey of Bvlloigne, or the Recoverie of
                    Ierusalem, done into English heroicall Verse by Edw. Fair efax, Gent.</hi> Never
                    did any mere translation receive such enthusiastic and continued approbation as
                    this work by Fairfax. In rhe same year in which it was published extracts from
                    it were printed in <hi rend="italic">England's Parnassus.</hi> Edward Phillips,
                    the nephew of Milton, in his <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Poetarum,</hi> a work in
                    which, <hi rend="smallcaps">es</hi> Warton says, may be discovered many traces
                    of Milton’s hand, warmly eulogized the translation. Waller said he was indebted
                    to it for the harmony of his numbers. Dryden places the translator almost on a
                    parity with Spenser (whom undoubtedly Fairfax imitated), and Collins has
                    beautifully associated him with his great original, Tasso :—</p>
                <p>“How have I sat, when piped the pensive wind, To hear his harp by British Fairfax
                    strung! Prevailing poet, whose undoubting mind Believed the magic wonders which
                    he sung!”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ode on Popular Superstitions.</hi> Sir Walter Scott conceived that
                    the lines applied to Fairfax <hi rend="italic">(Demonology,</hi> Letter viii.),
                    and Thomas Campbell seems to have entertained the same opinion <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Specimens of the Poets),—</hi> also Charles Knight and others. A careful
                    perusal of the stanza, however, will show that Collins intended the honour for
                    Tasso, not for his translator. Both, indeed, may be said to have “believed the
                    magic wonders which they sung.”</p></note></p>
                <p>In more recent times we find Campbell pronouncing Fairfax’s work one of the
                    glories of the reign of Elizabeth, to whom it was dedicated. Hallam, more
                    critical, said the translation did not represent the grace of its original, and
                    deviated too much from its sense, yet was by no means deficient in-spirit or
                    vigour. The poetical spirit of the work is indeed its life blood and
                    preservation. Hoole and Hunt may give a more literal version, but Fairfax alone
                    seizes upon the poetical and chivalrous character of the poem. As Denham says of
                    Fanshawe’s rendering of the <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido:—</hi></p>
                <p>‘ They but preserve the ashes, he the flame True to its sense, but truer to its
                    fame.”</p>
                <p>And in this way he carries along with him the interest and admiration of the
                    reader. The sweetness and melody of many passages are scarcely excelled even by
                    Spenser. Fairfax made no other appeal to the public. He wrote however, a series
                    of eclogues, ten in number, one of which, the fourth, was published by
                    permission of the family, in Mrs Cooper’s <hi rend="italic">Mused Library</hi>
                    (1737). He wrote also a <hi rend="italic">Discourse on Witchcraft, as it was
                    acted in the Family of Mr Edward Fairfax of Fuystone in the county of York
                    in</hi> 1621, which was edited from the original copy by Mr Monckton Milnes (now
                    Lord Houghton) in the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies of the Philobiblon
                    Society,</hi> 1858-9. Fairfax was a firm believer in witchcraft. He fancied that
                    some of his children had been bewitched, and he had the poor wretches whom he
                    accused brought to trial, but without obtaining a conviction. Such “follies of
                    the wise” are painful to contemplate. Fairfax, however, only shared in the
                    common superstition of the age, and it is at once a memorable and melancholy
                    fact that Sir Matthew Hale, the most upright and able of lawyers, condemned two
                    women to the stake on a charge of witchcraft. Fairfax described himself as
                    “neither a fantastic Puritan nor superstitious Papist; but so settled in
                    conscience as to have the sure ground of God’s word to warrant all he believed,
                    and the commendable ordinances of the English Church to approve all he
                    practised.” And he adds, “I live a faithful Christian and an obedient subject,
                    and so teach my family.” His descendants have not deemed it necessary to publish
                    his writings on theological subjects and the keen controversies of the times.
                    His fame is secure, grafted on the stem of Tasso, and flourishing in perennial
                    beauty and vigour. Fairfax was living in 1631, and is supposed to have died soon
                    afterwards, about 1632. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. ca.)</hi></p>
