                    fide</hi> buying goods from a person who was in possession of them, and had what
                    among mercantile men are called the documents of title, was liable to have his
                    rights defeated by the appearance of the real owner, who repudiated the
                    transaction and recovered the goods. Or an agent might pledge the goods
                    entrusted to him for advances made to him in good faith on that security, and
                    the unfortunate lender might find that the goods belonged to a principal, and
                    that he had no security for his loan. It thus became necessary in such cases to
                    inquire into the real ownership of the goods and the nature of the agent’s
                    authority,—an intolerable necessity in trade. Accordingly the Factors Acts were
                    passed for the protection of such transactions.</p>
                <p>The 4 Geo. IV. c. 83 was an Act for the “better protection of the property of
                    merchants and others who may hereafter enter into contracts or agreements in
                    relation to goods, wares, and merchandise entrusted to factors or agents.” It
                    was followed by the 6 Geo. IV. c. 94, the principal Factors Act, the second
                    section of which enacts that “persons entrusted with, and in possession of, any
                    bill of lading, Indian warrant, dock warrant, warehouse keeper’s <pb break="no"

                    goods, shall be deemed and taken to be the true owner of the goods, so far as to
                    give validity to sales made by them to buyers,” without notice of the fact that
                    they are not the real owners. When a factor pledges goods deposited with him as
                    security for an antecedent debt, the pledger shall acquire no further interest
                    in the goods than was possessed by the factor himself. By section 4, contracts
                    made with agents for the purchase of goods consigned to them shall be held
                    binding upon the owners notwithstanding that the purchaser had notice that the
                    vendors were only agents: <hi rend="italic">provided</hi> such contracts be made
                    in the usual course of business, and that the purchaser had not notice that the
                    agent had no authority to sell.</p>
                <p>By the Amendment Act, 5 and 6 Vict. c. 39 (which recites that much litigation had
                    arisen on the construction of the former statute, and that it is necessary to
                    explain and extend the provisions thereof), it is enacted “that any agent who
                    shall thereafter be entrusted with the possession of goods, or of the documents
                    of title to goods, shall be deemed and taken to be owner of such goods and
                    documents, so far as to give validity to any contract or agreement by way of
                    pledge, lien, or security <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> made to any person
                    with such agent, as'well for any original loan, advance, or payment, made on the
                    security of such goods or documents, as also for any further or continuing
                    advance.” And such contracts shall be binding on the owner notwithstanding
                    notice of the agency. <hi rend="italic">Bona fide</hi> deposits in exchange are
                    protected, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> where an agent pledges goods consigned
                    to him«in exchange for other goods on which the person delivering them up had at
                    the time a valid lien. In all cases the transaction must be <hi rend="italic"
                    >bona fide,</hi> and without notice that the agent is acting beyond his
                    authority or in bad faith as regards his principal.</p>
                <p>“These Acts,” says Mr Benjamin in his treatise on <hi rend="italic">The Sale of
                    Personal Property,</hi> “apply solely to persons entrusted as factors or
                    commission merchants, not to persons to whose employment a power of sale is not
                    ordinarily added, as a wharfinger, who receives goods usually without a power to
                    sell. The statute is limited in its scope to mercantile transactions, to
                    dealings in goods and merchandise, and does not embrace sales of furniture or
                    goods in possession of a tenant or bailee for him.” And the courts of law have
                    unfortunately felt themselves constrained to put a very narrow interpretation on
                    the scope of the Acts. The most remarkable case was that of Fuentes <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Montes <hi rend="italic">{Law Reports,</hi> 3 Common
                    Pleas, 268). Here the plaintiffs, wine merchants in Spain, had consigned some
                    casks of sherry to a London factor for sale, but afterwards revoked his
                    authority. He, while in possession of the wine, but after the revocation,
                    pledged it as security for advances made by the defendant, who acted in good
                    faith, and in entire ignorance of the revocation, The court held that the words
                    “entrusted with and in possession of” referred to the time of the pledge only,
                    and that the factor was not so entrusted at the time of the pledge. This
                    decision, which unsettled the confidence of merchants in dealing with apparent
                    owners of goods, and a general uncertainty as to the true construction of the
                    enactments, led to the passing of the last Factors Act (40 and 41 Vict. c. 39).
                    The second, section overrules the decision in Fuentes <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Montes, by providing that a revocation of authority shall not affect the right
                    of persons purchasing from factors without notice of such revocation. Then the
                    Act goes on to provide for other cases of apparent ownership in which the same
                    hardships had arisen which the Factors Acts were intended to meet. Thus, where
                    goods have been sold, and the vendor has been permitted to retain possession of
                    the documents of title, any sale by him or his agent will be as valid and
                    effectual as if he or his agent were a person entrusted with, or in possession
                    of, the goods under the Factors Acts. A case recently decided (Johnson <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> the Credit Lyonnais Company) will illustrate the purpose
                    of this enactment. A, a tobacco broker, had 50 hogsheads of tobacco lying in
                    dock for which warrants were issued to him. He sold it to B, who paid for it,
                    but left the warrants in A’s hands, and took no steps to have any change made in
                    the books of the dock company as to the ownership. In the meantime A obtained
                    advances on the tobacco from C and D, handing over to them the dock warrants. It
                    was held that these transactions were not protected as against B; under the new
                    Act such transactions are protected. The fourth section deals with case3 in
                    which goods have been sold, and the vendee has got possession of the documents
                    of title, although some lien or other right remains to the vendor. Dealings with
                    the vendee in respect of the goods, and in ignorance of the vendor’s right, are
                    protected. The fifth section protects <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> transfers
                    of documents of title for a previous vendor’s lien or right of stoppage <hi
