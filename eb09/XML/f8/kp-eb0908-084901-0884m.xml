                    Baronet</hi></label> (1789-1874), a distinguished mechanical engineer, was born
                    at Kelso, Roxburghshire, February 19, 1789. His father, who occupied the humble
                    position of farm bailiff, possessed a large measure of the untiring energy and
                    practical skill which were so conspicuously manifested in the son, but on
                    account of adverse circumstances the family were often reduced to very hard
                    straits; and as they frequently required to change their place of residence, the
                    educatiou which the children received was somewhat fragmentary. At the age of
                    ten, however, young Fairbairn had “mastered the rules of arithmetic as far as
                    practice and the rule of three,” and had acquired a taste for reading by a
                    perusal of the selections from English authors in Scott and Barrow’s
                    collections.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0885-0850"/> He afterwards received additional instruction in
                    reading, writing, and accounts, and obtained from his uncle, who was a parish
                    schoolmaster, some knowledge of mensuration; but “the want of a good grammatical
                    course, and a slight knowledge of the classics,” was a frequent subject of
                    regret to him in his subsequent life. Other circumstances worthy of notice
                    connected with his earlier years were his fondness for athletic exercises, which
                    often tempted him to the performance of daring feats in climbing, and the early
                    development of his mechanical genius, which first displayed itself in the
                    construction of a waggon to save himself the trouble and fatigue of carrying his
                    infant brother on his back. It is somewhat remarkable that the other efforts of
                    his mechanical genius in boyhood had reference chiefly to ships and mills, with
                    the construction of both of which his name was subsequently so largely
                    associated. In 1803 it was found necessary that Fairbairn should contribute
                    something to the very straitened family income, and he obtained work at three
                    shillings a week as a mason’s labourer on the Rennie bridge at Kelso; but a
                    serious accident which happened to him a few days after beginning this
                    employment not only deprived the family of the small help of his earnings, but,
                    by the expense it entailed, contributed to bring them almost to the brink of
                    starvation. His father having, however, shortly after this obtained the
                    situation of steward on a farm connected with Percy Main Colliery near North
                    Shields, William obtained employment as a carter in eonnexion with the colliery.
                    Here, on account of his “Scotch accent and different manner, he became the mark
                    of every species of annoyance,” and had to take part in no less than seventeen
                    pugilistic encounters before he was “able to attain a position calculated to
                    ensure respect.” In March 1801 an immense change for the better occurred iu his
                    surroundings and prospects, by his being bound an apprentice to a millwright at
                    Percy Mains. He now commenced a systematic course of self-improvement, assigning
                    each day of the week to a particular subject of study, and devoting also a fixed
                    amouut of his time to recreation and amusement. Besides obtaining by unaided
                    application a pretty complete knowledge of practical mathematics he contrived to
                    go through an extensive course of general reading; and an attachment he formed
                    to a young girl, whom he afterwards married, by leading him to begin letter
                    writing, was his first stimulus to the practice of literary composition. It was
                    at Percy Mains also that he made the acquaintance of George Stephenson, who then
                    had charge of an engine at a neighbouring colliery, and the friendship thus
                    begun lasted through life.</p>
                <p>For some years subsequent to the expiry of his term of apprenticeship, Fairbairn,
                    who, with all his forethought and persevering diligence, had still in his
                    composition a strong love of adventure and a spice of recklessness, lived a
                    somewhat roving life, seldom remaining long in one place and often reduced to
                    very hard straits before he got a job. But soon after his marriage he began
                    seriously to set himself to the attainment of the object he had long
                    contemplated, his emancipation from daily labour; and in November 1817 he
                    entered into partnership with a shopmate of the name of Lillie, with whose aid
                    he hired an old shed in High Street, Manchester, where he set up a lathe, and
                    began business. His first order was to renew the shaftwork of an extensive
                    cotton mill, which with great diligence he accomplished within the specified
                    time, and not only satisfactorily, but with the substitution of improvements
                    which virtually amounted to a revolution of the whole system of mill
                    construction. Such a successful performance of their first contract immediately
                    secured to the new firm a great reputation, and orders pressed in much faster
                    than they were able with their limited capital to execute them. Their fame soon
                    extended beyond Manchester, and in 1824 Fairbairn was engaged to plan and
                    execute a new arrangement of the water-power of Catrine cotton works, Ayrshire,
                    where, and at Deanston, Perthshire, he introduced a system of water-wheel
                    construction whose hydraulic power has never been surpassed. In the summer of
                    1824 he also effected similar improvements in a mill at Zurich, Switzerland. In
                    1832 Fairbairn dissolved partnership with Lillie, retaining the works in Canal
                    Street to which they had previously removed. In 1830 he had been employed by the
                    Forth and Clyde Canal Company to make experiments with the view of determining
                    whether it were possible to construct steamers capable of traversing the canal
                    at a speed which would enable the canal interest to compete successfully with
                    that of the railway; and the results of his investigation were published by him
                    in 1831, under the title <hi rend="italic">liemarhs on Canal Navigation.</hi>
                    His plan of using iron boats proved inadequate to overcome the difficulties of
                    his problem, but it first suggested the construction of iron vessels; and in the
                    development of the use of this material both in the case of merchant vessels and
                    men-of-war the chief merit must be assigned to Fairbairn. In this way also he
                    was led to pursue those ex periments in regard to the strength of iron,
                    according to its combination with other substances, and to various methods of
                    preparation and construction, which have given him a place in this branch of
                    mechanical engineering altogether pre-eminent. In 1835 Fairbairn established, in
                    connexion with his Manchester business, a ship-building yard at Millwall,
                    London, where he constructed several hundred vessels, including many for the
                    royal navy; but he ultimately found it impossible with his other engagements to
                    superintend the work in such a satisfactory manner as to make it pay, and at the
                    end of 14 years he disposed of the concern at a great loss. In 1837 he was
                    employed by the sultan of Turkey with the view of assisting in the introduction
                    of the mechanical arts into that country, and after his return home his services
                    were rewarded by a decoration. For Eeveral years Fairbairn was engaged, in
                    conjunction with Eaton Hodgkinson, in making experiments on the strength and
                    other properties of iron, and in 1845 he was consulted by Robert Stephenson in
                    reference to the best method of constructing the tubular bridge which the latter
                    designed for carrying the railway across the Conway and Menai Straits. Although
                    the share Fairbairn had in the undertaking has been the subject of some dispute,
                    there can be no doubt that he was guided in his experiments chiefly by his own
                    independent judgment, and that he was the inventor of the rectangular
                    self-supporting tube which was the essential feature of the construction. For
                    this invention he, with the concurrence of Stephenson, took out a patent, and he
                    afterwards constructed more thana thousand bridges on the same principle. In
                    reference to his connexion with the invention, he published a volume entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Construction of the Britannia and Conway
                    Tabular Bridges, Sze.,</hi> 1849. In 1849 he was invited by the king of Prussia
                    to submit designs for the construction of a bridge across the Rhine, but after
                    various negotiations, another design, by a Prussian engineer, which was a
                    modification of Fairbairn’s, was adopted. Auother matter which engaged much of
                    Fairbairn’s attention was steam boilers, in the construction of which he
                    effected many improvements. He is also the inventor of the tubular crane, and
                    took out several patents for the construction and arrangement of steam machines.
                    In 1851 he greatly aided, by his fertility and readiness of invention, in an
                    investigation carried on at his works by Mr Joule and Sir William Thomson in
                    reference to the properties of the materials of the earth’s surface; and from
                    1861 to 1865 he was employed to guide the experiments of the Government
                    committee appointed to inquire into the “application<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n886/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0886-0851"/> of iron to defensive purposes.” The results of
                    his experiments were published in the proceedings of the committee. Fairbairn
                    was a member of many learned societies, both British and foreign. In 1860 he
                    received the degree of LL.D, from the university of Edinburgh, and in 1862 that
                    of D.C.L. from the university of Cambridge. He declined the honour of knighthood
                    in 1861, but accepted a baronetcy in 1869. He died at Moor Park, Surrey, August
                    18, 1874. Perhaps no one ever made more use than Fairbairn of the time at his
                    disposal, for amid all the cares of business he not only found leisure for
                    varied scientific investigation, but managed to obtain a wide acquaintance with
                    general literature, to conduct an extensive correspondence on a great variety of
                    subjects, and also to participate largely in the delights of social intercourse.
                    In private his unassuming but dignified simplicity, his thorough honour, and his
                    geniality and kindness secured him general esteem. The results he achieved in
                    mechanical science were due chiefly to minute, patient, and sagacious
                    observation and experiment. It was his habit to aid himself in his
                    investigations by committing his ideas to writing, and, when his opinions on any
                    subject were matured, to communicate them to the world either in a published
                    volume, or by a paper read before some learned institution. By his extensive
                    acquaintance with English authors, and his early and patient practice of
                    composition, he acquired the possession of a clear, simple, and nervous style,
                    and his writings are in this respect worthy to be regarded as models in their
                    own species of literature.</p>
                <p>Among his principal writings, besides those already mentioned, may be named <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Application of Cast and Wrought Iron to Building
                    Purposes,</hi> 1856; <hi rend="italic">Iron, its History, Properties, and

                    read before learned societies are too numerous to be mentioned. The <hi
