                    Otley, Yorkshire, on the 17th of January 1611-12. He studied <pb break="no"

                    (1626-30), and then proceeded to Holland to serve as a volunteer with the
                    English army in the Low Countries under Lord Vere of Tilbury. This connexion led
                    to one still closer; in the summer of 1637 Fairfax married Anne, daughter of
                    Lord Vere, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> lady of spirit, whom Mr Carlyle
                    characterizes as “a Vere of the fighting Veres and given to Presbyterianism.”
                    The Fairfaxes, though serving at first under Charles I., were opposed to the
                    arbitrary prerogative of the crown, and Sir Thomas (he had been knighted by
                    Charles in 1640) declared that “his judgment was for the parliament as the king
                    and kingdom’s great and safest council.” When Charles endeavoured to raise a
                    guard for his own person at York, intending it, as the event afterwards proved,
                    to form the nucleus of an army, Fairfax was employed to present a petition to
                    his sovereign, entreating him to hearken to the voice of his parliament, and to
                    discontinue the raising of troops. This was at a great meeting of the
                    freeholders and farmers of Yorkshire convened by the king on Heyworth Moor near
                    York. Charles evaded receiving the petition, pressing his horse forward, but
                    Fairfax followed him and placed the petition on the pommel of the king’s saddle.
                    The incident is typical of the times and of the actors in the scene. War broke
                    out, Lord Fairfax was appointed general of the Parliamentary forces in the
                    north, and his son Sir Thomas, was made general of the horse under him. Both
                    father and son distinguished themselves in the campaigns in Yorkshire. At first
                    the Parliamentary troops were not successful. The Cavalier spirit of honour and
                    iigh-bred loyalty was too much, as Cromwell said, for poor tapsters and
                    town-apprentice people. There was little hope of success until men of strong
                    religious feelings could be brought into the field against them, and this was
                    effected by Oliver and his Ironsides, his invulnerable troop of disciplined
                    horsemen. In the beginning of 1644 the Scottish army under the command of the
                    earl of Laven joined the Parliamentary forces, and after some minor engagements,
                    commenced the siege of York, then invested by the marquis of Newcastle. York was
                    considered the second town of England, and upon its preservation Charles
                    believed that the safety of his crown mainly depended. There were several
                    assaults and sallies, but news having arrived that Prince Rupert was marching to
                    raise the siege with 20,000 men, the besieging generals, Leven, Fairfax, and
                    Manchester, resolved to draw off their troops, and encamp on the moor seven
                    miles west of York. On the 2nd of July 1644, was fought the important battle of
                    Marston Moor, which virtually decided the fate of the war. The gallantry of the
                    troopers led by the old earl of Leven, Manchester, and Fairfax was
                    conspicuous.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cromwell,
                    in the letter to his brother-in-law, assumes the whole credit of the defeat of
                    the Royalist right, certainly at the expense both of truth and honour. He says:
                    “The left wing which I commanded, being our own horse, saving a few Scots in our
                    rear, beat all the Prince’s horse. God made them as stubble to our swords.” Now
                    the few Scots consisted of 1920 men out of 4200, and Cromwell’s assertion that
                    they were in the rear is contradicted by every other eyewitness who mentions
                    them. Principal Bailie, who received a long account of the battle from his
                    namesake, and had other sources of information now lost, says that David Leslie
                    (Leven) in all places that day was Cromwell’s leader.—Markham's <hi

                    point.</p></note> Fairfax was severely wounded, and he lost a brother in the
                    action. The victory was so decisive that the marquis of Newcastle fled the
                    kingdom, and the Royalists abandoned all hopeof retrieving their affairs. The
                    city of York was taken, and nearly the whole north submitted to the
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>In the south and west of England, however, the Royalist cause was still active.
                    The war had lasted two years, and the nation began to complain of the
                    contributions that were exacted and the excesses that were committed by the mili
                    tary. Dissatisfaction was expressed with the military commanders, Essex and
                    Manchester, and as a preliminary step to reform, the self-denying ordinance was
                    passed. This Act took from all members of parliament their commands in the army
                    or their civil employments. The earl of Essex was removed from the supreme
                    command, and Sir Thomas Fairfax appointed his successor. Cromwell, as a member
                    of the House of Commons, was excluded by the ordinance, but he was too important
                    to be dispensed with; he was made lieutenant-general under Fairfax. The army was
                    new modelled, incompetent officers were dismissed, and the regiments completed
                    by more select levies. The hostile armies met on the 14th of June 1645, at
                    Naseby in Northamptonshire, and a decisive battle took place, which ended in the
                    total discomfiture of the Royalists. The king himself was in the field. “At
                    Naseby,” says Carlyle, “Charles fought his last battle—dashed fiercely against
                    the new model army which he had despised till then—and saw himself shivered
                    utterly to ruin”—partly through the fiery rashness of Prince Rupert, but mainly
                    through the able generalship of Fairfax and Cromwell. The king fled to Wales.
                    Fairfax besieged Leicester, and was successful at Taunton, Bridge water, and
                    Bristol. The whole west was soon reduced to obedience. The king had returned
                    from Wales and established himself at Oxford, where there was a strong garrison,
                    but danger was too apparent; the vacillating monarch withdrew secretly, and
                    proceeded to Newark to throw himself into the arms of the Scots. Oxford
                    capitulated; and by the end of September Charles had neither army nor garrison
                    in England.</p>
                <p>Fairfax arrived in London on the 12th of November 1645. In his progress towards
                    the capital he was accompanied by applauding crowds Complimentary speeches and
                    thanks were presented to him by both houses of parliament, along with a jewel of
                    great value set with diamonds, and a sum of money. Charles was delivered up to
                    the commissioners of parliament by the Scots in January 1646. He had voluntarily
                    surrendered himself to the Scots army, and they negotiated with the
                    parliamentary leaders in his favour. There was a debt of .£600,000, arrears of
                    pay, owing to the Scots, but they agreed to take £400,000, one half of which was
                    to be paid before the army left England. The bargain was concluded some months
                    before there was any stipulation to deliver up the king, but probably, as Hallam
                    remarks, the parliament would never have actually paid the money on any other
                    consideration than the delivering of the king’s person.<note anchored="true"

                    Royalists and the Cavalier wits, and poets, as a subject of obloquy and reproach
                    to the Scots commissioners, and, by implication, to the whole Scottish nation.
                    It is not yet forgotten. Such political libels are not of that class which the
                    poet says are “born to die.” They become the shibboleths of a party, and descend
                    from generation to generation.</p>
                <p>Charles was delivered up to the commissioners of parliament on the 30th January
                    1646-7. Fairfax, who preceded the king, having met him beyond Nottingham,
                    dismounted from his horse, kissed the royal hand, and having resumed his seat,
                    discoursed with the unfortunate prince during the journey to Holdenby. “The
                    general,” said Charles, “is a man of honour, and keeps hi3 word which he had
                    pledged to me.” His chivalrous courtesy is of a piece*with Lis whole
                    character.</p>
                <p>The agitation in the army now became formidable, and threatened anarchy. The
                    Independents were too powerful for both parliament and Presbyterians. Fairfax
                    resolved to <pb break="no"

                    he was persuaded to retain it, and was passive, if not co-operating, in all the
                    proceedings of the army which had for their object to destroy the power of
                    parliament. Lord Ferdinando Fairfax died in the spring of 1647, and Sir Thomas
                    succeeded to his title and to his office as governor of Hull. A second civil war
                    broke out in the summer of 1648; a Scots army of 40,000 was raised to deliver
                    the king from the “sectariesthere were tumults in England and in Wales. Fairfax
                    displayed the greatest activity in putting down these insurrections, and took
                    Colchester, whither the royalist army had betaken themselves. It was at this
                    time, when the commander-in-chief was besieging Colchester, that Mil ton
                    addressed to him the sonnet:—</p>
                <p>“Fairfax, whose name in arms through Europe lings, Filling each mouth with envy
                    or with praise.”</p>
                <p>The poet eulogizes the brave soldier for “firm unshaken virtue,” but he hesitated
                    to go along with the army and Independents in the trial of the king. He was
                    placed at the head of the judges before whom Charles was arraigned, but he
                    refused to act. In calling over the court, when the crier pronounced the name of
                    Fairfax, a lady in the gallery called out “that the Lord Fairfax was not there
                    in person, that he would never sit among them, and that they did him wrong to
                    name him as a commissioner.” This was Lady Fairfax, who could not forbear, as
                    Whitelock says, to exclaim aloud against the proceedings of the High Court of
                    Justice. The decision of the court was a grievous error. “When living, Charles
                    was a baffled tyrant,” as Lord John Russell has remarked; “when dead he became a
                    royal martyr.” In June 1650, after the Scots had declared for Charles II., the
                    council of state resolved to send an army to Scotland in order to prevent an
                    invasion of England. Fairfax declined to act against the Presbyterian Scots, and
                    resigned his commission. Cromwell was appointed his successor, “captaingeneral
                    and commander-in-chief of all the forces raised or to be raised by authority of
                    parliament within the commonwealth of England.” Fairfax received a pension of
                    £5000 a year, and is no more heard of till after the death of the triumphant
                    Protector.</p>
                <p>When Monk invited him to assist in the operations about to be undertaken against
                    Lambert’s army he promptly obeyed the call, and in December 1659 appeared at the
                    head of a body of Yorkshire gentlemen; and such was the influence of Fairfax’s
                    name and reputation that the Irish brigade, consisting of 1200 horse, quitted
                    Lambert’s colours find joined him. This was speedily followed by the breaking up
                    of all Lambert’s forces, and that day secured the restoration of the monarchy. A
                    “free” parliament was called; Fairfax was elected member for Yorkshire, and was
                    put at the head of the commission appointed by the House of Commons to wait upon
                    Charles II. at the Hague and urge his speedy return. Of course the “merry
                    monarch, scandalous and poor,” was glad to obey the summons, and Fairfax
                    provided the horse on which Charles rode at his coronation. The remaining eleven
                    years of the life of Lord Fairfax were spent iu retirement at his seat in
                    Yorkshire. He must, like Milton, have been sorely grieved and shocked by the
                    scenes that followed—the brutal indignities offered to the remains of his
                    companions in arms, Cromwell and Ireton, the sacrifice of Sir Harry Vane, the
                    neglect or desecration of all that was great, noble, or graceful in England, and
                    the flood of immorality which, flowing from Whitehall, sapped the foundations of
                    the national strength and honour. Lord Fairfax died at Nunappleton on the 12th
                    of November 1671. The integrity of Fairfax has never been doubted. No one has
                    ever attempted to charge meanness or corruption on the Parliamentary general.
                    But he was great only in the field, and had apparently none of the qualities of
                    a statesman. He is placed at great disadvantage, however, by being both in war
                    and in peace overshadowed by his associate Cromwell:</p>
                <p>“And under him His genius was rebuked, as, it is said, Mark Antony’s was by
                    Caesar.”</p>
                <p>Lord Fairfax had a taste for literature. He translated some of the Psalms, and
                    wrote poems on solitude, the Christian warfare, the shortness of life, &amp;c.,
                    none of which are above mediocrity. During the last year or two of his life he
                    wrote two <hi rend="italic">Memorials</hi> which have been published— one on the
                    northern actions in which he was engaged iu 1642-44, and the other on some
                    points during his command in the army. At York and at Oxford he endeavoured to
                    save the libraries from pillage, and he enriched the Bodleian with some valuable
                    MSS. His correspondence was published in 1848-9 in four volumes, and a life of
                    him by Clements R. Markham in 1870. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. ca.)</hi></p>
