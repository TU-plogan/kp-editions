                    (1814-1863), a famous hymn writer and theologian, the son of Thomas Henry Faber,
                    secretary to Dr Barrington, bishop of Durham, was born on the 28th of June 1814,
                    at Calverley, Yorkshire, of which place his grandfather, Thomas Faber, was
                    vicar. He attended the grammar school of Bishop Auckland for a short time, but a
                    large portion of his boyhood was spent in Westmoreland; and the lake scenery
                    left an indelible impression on his imagination. He afterwards went to Harrow,
                    where he remained until he became a student of Balliol College, Oxford, in 1833.
                    About the beginning of 1835 he begau to reside at University College, in
                    consequence of obtaining a scholarship there; and in 1836 he gained the
                    Newdigate prize for a poem on the “The Knights of St John,” which elicited
                    special praise from Keble. . Among his college friends were Dean Stanley and Sir
                    Roundell Palmer. In January 1837 he was elected fellow of University College.
                    Meanwhile he had given up the Calvinistic views of his youth, and had become an
                    enthusiastic admirer and follower of John Henry Newman. In 1841 a travelling
                    tutorship took him to the Continent; and, on his return, a book appeared called
                    <hi rend="italic">Sights and Thoughts in Foreign Churches and among Foreign
                    Peoples,</hi> which he dedicated to his dear friend the poet Wordsworth. The
                    journal of his travels is beautifully written, and reveals an intense love of
                    nature, and an almost southern susceptibility to her charms. There is none of
                    the interjectional piety which so often disfigures books of travel written by
                    religious men. He accepted the rectory of Elton in Huntingdonshire, but soon
                    after proceeded again to the Continent, with the intention of studying the
                    methods followed by the Roman Catholic Church. Returning to Elton, he devoted
                    himself, with great earnestness, to the work of his parish, although the two
                    years he spent there were marked by severe mental struggles, which issued in his
                    conversion to the Roman faith in November 1845. On leaving Elton his
                    parishioners sobbed out—“God bless you, Mr Faber, wherever you go” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Life,</hi> p. 238). He founded a religious community at
                    Birmingham, called Wilfridians, after the name Wilfred, which Faber assumed. The
                    community was ultimately merged in the oratory of St Philip Neri, of which
                    Father Newman was the head; and in 1849 a branch of the oratory—subsequently
                    considered independent—was established in London, first in King William Street,
                    and afterwards at Brompton over which Father Faber presided till his death on
                    the 26th of September 1863. In spite of his weak health, an almost incredible
                    amount of work was crowded into those years. He published a number of
                    theological works, and edited the <hi rend="italic">Oratorian Lives of the
                    Saints.</hi> He was an eloquent preacher, a brilliant talker, and had an
                    unsurpassed power of gaining the love of all with whom he came in contact. It is
                    mainly as a hymn writer, however, that he will be known in the future. There is
                    a sweet saintliness, and at the same time a grandeur of thought and a simplicity
                    of poetical expression in Faber’s hymns, which we fail to find in much of the
                    Protestant hymnoiogy. Among the finest are—“The Greatness of God,” “The Will of
                    God,” “The Eternal Father,” “The God of my Childhood,” “Jesus is God,” “The
                    Pilgrims of the Night,” “The Land beyond the Sea,” “Sweet Saviour I bless us ere
                    we go,” “I was wandering and weary,” and “The Shadow of the Rock.” The hymns are
                    largely used in Protestant collections.</p>
                <p>The only complete edition of Faber’s <hi rend="italic">Hymns</hi> is the one
                    published l&gt;v Richardson and Son in 1861, of which a second issue appeared in
                    1871. In addition to hymns, pamphlets, letters, and translations, he published
                    the following works:— <hi rend="italic">Sights and Thoughts in Foreign Churches
                    and among Foreign Peoples, All for Jesus, The Precious Blood, Bethlehem, The
                    Blessed Sacrament, The Creator and the Creature, Growth in Holiness, Spiritual
                    Conferences, The Foot of the Cross, Ethel's Book, Sir Lancelot, Poems, An Essay
                    on Canonization aiid Beatification, Characteristics of the Lives cf the
                    Saints,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Catholic Home Missions. Notes on Doctrinal
                    and Spiritual Subjects</hi> were edited by Father Bowden, and issued after
                    Faber’s death. See his <hi rend="italic">Life and Letters,</hi> by Father
