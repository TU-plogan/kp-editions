                    (1618-1700), a celebrated Italian antiquary, was bom in 1618, at Urbino in
                    Umbria. A younger son, and destined to the pursuit of the law, he studied first
                    at Cagli, and afterwards in his native city, where he took the degree of doctor
                    at the age of eighteen years. While in Rome, preparing for practice at the bar,
                    he early attracted the notice of Cardinal Lorenzo Imperiali, who employed him on
                    important and difficult political affairs in Spain. He was named successively
                    treasurer and auditor of the papal legation in that country, where he remained
                    thirteen years. During all this time, however, his favourite classical and
                    antiquarian studies were not neglected; and returning to Rome with the legate,
                    Bonelli, who had been made cardinal, he was able on the journey to make
                    important observations of the relics and monuments of Spain, France, and Italy,
                    and to converse with the many eminent scholars of those countries who afterwards
                    corresponded with him. At Rome he was appointed judge of appellation of the
                    Capitol, which post he left to be, under the legate, Cardinal Cerri, auditor of
                    the legation at his native city, Urbino. After three years he returned to Rome,
                    on the invitation of Cardinal Carpegna, vicar of Innocent XI., a great lover of
                    antiquities and learning, and now found that fulness of leisure which enabled
                    him to carry on those studies and produce those works which have made him
                    famous. He examined with minute care the monuments and inscriptions of the
                    Campagna. In his solitary expeditions he always rode a horse which his friends
                    nicknamed Marco Polo, after the celebrated Venetian traveller, saying that it
                    could discover half-hidden monuments by smelling only, and thus frequently led
                    its master to notice what he would otherwise have passed by. Fabretti was
                    delighted with the name, and used it himself in a letter on the study of
                    antiqnity, still in manuscript. By Innocent XII. Fabretti was made keeper of the
                    archives of the castle St Angelo, a charge of great responsibility and trust,
                    which he retained till his death.</p>
                <p>His work <hi rend="italic">De Aquis et Aquce-ductibus veteris Boma-,</hi> 1680,
                    three dissertations which cleared up a number of obscurities as to the
                    topography of ancient Latium, is inserted in Graevius’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Thesaurus,</hi> iv. 1677. His interpretation in this work of certain
                    passages in Livy and other classical authors involved him in a dispute with
                    Gronovius, which bore a strong resemblance to that between Milton and Salmasius,
                    Gronovius addressing Fabretti as <hi rend="italic">Faber llusticus,</hi> and the
                    latter, in reply, speaking of <hi rend="italic">Grunnovius</hi> and his <hi
                        rend="italic">titivilitia.</hi> In this controversy Fabretti used the
                    pseudonym Iasitheus, which he afterwards took as his pastoral name in the
                    Academy of the Arcadians. His other works, <hi rend="italic">De Columna Trajani
                        Syntagma,</hi> Rome, 1683, and <hi rend="italic">Inscriptionum Antiquarum
                        Explicatio,</hi> Rome, 1699, throw much light on Roman antiquity, especially
                    with the aid of the principle which he himself employed of making one monument
                    interpret another. In the former of these works is also to be found his
                    explication of a bas-relief, with inscriptions, now in the Capitol at Rome,
                    representing the war and taking of Troy, known as the Iliac table. Letters and
                    other shorter works of Fabretti are to be found in some miscellaneous
                    publications of the time, as the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savants.</hi> He
                    died at Rome, January 1700. His collection of inscriptions and monuments was
                    purchased from hi3 relatives by Cardinal Stoppani, and placed in the ducal
                    palace at Urbino, where they may still be seen.</p>
