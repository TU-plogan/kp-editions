                    pseudonym of Fernati Caballero, was born at Morges, Canton de Vaud, in 1797, her
                    parents being then on a tour through Switzerland. Her father, Johann Nikolas
                    Bohl von Faber, the son of a Hamburg merchant, had removed early in life to
                    Cadiz, prospered in business, professed the Catholic faith, and married Dona
                    Francisca de Larrea, a member of the Spanish aristocracy. Cecilia received a con
                    siderable part of her education in Germany at Gbrslow near Schwerin, where her
                    father had an estate; and here, besides other accomplishments, including a
                    complete mastery of German and Spanish, she acquired a competent knowledge of
                    Latin, English, French, and Italian. In 1813 she returned to Cadiz, and in the
                    following year became the wife of Captain Planells, whom she accompanied to
                    America, where she seems to have spent some years of married life. Not long
                    after the death of her first husband, she was married to the Marques de Arco
                    Hermoso, and in virtue of her exalted station frequently attended the court of
                    Madrid, where she was much admired for her beauty, vivacity, and wit. Tn 1837,
                    having, by the death of the marquis (1835), been again left a widow, she gave
                    her hand to Seiior de Arrom, a member of the bar. This union appears to have
                    been productive of little happiness, and when her husband accepted an
                    appointment as Spanish consul abroad, she decided to remain alone in Seville. It
                    is to the trials and disappointments that came upon her in the later years of
                    her life that the world is indebted for the fascinating works of this
                    distinguished writer, who seems to have been driven to authorship less by any
                    imperious literary instinct than by the necessity she felt for some anodyne
                    against sorrow. Rarely does it happen that literary genius such as she possessed
                    lies dormant for so long a time, unguessed by the world, hardly suspected even
                    by its owner. As early as 1828, indeed, if not earlier, she had committed to
                    writing, in the form of a novel, a tale of peasant life, which she had heard
                    prosaically told under the olive trees at the village of Dos Hermanas, in the
                    neighbourhood of Seville, but singularly enough, she had preferred to make use
                    of the German language, and does not appear to have contemplated publication.
                    Although Washington Irving, in the course of one of his visits to Spain, had
                    seen and praised the manuscript, and had encouraged the writer to cultivate
                    literature, and especially Spanish literature, as a serious pursuit, it was not
                    till many years afterwards that this first effort, <hi rend="italic">La Familia
                    de Alvareda,</hi> was presented to the public; nor was it till after her
                    fiftieth year had been passed that she appeared as an author at all, and even
                    then only under an assumed name. Her first, and in some respects her best,
                    publication. <hi rend="italic">La Gaviota</hi> (The Sea-Gull), was originally
                    printed in short daily instalments in the pages of a Madrid newspaper in 1849.
                    It met with high appreciation in the capital, and was accordingly followed at
                    brief intervals by <hi rend="italic">Elia, Clemenda, La Familia de Alvareda, Una
                    en Otra, Simon Verde,</hi> and other <hi rend="italic">Cuadros de costumbres
                    populares</hi> (pictures of popular life). Slowly but surely the works of the
                    new writer found their way all over the peninsula, and gradually were translated
                    into French and German, until within ten years she had achieved a European
                    reputation. A collected edition of her works in 13 volumes was issued from the
                    royal printing press at Madrid in 1859, and about the same time she received an
                    appointment as governess to the royal children. From 1863 to 1868 she occupied
                    rooms in the palace of the Alcazar,—</p>

                <p>the Hampton Court of Seville. At the revolution of 1868 she removed to private
                    apartments in the Calle de Burgos; and though with advancing years her pen
                    became less busy, she continued with unimpaired faculties to take a keen and
                    kindly, if somewhat needlessly anxious, interest in the important events that
                    were revolutionizing the institutions of her country. Among the numerous schemes
                    of beneficence that busied her, especially in later life, was the promotion of a
                    society for the prevention of cruelty to animals. She was engaged in correcting
                    for the press the last sheets of a compilation of stories, nursery-rhymes,
                    &amp;c., for the use of children <hi rend="italic">(Cuentos, Oraciones,
                    Adivinas, y Refranes populares e infantiles')</hi> when she died in her
                    eightieth year, on April 7, 1877.</p>
                <p>Her works, though numbering about fifty in all, are none of them very large, and
                    she cannot be called a voluminous writer. They all belong to one comparatively
                    brief period of her long and chequered life; and, if classified at all, can be
                    so only by the application of some comparatively artificial criterion. Some deal
                    principally with the features of Andalusian life as it exists among the
                    labourers and peasants; some delineate the higher phases of society; and in
                    others “the interest lies, not in the characters of the persons and the
                    description of scenery and manners, but in the selection of incidents which are
                    intended to point a moral or adorn a proverb.” While all are marked by deep and
                    tender sympathy with nature, by subtle and unerring delineation of character, by
                    a quaint humour that is never far removed from pathos, and by an exquisite‘power
                    of expression, it may safely be said that, as “George Sand” is most delightful
                    when she lovingly depicts the quiet scenes of Berri, the home of her youth, so
                    Fernan Caballero excels in her descriptions of the peasant life of Andalucia.
                    Foreign critics complain not unnaturally of the bitter ultramontane prejudice
                    and the exaggerated <hi rend="italic">Espanolismo</hi> which are so needlessly
                    paraded in almost all her works; yet even this peculiarity, as imparting to
                    these productions of undoubted genius a unique <hi rend="italic">couleur
                    locale,</hi> may fairly enough be held to enhance rather than diminish their
                    value in the eyes of the dispassionate student of the infinitely varied phases
                    of human thought and feeling.</p>
                <p>Besides those already noted, the following stories may be mentioned:— <hi
                    rend="italic">Cuentos y Pocstas populares Andaluces, Un Verano en Pornos, Cosa
                    cumplida solo en la otrd vida, La Estrella de Vandalia, Pobre Dolores,</hi>
                    &amp;c. Her principal works may be found in the <hi rend="italic">Colecaion de
                    Autcrcs Espauoles,</hi> published by Brockhaus, Leipsic. Most of them have been
                    translated into French. <hi rend="italic">La Gaviota</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elia</hi> have been translated into English,—the former by the Honourable
                    Augusta Bethell (1867); <hi rend="italic">La Familia de Alvarcda,</hi> under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">The Castle and the Cottage in Spain,</hi> by Lady
                    Wallace, appeared in 1861, and a second translation, by the Viscount Pollington,
                    was published in 1872. An appreciative and able estimate or Fernan Caballero,
                    with a full analysis of several of her best known works, appeared in the <hi
