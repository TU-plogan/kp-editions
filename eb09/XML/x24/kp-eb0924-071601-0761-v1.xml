                <p><label type="entry">X</label></p>
                <p>X represents the Phoenician letter Samekh, to which the old Ionian Ξ is
                    singularly close in form. This form is familiar to Greek students, because it
                    belongs to the alphabet that superseded the alphabet of the Euboean type which
                    was first in use at Athens. But the Euboean form of the letter was -f- (see
                    Roehl, <hi rend="italic">I.G.A.,</hi> No. 372); and this form went with the
                    Euboean alphabet of Chalcis to the western Hellenic world, and passed in Italy
                    into the form X, which survives with us. The history of the symbol in Italy is
                    not, however, perfectly clear, because in the extremely archaic alphabets of
                    Caere and Formello we find not only -Jbut also a symbol ffi, and this has the
                    place of <hi rend="italic">Xι</hi> in the Ionian alphabet, whereas + stands
                    after U, instead of in its proper place, which has been thus usurped by this
                    huge and otherwise unknown intruder. There would be no difficulty in supposing
                    that + is only a curtailed portion of the fuller form, and that the two survived
                    for a time side by side in the alphabet, perhaps with some differentiation of
                    value, were it not that this is inconsistent with the ultimate derivation of the
                    Italic alphabet from Chalcis, where the large form certainly does not appear.
                    The name <hi rend="italic">Xι</hi> (ksi) is clearly Greek, not, like the names
                    of the letters in general, borrowed from the Phoenician. It is obviously
                    modelled upon Psi, just as Psi was itself modelled upon Pi. The value of the
                    sound in Phoenician was probably a strong sibilant, with a weak guttural
                    preceding. In the old inscriptions of the Aegean Islands—Thera, Naxos,
                    &amp;c.—we find a double symbol K M <hi rend="italic">(i.e., ks);</hi> in Naxos
                    we find also X Σ and BΣ <hi rend="italic">(i.e., hs),</hi> which indicates a
                    guttural breathing before the s; and in old Attic inscriptions also we find
                    XΣ.</p>
                <p>But this same symbol X had another very different value in Greece from <hi
                        rend="italic">l·s,</hi> and by this value, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a
                    guttural aspirate, <hi rend="italic">kh</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> it is
                    familiar to Greek students under the name Chi. This value is confined to
                    alphabets of the Ionian type. In the islands we find KQ or KH, also Φ0 at Thera,
                    digraphs being employed in the same manner as for <hi rend="italic">ks</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">ps.</hi> This same guttural sound is represented in
                    alphabets of the Euboean type under the form j <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> or
                    ψ, which appears naturally in the Caere alphabet, but in the derived Italian
                    alphabets was retained by the Etruscan only. In Greece it was found in Bceotia
                    and the Peloponnesus: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> it appears on the tripod at
                    Delphi set up by the Lacedaemonians to commemorate the victory of Plataeae. But
                    in the Ionic alphabet alone this same symbol has a totally different value, to
                    wit, <hi rend="italic">ps,</hi> and to this value the Greeks gave the name Psi.
                    It is noteworthy that the old Attic way of writing this double sound was φ∑. The
                    origin of this second X and that of its companion Y is very uncertain. The Attic
                    writings above mentioned, and the φ Q of Thera, give colour to the idea that X
                    and Φ may be survivals of a ruder alphabet, superseded by the Phoenician, with
                    the values <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> On the other
                    hand, it does not seem impossible that γ, with the value <hi rend="italic"
                        >ch,</hi> may be a descendant of the useless φ (koppa), obtained by opening
                    out the circle (Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Alphabet,</hi> ii. 93); but the same
                    writer maintains that X is a variation of K, which seems very improbable. It is
                    at least as credible that it is a variant of Samekh, in which the guttural
                    element of the original complex sound superseded the sibilant.</p>
                <p>There is nothing noteworthy in the history of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> in
                    English. In French, when medial, it has generally passed into <hi rend="italic"
                        >ss,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">laisser</hi> (from <hi rend="italic"
                        >laxare)</hi>; and it has the same sound, even when written, as in <hi
                        rend="italic">soixante.</hi> It is frequently found at the end of words
                    owing to a mis-writing, the contraction for final <hi rend="italic">us</hi>
                    having been confounded with it, as in plurals, <hi rend="italic">yeux,
                        animaux,</hi> &amp;c., where the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> has been added
                    again, also in <hi rend="italic">epoux</hi> (esponsus), <hi rend="italic"
                        >faux</hi> (falsus), <hi rend="italic">roux</hi> (russus), &amp;c. Not
                    unnaturally the <hi rend="italic">x</hi> has been substituted still further, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">prix;</hi> in other cases, like <hi rend="italic"
                        >croix,</hi> we have probably a learned imitation of the Latin. Italian also
                    substitutes <hi rend="italic">ss</hi> for <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> as in <hi
                        rend="italic">massimo</hi> for <hi rend="italic">maximus, lussuria,</hi>
                    &amp;c. On <hi rend="italic">x</hi> in Spanish, see vol. xxii. p. 350.</p>
