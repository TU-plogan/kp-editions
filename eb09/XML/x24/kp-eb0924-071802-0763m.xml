                <p><label type="entry">XENOCRATES</label> of Chalcedon, scholarch or rector of the
                    Academy from 339 to 314 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was born in 396.
                    Removing to Athens in early youth, he became the pupil of the Socratic
                    Aeschines, but presently joined himself to Plato, whom he attended to Sicily in
                    361. Upon his master’s death (347 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), in company
                    with Aristotle he paid a visit to Hermias at Atarneus. In 339, Aristotle being
                    then in Macedonia, Xenocrates succeeded Speusippus in the presidency of the
                    school, defeating his competitors Menedemus and Heracleides by a few votes. On
                    three occasions he was member of an Athenian legation, once to Philip, twice to
                    Antipater. Soon after the death of Demosthenes in 322, resenting the Macedonian
                    influence then dominant at Athens, Xenocrates declined the citizenship offered
                    to him at the instance of Phocion, and, being unable to pay the tax levied upon
                    resident aliens, was, it is said, sold, or on the point of being sold, into
                    slavery. He died in 314, and was succeeded as scholarch by Polemon, whom he had
                    reclaimed from a life of profligacy. Besides Polemon, the statesman Phocion,
                    Chaeron tyrant of Pellene, the Academic Crantor, the Stoic Zeno, and Epicurus
                    are alleged to have frequented his lectures.</p>
                <p>Xenocrates’s earnestness and strength of character won for him universal respect,
                    and stories were remembered in proof of his purity, integrity, and benevolence.
                    Wanting in quickness of apprehension and in native grace, he made up for these
                    deficiencies by a conscientious love of truth and an untiring industry. Less
                    original than Speusippus, he adhered more closely to the letter of Platonic
                    doctrine, and is accounted the typical representative of the Old Academy. In his
                    writings, which were numerous, he seems to have covered nearly the whole of the
                    Academic programme; but metaphysics and ethics were the subjects which
                    principally engaged his thoughts. He is said to have invented, or at least to
                    have emphasized, the tripartition of philosophy under the heads of physic,
                    dialectic, and ethic.</p>
                <p>In his ontology Xenocrates built upon Plato’s foundations: that is to say, with
                    Plato he postulated ideas or numbers to be the causes of nature’s organic
                    products, and derived these ideas or numbers from unity (which is active) and
                    plurality (which is passive). But he put upon this fundamental dogma a new
                    interpretation. According to Plato, existence is mind pluralized: mind as a
                    unity, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., universal mind, apprehends its own plurality
                    as eternal, immutable, intelligible ideas; and mind as a plurality, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, particular mind, perceives its own plurality as
                    transitory, mutable, sensible things. The idea, inasmuch as it is a law of
                    universal mind, which in particular minds produces aggregates of sensations
                    called things, is a “determinant” <hi rend="italic">(πέρας</hi> ἔ <hi
                    rend="italic">χον),</hi> and as such is styled “quantity” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ποσόv)</hi> and perhaps “number” (<hi rend="italic">άριθμόs)</hi>; but the
                    ideal numbers are distinct from arithmetical numbers, and the elements of ideal
                    numbers from the elements of arithmetical numbers. Xenocrates, however, failing,
                    as it would seem, to grasp the idealism which was the metaphysical foundation of
                    Plato’s theory <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n764/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0764-0719"/> of natural kinds, took for his principles
                    arithmetical unity and plurality, and accordingly identified ideal numbers with
                    arithmetical numbers. In thus reverting to the crudities of certain Pythagoreans
                    he laid himself open to the criticisms of Aristotle, who, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Metaphysics,</hi> recognizing amongst contemporary Platonists
                    three principal groups—(1) those who, like Plato, distinguished mathematical and
                    ideal numbers; (2) those who, like Xenocrates, identified them; and (3) those
                    who, like Speusippus, postulated mathematical numbers only—has much to say
                    against the Xenocratean interpretation of the theory, and in particular points
                    out that, if the ideas are numbers made up of arithmetical units, they not only
                    cease to be principles but also become subject to arithmetical operations.
                    Xenocrates’s theory of inorganic nature was substantially identical with the
                    theory of the elements which is propounded in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timaeus,</hi> 53 C <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> Nevertheless, holding that every
                    dimension has a principle of its own, he rejected the derivation of the
                    elemental solids—pyramid, octahedron, icosahedron, aud cube— from triangular
                    surfaces, and in so far approximated to atomism. Moreover, to the tetrad of
                    simple elements—namely, fire, air, water, earth—he added the <hi rend="italic"
                    >πέμπτη οὑσία,</hi> ether.</p>
                <p>His cosmology, which is drawn almost entirely from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timaeus,</hi> and, as he intimated, is not to be regarded as a cosmogony,
                    should be studied in connexion with his psychology. Soul is a self-moving
                    number, derived from the two fundamental principles, unity (<hi rend="italic"
                    >ἕv</hi>) and plurality (<hi rend="italic">δυάs</hi> ά <hi rend="italic"
                    >όριστοs),</hi> whence it obtains its powers of rest and motion. It is
                    incorporeal, and may exist apart from body. The irrational soul, as well as the
                    rational soul, is immortal. The universe, the heavenly bodies, man, animals, and
                    presumably plants, are each of them endowed with a soul, which is more or less
                    perfect according to the position which it occupies in the descending scale of
                    creation. With this Platonic philosopheme Xenocrates combines the current
                    theology, identifying the universe and the heavenly bodies with the greater
                    gods, and reserving a place between them and mortals for the lesser
                    divinities.</p>
                <p>If the extant authorities are to be trusted, Xenocrates recognized three grades
                    of cognition, each appropriated to a region of its own, —namely, knowledge,
                    opinion, and sensation, having for their respective objects supra-celestials or
                    ideas, celestials or stars, and infracelestials or things. Even here the
                    mythological tendency displays itself,— <hi rend="italic">νοητά, δοξαστά,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">aίσθητά</hi> being severally committed to Atropos,
                    Lachesis, and Clotho. Of Xenocrates’s logic we know only that with Plato he
                    distinguished <hi rend="italic">τò καθ’ αὑτό</hi> and <hi rend="italic">τò πρόs
                    τι,</hi> rejecting the Aristotelian list of ten categories as a superfluity.</p>
                <p>Valuing philosophy chiefly for its influence upon conduct, Xenocrates bestowed
                    especial attention upon ethics. The catalogue of his works shows that he had
                    written largely upon this subject; but the indications of doctrine which have
                    survived are scanty, and may be summed up in a few sentences. Things are goods,
                    ills, or neutrals. Goods are of three sorts—mental, bodily, external; but of all
                    goods virtue is incomparably the greatest. Happiness consists in the practice of
                    virtue, the requisite powers and opportunities being presupposed. Hence the
                    virtuous man is always happy, though his happiness cannot be perfect unless he
                    is adequately provided with personal aud extraneous advantages. The virtuous man
                    is pure, not in act only, but also in heart. To the attainment of virtue the
                    best help is philosophy; for the philosopher does of his own accord what others
                    do under the compulsion of law. Speculative wisdom and practical wisdom are to
                    be distinguished. Meagre as these statements are, they suflice to show that in
                    ethics, as elsewhere, Xenocrates worked upon Platonic lines, and that in his
                    theory of the relations of external advantages to happiness, as well as in the
                    technicalities of his exposition, he closely resembled Aristotle.</p>
                <p>Xenocrates was not in any sense a great thinker. His metaphysic was a travesty
                    rather than a reproduction of that of his master. His ethic had little which was
                    distinctive. But his austere life and commanding personality made him an
                    effective teacher, and his influence, kept alive by his pupils Polemon and
                    Crates, ceased only when Arcesilaus, the founder of the so-called Second
                    Academy, gave a new direction to the studies of the school.</p>
