                    >apium,</hi><hi rend="italic">άτι.™)</hi> is the collective designation of
                    certain species and varieties of <hi rend="italic">Hedera,</hi> the important
                    alliances of which are <hi rend="italic">Aralia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panax,</hi> which, with some twenty other less-known genera, constitute the
                    natural order <hi rend="italic">Araliaceae.</hi> There are fifty species of ivy
                    recorded in modern books, but they may be reduced to three. The European ivy is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hedera</hi><hi rend="italic">Helix</hi> of Linnaeus (figs.
                    1-3), a plant subject to in finite variety in the forms and colours of its
                    leaves, but the tendency of which is always to a three-lobed form when climbing
                    and a regular ovate form of leaf when producing fruit (fig. 3). The African ivy
                    is <hi rend="italic">II. caηameηsis,</hi> Willd. (fig. 4), otherwise known as
                    the Irish ivy, a native of Africa and the adjacent islands. This also varies,
                    but in a less degree than <hi rend="italic">H Helix,</hi> from which its leaves
                    differ in their larger size, rich deep green colour, and a prevailing tendency
                    to a five-lobed outline. When in fruit the leaves are usually three-lobed, but
                    they are sometimes entire and broadly ovate. The Asiatic ivy is <hi
                    rend="italic">II. colclιica,</hi> Koch (fig. 5), otherwise known as <hi
                    rend="italic">H. raegneriana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">II. ragusina.</hi> This
                    has ovate, obscurely three-lobed leaves of a coriaceous texture and a deep green
                    colour; in the tree or fruiting form the leaves are narrower than in the
                    climbing form, and without any trace of lobes. Distinctive characters are also
                    to be found in the appendages of the pedicels and calyx, <hi rend="italic">H.
                    Helix</hi> having six-rayed stellate hairs, <hi rend="italic">II.
                    canamensis</hi> fifteen-rayed hairs, and <hi rend="italic">II. colchica</hi>
                    yellowish two-lobed scales. A revision of the natural order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hederaceae</hi> by the late Dr B. Seemann will be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of Botany,</hi> 1864-5-6.</p>
                <p>It is of the utmost importance to note the difference <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n550/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0550-0527"/> of characters of the same species of ivy in its
                    two con ditions of climbing and fruiting. The first stage of growth, which we
                    will suppose to be from the seed, is essentially scandent, and the leaves are
                    lobed more or less. This stage is accompanied with a plentiful production of the
                    claspers by means of which the plant becomes attached and obtains support. When
                    it has reached the summit of the tree or tower, the stems being no longer able
                    to maintain a perpendicular attitude fall over and become horizontal or pendent.
                    Coincidently with this change they cease to produce claspers, and the leaves are
                    strikingly modified in form, being now narrower and less lobed than on the
                    ascending stems. In due time this tree-like growth produces terminal umbels of
                    greenish flowers, which are five-divided, with the styles united into a very
                    short one. These flowers are succeeded by smooth black or yellow berries,
                    containing two to five seeds. The yellow-berried ivy is met with in northern
                    India and in Italy, but in northern Europe it is known only as a curiosity of
                    the garden, where, if sufficiently sheltered and nourished, it becomes an
                    exceedingly beautiful and fruitful tree. .</p>
                <p>It is stated in books that same forms of sylvestral ivy never flower, but a
                    negative declaration of this kind is valueless. Sylvestral ivies of great age
                    may be found in woods on the western coasts of Britain that have apparently
                    never flowered, but this is probably to be explained by their inability to
                    surmount the trees supporting them, for until the plant can spread its branches
                    horizontally in full daylight, the flowering or tree-like growth is never
                    formed. As regards the claspers, respecting which various views prevail, they
                    are veritable roots, as may be proved by planting an ivy in a damp fern case,
                    when the claspers acquire a new character and penetrate the soil and perform all
                    the functions of roots, suggesting that the hard felt-like form in which they
                    appear on old ivy stems is the consequence simply of an arrest of development.
                    We occasionally see ivies on towers completely isolated from the soil through
                    the destruction of their stems. In these cases the claspers penetrate the
                    structure, and in the capacity of roots obtain the needful sustenance, and the
                    plant lives though no longer deriving nourishment from the earth.</p>
                <p>A question of great practical importance arises out of the relation of the plant
                    to its means of support. A moderate growth of ivy is not injurious to trees:
                    still the tendency is from the first inimical to the prosperity of the tree, and
                    at a certain stage it becomes deadly. Therefore the growth of ivy on trees
                    should be kept within reasonable bounds, more especially in the case of trees
                    that are of special value for their beauty, history, or the quality of their
                    timber. In regard to buildings clothed with ivy, there is nothing to be feared
                    so long as the plant does not penetrate the substance of the wall by means of
                    any fissure. Should it thrust its way in, the natural and continuous expansion
                    of its several parts will necessarily hasten the decay of the edifice. But a
                    fair growth of ivy on sound walls that afford no entrance beyond the superficial
                    attachment of the claspers is, without any exception whatever, beneficial. It
                    promotes dryness and warmth, reduces to a minimum the corrosive action of the
                    atmosphere, and is altogether as conservative as it is beautiful.</p>
                <p>The economical uses of the ivy are not of great importance. The wood is used by
                    leather cutters to sharpen their knives. From the trunk a resinous substance is
                    obtained called “ivy gum,” which is employed for the relief of toothache. The
                    leaves are eaten greedily by horses, deer, cattle, and sheep, and in times of
                    scarcity have proved useful. The flowers afford a good supply of honey to bees;
                    and, as they appear in autumn, they occasionally make amends for the
                    shortcomings of the season. The berries are eaten by wood pigeons, blackbirds,
                    and thrushes. From all parts of the plant a balsamic bitter may be obtained, and
                    this in the form of <hi rend="italic">hederic acid</hi> is the only preparation
                    of ivy known to chemists.</p>
                <p>In the garden the uses of the ivy are innumerable, and the least known though not
                    the least valuable of them is the cultivation of the plant as a bush or tree,
                    the fruiting growth being selected for this purpose. The variegated tree forms
                    of <hi rend="italic">11. Helix,</hi> with leaves of creamy white, golden green,
                    or rich deep orange yellow, soon prove handsome miniature trees, that thrive
                    almost as well in smoky town gardens as in the pure air of the country, and that
                    no ordinary winter will injure in the least. The tree-form of the Asiatic ivy
                    (Z∕. <hi rend="italic">colclvica)</hi> is scarcely to be equalled in beauty of
                    leafage by any evergreen shrub known to English gardens, and, although in the
                    course of a few years it will attain to a stature of 5 or 6 feet, it is but
                    rarely we meet with it, or indeed with tree ivies of any kind; but little
                    attention hitherto having been given to this subject. The scandent forms are
                    more generally appreciated, and are now much employed in the formation of
                    marginal lines, screens, and trained pyramids, as well as for clothing walls. A
                    very striking example of the capabilities of the commonest ivies, when treated
                    artistically as garden plants, may be seen in the Zoological Gardens of
                    Amsterdam, where several paddocks are enclosed with wreaths, garlands, and bands
                    of ivy in a most picturesque manner.</p>
                <p>The ivies known in gardens number about sixty varieties, the whole of which are
                    figured and described in <hi rend="italic">The Ivy, a Monograph,</hi> by Shirley
                    Hibberd, 1872. To cultivate these is an extremely simple matter, as they will
                    thrive in a poor soil and endure a considerable depth of shade, so that they may
                    with advantage be planted under trees. The common Irish ivy is often to be seen
                    clothing the ground beneath, large yew trees where grass would not live, and it
                    is occasionally planted in graveyards in London to form an imitation of grass
                    turf, for which purpose it is admirably suited.</p>
                <p>The ivy, like the holly, is a scarce plant on the American continent. In the
                    northern United States and British America the winters are not more severe than
                    the ivy can endure, but the summers are too hot and dry, and the requirements of
                    the plant have not often obtained attention. In districts where native ferns
                    abound the ivy will be found to thrive, and the varieties of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hedera</hi><hi rend="italic">Helix</hi> should have the preference. But in the
                    drier districts ivies might often be planted on the north side of buildings,
                    and, if encouraged with water and careful training for three or four years,
                    would then grow rapidly and train themselves. A strong light is detrimental to
                    the growth of ivy, but this enhances its value, for we have no hardy plants that
                    may be compared with it for variety and beauty that will endure shade with equal
                    patience. (s. <hi rend="smallcaps">h.)</hi></p>
