                        Henry</hi></label> (1777-1835), generally known as William Henry Ireland,
                    who at the age of seventeen produced the notorious Shakespeare forgeries, was
                    the son of the subject of last notice, and was born in London in 1777. After
                    spending four years at school in France, he was apprenticed in 1794 to a
                    conveyancer in London. The enthusiasm of his father for everything connected
                    with Shakespeare suggested to young Ireland the idea of delighting him with a
                    forged autograph of the poet. He carefully drew up a copy of an old deed,
                    purporting to be a lease from Shakespeare to certain other parties, and
                    presented it as a genuine document to his unsuspecting father. The complete
                    success of this first attempt and the eager solicitations of his friends to
                    ransack the papers among which he pretended to have found the lease were the
                    incitements to a more ambitious career of literary forgery. He invented a story
                    of a gentleman, accidentally met with, among whose old papers the documents were
                    found, but who, for various reasons, refused to permit his name to be disclosed.
                    A large collection of the most interesting relics was brought to light. A
                    profession of faith, a love-letter, enclosing a lock of the poet’s hair, to Anne
                    Hathaway, private letters to and from Shakespeare, theatrical memoranda, notes
                    of hand and receipts, agreements between Shakespeare and actors, pictures,
                    annotated <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n288/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0288-0273"/> books and tracts—all were produced and
                    received with delighted credulity. Dr Parr, Dr Wharton, Sir Isaac Heard, James
                    Boswell, and others came to register their belief in the authenticity of the
                    papers. The assurance with which the imposture was conducted may be judged from
                    the fact that a deed was brought forward, in which it was set forth that the
                    papers and books had been bequeathed by Shakespeare to a certain contemporary
                    William-Henrye Irelaunde, who had rescued him from drowning in the Thames, and
                    who, there was evidence to show, was the direct ancestor of the Ireland whom
                    chance had thrown in the way of the possessor of the relics. At last a whole new
                    play, named <hi rend="italic">Vortigern,</hi> was announced as having been
                    discovered. Sheridan purchased it for Drury Lane Theatre, and an overflowing
                    house assembled to sit in judgment upon it. But away from the glamour of crabbed
                    handwriting and yellow paper, the feeble dialogue and crude conceptions of the
                    tragedy could not stand the test, and one representation sufficed to prove it a
                    complete failure. Its fate prevented the composition of a series of historical
                    plays, of which <hi rend="italic">Henry II.</hi> had already been produced by
                    the impudent Ireland. Samuel Ireland the elder had published the miscellaneous
                    papers in what he asserts to have been the fullest belief in their authenticity,
                    but the hostile criticism of Malone and others, and the unsatisfactory account
                    of the source of the papers, combined to compel him to demand a full disclosure
                    from his son. Harassed by the success of his own deceit, which had carried him
                    far beyond his first intention, Ireland at last confessed his fraud, and
                    published a tract with a full account in 1796. In 1805 he published more
                    elaborate <hi rend="italic">Confessions,</hi> in which he cannot conceal his
                    satisfied vanity. After the exposure, Ireland was forced to abandon both his
                    home and his profession. He wrote several novels of no value, and gradually sank
                    to the condition of a bookseller’s hack. He died in great penury in April
                    1835.</p>
                <p>The more interesting publications on the Ireland forgeries are :— <hi

                        attributed to Shakespeare,</hi> by Edmond Malone, 1796; <hi rend="italic">An

                    pamphlets by Boaden, Waldron, Wyatt, Webb, and Oulton. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vortigern</hi> was republished in 1832.</p>
