                <p><label type="entry">IRVING, <hi rend="smallcaps">Washington</hi></label>
                    (1783-1859), the first American who obtained a European reputation merely as a
                    man of letters, was born at New York, April 3, 1783. Both his parents were
                    immigrants from Great Britain, his father, originally an officer in the merchant
                    service, but at the time of Irving’s birth a considerable merchant, having come
                    from the Orkneys, and his mother from Falmouth. Irving was intended for the
                    legal profession, but his studies were interrupted by an illness necessitating a
                    voyage to Europe, in the course of which he proceeded as far as Rome, and made
                    the acquaintance of Washington Allston. He was called to the bar upon his
                    return, but made little effort to practise, preferring to amuse himself with
                    literary ventures. The first of these of any importance, a satirical miscellany
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Salmagundi,</hi> written in conjunction with his
                    brother William and J. K. Paulding, gave ample proof of his talents as a
                    humorist. These were still more conspicuously displayed in his next attempt, <hi
                    rend="italic">Knickerbocker's History of Hew York</hi> (1809). The satire of <hi
                    rend="italic">Salmagundi</hi> had been principally local, and the original
                    design of <hi rend="italic">Knickerbockers History</hi> was only to burlesque a
                    pretentious disquisition on the history of the city in a guide-book by Dr Samuel
                    Mitchell. The idea expanded as Irving proceeded, and he. ended by not merely
                    satirizing the pedantry of local antiquaries, but by creating a distinct
                    literary type out of the solid Dutch burgher whose phlegm had long been an
                    object of ridicule to the mercurial Americans. Though far from the most finished
                    of Irving’s productions, <hi rend="italic">Knickerbocker</hi> manifests the most
                    original power, and is the most genuinely national in its quaintness and
                    drollery. The very tardiness and prolixity of the story are skilfully made to
                    heighten the humorous effect. The next few years <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n388/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0388-0373"/> were unproductive. Upon the death of his father,
                    Irving had become a sleeping partner in his brother’s commercial house, a branch
                    of which was established at Liverpool. This, combined with the restoration of
                    peace, induced him to visit England in 1815, when he found the stability of the
                    firm seriously compromised. After some years of ineffectual struggle it became
                    bankrupt. This misfortune compelled Irving to resume his pen as a means of
                    subsistence. His reputation had preceded him to England, and the curiosity
                    naturally excited by the then unwonted apparition of a successful American
                    author procured him admission into the highest literary circles, where his
                    popularity was insured by his amiable temper and polished manners. As an
                    American, moreover, he aroused no jealousy and no competition, and stood aloof
                    from the political and literary disputes which then divided England. Campbell,
                    Jeffrey, Moore, Scott, were counted among his friends, and the last-named
                    zealously recommended him to the publisher Murray, who, after at first refusing,
                    consented (1820) to bring out <hi rend="italic">Geoffrey Crayons Sketch
                    Book,</hi> which was already appearing in America in a periodical form. The most
                    interesting part of this work is the description of an English Christ' mas,
                    which displays a delicate humour not unworthy of the writer’s evident model
                    Addison. Some stories and sketches on American themes contribute to give it
                    variety; of these Rip van Winkle is the most remarkable. It speedily obtained
                    the greatest success on both sides of the Atlantic. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bracebridge Hall,</hi> a work purely English in subject, followed in 1822, and
                    showed to what account the American observer had turned his experience of
                    English country life. The humour is, nevertheless, much more English than
                    American. <hi rend="italic">Tales of a Traveller</hi> appeared in 1821, and
                    Irving, now in comfortable circumstances, determined to enlarge his sphere of
                    observation by a journey on the Continent. After a long course of travel, he
                    settled down at Madrid in the house of the American consul Rich. His intention
                    at the time was to translate Navarrete’s recently published work on Columbus;
                    finding, however, that this was rather a collection of valuable materials than a
                    systematic biography, he determined to compose a biography of his own by its
                    assistance, supplemented by independent researches in the Spanish archives. His
                    work appeared in 1828, and obtained a merited success. It is a finished
                    representation of Columbus from the point of view of the 19th century, affecting
                    neither brilliancy nor originality, but a model of tasteful elegance, felicitous
                    in every detail and adequate in every respect. <hi rend="italic">7'he Companions
                    of Columbus</hi> followed; and a prolonged residence in the south of Spain gave
                    Irving materials for two highly picturesque books, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Conquest of Granada,</hi> professedly derived from the MSS. of an imaginary Fray
                    Antonio Agapida, and <hi rend="italic">The Alhambra.</hi> Previous to their
                    appearance he had been appointed secretary to the embassy at London, an office
                    as purely complimentary to his literary ability as the legal degree which he
                    about the same time received from the university of Oxford. Returning to the
                    United States in 1832, after seventeen years’ absence, he found his name a
                    household word, and himself universally honoured as the first American who had
                    won for his country recognition on equal terms in the literary republic. After
                    the rush of fêtes and public compliments had subsided, he undertook a tour in
                    the western prairies, and returning to the neighbourhood of New York built for
                    himself a delightful retreat on the Hudson, to which he gave the name of
                    “Sunnyside.” His acquaintance with the New York millionaire John Jacob Astor
                    prompted his next important work— <hi rend="italic">Astoria,</hi> a history of
                    the fur-trading settlement founded by Astor in Oregon, deduced with singular
                    literary ability from dry commercial records, and, without laboured attempts at
                    word-painting, evincing a remarkable faculty for bringing scenes and incidents
                    vividly before the eye. <hi rend="italic">Captain Bonneville,</hi> based upon
                    the unpublished memoirs of a veteran hunter, was another work of the same class.
                    In 1842 Irving was appointed ambassador to Spain. He spent four years in the
                    country, without this time turning his residence to literary account; and it was
                    not until two years after his return that Forster’s <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Goldsmith,</hi> by reminding him of a slight essay of his own which he now
                    thought too imperfect by comparison to be included among his collected writings,
                    stimulated him to the production of his own biography of his favourite author.
                    Without pretensions to original research, the book displays an admirable talent
                    for employing existing material to the best effect. The same may be said of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Lives of Mahomet and his Successors,</hi> published two years
                    subsequently. Here as elsewhere Irving has correctly discriminated the
                    biographer’s province from the historian’s, and, leaving the philosophical
                    investigation of cause and effect to writers of Gibbon’s calibre, has applied
                    himself to represent the picturesque features of the age as embodied in the
                    actions and utterances of its most characteristic representatives. His last days
                    were devoted to a biography of Washington, undertaken in an enthusiastic spirit,
                    but which the author found exhausting and his readers tame. His genius required
                    a more poetical theme, and indeed the biographer of Washington must be at least
                    a potential soldier and statesman. Irving just lived to complete this work,
                    dying of heart disease at Sunnyside, on November 28, 1859.</p>
                <p>Although one of the chief ornaments of American literature, Irving is not
                    characteristically an American author. Like most of the Transatlantic writers of
                    his generation, he disappointed expectation by a scrupulous conformity to
                    acknowledged European standards. The American vine had not then begun to produce
                    the looked-for wild grapes. Irving, however, is one of the few authors of his
                    period who really manifests traces of a vein of national peculiarity which might
                    under other circumstances have been productive. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Knickerbocker's History of New York,</hi> although the air of mock solemnity
                    which constitutes the staple of its humour is peculiar to no literature,
                    manifests nevertheless a power of reproducing a distinct national type. Had
                    circumstances taken Irving to the West, and placed him amid a society teeming
                    with quaint and genial eccentricity, he might possibly have been the first
                    Western humorist, and his humour might have gained in depth and richness. In
                    England, on the other hand, everything encouraged his natural fastidiousness; he
                    became a refined writer, but by no means a robust one. At the same time he is
                    too essentially the man of his own age to pass for a paler Addison or a more
                    decorous Sterne. He has far more of the poet than any of the writers of the 18th
                    century, and his moralizing, unlike theirs, is unconscious and indirect. The
                    same poetical feeling is shown in his biographies; his subject is invariably
                    chosen for its picturesqueness, and whatever is unessential to portraiture is
                    thrown into the background. The result is that his biographies, however
                    deficient in research, bear the stamp of genuine artistic intelligence, equally
                    remote from compilation and disquisition. In execution they are almost
                    faultless; the narrative is easy, the style pellucid, and the writer’s judgment
                    nearly always in accordance with the general verdict of history. They will not,
                    therefore, be easily superseded, and indeed Irving’s productions are in general
                    impressed with that signet of classical finish which guarantees the permanency
                    of literary work more surely than direct utility or even intellectual power.
                    This refinement is the more admirable for being in great part the reflection of
                    his own moral nature. Without ostentation or affectation, he was exquisite in
                    all things, a mirror of loyalty, courtesy and good <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n389/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0389-0374"/> taste in all his literary connexions, and
                    exemplary in all the relations of domestic life which he was called upon to
                    assume. He never married, remaining true to the memory of an early attachment
                    blighted by death.</p>
                <p>The principal edition of Irving’s works is the “Geoffrey Crayon,” published at
                    New York in 1880, in 26 vols. His life, accompanied by copious extracts from his
                    correspondence, was published by his nephew Pierre (London, 1862-64, 4 vols. ).
                    A German abridgment of this work has been ably executed by Adolf Laun (Berlin,
                    1870, 2 vols.). There is a good deal of miscellaneous information in a
                    compilation entitled <hi rend="italic">Irvvngitma</hi> (New York, 1860); and
                    Bryant’s memorial oration, though somewhat too uniformly laudatory, may be
                    consulted with advantage. It has been republished in 1880, along with C. Dudley
                    Warner’s introduction to the “Geoffrey Crayon” edition, and Mr G. P. Putnam’s
                    personal reminiscences of Irving, -which originally appeared in the <hi
