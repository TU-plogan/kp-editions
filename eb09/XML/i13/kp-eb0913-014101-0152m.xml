                <p><label type="entry">INSECTS</label></p>
                <p>THE <hi rend="smallcaps">Insecta,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Insects,</hi> form
                    the largest class of that division of the animal kingdom formerly called <hi
                    rend="italic">Articulata,</hi> but for which the more expressive term <hi
                    rend="italic">Arthropoda</hi> (joint-footed) is now more generally employed.
                    This term includes, besides <hi rend="italic">Insecta,</hi> the classes <hi
                    rend="italic">Crustacea, Arachnida,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myriopoda.</hi></p>
                <p>The chief diagnostic characters of an Insect, as combinedly distinguishing it
                    from a Crustacean, an Arachnid, or a Myriopod, are as follows:—Legs usually
                    (never more than) six in number; two antennae; ordinarily two pairs of more or
                    less membranous wings; head, thorax, and abdomen distinctly separated;
                    respiration effected by means of internal tracheae, which communicate with the
                    air by lateral openings termed spiracles or stigmata, or by external plates or
                    filaments (these ordinarily only in the preparatory conditions of aquatic
                    forms), which absorb air and convey it to the tracheae. A reference to the
                    articles on the other classes of <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda</hi> will indicate
                    in what way these diagnostic points are modified in them.</p>
                <p>As in all organized beings, the limits of the class are not strongly defined,
                    for, although it is not difficult to indicate an insect, speaking broadly, there
                    are certain small groups that do not satisfactorily fall into the class as
                    limited by strongly marked lines of demarcation. These will be especially
                    alluded to hereafter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Humber of Species of Insects.—</hi> At the head of this article
                    it is stated that the <hi rend="italic">Insecta</hi> form the largest group of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda</hi>; it might probably be said with justice
                    that they far outnumber all the other members of the animal kingdom combined. It
                    is certain that at the present time 80,000 presumably distinct species of
                    beetles have been described, and it is safe to assume that the number of known
                    species of other orders is greater, thus giving a total of about 200,000. And
                    yet we are only on the threshold of a knowledge of the forms that actually exist
                    in nature, many enormous groups of minute forms being still only very partially
                    studied. In fact, it may be confidently anticipated that some day the number of
                    known forms will not fall far short of 1,000,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquity of Insects.—</hi> Fossil indications have been
                    discovered in the Devonian series, and in the Carboniferous they become rather
                    more numerous; but, with few exceptions, these all belong to those orders in
                    which the metamorphoses are incomplete, and there is no evidence that any
                    antho-philous insects (such as <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymeηoptera)</hi> were then in existence. Ascending the geological
                    scale to the Mesozoic age, the representatives of the older groups become very
                    numerous, and often of gigantic size. <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi> are
                    fairly well indicated; and the flower-loving <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> make their appearance, but in very small
                    numbers. In the Tertiary rocks remains become sometimes very abundant, and of
                    all orders; and in the post-Tertiary or Quaternary period these remains consist
                    largely of those of species now existing. One of the most interesting features
                    in fossil entomology is the well-known occurrence of myriads of insects entombed
                    in the fossil resin known as amber, preserved in the most beautiful manner, and
                    belonging for the most part to genera now existing, but differing specifically.
                    In alluding to this it is well to mention that the insects found in gum copal
                    and other recent resins are, on the contrary, of existing species. As in other
                    animals, and also plants, the fossil remains prove that the distribution of heat
                    and cold on the earth was once very different from what it now is: a fossil
                    beetle of rather large size was discovered by our last Arctic Expedition almost
                    at the highest northern point attained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geographical Distribution.—</hi> It may be asserted that no
                    part of the earth’s surface is without insects. They have been discovered in the
                    Arctic and Antarctic regions at the highest point reached, and even showy
                    butterflies of several species enliven the dreary solitudes of almost
                    everlasting ice, as was abundantly proved by the naturalists of the “Alert” and
                    “Discovery,” who found them almost up to 83° N. lat. But, as a rule, the larger
                    and more brilliant forms occur within the tropics. Yet it must not be assumed,
                    as is sometimes erroneously done, that the majority of tropical insects are
                    large and brilliant, and the smaller and more obscure forms comparatively less
                    numerous. Recent investigations by competent observers show that the latter are
                    at least as abundant in the tropics as in temperate regions, and that it is the
                    wealth of large forms that has caused the others to be overlooked.</p>
                <p>The attempts at subdivision of the globe into zoological regions, so successful
                    with regard to mammals, and in a smaller degree with birds, have not been so
                    entirely satisfactory with regard to insects, more especially as concerns the
                    separation of the Palaearctic and Nearctic regions (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Distribution)</hi>; still there is often a very marked localization in
                    particular groups, which divide themselves specifically to an infinite extent
                    within very circumscribed areas, and are found nowhere else. The results
                    obtained from minute investigation of insular faunae have derived much of their
                    value from insects, and have occasioned much valuable philosophical speculation
                    on the origin both of the islands themselves and. of their faunae and florae.
                    Space will not permit of detailed allusion to the apparent affinity shown by the
                    insect inhabitants of regions now very widely separated, such, for instance, as
                    that of Western Europe with Western (rather than Eastern) North America, of
                    Australia and New Zealand with Chili, of Chili and the southern extremity of
                    South America with the Palaearctic region, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>As special points of distribution may be mentioned the occurrence of insects in
                    hot springs, in brine, in the deepest caves (these are usually blind), below
                    low-water mark, and even on the surface of the ocean (the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Halobates</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Hemiptera) very</hi> far
                    from land.</p>
                <p>The power of many insects to acclimatize themselves rapidly when accidentally
                    introduced into new regions is very marked, and adds to the difficulty often
                    experienced in considering what species are really endemic and what introduced,
                    especially in islands. Some of the common and noxious British species thrive
                    enormously when introduced into Australia and New Zealand; and there is every
                    reason to believe that the grape-vine pest <hi rend="italic">(Phylloxera)</hi>
                    was originally an importation from America.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Duration of Life.—</hi> The maximum duration of the life of a
                    perfect insect is probably attained in bees and ants, the females or queens of
                    which are known to live at least seven years; the minimum is found in some
                    species of May-flies <hi rend="italic">(Ephemeridae),</hi> in which twenty-four
                    hours is perhaps the limit. But the length of life of a perfect insect is
                    sometimes in direct opposition to that of the same insect in its preparatory
                    stages, and some of the <hi rend="italic">Ephemeridae</hi> that live at most but
                    a few days in their aerial form have taken three years to complete their growth
                    in their subaquatic stages. Temperature also has a marked effect on some
                    species. The common house-fly, for instance, will complete its whole life cycle
                    from embryo to fly in a few days in the heat of summer, but requires very much
                    longer in cold weather.</p>

                    this subject. Those who desire an exhaustive résumé cannot do better than
                    consult Kirby and Spence’s delightful <hi rend="italic">Introduction,</hi> even
                    although it may be now somewhat out of date. Some especially noxious
                    species—such, for instance, as the grape-vine pest, the Colorado beetle, and the
                    Rocky Mountain locust—had not then been alluded to as occasioning damage, or
                    were even altogether unknown. As concerns American species, Riley’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Reports on the Noxious, Ac., Insects of Missouri</hi> are mines of
                    information. Amongst insects that are of direct benefit to man the hive-bee and
                    the silk-worm moth stand pre-eminent, and the cochineal and lac insects are
                    scarcely of less importance. No substitutes for silk, honey, and beeswax have
                    been or are likely to be discovered; but, on the other hand, chemical
                    discoveries have now occasioned the disuse of some insect products that were
                    formerly valuable articles of commerce, and in this category nothing is more
                    remarkable than the manner in which the oak-gall of commerce has given way to
                    inorganic substances in the manufacture of ink. As food for man, insects play a
                    very unimportant part, and they can scarcely be said now to form part of the
                    diet of the more highly civilized races, notwithstanding an attempt lately made
                    in America so to utilize the masses of the destructive Rocky Mountain locust.
                    Yet locusts themselves (with other large insects) are eaten raw or cooked by the
                    inhabitants of more than one part of the globe, and the large fleshy grubs or
                    larvae of beetles and other insects are as much esteemed as delicacies by the
                    natives of some countries as the <hi rend="italic">Cossus</hi> (the precise
                    identity of which appears involved in some uncertainty) was by the luxurious
                    Romans. The aborigines of Australia make a cake of the pounded bodies of a
                    night-flying moth <hi rend="italic">(Nοctua spinι),</hi> termed the Bugong moth;
                    the natives of the Lake region of Central Africa make a kind of bread of the
                    multitudes of small dead insects (chiefly <hi rend="italic">Ephemeridae</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Diptera)</hi> that collect on the shores; in Central America
                    the eggs of a large water bug supply materials for a kind of bread.</p>
                <p>Noxious insects are legion, and cannot here be alluded to even in the most
                    general manner. The number of those that cause injury to man by direct attacks
                    is comparatively small; it is by their attacks on the produce of our fields and
                    gardens that insects assert their importance. But it should not be overlooked
                    that the especial province of insects is to act as scavengers, and very
                    frequently they are not the initiating cause of damage, which is rather to be
                    sought in a previously unhealthy condition of the trees or plants; they simply
                    step in to complete the work of destruction commenced by disease or by a low
                    state of the vital functions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Insects and the Fertilization of Plants.—</hi> Such is the
                    importance of insects in the economy of nature, and as conferring indirect
                    benefit on man, in this particular, that this subject might have been alluded to
                    under the preceding heading. That the action of insects in fertilizing plants
                    was often necessary had long been known. But it is owing to the patient and
                    laborious researches of living naturalists (amongst whom the names of Darwin,
                    Hermann Müller, and Lubbock stand prominently forward) that the vast importance
                    of the subject has come to be understood. They have proved incontestably that in
                    a multitude of plants the condition of the reproductive organs is such that
                    selffertilization is impossible; but what is of greater importance is the proof
                    afforded that, although many plants are perfectly capable of self-fertilization,
                    the weight and number of the seeds or fruit are often vastly increased when
                    crossfertilization is effected, and that this is mainly done by the action of
                    insects, the wind and other causes playing only a minor rôle. It may be truly
                    said that such is the correlation between plants and insects that the majority
                    of the former would more or less gradually disappear from the earth’s surface
                    were the latter to be destroyed. In New Zealand the red clover has been
                    introduced and flourishes, but all hopes of spreading it there have to be
                    abandoned; the plant never perfects its seeds, owing to the absence of humble
                    bees, which appear absolutely necessary for its fertilization.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parasitism.—</hi> Among the varied relations of insects to
                    other classes of the animal kingdom and their mutual relations, no subject is
                    more interesting than is that of parasitism. It occurs in almost all the orders,
                    but in very different degrees. Whole groups are naturally epizoic, others
                    entozoic, while a few (such as fleas and bed bugs) can scarcely be arranged in
                    either of these divisions, inasmuch as, although in one sense epizoic, it
                    appears probable that they may occasionally be able to go through the whole of
                    their life cycle without contact with the animals to which they otherwise appear
                    especially attached. As true epizoa the whole group of true lice, <hi
                    rend="italic">Anoρlura</hi> (which are probably degraded <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hemiρtera),</hi> and bird lice <hi rend="italic">(Malloρhagα,</hi> a group of
                    uncertain affinities) are especially familiar. These cannot exist without their
                    hosts, and their whole life is passed on them, each mammal or bird having its
                    especial parasite (or more than one), which affects it only, or is at any rate
                    confined to it and allied species. Such also are certain degraded forms of <hi
                    rend="italic">Diptera,</hi> including the bat parasites <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Nycteribia),</hi> the bird flies <hi rend="italic">(Orηithomyia),</hi> and
                    others. Such also is a curious creature <hi rend="italic">(Platypsylla)</hi>
                    parasitic upon the beaver, the affinities of which are so little marked that it
                    has been formed into a distinct order <hi rend="italic">(Achreioptera)</hi> by
                    Westwood, placed in the <hi rend="italic">Hemiρtera</hi> by Ritsema, and
                    declared to be a true beetle by Leconte. Such also is a curious little moth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Epiρyroρs,</hi> Westwood), an external parasite upon certain
                    homopterous insects; another moth <hi rend="italic">(Tinea vastella)</hi> lives
                    in its larval state on the horns of living animals; and many others might be
                    cited.</p>
                <p>As entozoic insects, the large dipterous family <hi rend="italic">Oestridae</hi>
                    is especially characteristic, all its members living at the expense of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> in very varied manners, the stomach, throat, frontal
                    air passages, the subcutaneous system, and even the genital organs being
                    attacked by various species, but only as larvae, the perfect insects being
                    winged and strong flyers. Furthermore, a genus of <hi rend="italic">Diptera
                    (Batrachomyia)</hi> belonging to quite another family <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mucidae)</hi> is said to attack frogs. It is scarcely just, however, to class
                    as true parasites certain insects whose larvae have been discharged (still
                    living), from the nostrils, intestines, or urethra of man. Many such cases have
                    been perfectly authenticated, but the insects have been such as certainly do not
                    of necessity require such conditions, and these latter are not natural habitats.
                    Accident introduced them, and they were fitted to exist, at any rate for short
                    periods, in the interior of the human body. But the largest class of insect
                    parasitism is that which exists between insects themselves, as exhibited in an
                    enormous number of certain families <hi rend="italic">(fchneumonidae, Evaniidae,

                    >Hymenoptera,</hi> &amp;c. These are essentially parasitic in their preparatory
                    stages, and the parasitism is of the class that may be termed entozoic. The eggs
                    are laid either in or on the bodies of the larvae (chiefly) of other insects,
                    and even in the eggs, the young larvae of the parasites feeding mostly on the
                    adipose tissue of their hosts, often enabling the latter to undergo most of
                    their transformations (but very rarely that to the perfect insect). To such a
                    class, belong also many dipterous insects, chiefly belonging to the <hi

                    scientific travellers have not succeeded in confirming Madame Merian’s
                    well-known statements with regard to the luminosity of the so-called ·
                    lantern-flies <hi rend="italic">{Fulgora),</hi> hence these have to be
                    eliminated from the category of luminous insects. It is among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi> that the phenomenon especially occurs, and in them
                    is almost confined to certain skip-jack beetles (the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrοphοrus),</hi> and probably the entire family of glow-worms <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lampyridae).</hi> The luminosity is confined to certain distinct
                    patches, differing in position and number according to the species and also
                    according to sex,—usually most observable in the female, although this does not
                    appear to be always the case. The property is distinctly under the control of
                    the insect, and is often exercised in an intermittent manner at stated
                    intervals, when the insects are not under the influence of extraordinary
                    excitement. It is probable that luminosity exists in some <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diρtera,</hi> and also in the larvae of certain exotic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera,</hi> a recent traveller having assured us that in South America a
                    larva of this order has luminous patches along either side, so that when in
                    motion it has been compared to a lighted-up railway train. Some occasional
                    instances of luminosity appear to be accidental, probably owing to the insects
                    having been feeding upon, or otherwise in contact with, decaying phosphorescent
                    matter. With regard to the nature of the luminous substance no very precise
                    results have been arrived at by investigators. That it is phosphorus in some
                    form or other appears certain, and the latest experimenter (Jousset de Bellesme)
                    asserts as his belief that it is no other than phosphoretted hydrogen gas stored
                    up in the cellular tissue, and in direct communication with the nervous and
                    respiratory systems.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Galls.—</hi> These well-known insect-productions are alluded to
                    chiefly in order to call attention to the mystery that surrounds their growth.
                    Galls are occasioned by the presence of the larvae of certain species in nearly
                    all orders of true insects, though it is amongst the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynipidae</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Hymeηoptera</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cecidomyiidae</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> that they are most
                    characteristic. And they may be in almost any position on a plant, according to
                    the species of gall-maker. The most striking, however, are clearly modified leaf
                    or flower-buds.</p>
                <p>The mystery surrounding galls is their cause. The indirect cause is the puncture
                    of the insect, and the presence of its eggs or larvae, but no explanation has
                    been offered of the reason why this presence sets up the growth termed a gall.
                    Two insects of differing species will deposit their eggs in the same position:
                    in the one case no abnormal growth follows; in the other some peculiar
                    irritation sets up a tumour, often enormous in size. Two insects, also of
                    different species, but both gall-makers, do the same: in both cases a tumour
                    ensues, but its form is totally different in the two. A most noticeable recent
                    discovery is that by Dr Adler (since confirmed by others) to the effect that in
                    certain European <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae,</hi> dimorphism to a remarkable
                    extent occurs, and that certain genera are only conditions of others, the two
                    forms of insects, and the totally different galls occasioned by them, being
                    alternate in appearance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">External Structure.—</hi> Taking any large insect, we recognize
                    in it three more or less distinctly separated divisions, the head, thorax, and
                    abdomen. Taking the majority of insects, and especially of their larvae, we
                    recognize thirteen segments or somites, counting the head as one, the thorax as
                    consisting of three, and the abdomen as nine. From a classificatory point of
                    view, it is probably convenient to retain this idea, though in the abdomen of a
                    dragon-fly (for instance) there are 10 quite distinct segments. But, seen in the
                    light of embryology and morphology, a different aspect is put on. The abdomen in
                    the embryo of some insects clearly consists of 11 segments. Moreover if each
                    appendage of the head be considered as a modified limb, we get in some insects
                    as many as 7 segments in this portion of the body alone. Thus although 13
                    segments is a usual and convenient number as regards the structure of an insect,
                    this number must be vastly increased if we consider the animal in regard to
                    other divisions of the Arthropod series. In the abdomen the actual number is
                    sometimes very much reduced, owing to several of the segments becoming
                    obsolescent, coalescent, or retracted.</p>
                <p>The exoskeleton, or outer covering, is more or less hornlike in its nature. But
                    its elements are by no means similar to those of either horns or bones. It is
                    composed to a varying extent of phosphate of lime, with the addition of a
                    peculiar substance termed <hi rend="italic">chitine,</hi> especially
                    characteristic of, though not strictly confined to, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insecta.</hi> According to recent analysis, the constituents of chitine are

                <p>The head, or anterior of the three main divisions of the body, of a perfect
                    insect is of very varying form and structure, both as regards outline, the
                    condition of its attachment to the trunk, and the details of its special
                    appendages. No account of these variations can be given here; they will be
                    briefly alluded to in the classificatory portion of this article. The various
                    organs and appendages may be stated as follows. On each side of the anterior
                    portion are inserted two long and usually multi-articulate processes termed
                    “antennae,” which are tubes containing nerve-prolongations and tracheae, and
                    undoubtedly associated in a high degree with the special senses; but,
                    notwithstanding all the controversy on the subject that has existed and still
                    exists, we do not yet know clearly what is their special function. They have
                    been considered organs of touch, of hearing, of smell, or simply as balancers
                    assisting and directing flight. No one who has watched the proceedings of many
                    insects (and especially of ants), when meeting others of their kind, can doubt
                    that they act in some way (but perhaps not in all insects) as means of
                    intercommunication, and thus take a high rank as important structures. They are,
                    as a rule, much less developed in those insects having very large eyes; and in
                    the larvae of those that undergo a complete metamorphosis they are usually
                    rudimentary only, notwithstanding their often enormous development in the
                    perfect insects produced from the same larvae.</p>
                <p>The compound eyes are two in number (though each is occasionally divided into two
                    portions), usually of large, sometimes of enormous size, and each consisting of
                    very numerous facets, which but indicate the faces of so many independent
                    angular tubes separated by layers of pigment. In the larval state the eyes are
                    ordinarily simple, and each eye is usually a congregation of separate eye-spots.
                    Besides the compound eyes, there are two or three (or no) small simple eyes,
                    “ocelli”or “stemmata,” each with a simple nerve, and never present in the larvae
                    or (probably) pupae.</p>
                <p>The organs of the lower surface of the head are of a most complicated nature, and
                    are excessively modified according as the insect takes nutriment by biting or by
                    sucking. Below the eyes is the “front”; this is succeeded by a piece termed the
                    “clypeus”(or “epistome” or “nasus”), which is followed by the “labrum” or upper
                    lip. On either side are the “mandibles” (usually dentate within) articulated to
                    the cheeks, and below these a second pair of jaws, compound in structure, and
                    consisting of a hinged base, afterwards frequently dividing into two portions,
                    the “maxillae” and maxillary lobes, and provided externally with articulated
                    appendages known as the maxillary palpi. Below the mouth is the “labium” with
                    its labial palpi, articulated to the “mentum” or chin-piece; lying within this
                    lower <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n155/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0155-0144"/> mouth-covering ia the “lingua” or tongue. The
                    same general arrangement is present throughout all insects, and also in the
                    larval and pupal stages; but the differing conditions of the food cause extreme
                    modification, not only between differing groups or orders of the perfect
                    insects, but also in the metamorphic stages of the one and the same species. In
                    some insects there are additional small structures, such as the
                    “paraglossae.”</p>
                <p>The “thorax” is the next main division. It is composed of three distinct
                    portions, the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax, all subject to excessive
                    modifications; but the last is, on an average, the smallest; at any rate it
                    seldom exceeds the intermediate, and is usually very much smaller. According to
                    surface, each portion receives two different names; thus the upper side consists
                    of the pronotum, mesonotum, and metanotum, the lower of the prosternum,
                    mesosternum, and metasternum. It will be noticed also that each subdivision is
                    again subdivided by more or less distinct grooves, especially above and on the
                    sides, indicating its compound nature, and each of these has its special term,
                    so that some authors go so far as to say that each thoracic division is formed
                    of nine separate pieces (a text book on entomology, which this article cannot
                    be, should be consulted as to these). In those insects in which the wing-power
                    is great, the attachments of the muscles are strongly indicated externally.</p>
                <p>The appendages of the thorax are the legs and wings. The legs are articulated
                    members, of which one pair is attached to the sides of each subdivision. All
                    true insects have but six actual legs, but in the larvae of some orders there
                    are simple fleshy prolegs on the abdominal segments, considered as representing
                    the homologues of those abdominal legs so conspicuous in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myriopoda.</hi> Of the true legs the anterior (or prothoracic) pair are
                    directed forward, the two other pairs backward. Each leg consists of a basal
                    joint or coxa (frequently not movable) inserted in sockets termed the acetabula;
                    this is followed by a small joint termed the trochanter placed between the coxa
                    and femur or thigh, which is ordinarily the largest joint, and is enormously
                    developed in saltatorial insects. To this succeeds the tibia, followed again by
                    the tarsus, which is ordinarily compound, but may consist of any number of
                    joints from one to five. The tarsus is terminated by a pair (seldom one only) of
                    claws, between which are more or less membranous arolia or plantulae (much
                    marked in the feet of <hi rend="italic">Diptera,</hi> which climb polished
                    surfaces, &amp;c., by means of them), and also a pulvillus or cushion.</p>
                <p>Wings are appendages of the mesothorax and metathorax (never of the prothorax),
                    and, viewed simply as organs of locomotion, may be considered as expansions of
                    the integument, though some morphologists object to this simple definition, and
                    one at least (F. Plateau) regards them as tracheal extensions. Although in all
                    orders there are cases in which they are never developed, the exceptions being
                    so few as abundantly to prove the rule, yet the posterior (or “hind” or “under
                    ”) pair may be absent, and the anterior (or “fore” or “upper ”) ample. So
                    strongly are they attributes of a perfect insect, that in some cases in which
                    neither pair is developed the creatures strongly incline to retain their larval
                    form. Normally the first external indications may be said to appear in the pupal
                    stage (but we will show that in insects with imperfect metamorphoses the line of
                    demarcation between larva and pupa is not marked), and they only attain their
                    full development some little time after the exclusion of the perfect insect. A
                    wing consists of an upper and lower membrane (readily separable in a recently
                    excluded insect, or afterwards by maceration), strengthened by more or less
                    numerous strong ribs, more or less connected transversely, termed nervures or
                    veins (neither term being very appropriate), which are chitinous tubes
                    (containing special tracheae), through which the blood circulates. The varying
                    condition of the wings will be alluded to in the systematic portion of this
                    article, as also to some extent the scheme of neuration, one of the most
                    important factors in systematic entomology, but rendered unsatisfactory iu
                    consequence of the utterly different nomenclature employed by writers on special
                    orders, though doubtless the general scheme is capable of being homologized.</p>
                <p>The last of the three great divisions of the body is the abdomen, which consists
                    of a number of segments (normally nine), having an upper (dorsum) and lower
                    (venter) chitinous surface, which two surfaces (in the most characteristic
                    condition) are connected by a membranous lateral line, with lateral stigmata or
                    spiracles. But almost every conceivable modification is presented both in its
                    attachment to the thorax, its general outline, and the number of segments
                    present. Of the appendages of the abdomen it is necessary to say but little. In
                    a perfect insect there are no abdominal legs, and rarely any indications of
                    breathing plates (so usual in some groups of aquatic larvae). The appendages are
                    therefore almost entirely connected with the sexual apparatus, which vary
                    enormously, and occasionally there are terminal articulated thread-like tails,
                    strongly simulating antennae both in form and structure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nervous System.—</hi> This may be said to consist of a more or
                    less double cord lying along the ventral portion of the body, connected at
                    intervals by thickened masses termed ganglia. But the large mass in the head is
                    termed the brain, in contradistinction to the others. The brain usually consists
                    of a bilobed mass giving off nerve masses to the eyes, and threads to the other
                    cephalic appendages or organs; recent researches prove that, at any rate in some
                    cases, the brain has convolutions analogous to those of the higher animals.
                    Immediately below the brain is a large ganglion, usually termed the
                    infra-cesophagal, connected with the mouth organs and digestive functions. Then
                    follow, in the thorax and abdomen, a series of ganglia, each of which gives off
                    numerous lateral threads. But the number of these ganglia varies very greatly,
                    not only in insects of different orders, or in species of the same order, but
                    also in the larvae, pupae, and perfect insects of the same species; and it is
                    impossible to enter here into the most rudimentary analysis of these variations.
                    It has been said that normally there should be a ganglion for each segment (or
                    for each movable segment) of the body, and to some extent this would appear to
                    hold good, for, in those insects in which some of the segments coalesce, a
                    similar arrangement is seen in the system of ganglia, but this would not appear
                    to be a universal law, and in some the abdominal ganglia are virtually obsolete.
                    Similar variations exist in the extent to which the double central column
                    becomes united or remains divided. In addition to this column, a simple
                    sympathetic nerve is also distinguished, without ganglia, but giving off threads
                    to the respiratory and other systems. This lies above the main ganglionic chain.
                    In minute structure the nervous cord of the <hi rend="italic">Tnsecta</hi> is
                    analogous to that of higher animals. The simplicity of the nervous system has
                    caused it to be believed that insects do not suffer pain in the sense of that
                    experienced by higher animals, and their behaviour when subjected to treatment
                    that should cause intense pain, in the ordinary sense of the word, appears to
                    warrant such an opinion; but the existence of such a condition cannot be held to
                    justify wanton cruelty. Those who desire minute information on the nervous
                    system should especially consult Newport’s article “Insecta” in Todd’s <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Respiratory System.—</hi> Respiration by tracheae is one of the
                    main characteristics of an insect. Tracheae are tubes ramifying in the interior
                    of the body, the walls of which are composed of two membranes with a spiral
                    thread between, and extending into the wings and other appendages; but in the
                    perfect insect the main tracheae are subject to modification, and are more or
                    less expanded into vesicles to suit the requirements of creatures with great
                    powers of flight, or of strong movement in other ways. The manner in which air
                    is communicated to these tracheae, in order that the necessary oxygen may be
                    obtained from it, is twofold in its nature. In insects that live in free air the
                    latter is received through lateral openings termed spiracles or stigmata, which
                    vary in number in different insects, but there is usually one on each side of
                    most of the segments. A spiracle usually consists of a longitudinal slit in a
                    membrane, protected by delicate mechanism, and also by special muscles, which
                    can close it hermetically if necessary. Many aquatic insects also breathe
                    through spiracles, and in these cases a quantity of air is collected (or
                    entangled) in delicate pubescence on the surface of the body, the insect coming
                    to the surface to obtain a fresh supply at intervals. But in the majority of
                    aquatic insects, and especially of their larvae or pupae, air is obtained by
                    means of external threads or plates, expansions of the integument, the function
                    of which is to absorb air from water and convey it to the tracheae by means of
                    delicate ramifications of the tracheal system in their substance. The number and
                    position of these external appendages (or branchiae) is as varied as are the
                    conditions under which the insects live; in some only a single elastic tube is
                    present, which can be protruded to the surface of the water, and its length
                    adapted to the varying depth of that element; in some (as in many dragon-flies)
                    the plates are in the rectum, and the air is obtained by the forcible taking iu
                    and expulsion of water by means of powerful anal valves (which serve also for
                    locomotion). It is obvious that those larvae that exist parasitically in the
                    substance of the body of other larvae, &amp;c., must still obtain air, and it is
                    presumed that this is sometimes effected at the expense of the respiratory
                    system of their hosts. It has long been known that rudimentary branchiae exist
                    in aerial insects, and, though this was at one time supposed to be an attribute
                    of one or two forms only, it is now known to occur frequently. According to the
                    researches of Gegenbaur and Palmén, those branchiae exist side by side with the
                    ordinary spiracles; hence they conclude that there is no direct connexion
                    between the branchial system of the larva and the spiracles of the imago. It is
                    still perhaps an open question whether these branchiae in the imago serve any
                    functional purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alimentary and Digestive Systems.—</hi> The food of insects is
                    either solid or liquid, and the parts of the mouth are modified, according to
                    requirements, into two main conditions, termed mandibulate and haustellate; but
                    the latter term is somewhat vague, inasmuch as the modifications are by no means
                    homologous in all haustellate insects, although the structure is subservient to
                    the same function. Again, in both divisions the food may be either vegetable or
                    animal in its nature, and according as this may be the parts of the digestive
                    system are modified. The most simple digestive system consists merely of a tube
                    extending from mouth to anus, with no very distinct division into parts. But in
                    insects the arrangement is considerably more complex, yet varying enormously.
                    The most complete system consists of oesophagus, with the salivary glands
                    (modified into silk-producing glands in <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera,</hi>
                    &amp;c.), crop or proventriculus, gizzard, stomach, small and large intestines,
                    and an arrangement of small canals termed the Malpighian tubes. Some authors
                    distinguish also other divisions of the intestines answering to those of higher
                    animals. By some the term proventriculus is applied to the crop, by others to
                    the gizzard. The gizzard is usually absent in haustellate insects; but, as most
                    of these are truly mandibulate in their larval stage, much modification is
                    undergone during metamorphosis. The digestive secretion of all parts of the
                    system appears to be essentially alkaline, and assimilation goes on from all
                    (excepting perhaps the lower intestine) <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with
                    digestion, the latter being commenced iu the crop. The Malpighian tubes are a
                    set of long slender vessels (varying much in number) situated in the lower
                    portion of the system at the junction of the small and large intestines. Their
                    function has been warmly contested amongst physiologists, many considering them
                    biliary organs, while probably an equal number maintain they are solely urinary,
                    and a few hold that both these functions may be attributed to them. The recent
                    researches of Plateau and others are in favour of their being solely urinary.
                    Von Siebold has asserted that the biliary system consists of certain cells in
                    the walls of the stomach. It is possible the whole intestinal canal is at times
                    called upon to play a rôle quite independent of digestion and assimilation; it
                    may be made subservient to metamorphosis through being distended with air, thus
                    assisting the rupture of the integuments for the escape of the imago; but this
                    can probably only obtain in insects with incomplete metamorphoses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Circulatory System.—</hi> Almost as much uncertainty exists, or
                    has existed, as to the true nature of this system as in other points of internal
                    structure and physiology. Originally it was believed that no circulatory system
                    existed, an idea that was speedily dissipated. If we examine a larva of which
                    the integuments are tolerably transparent, we perceive, even without dissection,
                    a large vessel running along the dorsal portion of the creature just beneath the
                    integument, and we perceive also that it distinctly pulsates. This is the
                    “dorsal vessel” or “heart,” and it terminates anteriorly in a cephalic aorta.
                    Examined more minutely by dissection, it is seen to consist of a number of
                    chambers and constrictions, each chamber having a lateral valvular opening on
                    either side, through which the blood is received into the vessel by regular
                    currents and conveyed to the cephalic aorta, whence it escapes into the body in
                    currents which have no vascular walls, and is again received into the dorsal
                    vessel from lateral currents, —such, at least, is the most generally received
                    opinion. Certain it is that the blood (which is ordinarily a colourless liquid)
                    circulates through all parts of the body, even to the antennae, legs, and wings,
                    and the circulation can be well observed in the wings of some insects in which
                    these organs are unusually transparent, in that case distinctly following the
                    course of the nervures. But many physiologists have believed that the blood is
                    conveyed over the body by means of the tracheae, some distinguishing certain
                    tracheae to which this function alone, and not that of respiration, is proper.
                    The majority of these, however, state that the blood simply flows between the
                    two integuments of which the walls of a trachea are composed, and to this system
                    the term “peritracheal” has been given. According to the results obtained from
                    the experiments of the most recent observers, we prefer to doubt the existence
                    of this peritracheal circulation. The relative frequency of pulsations varies
                    much according to the insect and its state of activity or excitement. They
                    disappear almost entirely in insects in a state of hibernation, and are much
                    reduced in the pupae of those that undergo complete metamorphoses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Muscular System.—</hi> The muscles are attached to the inner
                    side of the chitinous integument, and lie just beneath it. They are composed of
                    numerous parallel fibres without any tendinous sheaths, but the fibres are
                    apparently sometimes united at their extremity into a kind of tendon, which has

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0157-0146"/> been considered as only an extension of the
                    chitinous integument. According to their position and function, they act
                    variously, as do those of higher animals, and have received similar names. Their
                    number is often enormous, and when we consider the great powers of flight, or of
                    locomotion by other means, possessed by many insects, it is not difficult to
                    understand that their strength must be proportionately great. Lyonet’s
                    celebrated treatise on the anatomy of <hi rend="italic">Cossus</hi> remains a
                    masterpiece of research on this subject, and in England Lubbock’s recent memoir
                    on the subcutaneous muscles of <hi rend="italic">Pygaera bucephala</hi> is
                    equally remarkable, and should be studied by those desiring minute information
                    on the complex muscular system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Generative System.—</hi> In all insects the sexes are separate.
                    True hermaphrodites do not exist, though individual monstrosities, in which the
                    form, coloration, and even internal organization of both sexes are combined, are
                    not rare. The external organs are placed at or near the extremity of the
                    abdomen, and are usually accompanied by secondary or accessory appendages often
                    of most complex structure, serving to ensure complete contact during the sexual
                    act, and probably also to some extent excitatory. In the dragon-flies, however,
                    the intromittent organ of the male is in the under side of the second abdominal
                    segment, which explains the extraordinary position of the sexes when coupled. In
                    the male the testes are very varied in form, ordinarily separated, but sometimes
                    united into one mass, each of the two halves of which has its special duct. But
                    the separate form is by far the most usual. As in higher animals, there are the
                    usual parts, the <hi rend="italic">ductus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ejaculatorius,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">vesiculae seminales,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">vasa deferentia,</hi> the conditions of which vary infinitely in
                    different insects. Whether the intromittent organ is always traversed by an
                    inner canal or not is a little doubtful. Ordinarily such is no doubt the case,
                    but in others it would appear probable that the <hi rend="italic">ductus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ejaculatorius</hi> does not end absolutely in the organ, and that
                    a groove on the surface of the latter receives the sperm. Some such arrangement
                    must certainly exist in dragon-flies, in which the testes and the opening of the
                    duct have no direct connexion with the intromittent organ. In the female the
                    ovaries occupy much of the abdomen that is not taken up by the intestinal canal.
                    Each consists of a very varying number of tubes, branching off externally, in
                    which the eggs are contained; these eggs are conveyed by oviducts, and before
                    extrusion receive the fertilizing fluid stored in the spermatheca, which latter
                    may be simple or compound; they pass out by the vagina. In close connexion with
                    these parts in the female is the poison gland and sting found in some insects.
                    In the gravid female of <hi rend="italic">Termes</hi> the ovaries become
                    enormously distended, so that the entire insect may be said to consist of little
                    else than eggs. The rudiments of the sexual organs may be detected in the larva
                    when in a very young state, and the sex of the future perfect insect
                    determined,—a sufficient answer to those who assume that sex can be controlled
                    by the nutriment furnished to the larva. It was formerly considered that,
                    pairing once effected, the male died almost immediately, and the female followed
                    after having deposited her eggs. Recent observations go to prove that this is to
                    a large extent erroneous, that pairing may be effected several times by both
                    sexes (the female laying her eggs intermittently), in effect that polygamy and
                    polyandry exist.</p>
                <p>There are certain anomalous conditions of the generative system that may be
                    conveniently noticed here, under different headings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Neuters or Workers.—</hi> In bees, wasps, and ants, and also in
                    <hi rend="italic">Termes</hi> (or white ants), the majority of the members of a
                    colony is made up of individuals which as a rule have no reproductive powers. In
                    the first three, these are aborted females, and it has been proved (at any rate
                    for ants) that occasionally these workers lay eggs, which, however, always
                    produce males, the production of a queen depending apparently upon special
                    feeding in the larval stage. In <hi rend="italic">Termes</hi> the conditions are
                    different. There are both workers and soldiers, both incapable of reproduction,
                    but not exclusively consisting of aborted females, since both sexes are
                    represented. Also in <hi rend="italic">Termes</hi> there are what have been
                    termed complementary males and females, distinct from the pair that were once
                    supposed to be the exclusive founders of a new colony; of these the females lay
                    comparatively few eggs, their ovaries not acquiring the extraordinary
                    development of those of the true queen.</p>

                    there is a well-authenticated instance of an Australian insect closely allied to
                    the clothes-moth bringing forth larvae already hatched. A similar condition is
                    asserted to exist in a species of cockroach. In <hi rend="italic"

                    frequently male. This property varies considerably in details. In the case of
                    the bee or the ant, it would appear that one impregnation suffices for the life
                    of the queen (which may last for seven or eight years), but the power of
                    producing females does not probably extend beyond the immediate influence of the
                    impregnation. In some hymenopterous gall-flies a true alternation probably
                    sometimes occurs, combined with dimorphism; but absolute parthenogensis, in
                    which females are produced generation after generation, is the common condition
                    in many lepidopterous insects. This process is effected by internal budding. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aphides</hi> the conditions are still more remarkable,
                    owing to the existence -of both winged and apterous forms of both sexes, and of
                    both oviparous and viviparous generation; but it is not proved that the same
                    individual insect is capable of producing both forms. In the case of the minute
                    fly <hi rend="italic">(Miastor metroloas)</hi> mentioned above, the production
                    of larvae from larvae is continued throughout the winter and spring, until in
                    June the brood goes through its ordinary metamorphosis, and results in mature
                    males and females, and so the cycle recommences. Of all the marvels in the
                    history of insects, this is the most astonishing; no wonder that the assertions
                    of R. Wagner (the discoverer) were met with incredulity from the best
                    physiologists until abundantly confirmed by others, and in other species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses.—</hi> Hundreds of volumes have been written on
                    this fascinating subject, one or more of which are in almost every library;
                    hence there is no necessity for giving more than a rudimentary outline here. All
                    true insects may be said to undergo a metamorphosis. Such a condition is absent
                    in the small groups known as <hi rend="italic">Thysaηura</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Collembola;</hi> and, although these are here retained amongst <hi
                    rend="italic">Insecta</hi> as a matter of convenience, the writer is disposed to
                    agree with Lubbock that they are outside the pale of true insects. Metamorphosis
                    may be broadly grouped into two main divisions—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n158/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0158-0147"/>
                <p>(1) that in which the larva changes into a pupa which, as a rule, is inactive,
                    and which never eats, and (2) that in which there is no true pupa state, the
                    animal continuing active, and eating, from the egg to the perfect insect. In the
                    former the larva changes its skin, or moults, several (often many) times before
                    it changes to the pupa, the last moult (or ecdysis) happening when it is in what
                    may be called the pseudo-pupal condition (which may last from a few hours to
                    several months) immediately before the pupa state is assumed; this division is
                    usually characterized as “metabolic.” In the latter ecdysis goes on continuously
                    at intervals from the egg to the winged-insect, and the form of the larval
                    condition much resembles that of the perfect, the wings budding out gradually as
                    the creature approaches maturity; the term “hemimetabolic” is applied to this
                    division. In the first division the conditions are rather more varied than in
                    the second. In the pupa of some <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> the larval skin
                    hardens, and within this the true pupa is formed (such a pupa is termed
                    “coarctate ”); in other <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> the pupa is not contained
                    within the larval skin (which much resembles a true cocoon), but is free and
                    even sometimes active, the various appendages not being connected with the body,
                    as is usually the case in that of a lepidopterous insect. The pupae of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coleopter a</hi> are also
                    much in the same condition, but they are not strictly active. Many writers have
                    attempted to draw a broad distinction between such a pupa as that of a moth and
                    that of an ant-lion or caddis-fly, cited here as extremes, because in the latter
                    the members are free, and the pupa is really active shortly before the change
                    into the perfect state, and thus the metamorphosis is supposed to be in some
                    respects intermediate between that of true <hi rend="italic">Metabola</hi> and
                    true <hi rend="italic">Hemimetabolα.</hi> But such distinctions are more
                    apparent than real. In many of the small moths the limbs and other appendages
                    are scarcely consolidated with the body, but simply concealed in sheaths of
                    which the ends at any rate are free. Also in the second (or hemimetabolic)
                    division distinction has been drawn between the larva of a May-fly and that of a
                    bug (as instances), because the changes from an absolutely apterous condition to
                    one in which the wings are rudimentary and from this to the perfect state are
                    more marked in the latter. This is probably due to the number of moults being
                    less; the form with rudimentary wings is in no way a true pupa.</p>
                <p>The metamorphosis of the internal organs, and even of the mouth parts, is much
                    more marked in the <hi rend="italic">Metabola</hi> than in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hemimetabola.</hi> Respiration is maintained by means of spiracles or
                    branchiae, as in larvae.</p>
                <p>“Hypermetamorphism” is a term applied to certain conditions in which the larva at
                    one period of its life assumes a very different form and habit from those of
                    another period. Such a condition exists in several <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coleoptera,</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">Meloe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cantharis,</hi> in which the larva is at first very active, with long legs,
                    slender form, and anal setae, and attaches itself to the bodies of bees,
                    afterwards becoming almost apodal, short, and stout, and living in the
                    bees’-nests. Other <hi rend="italic">Cantharidae</hi> live in the egg-tubes of
                    <hi rend="italic">Orthoptera.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Sitaris a</hi> still
                    more remarkable intermediate condition has been observed: the larva after having
                    attained its second condition assumes that of the coarctate pupa of a fly, from
                    which it changes again to a state more analogous to the second condition before
                    finally transforming to a pupa. This kind of metamorphosis has been closely
                    observed by Newport, Fabre, Lichtenstein, Riley, and others. Brauer has recorded
                    a somewhat similar condition in the larva of <hi rend="italic">Mantispa
                    (Neuroptera),</hi> which is at first free and very active, and afterwards
                    becomes nearly apodal and obese, and lives parasitically in the nests of
                    spiders. Advanced evolutionists hold the idea that larvae are only acquired
                    conditions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Classification.</hi></p>
                <p>It is necessary to reduce what may be termed the systematic portion of this
                    article to the smallest possible limits. The various orders are noticed under
                    separate articles, and similar articles are devoted to the consideration of many
                    of the more prominent, interesting, and familiar insects. All we can do here is
                    to allude briefly to classification as a whole, with indications of the higher
                    groups under each order. We also have nothing to do here with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crustacea, Arαchnida,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myriopoda,</hi> now considered
                    as distinct classes, although American writers have recently again included the
                    last two in <hi rend="italic">Insecta</hi> as orders, placing the more
                    subordinate groups (or orders in the general acceptation of the term) as
                    suborders. Still more impossible is it for us to enter into an examination of
                    the history of classification; those of our readers who are specially interested
                    in this subject cannot do better, than consult vol. iv. of Kirby and Spence’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Introduction to Entomology,</hi> where a most full and
                    painstaking “history of entomology” is to be found up to the date (1826) at
                    which it was published; or they may consult with equal advantage Westwood’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Introduction to Modern Classification,</hi> and Burmeister’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Manual of Entomology</hi> (Shuckard’s English translation). The
                    different classifications proposed by authors mainly resolve themselves under
                    three headings,— the “metamorphotic” (of which Swammerdam may be considered the
                    founder), the “alary” (or wing-system, due to Linnaeus), and the “cibarian” (or
                    mouth-system, originating with, or at any rate elaborated by, Fabricius). The
                    metamorphotic system divides insects into those that undergo complete and
                    incomplete metamorphoses; the alary is based upon the presence of two or four
                    wings, or their absence altogether; the cibarian depended upon the conditions of
                    the mouth organs, and more especially as to their being fitted for biting or
                    sucking (mandibulate or haustellate). But experience proved that each of these
                    systems had its defects; there were always some groups, of more or less
                    importance and extent, that would never fit satisfactorily into any of the
                    proposed systems. To remedy this varying means were adopted, such as à
                    combination of the several systems into what has been termed the “eclectic”
                    system, the erection of numerous orders for certain aberrant groups, and that
                    most ingenious idea of MacLeay, the author of what is termed the “circular”
                    system. We are disposed to consider that of all systems the one that combines
                    the greatest amount of convenience with the nearest approach to being natural is
                    the metamorphotic, and this we shall accordingly follow here. It is not intended
                    to acknowledge the subsidiary orders, excepting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collembola</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thysanura,</hi> which are probably
                    scarcely true insects, but which it is necessary to place here, were it only to
                    avoid the risk of their being overlooked altogether, inasmuch as the writers on
                    the other classes of <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda</hi> are not likely to
                    recognize them as coming within their scope.</p>
                <p>The stumbling-block of all systems has been the Linnaean order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neuroptera,</hi> inasmuch as its members combine the characters of most of the
                    other orders, and ingenious American writers have attempted to overcome this
                    difficulty by considering it a collection of “synthetic types.” In adopting
                    metamorphosis as the basis of classification, we prefer to take another course,
                    and to follow Erichson, who (in 1839) boldly transferred all those <hi
                    rend="italic">Neuroptera</hi> with incomplete metamorphoses to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orthoptera</hi> as a suborder, although, in dealing with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Neuroptera</hi> in the light of a specialist, division into
                    several orders appears the more natural course.</p>
                <p>The sequence of orders we propose to follow is as undcr :—</p>

                    insects that appear to be endowed with the highest intellectual faculties. But
                    at the same time it must be remembered that if the economy of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Termitidae</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Neuroptera</hi>
                    had been as fully investigated as has that of bees, wasps, and ants, it is
                    probable that the importance of this idea might be considerably weakened. The
                    main characteristics are as follows :—</p>
                <p>Wings four (frequently absent altogether in ants, &amp;c.), membranous, naked,
                    transparent, with open reticulation and very few transverse nervules. Mouth
                    mandibulate. Metamorphosis complete, but the pupa has its members free. Larva
                    mostly apodal, but in the saw-flies much resembling that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera.</hi></p>
                <p>A convenient subdivision into three great groups is generally adopted, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">Aculeata,</hi><hi rend="italic">Entomophaga</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">Ρupivora),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ρhytophaga.</hi></p>
                <p>The Aculeata may be again divided into four :— <hi rend="italic">Mellifera</hi>
                    (or Bees), <hi rend="italic">Fοssοres</hi> (Wasps, &amp;e.), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heterogyηa</hi> (Antsand allies), and <hi rend="italic">Τubuli-fera</hi>
                    (Ruby-tailed Flies), but the last is perhaps more generally considered as
                    forming a special division. In these the females (and workers, when present) are
                    provided with a sting at the apex of the abdomen, connected with a poison gland.
                    The abdomen is petiolate. The antennae are mostly thirteen-jointed in the males
                    and twelve-jointed in the females. In the bees the mouth parts are greatly
                    modified, so as to form a suctorial apparatus, by the elongation of the
                    maxillae, labium, and lingua, the small palpi being borne at its end. The
                    neuration of the wings is tolerably complete. The legs are much modified,
                    according to requirements, such as pollen-gathering, burrowing, &amp;c. The
                    larvae are apodal, hatched in cells constructed by the parent insects, the food
                    usually provided by them being either honey or other insects. The habits of the
                    group are frequently social (in this case neuters or workers are present); many
                    are parasitic on insects of their own group (in the broad sense), and in many
                    instances the parasites strikingly resemble those species in the nests of which
                    they live (as in the familiar instance of <hi rend="italic">Bombus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Apathies').</hi> Each division includes several families (to which
                    we cannot allude here), and the group as a whole includes some of the most
                    familiar insects, such as bees, wasps, and ants.</p>
                <p>The Entomophaga are invariably true parasites in the larval stage (excepting the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae),</hi> the perfect insects depositing their eggs in
                    or on the larvae or eggs of other insects, and their larvae living upon the
                    adipose tissue or contents of the eggs. There are no true sting and poison
                    gland, but the female usually has the end of the abdomen provided with a long
                    slender ovipositor, with which she can (in some cases) pierce the skin if
                    roughly handled (but no inflammatory symptoms follow). The antennae are usually
                    long, slender, and multiarticulate. The abdomen is strongly petiolate. The
                    neuration of the wings is variable (often almost absent). The main divisions are
                    <hi rend="italic">Ichneumonidae, Proctotrypidae, Clialcididae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynipidae,</hi> chiefly founded on the neuration, which in <hi
                    rend="italic">Chalcididae</hi> (and in a lesser degree in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proctotrypidae)</hi> is almost absent. Many members of this group are of
                    extreme interest in consequence of their economy, and especially some extremely
                    minute species (in <hi rend="italic">Proctotrypidae)</hi> that infest the eggs
                    of other insects, some of which can swim by means of the wings in search of the
                    eggs of aquatic insects. The <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae,</hi> although agreeing
                    in main points of structure with the other divisions, are totally different in
                    habits, and the term <hi rend="italic">Entomophaga</hi> as applied to them is
                    erroneous (a few, however, are parasitic upon aphides). They lay their eggs in
                    the tissues or buds of plants, and there results therefrom a swelling termed a
                    gall, inside which the larva feeds, either solitarily, or many in one gall in
                    separate cells.</p>
                <p>True Phytophagous <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> (or Terebrantia) comprise
                    the two divisions known as <hi rend="italic">Tenthredinidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Siricidae.</hi> In these the abdomen, instead of being petiolate,
                    is sessile; the female is provided with a double saw in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tenthredinidae,</hi> and with a borer in <hi rend="italic">Siricidae.</hi> The
                    antennae have seldom more than ten joints. The neuration of the wings is
                    complete. The larvae differ from those of all other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hymenoptera</hi> in possessing well-developed thoracic legs, and in addition
                    (excepting in the <hi rend="italic">Siricidae)</hi> a varying number of
                    abdominal prolegs, and are so like those of <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi>
                    as often to require a practised eye to distinguish them therefrom. All are
                    phytophagous, but their habits are very varied; in fact, all the conditions
                    known in <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> are probably here present also. Some
                    species cause galls. Some (such as the Turnip Saw-Fly) occasion great damage.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Siricidae</hi> are wood or stem borers; the familiar <hi
                    rend="italic">Sirex gigas</hi> often appears in the midst of large towns,
                    through the larvae or pupae having been brought in with pine timber.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Coleopter a.</hi> —This is probably the largest, and
                    certainly the best studied, of all the orders.</p>
                <p>Four-winged insects, but the upper pair of wings are modified, hard and horny in
                    texture, and are termed “elytra,” lying longitudinally over the meso-and
                    metathorax and abdomen, and when closed divided by a line or suture
                    (occasionally the elytra are united, and in this case the second pair of wings
                    is usually absent, and the insects are incapable of flight; more rarely the
                    wings are absent altogether, both the elytra and hind-wings). Mouth mandibulate.
                    Antennae seldom more than 11-jointed (often much less). Metamorphosis complete;
                    the pupa having its members free. Larva extremely variable as to form; usually
                    with thoracic legs, sometimes apodal.</p>
                <p>Latreille divided the enormous amount of materials comprised in this order into
                    four great groups according to the number of joints in the tarsi. Thus the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pentamera</hi> have five joints in all the tarsi; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Heteromera</hi> have five in the anterior and intermediate tarsi,
                    and four in the posterior; the <hi rend="italic">Tetramera</hi> have four in all
                    the tarsi, the <hi rend="italic">Trimera</hi> three in all. More minute
                    investigation and better knowledge have proved, however, that this system is
                    essentially artificial, and in part founded on misapprehension; and it is the
                    custom amongst many modern entomologists to ignore these great divisions, and to
                    consider the order as composed of about 75 families, without collecting them
                    into larger groups. It would be impossible to notice here each of these families
                    in detail, and the old system, still regarded with favour by some of our most
                    intelligent coleop-terists as the most useful, will be followed.</p>
                <p>The general structure is so marked that but little controversy has been
                    occasioned. A beetle is recognized as such universally, notwithstanding the
                    great diversity of details that exists. The only disputed elements are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Strepsiptera</hi> (Bee-parasites) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Platypsylla</hi> (an epizoic parasite on the beaver). The diversity in the
                    larval condition is much greater, and as extremes may be cited the larvae of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Staphylinidae</hi> (in which there is little difference in
                    form and structure from those of the imago, excepting the absence of wings) and
                    the apodal maggots of the <hi rend="italic">Gurculionidx.</hi> In the pupal
                    condition this divergence mainly disappears.</p>
                <p>The Pentamera are usually considered to comprise the following superior
                    subdivisions. <hi rend="italic">Adcphαgα</hi> alone possess an inner palpiform
                    lobe to each maxilla; the larvae are predaceous, and feed on other insects and
                    on flesh generally: they include the <hi rend="italic">Cicindelidae</hi>
                    (Tiger-Beetles) and <hi rend="italic">Carabidae</hi> (these two groups often
                    termed <hi rend="italic">Geοdcρhaga),</hi> which are terrestrial, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dytiscidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gyrinidae,</hi> familiar
                    aquatic groups, with the addition of <hi rend="italic">Amphizoa,</hi> an
                    anomalous American genus, recently referred to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dytiscidae.</hi><hi rend="italic">Palpicornia</hi> have short clavate antennae,
                    and comprise a number of small and mostly aquatic genera. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brachelytra</hi> (including <hi rend="italic">Staphylinidae,</hi> known as
                    Rove-Beetles or Devil’s Coach Horses) are known by the very short elytra
                    (usually much shorter than the abdomen), and form an exceedingly numerous <pb

                    larvae are predaceous, and differ but little in form from the imago; with these
                    the curious and aberrant <hi rend="italic">Pselaphidae</hi> are usually united.
                    <hi rend="italic">Clavicornia</hi> have clavate antennae, and are sometimes
                    termed <hi rend="italic">Necroρhaga,</hi> from the habit many of the species
                    have of feeding upon dead and decaying animal matter; the forms are very
                    numerous, and include the well-known Burying Beetles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Necrophorus)</hi> and the destructive <hi rend="italic">Bermestidae</hi> (in
                    which is the Bacon-Beetle); <hi rend="italic">Parnidae</hi> are aquatic; <hi
                    rend="italic">Paussidae</hi> are wonderfully curious creatures with singularly
                    formed antennae, living in ants’ nests: in this division are now placed the
                    almost microscopic <hi rend="italic">Trichopterygidae,</hi> most of which are
                    not larger than small grains of sand, and remarkable for their narrow ciliated
                    hind wings, and also other groups sometimes placed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trimera.</hi><hi rend="italic">Lamellicornia</hi> have the apex of the antennae
                    pectinate or provided with lamelliform plates: they include the Stag-Beetles and
                    the very numerous Dung-Beetles, amongst which is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scarabaeus</hi> of the Egyptians, together with the numerous Chafers. <hi
                    rend="italic">Sternoxi</hi> have the prosternum produced and pointed, and mostly
                    filiform antennae, with ordinarily au elongate oval form: in this division are
                    the beautiful <hi rend="italic">Buprestidae</hi> and the familiar <hi
                    rend="italic">Elateridae,</hi> the latter known as Click-Beetles, and able to
                    spring by means of the process of the prosternum acting on a peculiar structure
                    of the mesosternum: the larvae are all vegetable feeders, and have the legs only
                    slightly developed; those of <hi rend="italic">Elateridae</hi> are known as
                    Wire-Worms,and are often very destructive; some of the exotic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elateridae</hi> are brilliantly luminous. <hi rend="italic">Malacodermi</hi>
                    are a group of mostly soft-bodied insects very variable in form and habits; the
                    prostemnm is not produced, and the antennae are usually pectinate or serrate:
                    included in it, are the <hi rend="italic">Telephoridae</hi> (Soldier-Beetles),
                    <hi rend="italic">Lampyridae</hi> (Glow-Worms), <hi rend="italic">Clcridae</hi>
                    (often parasitic in the nests of bees), the wood-eating <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ptinidae</hi> (in which is <hi rend="italic">Anobium,</hi> or the Death-Watch),
                    and <hi rend="italic">Bostrychidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The Heteromera are a large group of forms connected together by the tarsal
                    structure, but otherwise of the most diversified nature; in fact it may be said
                    that, so far as outward appearance is concerned, there are forms in it that
                    might be readily mistaken as belonging to almost all the other principal groups,
                    so protean are they both in structure and in habits. Two principal points of
                    structure have been used for separating them into two great divisions. In one of
                    these they have been divided into <hi rend="italic">Globicoxae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Conicoxae,</hi> according to the form of the anterior coxae; in
                    the other the two divisions are termed <hi rend="italic">Atrachelia,</hi> in
                    which the head does not form a neck, and <hi rend="italic">Trachelida,</hi> in
                    which the head is narrowed into a neck. To some extent both these points of
                    structure are correlated; we adopt the latter; but it must be remarked that the
                    protean nature of the group as a whole is equally exemplified in its primary
                    subdivisions. They appear to be invariably terrestrial, and for the most part
                    phytophagous. The <hi rend="italic">Atrachelia</hi> are mainly composed of a
                    large number of genera of which <hi rend="italic">Tenebrio</hi> (the Meal-Worm)
                    maybe taken as a type, and <hi rend="italic">Blaps</hi> (the Churchyard Beetle)
                    is also amongst its members. In the <hi rend="italic">Trachelida</hi> the forms
                    are more varied, and include some of the most remarkable instances of anomalies
                    of form and structure, and even of metamorphosis, that exist amongst <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptera.</hi> Here are placed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cantharidae</hi><hi rend="italic">(</hi> Blister-Beetles, &amp;c.), so
                    remarkable for the hypermetamorphosis that exists in the larvae, and parasitic
                    in the nests of bees and locusts; the extraordinary genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Situris</hi> (equally hypermetamorphotic), a parasite in bees’ nests; <hi
                    rend="italic">Meloe</hi> (the Oil-Beetles, the history of which reads almost
                    like a romance, the very young larvae being active little creatures living on
                    the bodies of bees, but afterwards becoming obese and almost footless, and
                    feeding on the bee larvae in the nests); and <hi rend="italic">Rhiρidius,</hi>
                    parasitic on cockroaches. As a crowning point of eccentricity the extraordinary
                    <hi rend="italic">Strepsiρtera</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Stylopidae)</hi> seem
                    likely to find their resting place here, after having been considered a distinct
                    order, as <hi rend="italic">Biρtera,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera,</hi>
                    and as <hi rend="italic">Neuroptera</hi>; but even yet it is probable their
                    position may be warmly disputed. These anomalous creatures are parasitic in the
                    bodies of bees, and the female, which is vermiform, and without antennae, legs,
                    or wings, never leaves its host, and is viviparous. The male has very large
                    eyes, and extraordinary short antennae; the anterior wings (or elytra) are
                    represented by small narrow processes, not unlike the halteres of <hi
                    rend="italic">Diptera</hi>; the posterior wings are folded in repose, but when
                    expanded are extraordinarily broad, whitish in colour, and almost without
                    nervures. The metathorax occupies the greater part of the body; the abdomen is
                    terminated by a short stout process. The very young larvae are minute, active,
                    and not unlike the young larvae of <hi rend="italic">Cantharis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Meloe</hi> in form, and escape from the body of the mother by a
                    slit in the neck; they are conveyed into the nests of their hosts, and penetrate
                    the larvae of the latter, where they undergo hypermetamorphosis. Although
                    originally supposed to be exclusively parasites on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hymenoptera,</hi> one species has recently been detected in the body of an
                    homopterous insect.</p>
                <p>Tetramera.-Although the beetles of this great division have apparently only
                    four-jointed tarsi, it was long ago demonstrated by Westwood that there is
                    actually a very minute joint between the lobes of the third joint, so that they
                    are actually pentamerous, but the concealed joint is probably functionless; thus
                    the terms <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Tetramer a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crypto-Tetr</hi><hi rend="italic">amer</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> have been
                    proposed in lieu of <hi rend="italic">Tetr am era.</hi> The chief groups are the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhyncophora, Xyloρhaga, Longicornia, Phytophaga,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Clavipalpi.</hi> All are vegetable feeders’ The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhyncophora</hi> (or Weevils) have the head produced into a rostrum, varying
                    enormously in length, and in its lowest condition scarcely appreciable. The
                    larvae are footless grubs, feeding almost uni-versallyin the interior of the
                    stems or seeds of plants,and occasionally causing galls. Some exotic members of
                    this group are amongst the most beautiful of insects. A peculiarity exists in
                    the antennae, which are attached to the rostrum, and usually elbowed, the basal
                    joint being ordinarily very long (and termed the “scape ”) and the rest shorter,
                    the terminal joints usually forming a club (the portion between the scape and
                    the club is termed the “funiculus”). <hi rend="italic">Rhyncophora</hi> have
                    been very variously subdivided. Schönherr separated them into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orthoceri</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gonatoceri,</hi> according to the absence
                    or presence of an elbow to the antennae; West wood has three families, <hi
                    rend="italic">Bruchidae,Attelabidae,o.nà. Curculionidae,</hi> founded on the
                    antennae and palpi; Lacordaire’s groups are <hi rend="italic">Adelognathes</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Phanerognathes,</hi> founded on the covered or uncovered
                    mentum. Adopting Westwood’s system, we have three families. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bruchidae</hi> have only a short flattened snout, unelbowed antennae, and
                    filiform palpi; they are probably universally seed or nut feeders in the larval
                    stage. <hi rend="italic">“Bmιchτιs gra-narius</hi> causes great destruction to
                    grain; species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Caryo-borus</hi> affect palm-nuts,
                    some even living in the so-called vegetableivory nuts; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthribidae,</hi> which form a subfamily of <hi rend="italic">Bruchidae</hi>
                    according to Westwood, live in dead wood. <hi rend="italic">Attelubidae</hi>
                    have the antennae unelbowed, the palpi conical, and the rostrum long and curved;
                    the genera <hi rend="italic">Brenthus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Attelalnιs</hi>
                    form the types of two subfamilies differing chiefly in the form of the club of
                    the antennae; the first of these is almost entirely extτa-European, and its
                    members appear to feed on dead wood; the second includes the brilliant species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Rhynchites</hi> (the larvae of which roll up leaves and
                    feed on them, or live upon fruits) and the minute species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apion,</hi> of which the larvae variously attack seeds, the interior of the
                    stems of plants, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Curculionidae</hi> have elbowed
                    antennae and conical palpi, and are further subdivided into two main groups
                    according to the length of the rostrum, each again forming numerous smaller
                    groups; the family contains many of the most familiar weevils, and some of the
                    most destructive; the habits are extremely diversified: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sitophilus</hi> feeds on grain, <hi rend="italic">Calandra</hi> in the stems of
                    palms, sugar-cane, &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">Balaninus</hi> on nuts, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobius</hi> on the wood of pine trees, and a multitude of other
                    instances of peculiar habits might be cited. It must be remarked that other main
                    groupings of <hi rend="italic">Rhyncophora</hi> considerably modify both the
                    sequence and family position of many genera to an extent that cannot even be
                    glanced at here. <hi rend="italic">Xylophaga</hi> form a small group sometimes
                    united with the <hi rend="italic">Rhyncophora,</hi> consisting of small
                    wood-boring beetles, in which the rostrum may be termed obsolete, and the
                    insertion of the antennae is close to the eyes. Some of the members of this
                    group (of which <hi rend="italic">Tomicus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scolytus</hi> are familiar examples) are supposed to cause great damage through
                    their larvae feeding beneath the bark of trees; but it is possible they only
                    appear when an unhealthy condition has been set up from other causes. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Longicornia</hi> may be mainly distinguished by their elongate
                    elegant form, long antennae, which are generally filiform, but often pectinate,
                    serrate, or ornamented with tufts of hair, the head not rostrate and armed with
                    powerful jaws, the femora often clavate, and the tarsi having the basal three
                    joints cushioned beneath. The larvae mostly feed on dead or dying timber, boring
                    into its interior, and but seldom on living healthy wood, the females being
                    provided with an ovipositor; these larvae are fat, with very strong mandibles,
                    and extremely short legs; in some species several years elapse before they
                    attain their full growth. The most modern classification recognizes three
                    families, <hi rend="italic">Prionidae, Ceranibycidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lamiidae.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Prionidae</hi> have the sides of the
                    prothorax margined, and usually toothed, and comprise the largest known beetles
                    in length, even if not in bulk. <hi rend="italic">Cerambycidae</hi> have the
                    head porrect, and the prothorax not margined; some authors separate from these a
                    family <hi rend="italic">Lepturidae</hi> as of equal value. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lamiidae</hi> have the head vertical. The <hi rend="italic">Phytophaga</hi>
                    form a large group of beetles feeding essentially, in all their stages, on the
                    leaves of plants (hence the name). They are usually of short and thick form,
                    with filiformi, moniliform, or serrate (never clavate) antennae, the head
                    ordinarily immersed in the prothorax and without rostrum, and the elytra
                    covering the sides of the abdomen; the mandibles comparatively weak; the femora
                    often enlarged. The larvae are usually external feeders, with well-developed
                    legs, and often very curious in form. Much diversity in the classification of
                    <hi rend="italic">Phytophaga</hi> exists, and as to the number of families and
                    the value of their characters. By Latreille they were divided into <hi
                    rend="italic">Eupoda {Parameca,</hi> Westwood) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyclica,</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> which the most prominent character is in
                    the external form, the <hi rend="italic">Eupoda</hi> having the head and thorax
                    narrower than the abdomen, whereas in the <hi rend="italic">Cyclica</hi> the
                    base of the elytra is not broader than the hinder part of the thorax, hence the
                    form is more rounded. Another grouping is according to the insertion of the
                    antennae at the sides, or on the middle, of the front. The number of families
                    varies from four to nine according to different authors. A glance at the
                    prominent forms, according to later ideas, is here given. <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">asparagi),</hi> the genus <hi rend="italic">Donacia</hi> (and
                    allies), which is aquatic in its earlier stages, and the brilliant exotic genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Sagra</hi> (remarkable for its enormously thickened hind
                    femora), the larva of which forms galls on the stems of plants and lives
                    therein. <hi rend="italic">Gryptocephalidae</hi> (including <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clythridse)</hi> are remarkable for the habits of the larvae, which form hard
                    cases of excrement (?) in which they live. <hi rend="italic">Chrysomelidae</hi>
                    are a group of often beautiful insects, mostly remarkable fortheir nearly
                    hemispherical form; they include, <hi rend="italic">inter alia, Tirnarcha</hi>
                    (the Bloody-nosed Beetle), the well-known genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysomela,</hi> and the Colorado Potato-Beetle <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Doryphora</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Longitarsus)</hi>; most of them distil an
                    acrid fluid; the larvae are short and obese, feeding exposed and the pupae often
                    have the remarkable peculiarity of being suspended by the tail. <hi
                    rend="italic">Halticidae</hi> are noted for their thickened hind femora and
                    their jumping powers; though small in size, some of the members <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the Turnip-Flea) are most destructive. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cassididae</hi> (or Tortoise-Beetles) usually have the sides of
                    the elytra expanded; the larvae have the very singular habit of concealing
                    themselves under a covering formed of their own excrement, which is sustained by
                    means of a forked appendage at the extremity of the body. Other families (such
                    as <hi rend="italic">Hispidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Galeru-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cidae)</hi> must be passed over. The last division of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tetramera</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">Clavipalpi,</hi> often
                    placed with the <hi rend="italic">Trimera,</hi> and forming a connecting link
                    therewith. They are a small group, with the last three joints of the antennae
                    forming a compressed club, aud the last joint of the maxillary palpi also
                    broadly clavate. The family <hi rend="italic">Erotylidae</hi> mainly constitutes
                    the group; the larvae probably all live upon fungi. In proof of the wide
                    divergence of opinion as to the relationship of special groups, it may be
                    mentioned that one author places certain genera of this group amongst the <hi
                    rend="italic">Clavicorma of</hi> the Pentamerous division.</p>
                <p>The last of the great divisions of <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi> forms the
                    Trimera. As in the <hi rend="italic">Tetramera,</hi> it was discovered that the
                    term is not strictly applicable, and that a minute joint is concealed between
                    the lobes of the second joint of the tarsi, hence they have been called <hi
                    rend="italic">PseudoTrimera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crypto-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Trimera.</hi> Some authors have made this group a place of refuge
                    for many almost isolated forms, the natural position of which it is difficult to
                    suggest. At present, however, only a small number of more homogeneous materials
                    are usually located here, and these are divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphidiphaga</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fungicola.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphidiphaga</hi> comprise the familiar Lady-Birds <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Coccinella)</hi> and allies; these have the last joint of the maxillary palpi
                    hatchet-shaped, have short-clubbed antennae, and have the body remarkably
                    hemispherical. They appear to feed chiefly on other small insects in both larval
                    and perfect stages, and aphides are especial articles of diet with them; but the
                    writer has seen a larva of <hi rend="italic">Coccinella</hi> with its head
                    deeply immersed in the juicy body of a recently formed pupa of its own species.
                    <hi rend="italic">Fungicola</hi> have the last joint of the maxillary palpi
                    filiform, with longer antennae, and, as a rule, less hemispherical body. They
                    contain <hi rend="italic">a</hi> number of mostly small and little familiar
                    forms, and, as their name indicates, are often found in fungi, on which they no
                    doubt principally subsist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Diptera.</hi> —Only the anterior (rnesothoracic) wings
                    present, membranous, usually naked, with varying longitudinal nervures and but
                    few transverse nervules. Posterior wings replaced by knobbed filaments termed
                    “halteres.” Mouth consisting of a rostrum formed chiefly by the extended labium,
                    forming a canal in which the other usual organs, modified into lancet-shaped
                    pieces, are contained, the whole forming a sucker; only the maxillary palpi
                    developed. Thorax consisting almost entirely of the greatly enlarged mesothorax,
                    the two other divisions very small, and scarcely separable from the mesothorax.
                    Tarsi 5-jointed; the end joint with a pair of more or less disciform pulvilli.
                    Metamorphosis complete.</p>
                <p>Although it is the generally received opinion that the halteres are the
                    representatives of the posterior wings, there have been those who regard them
                    rather as connected with respiration or hearing, and by some they have even been
                    considered as belonging to the base of the abdomen rather than to the thorax;
                    this latter idea results from the difficulty of defining the true limits of the
                    metathorax. At the base of each anterior wing is a small membranous portion
                    termed an “alulet,” not absolutely connected with the wing itself, but which
                    must be considered an adjunct, and certainly not representing a posterior
                    wing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> form one of the most extensive orders. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Genuina</hi> are commonly divided into two great groups, according
                    to the structure of the antennae, and termed <hi rend="italic">Hemoeera</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Braehyeera</hi> respectively; but it has long been seen that
                    these divisions are not natural, especially with regard to metamorphoses, and
                    Brauer proposed division according to whether the larval skin at the last moult
                    opens by a slit down the back or in a curvilinear manner, a proposal he has
                    since extended by demonstrating that those two divisions— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orthorhapha</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cyelorhapha—</hi> are rendered the more
                    natural by the pupal condition being correlated with differences in the larva
                    and perfect insect, and eventually it is probable his views will be generally
                    adopted. Another basis for division is according to whether the pupa is free
                    (sometimes active, but not taking nutriment) or enclosed within the hardened
                    skin of the larva (“obtected” or “coarctate ”). The division into <hi
                    rend="italic">Nemocera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Braehyeera</hi> is here
                    followed.</p>
                <p>In the Nemocera the antennae are long and slender,and composed of a considerable
                    number of small joints, which are often verticillate or plumose. They include
                    the families <hi rend="italic">Culicidae, Chironomidae, Psychodidae,
                    Cecidomyiidae, Mycetophilidae, Tipulidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibionidae,</hi> but some authors make a more minute subdivision. All these,
                    and a multitude of others, fall into Brauer’s suborder <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orthorhapha,</hi> and the pupa is obtected. Here come some of the most familiar
                    and bloodthirsty members of the order, such as Gnats (or Mosquitos), Midges,
                    Gall-Midges, “Daddy Long Legs,” &amp;c., and some of them cause incalculable
                    mischief to the agriculturist. In those species in which the earlier stages are
                    aquatic, the pupa is active.</p>
                <p>The Braehyeera have the antennae short and thick, not more than three-jointed,
                    but the terminal joint has a bristle <hi rend="italic">(arista)</hi> which is
                    sometimes articulate. These again have been divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hcxa-</hi><hi rend="italic">chaetae, Tetrachaetae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dichaetae,</hi> according to the number of setae concealed in the mouth. They
                    are “cyclorhaphous,” and the pupa is coarctate. It is not possible to enumerate
                    here all the families, nor to allude to the extreme diversity of habit and
                    structure that exists. House-Flies, Blow-Flies, Flesh-Flies, Bot-Flies, and
                    Gad-Flies, the beautiful <hi rend="italic">Syrphidae</hi> (many of which devour
                    aphides in the larval state), the parasitic <hi rend="italic">Tachinae,</hi> the
                    plant-eating <hi rend="italic">Phytomyzae,</hi> &amp;c., all belong to this
                    division.</p>
                <p>The Pupipara are a small group distinguished especially by the fact that the
                    larvae and pupae are developed in the body of the mother, and the head is sunk
                    in the thorax; they have even been considered a distinct order termed <hi
                    rend="italic">Hνmaloptera.</hi> All are parasitic. They include <hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithomyia</hi> (Bird-Flies), <hi rend="italic">Melophagus</hi>
                    (the Sheep-Tick), the extraordinary wingless genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nycteribia,</hi> parasitic upon bats, and the perhaps still more extraordinary
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Braula,</hi> a minute creature known as the Bee-Louse.
                    Brauer terms them <hi rend="italic">Cyelorhapha pupipara.</hi></p>
                <p>With the <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> (as a distinct section) it is now the all
                    but universal practice to include the Aphaniptera or Fleas, at one time
                    considered as forming a distinct order. They differ from true <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diptera</hi> in their laterally compressed form, well-defined thoracic
                    divisions, absence of wings (which are represented only by scales), aborted
                    antennae, developed labial palpi, &amp;c. The mouth of the imago is (as is too
                    well known) formed for suction, and its parts can be homologized with those of
                    the true <hi rend="italic">Diptera.</hi> The larva is slender and worm-like, and
                    is mandibulate, in all probability feeding on the scaly débris or scurf from the
                    skins of the animals attacked; it is not found on the animals themselves, but in
                    their beds or other resting-places. The pupa is inactive. For all practical
                    purposes the <hi rend="italic">Aphaniptera</hi> include only two genera— <hi
                    rend="italic">Pulex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sarcopsylla,</hi> the Flea and
                    the Chigoe or Jigger. Many mammals and some birds have each its own peculiar
                    species of flea, or more than one, and the size of the tormentor is often in an
                    inverse proportion to that of the tormented, the flea of the mouse being of
                    gigantic proportions. The chigoe is notorious in tropical America for its habit
                    of penetrating the skin of man, especially on the feet, the abdomen of the
                    insect swelling and causing troublesome ulcers. Formerly it was believed that
                    the eggs were deposited in the ulcers and that the larvae fed therein, but more
                    recent observations tend to prove that the habits are much those of ordinary
                    fleas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lepidoptera.</hi> —Four membranous wings (frequently
                    rudimentary, or sometimes wanting, in the female) clothed with flattened
                    striated scales; neuration open; transverse nervules few; at the base of the
                    anterior margin of the posterior pair is frequently a bristle used for
                    connecting the two pairs in flight. Mouth haustellate, the maxillae being much
                    elongated and very slender, forming two closely-applied pieces, which together
                    make the suctorial apparatus by means of which the nectar of flowers is pumped
                    up for food; in some groups this apparatus is rudimentary. Labial palpi strongly
                    developed, the maxillary ordinarily rudimentary (but more developed than the

                    pair of lateral organs termed <hi rend="italic">patagia.</hi> Legs slender;
                    tibiae spurred. Metamorphosis complete, all the appendages of the pupa enclosed
                    in common covering with the body, but leaving the parts visible (occasionally,
                    in some of the lower groups, the extremities of the appendages are free). Larva
                    (termed a caterpillar) with six thoracic legs, and with a varying number (never
                    more than 4 pairs) of fleshy abdominal and two anal prolegs (rarely the larva is
                    apodal). With few exceptions, they are phytophagous.</p>
                <p>These insects are familiarly known as Butterflies and Moths, and the order
                    contains the most beautiful insects that exist, and forms the most popular and
                    attractive of all for collectors. The scales of the wings (and other parts of
                    the insect) are really modified hairs. Each is a flattened sac, striated on one
                    side, containing variously coloured pigments, the arrangement of scales of
                    different colours causing the beautiful markings and patterns so universal; but
                    metallic colours are due also to interference caused by minute inequalities of
                    the surface, combined with the contained pigment.</p>
                <p>The classification of <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> is still in a state of
                    much uncertainty. By collectors they are fancifully divided into <hi
                    rend="italic">Macro-</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Micro-Lepidoptera.</hi> A more
                    familiar division is into Butterflies and Moths,—the former being termed <hi
                    rend="italic">Hhopalocera</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Diurni),</hi> the latter
                    <hi rend="italic">Heterocera</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Hocturni).</hi></p>
                <p>The Rhopalocera are especially distinguished by their clubbed antennae. The
                    following great groups are tolerably well marked (but each has been much
                    subdivided) :—viz., <hi rend="italic">Papilionidae, Nymphalidae, Erycinidae,
                    Lycaenidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hcspcriidae.</hi> Some split the division
                    into two, according as the pupa is suspended by the tail only, or has a thread
                    round the body as well (these groups are termed <hi rend="italic">Suspensi</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Succincti</hi> respectively); the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nymphalidae</hi> are especially characteristic of the first of these. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nymphalidae</hi> the anterior legs are not fully developed in
                    either sex; in the <hi rend="italic">Erycinidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycaenidae</hi> this occurs only in the males. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hcsperiidae</hi> have the club of the antennae terminated by a hook, and the
                    position of the wings in repose differs ordinarily from that in the other
                    groups; the pupa is enclosed in a rudimentary cocoon, and may even be
                    subterranean.</p>
                <p>The Heterocera are subdivided roughly into <hi rend="italic">Sphingidae,
                    Bombycidae, Noctuidae, Gcomctridae, Pyralidae, Tortricidae, Tineidae,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Pterophoridae</hi>; but much more minute subdivision is
                    adopted by specialists. In these the form of the antennae is very variable (as
                    the name implies), and the bristle on the posterior wings is usually (not
                    always) present. The <hi rend="italic">Sphingidae</hi> (which comprise some of
                    the largest and most robust moths) usually have the antennae fusiform towards
                    the tips. <hi rend="italic">Bombycidae</hi> generally have the antennae of the
                    male strongly pectinate, and those of the female simple or nearly so; the larvae
                    with four pairs of abdominal prolegs (and the anal pair); but this is a group of
                    extremely heterogeneous materials, if taken in its widest sense; it includes the
                    Silk-Worm Moths as familiar examples, and many extraordinary forms, amongst
                    which may be mentioned the curious <hi rend="italic">Psychidae,</hi> in which
                    the larvae manufacture portable cases wherein they live, and in which the
                    females are apterous. Perhaps allied to this group, or intermediate between it
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Sphingidae,</hi> is the curious and abnormal
                    collection of pretty insects termed <hi rend="italic">Castniadae,</hi> at one
                    time considered to be butterflies, and even yet included with them by some
                    authors. The haustellum is rudimentary in the true <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bombycidae.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Noctuidae</hi> are stout-bodied moths,
                    mostly (but by no means always) of nocturnal habits; the antennae greatly
                    varying, but not thickened; the bristle on the posterior wings present; the
                    haustellum present (in one genus, <hi rend="italic">Ophideres,</hi> it is strong
                    enough to pierce the skin of oranges). They are mostly divided into two groups
                    according to the number of the prolegs in the larvae (four, or only three,
                    abdominal pairs), and the neuration of the posterior wings. The larvae are
                    usually nearly smooth (those groups with hairy larvae are by some transferred to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bombycidae'),</hi> and the pupae subterranean. <hi
                    rend="italic">Geometridae</hi> are especially distinguished by the presence of
                    usually only one pair of abdominal prolegs, occasioning a peculiar form of
                    locomotion, termed “looping”; antenrife varying; bristle of posterior wings
                    present; the wings usually expanded when at rest. With apparent relations to
                    these is the small group <hi rend="italic">Uraniidae,</hi> consisting of
                    beautiful papilioniform insects, still by some placed with the butterflies. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyralidae</hi> form a special group of varying, and for the most
                    part rather small, insects, with simple (or nearly simple) antennae; long
                    slender legs; the bristle of the posterior wings present; long palpi; larvae
                    with three to five pairs of abdominal prolegs, and mostly smooth and glossy in
                    appearance. <hi rend="italic">Tortricidae</hi> are small insects of nocturniform
                    mien when at rest (the wings being horizontal and not expanded); antennae
                    simple; bristle of posterior wings absent; haustellum short; palpi short; larvae
                    with four pairs of abdominal prolegs. Many of the species of this group do
                    immense damage to trees and garden plants. The <hi rend="italic">Tincidae</hi>
                    is an immense group of mostly small (often very minute) insects, with extremely
                    varying structure and habits. They may always be distinguished from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tortricidae</hi> by the long palpi (the maxillary pair being
                    sometimes strongly developed and exceeding the labial); the fringes of the wings
                    are usually very long. Some of these minute forms are excessively beautiful. The
                    group as a whole is made up of very incongruous materials. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pterophoridae</hi> are a small group at once distinguished by the wings being
                    split up into linear divisions, hence they have been termed “plumes.” By some
                    they are not considered distinct from the <hi rend="italic">Pyralidae,</hi> with
                    which there is considerable structural affinity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Neuroptera.</hi> —Four membranous and for the most part
                    densely reticulate wings, more or less clothed with hairs, but without true
                    scales; very frequently the hairs are on the neuration only. Mouth mandibulate.
                    Metamorphosis complete, but the pupa has its members free.</p>
                <p>In the outline of classification (at p. 147) proposed to be adopted in this
                    article, it is stated that the <hi rend="italic">Neuroptera</hi> as there
                    indicated are considered as forming a single order, more as a matter of
                    convenience than from any conviction of the homogeneity of the two
                    divisions.</p>
                <p>The Trichoptera (or Caddis-Flies) form a very natural and sharply defined group
                    distinguished by their rudimentary mouth-parts, with the exception of the two
                    pairs of palpi, which are strongly developed, the m⅛xillary pair being the
                    longer, and with often the greater number of joints; the antennae setaceous;
                    wings with comparatively simple neuration and but few transverse nervules,
                    ordinarily covered with hair (which sometimes simulates scales); larvae (known
                    as Caddis-Worms) with well-developed thoracic legs, and anal crotchets, but
                    without prolegs, living in tubes covered with extraneous materials; pupa lying
                    free in the case, or occasionally in a special cocoon, only active just before
                    its metamorphosis; habits (with one or two exceptions) aquatic.</p>
                <p>It is considered by the writer that there is direct relationship of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Trichoptera</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera,</hi> and
                    this idea acts as the key to the scheme of classification adopted. They are
                    divided into seven families, viz., <hi rend="italic">Phryganeidae,
                    Limnophilidae, Sericostomatidae, Leptoceridae, Hydropsychidae,
                    Rhyacophilidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hydroptilidae,</hi> chiefly according
                    to the structure of the maxillary palpi. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhyacophilidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hydropsychidae</hi> the larvae
                    inhabit fixed cases, in the others the cases are free, and caτied about by the
                    inmates; in the <hi rend="italic">Rhyacophilidae</hi> the pupa is enveloped in a
                    special cocoon. The neuration shows strongly-marked homology with that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepidoptera.</hi></p>
                <p>The Planipennia (or true <hi rend="italic">Neuroptera</hi> according to modern
                    ideas) have strongly-developed mandibulate mouths; for the most part moniliform
                    or filiform (often clavate) antennae; the wings ordinarily densely reticulate,
                    with very numerous transverse nervules, the membrane hairless or nearly so. The
                    larva is more divergent from the Lepidopterous type. The pupa is ordinarily in a
                    cocoon; it is active just before its transformation. A convenient subdivision is
                    into <hi rend="italic">Panorpidae, Sialidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Megaloptera.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Panorpidae</hi> (Scorpion-Flies, &amp;c.) are remarkable
                    for the mandibles, &amp;c., being situated at the end of a long beak, formed by
                    the much-elongated clypeus above and the lower lip beneath. The wings have open
                    reticulation, and the larva is more vermiform than in the succeeding groups, so
                    that the relationship to the <hi rend="italic">Trichoptera</hi> is close. They
                    are carnivorous both in imago and larva, and the latter is subterranean. <hi
                    rend="italic">Panorpa</hi> is remarkable for the cheliform termination of the
                    abdomen, <hi rend="italic">Bittacus</hi> for its tipuliform aspect, <hi
                    rend="italic">Boreus</hi> for its nearly apterous condition.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sialidae</hi> form a heterogeneous group of small
                    subdivisions with setaceous antennae (which are sometimes pectinate); strongly
                    developed prothorax; the third or fourth joints of the tarsi cordate. They are
                    again divided into two sections (or families), of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhaphidia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sialis</hi> may be taken as the types. The
                    former (Snake-Flies) are especially remarkable for the enormously elongated
                    prothorax (the anterior legs at its posterior extremity); the larvae
                    sub-cortical. The latter comprise mostly large insects with strong (but not
                    greatly elongated) prothorax and ample wings, the larvae of which are aquatic,
                    and provided with lateral branchial plates; the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corydalis</hi> is remarkable for the enorjpously elongated mandibles of the
                    male (but not in all species).</p>

                    moniliform (or clavate) antennae; densely reticulate broad wings; varying
                    prothorax; tarsal joints not dilated. The number of subfamilies is large. The
                    most prominent forms are the <hi rend="italic">Mantispidae,</hi> with their long

                    mandibulate. Metamorphosis incomplete.</p>
                <p>Having adopted metamorphosis as a basis for classification, it became necessary
                    to view this order after the manner universal amongst German systematists, and
                    to include in it many groups that are ordinarily accepted as neuropterous, the
                    only plan possible without the erection of independent orders for their
                    accommodation. The result is that more absolute homogeneity from a general point
                    of view is attained, and we have to deal with an order made up of otherwise most
                    incongruous elements, but somewhat relieved by the sharpness with which the
                    great groups are defined. Regarding the two great divisions, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psmιdo-Neuroptera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crthoptera</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >genuina,</hi> as a whole, the main distinction really consists in the fact that
                    in the former the four wings are equally membranous, whereas in the latter the
                    anterior pair are more or less coriaceous; another difference is in the head,
                    which in the former is horizontal, whereas in the latter it may be described as
                    vertical; but this distinction only applies to the typical groups. Thus there is
                    really little more difference than exists between the two great divisions of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hemiptera,</hi> now almost universally placed in one order.</p>
                <p>Naturally allowing the Pseudo-Neuroptera the first place as following on from the
                    true <hi rend="italic">Neurοpterα</hi> (though some would say the Dragon-flies
                    are really the typical <hi rend="italic">Neurοptera</hi> of Linnaeus), these
                    must be first considered. Adopting the descending scale, the main groups may be
                    glanced at as follows :—</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Odοηata</hi> (Dragon-flies; constituted an order by
                    Fabricius) may be considered the most highly organized, with regard to theiι
                    powerfully mandibulate mouth, strong, densely reticulate wings, &amp;c. The
                    special peculiarities of this group (including the extraordinary structure of
                    the mouth in the preparatory stages, and the anomalous position of the genital
                    organs in the male) have been fully discussed in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dragon-fly</hi><hi rend="italic">ly.v.}.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ephemeridae</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ephemeridae)</hi> follow. After these come the <hi rend="italic">Perlidae,</hi>
                    aquatic insects in their preparatory conditions, remarkable for the
                    comparatively weak development of the mouth parts (shared with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ephemeridae)</hi> in the perfect state, the four wings
                    longitudinally horizontal and overlapping, the stout quadrate or oblong
                    prothorax, the frequent presence of two articulated tails, the long setaceous
                    antennae, &amp;e. This group is also remarkable as being the first in which the
                    persistence of external branchiae in the imago was detected (a peculiarity since
                    found to be of frequent occurrence in them, and extending to other orders). They
                    are known familiarly as Stone-Flies, and form a large portion of the
                    stock-in-trade of an angler.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Embidae</hi> constitute a very small group, which in
                    general form much resemble <hi rend="italic">Perlidae,</hi> but have, on the
                    other hand, affinities with the white ants. The larvae live habitually under
                    stones in little galleries, and a recent discovery appears to prove that they
                    feed on roots.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Termitidae</hi> (or White Ants, placed by some authors in the
                    true <hi rend="italic">Orthοptera)</hi> are social insects living in immense
                    communities, and forming nests on the ground or on trees. In some respects there
                    is analogy between these and social <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera,</hi> and the
                    diversity of condition in a single species is even greater. Winged forms of both
                    male and female exist (the wings being shed at a certain time), and there are
                    also commonly apterous forms known as workers and soldiers, whose office it is
                    to build the dwellings and protect the inmates, the soldiers having the head
                    provided with a powerful horn or elongated mandibles. Each condition has its own
                    special immature form, so that it is probable no more specially polymorphic
                    insects exist. The wings are carried horizontally and overlapping in repose; the
                    prothorax is well developed, and the tarsi are four-jointed. Recent observations
                    tend to show that specially prepared food (comminuted wood) is provided for the
                    larvae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Psocidae</hi> are a small group of small insects remarkable for
                    their swollen face, setiform antennae, narrow prothorax, and large mesothorax,
                    four-jointed maxillary palpi, and rudimentary labial palpi, two-or three-jointed
                    tarsi. The wings are deflexed (often absent), with ordinarily very open
                    neuration. These insects live on fungi and débris and also occasionally on dry
                    animal substances, as in the case of the Book-Louse, ordinarily so abundant in
                    neglected collections of insects, and erroneously supposed to occasion a ticking
                    like that of <hi rend="italic">Anobium.</hi></p>
                <p>There remain two groups the position of which has occasioned much controversy,
                    but which are now often placed here, not, perhaps, because the affinities are
                    very marked, but more to accommodate them with a resting-place in a division of
                    <hi rend="italic">Insecta</hi> the characters of which are so very elastic.</p>
                <p>The first of these are the <hi rend="italic">Thysanoptera,</hi> considered a
                    distinct order by Haliday, the founder of the name, and by Burmeister placed in
                    his order <hi rend="italic">Gymnognatha</hi> as a distinct group termed <hi
                    rend="italic">Physopoda</hi>; by some authors they are placed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hemiptera.</hi> It is true that the mouth forms a short rostrum
                    with only bristle-like mandibles, but the presence of distinct palpi would
                    appear definitely to invalidate the position in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hemiptera.</hi> The wings are four in number, lying horizontally on the back
                    and crossing at the tips; they are very slender, membranous, without nervures or
                    nearly so, and strongly ciliated, or they may be wanting in some species, even
                    in the perfect state. These insects are familiarly known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thrips,</hi> and sometimes occasion much damage to various kinds of plants by
                    sucking the juices, which the almost haustellate nature of the mouth enables
                    them to do. They are mostly very minute insects, and have been divided into many
                    sections and genera on structural characters.</p>
                <p>The second of the above-mentioned groups is the <hi rend="italic">Mallophaga</hi>
                    (or Bird-Lice), which it is convenient to separate from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anoplura</hi> (or tnιe Lice) on account of the structure of the mouth, which is
                    mandibulate and also carries palpi. On account of the absence of metamorphoses,
                    some place them (with the <hi rend="italic">Anoplura)</hi> as outside the pale
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Insecta,</hi> but they may be regarded as degraded <hi
                    rend="italic">Pseudo-Neuroptera.</hi> They for the most part live on the
                    feathers of birds (each bird having its particular parasites), but a few also on
                    mammals.</p>
                <p>What may be termed Orthoptera genuina consist of groups for the most part very
                    sharply defined.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Blattidae</hi> (or Cockroaches) form the order <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictyoptera of</hi> Leach. These are insects of flattened form,
                    with four horizontal wings (or apterous), of which the anterior pair are
                    considerably coriaceous, but with distinct neuration; the head small; tarsi
                    five-jointed. The eggs are not laid separately; but are contained in a common
                    capsule which is carried about by the female at the extremity of her abdomen.
                    There are many genera and species, of which latter the abundant <hi
                    rend="italic">Periplaneta</hi><hi rend="italic">orientalis</hi> is the most
                    familiar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forficulidae</hi> (or Earwigs) form the order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eυplexoptera</hi> of Westwood and the group <hi rend="italic">Hmnatoρtera</hi>
                    of Burmeister. Externally they much resemble <hi rend="italic">Goleoptera</hi>
                    of the family <hi rend="italic">Staphylinidae</hi> in form (but with pincer-like
                    appendages at the extremity of the abdomen), the anterior wings being
                    abbreviated and coriaceous, separated by a suture, and concealing the ample but
                    folded posterior wings (but some forms are apterous); the tarsi three-jointed.
                    The eggs are deposited in cavities in the earth, and are guarded (at any rate in
                    some) by the mother.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mantidae</hi> are mostly large elongate insects with strongly
                    developed raptorial anterior legs (hence the insects are carnivorous). The
                    prothorax very long; tarsi five-jointed; wings often ample or frequently
                    vanting, all reticulate, but the anterior pair slightly more coriaceous. The
                    earlier states greatly resemble the perfect insect without wings. The eggs are
                    contained in a kind of case formed of a secretion voided with them, in which
                    they are arranged in rows, the whole mass being attached to twigs, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Phasmidae</hi> (Spectres, or Walking-Sticks) have considerable
                    external resemblance to the former, but the anterior legs are not raptorial, and
                    the insects are phytophagous. The wings (when present) are usually much shorter
                    than the abdomen. Most of the species mimic (as do those of the last family)
                    leaves or twigs, often to such a degree that it is hard to imagine one is
                    regarding an insect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gryllidae</hi> form the first of a division termed <hi
                    rend="italic">Saltatoria</hi> (as opposed to <hi rend="italic">Cursoria</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Gressoτia),</hi> from the structure of the hind legs fitting
                    them for jumping. The antennae are long and setaceous; tarsi three-jointed;
                    anterior wings lying horizontally over the folded posterior. The males mostly
                    produce sound by a special structure at the base of each anterior wing acting on
                    the posterior. This family is made up of materials presenting considerable
                    diversity, but may be grouped roughly in two, according as the anterior legs are
                    formed for digging (Mole-Crickets) or for running (Crickets).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Locustidae</hi> have the antennae very long and slender; the
                    tarsi four-jointed; the anterior wings longitudinally deflexed. The female
                    ordinarily has a broad curved ovipositor suitable for forming <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n164/mode/1up"

                    deposited. They are mostly phytophagous, but in some cases carnivorous also. The
                    males are usually very noisy,—with special sound-producing organs at the base of
                    the anterior wing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acrydiidae</hi> differ from the last chiefly in the antennae,
                    which are shorter and thick, and in the three-jointed tarsi. The female has no
                    produced ovipositor. They are phytophagous, and the eggs are mostly laid in
                    earthen tubes. This family includes (according to modern classification) the
                    true Locusts, notwithstanding the application of the term to the last-mentioned.
                    Sound is produced by friction of the hind thighs against the nervures of the
                    anterior wings.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Grthoptera</hi> have here been treated in a somewhat more
                    detailed manner than other orders, on account of the bearing of the materials on
                    the classification of insects in general, and the sharply differentiated nature
                    of these materials in particular.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hemiptera.</hi> —This order consists of insects of very
                    varying structure. Primarily there are two great divisions, known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Heteroptera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Homoptera,</hi> by some
                    considered distinct orders. The points in which they agree consist especially in
                    an imperfect metamorphosis, and the structure of the mouth, which latter is of a
                    very simple nature, consisting of an elongated articulate tube formed by an
                    extension of the labium into a suctorial organ, concealed in which are
                    bristle-like mandibles and maxillae, and probably rudiments of maxillary palpi.
                    The tarsi have from one to three joints.</p>
                <p>In the Heteroptera (or true Bugs) the anterior wings are horizontal, and composed
                    of two distinct parts, the basal portion (or corium) being coriaceous, and the
                    apical portion (or membrane, often undeveloped) being membranous with distinct
                    longitudinal neuration, which latter is only faintly indicated in the coriaceous
                    portion. I n repose the membranous portion of one wing overlaps that on the
                    other. The posterior wings are concealed under the anterior, folded, membranous,
                    and with only few nervures. Apterous forms are not uncommon, and sometimes the
                    posterior wings are wanting. This division is again divided into two, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gymnοcerαtα</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cryρtοcerata,</hi> in the
                    former of which the antennae are composed of few elongate slender joints, while
                    in the latter the joints are still fewer, short and thick, and ordinarily
                    concealed under the head. Modern writer's have erected a multitude of small
                    subdivisions which cannot be enumerated here. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnocerata</hi> are broadly divided into the following families, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">Scutelleridae, Pentatornidae, Coreidae, Bcrytidae, Lygaeidae,
                    Capsidae, Tingididae, Reduviidae, Emcsidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saldidae,</hi> founded on different points in the structure of the antennae,
                    rostrums scutellum of mesothorax, tarsi, &amp;c. They are terrestrial, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">suck</hi> the juices of plants or animals. The entire family
                    <hi rend="italic">Reduviidae</hi> are probably blood-suckers, and members of
                    other families as above given are notorious for a similar habit, amongst which
                    may be particularly noticed the genus <hi rend="italic">Acanthia</hi> (including
                    the Bed Bug); but the greater part are plant bugs. Most of them are remarkable
                    for emitting a peculiar and often disgusting odour. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cryptoccrata</hi> are entirely water bugs, often of extraordinary form, and
                    sometimes gigantic in size. They include the families <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrornetridae, Gerridae, Galgulidae, Nepidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notonectidae.</hi> They prey upon animals. One genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Halobates)</hi> is remarkable for its pelagic habits, being found on the
                    surface of the ocean very far from land. Many others, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notonecta</hi> (Water Boatmen or Toe-Biters), <hi rend="italic">Nepa, Ranaira,
                    ke.,</hi> are very familiar insects.</p>
                <p>The Homoptera have the wings for the most part deflexed, and tlιc anterior pair
                    not separated into two parts. Often all the wings are membranous, with strong
                    nervures; in others the anterior pair is coriaceous. The division regarded as a
                    whole is very polymorphic. The true <hi rend="italic">Homoptera</hi> have
                    three-jointed tarsi. They may be divided into <hi rend="italic">Cicadidae</hi>
                    (remarkable for the sound-producing organs at the base of the abdomen of the
                    male), <hi rend="italic">Fulgoridae</hi> (known as Lantern-Flies, but now known
                    to produce no light; having the head greatly prolonged in front), <hi
                    rend="italic">Lystridae, Cixiidae</hi> (comprising many little planthoppers),
                    <hi rend="italic">Issidae, Derbidae, Flatidae, Tettigometridae, Membracidae</hi>
                    (often of most extraordinary forms), <hi rend="italic">Cercopidae</hi> (included
                    in which is the Cuckoo-Spit Insect), <hi rend="italic">Ledridae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Jassidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> all vegetable feeders. The
                    more aberrant <hi rend="italic">Homoptera</hi> include well-marked groups. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Psyllidae</hi> are small plant-sucking saltatorial insects
                    with four membranous wings which lie longitudinally deflexed in repose, and with
                    very narrow prothorax, and eight-to ten-jointed antennae; they often occasion
                    much damage; the larvae are frequently covered with a cottony secretion. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Aphidae</hi> are the familiar Plant-Lice, the winged forms of
                    which have those organs membranous, and often extended in repose. The antennae
                    are five-to seven-jointed. The diversity in form and habits is enormous, and, as
                    is well-known, there are winged and apterous forms in the same species, and
                    parthenogenetic generation of the most extraordinary nature; and the same
                    species may be both oviparous and viviparous.</p>
                <p>Most of them void a sweet secretion from abdominal tubes, known as honey-dew, for
                    which they are “milked” by ants. The destruction they occasion to plants is very
                    great; as a now too familiar instance of this, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phylloxera</hi><hi rend="italic">vastatrix</hi> of the grape-vine may be cited.
                    <hi rend="italic">Coccidae</hi> (or Scale Insects) have the male two-winged, the
                    female apterous, and living all her life as a fixed “scale” on plants, the
                    organs being of the most rudimentary nature; the eggs lying under the scale in
                    great numbers; the tarsi with only one joint; parthenogenesis occurs also in
                    this group; the male in its earlier stages lives under a special scale. The
                    Cochineal Insect is one of the best known in this group. The little family <hi
                    rend="italic">Aleurodidae</hi> consists of minute insects covered with a white
                    waxy secretion. They have four almost nerveless wings in both sexes, two-jointed
                    tarsi, the abdomen without secreting tubes, and do not live under scales.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Hemiptera</hi> it is now the fashion to include the
                    Anoplura, or true Lice (some also place here the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mallophaga</hi> or Bird-Lice), a degraded form of this order, without
                    metamorphosis. Here it is preferred to let them rest in this article, even
                    although some writers do not consider them true insects. The mouth parts
                    certainly have indications of a rostrum, and there are no palpi, and, but for
                    the absence of metamorphosis, there would be little difficulty in fixing the
                    position here as without doubt. All, as is well-known, are epizoic parasites on
                    man and other <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> each species being confined to a
                    special host, while attempts have been made to prove that the Head-Louse <hi
                    rend="italic">{Pediculus</hi><hi rend="italic">capitis')</hi> varies according
                    to the races of men to which it is attached. Perhaps the Crab-Louse <hi
                    rend="italic">{Phihirius pubis)</hi> is regarded with greater disgust than is
                    bestowed upon any other living creature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Collembola</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Thysanura.</hi> —In
                    the introductory notes to this article (p. 141) it is stated that “although it
                    is not difficult to define an insect, speaking broadly, there are certain small
                    groups that do not satisfactorily fall into the class as limited by
                    strongly-defined lines of demarcation.” The writer there had especially in view
                    those lice known as <hi rend="italic">Mallophaga</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anoplura,</hi> and the two groups indicated in the heading of this section,
                    groups in which metamorphosis, the key of his ideas as to classification, and
                    embodying an essential requisite in an insect according to common acceptance, is
                    wanting. In the time of Linnaeus, when we were only outside the threshold of
                    knowledge, it may have been sufficient (and perhaps prudent) to include these
                    groups in an order <hi rend="italic">Aptera.</hi> But accumulation of knowledge
                    soon dispersed that incongruous order. Such of its elements as could with
                    justice be considered insects have been distributed amongst the various orders.
                    We have not hesitated here to regard the <hi rend="italic">Mallophaga</hi> as
                    degraded <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Neuroptera,</hi> nor the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anoplura</hi> as equally degraded <hi rend="italic">Hemiptera,</hi>
                    notwithstanding that some veterans in entomological science may still dispute
                    their position as true insects. There is a breaking-point to elasticity even in
                    ideas of classification, and with regard to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collembola</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thysanura</hi> we gladly avail ourselves
                    of the assertion of Lubbock to the effect that they are scarcely within the pale
                    of the true <hi rend="italic">Insecta,</hi> notwithstanding the efforts made to
                    locate them in that convenient refuge for the destitute, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pseudo-Neuropt era.</hi> It is certain that the writers in the present work on
                    other classes of <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda</hi> will not accept them, and it
                    becomes necessary that they should not be forgotten. If insects at all, they
                    have in the process of evolution lost the chief attributes of insects, or have
                    never acquired them. Generally both groups are accepted as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thysanura,</hi> or as forming two families— <hi rend="italic">Poduridae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">( = Collembola)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lepismatidae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">( — Thysanura).</hi></p>
                <p>In the Collembola the antennae are short, thick, and few-jointed; the eyes are
                    composed of groups of simple “eye-spots” (much as in the larvae of true insects)
                    varying in number; the mouth organs mandibulate, subject to modifications of a
                    haustellate nature; the palpi quite rudimentary; the abdomen consisting of six
                    segments, and ordinarily provided beneath with a saltatory apparatus (which may,
                    however, be rudimentary); no caudal setae. The body is often clothed with
                    prismatic scales, not unlike those of <hi rend="italic">Lcpidοpterα.</hi>
                    Ordinarily they are minute animals, living in damp places, and sometimes found
                    gregariously. An elongate form is the most general, but <hi rend="italic"
                    >Smynthumιs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Papirius</hi> are short and obese.
                    Lubbock recognizes six families.</p>
                <p>The true Thysanura are elongate creatures, not unlike the larvae of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ephemeridae</hi> in form. The antennae are long, slender, and
                    multiarticulate; the eyes large, compound, and contiguous (or absent); <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n165/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0165-0154"/> the mouth mandibulato; the palpi well developed;
                    the abdomen consisting of ten segments, with long caudal appendages. Lubbock
                    forms three families. In some of the genera the scales form beautiful
                    microscopic objects; in others they are replaced by hairs. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepisma saccharina—</hi> sometimes termed the “Silver Fish”—is a familiar
                    example of <hi rend="italic">Thysanura.</hi> The genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Campodea</hi> is especially interesting as being considered by some as the
                    representative of the primitive form of insect, whence all others have been
                    evolved.</p>
