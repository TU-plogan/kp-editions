                    rend="italic">Agam.</hi> 1150), <hi rend="italic">θεόπνευστοι.</hi> (Plut., ii.
                    904 <hi rend="italic">sq.; cf.</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 15), <hi rend="italic"

                    passim), εvθεoL</hi> (Plato, <hi rend="italic">Plιx,dr.</hi> 244), <hi
                    rend="italic">μαινόμενοι,</hi><hi rend="italic">divino numine afflati, divino
                    spiritu instincti, inspirati, furentes.</hi> Artistic powers and poetic talents,
                    gifts of prediction, the warmth of love, and the battle frenzy were all ascribed
                    to the power of the god possessing the man inspired. And these words were taken
                    over into Christian theological writing, and used to describe what Jewish and
                    Christian divines have called inspiration. This transference of terms, which,
                    was unavoidable, produced, however, a certain confusion of thought; for pagans
                    and Christians meant by inspiration two different things, When a pagan described
                    inspiration, he did so by stating the marks of the state into which the inspired
                    person fell when the fit seized him; a Christian theologian on the other hand
                    was chiefly concerned with the result of inspiration. What the inspired person
                    said or did or commanded was of less moment to the pagan philosopher than the
                    fact that he was possessed, that ho was passive in the hands of the inspiring
                    deity, that he was no longer himself but the god who for the moment dwelt in him
                    and used him as he might an inanimate instrument But in Christian theology
                    inspiration always has to do with the belief that God has “wholly committed to
                    writing” His revelation, and the psychological character of the state of
                    inspiration is of small account compared with the fact that inspiration,
                    whatever it may be, has for its result that God’s revelation has so been
                    committed to writing that men have it permanently, fully, and in an infallibly
                    trustworthy way. In pagan literature <hi rend="italic">θεόπνευστος</hi> is
                    applied primarily to men who have been possessed; in Biblical and ecclesiastical
                    language its primary use is to denote the writings which are the result of
                    inspiration. The words in the mouth of a pagan mean primarily the psychological
                    state, in the mouth of a Christian they mean the characteristics of a book or
                    set of writings.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of inspiration in Christian theology contains very little reference
                    to the psychological state of the persons inspired, and when it does enter into
                    such details we may generally trace their presence back to the influence of
                    pagan ideas or words; it has to do with the characteristics of the writings
                    which have been inspired. In short, the problem of inspiration in Christian
                    theology very much comes to this :—In the Bible we have God’s revelation wholly
                    committed to writing; what are we to infer from this about the Bible <hi
                    rend="italic">2</hi> And the varying answers given to this question form the
                    history of the doctrine. Theology distinguishes between revelation, inspiration,
                    and the canon of Scripture. Revelation is the objective approach of God to man,
                    God entering into human life and history for man’s salvation; Scripture is the
                    record of this revelation, and inspiration provides that the record is complete
                    and trustworthy; while the canon of Scripture gives the list of inspired
                    writings.</p>
                <p>It does not belong to an historical article like this to describe more minutely
                    the doctrine of inspiration or its basis in Scripture and in the Christian
                    experience; all that can be done here is to state as concisely as possible
                    various answers made to the main problem involved.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Jewish Theologians.—</hi> Our knowledge of the opinions of
                    ancient Jewish thinkers about inspiration comes chiefly from the Apocrypha, from
                    Josephus, and from Philo Judaeus. The writers of the Apocrypha do not give us
                    any theory or doctrine of inspiration, but it may be easily gathered from what
                    they say that they regarded the Scriptures of the Old Testament as the word of
                    God, and therefore worthy of all reverence. It is in 1 Macc. xii. 9 that the
                    expression τα <hi rend="italic">βιβ∖lα</hi><hi rend="italic">τα.</hi> άγια is
                    first used of Old Testament books; and it is evident that the Pentateuch or the
                    books of the law were held in special reverence, but beyond this we do not find
                    a doctrine of inspiration. Nor does Josephus formally state or discuss the dogma
                    in his writings, but his language shows that he and his contemporaries believed
                    that the Old Testament Scriptures were the word of God. The Old Testament he
                    calls prophecy, and he declares that down to the time of Artaxerxes there was a
                    regular succession of prophets which since then has ceased <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Contra</hi><hi rend="italic">Apion.,</hi> lib. i. c. 8.). It is Philo who
                    first seeks to give a theory of inspiration, and he does so by bringing the
                    reflexions of Plato upon the pagan inspiration or <hi rend="italic">μανία</hi>
                    to explain the Jewish doctrine. Following Plato, Philo says that inspiration is
                    a kind of “ecstasy,” and he seems to imply that the degree of inspiration is
                    greater in proportion to the unconsciousness or at least to the passivity of the
                    man inspired. The prophet, he says, does not speak any words of his own, he is
                    only the instrument of God, who inspires and who speaks through him <hi
                    rend="italic">(De</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n166/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0166-0155"/><hi rend="italic">Specialibus Legibus,</hi> § 8);
                    but he says that there are degrees of inspiration, and that all portions of
                    Scripture are not equally inspired, or at least have not the same depth of
                    inspiration. Moses has the first place in the scale of inspired writers; he is
                    <hi rend="italic">αρχvπpoφητης,</hi> while others are Mωυσ∈ωs cτα7pot, <hi
                    rend="italic">μαθηrαi, θιaσωτaι,</hi><hi rend="italic">φοιτηταί,
                    γνώριμοί</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but this idea of degrees of inspiration, a
                    conception borrowed from Plato, does not seem to prevent Philo from thinking
                    that the very words of the Old Testament were all inspired of God <hi
                    rend="italic">(Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mos.,</hi> 2, § 7). It was also a
                    common opinion among the Rabbins of the early Middle Ages that the inspiration
                    of the Old Testament required that, not merely the thoughts and words of
                    Scripture, but even the vowel points and accents were themselves of divine
                    origin; but this idea seems to have been compatible with the theory that there
                    were three degrees of inspiration, the highest being the inspiration of the
                    Pentateuch and the lowest that of the Hagiographa.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Church Fathers.—</hi> The early Christian church seems
                    to have simply taken over the Jewish views about the inspiration of the Old
                    Testament; and, when the New Testament canon was complete, they transferred the
                    same characteristics to the New Testament writings also. It is evident that the
                    early fathers of the church wished to teach that the complete knowledge of the
                    salvation of God revealed in Christ was to be found in the Holy Scriptures
                    because they were the book of God, but it is difficult to gather any consistent
                    doctrine of inspiration from their writings, and when they do speak of
                    inspiration it seems as if they were thinking more of the psychological process
                    going on in the mind of the inspired man than of the result in the character of
                    an inspired book. It was perhaps difficult for men educated in the principles of
                    heathen philosophy to avoid applying their early belief about the pagan <hi
                    rend="italic">μανία</hi> to explain or define the Christian idea of inspiration.
                    At all events we find the doctrine of inspiration described under such metaphors
                    as the Platonists were accustomed to use: the inspired writer was the lyre, and
                    the Holy Spirit the plectrum; the writer was the vase, and the Spirit filled it;
                    and Montanus could appeal to the almost unanimous idea of the church that
                    prophecy implied both passivity and ecstasy. This view of inspiration was
                    strengthened by the Apologists, who were accustomed to plead for the credibility
                    of the inspiration of the Scriptures by appealing to the oracle of Dodona, to
                    the supernatural character of the Sibylline books, and to the universally
                    accepted fact of <hi rend="italic">μανία.</hi> Origen, who so frequently
                    anticipates later criticism, was one of the earliest theologians who really
                    attempted to construct a theory of inspiration. He said that the Scriptures
                    contain the plenitude of the Holy Spirit, and that there was nothing in the law
                    nor in the gospel which had not come down to us from the fulness of the Divine
                    Majesty. Inspiration, he declared, preserved the writers from any faults of
                    memory, and made it impossible to say that there was anything superfluous in
                    Scripture. He got over difficulties either by allegorical interpretations, or by
                    declaring that God, like a teacher, accommodates Himself to the degree of
                    civilization in various ages. But the church of the early centuries was hindered
                    from considering the doctrine of inspiration on all its sides by two influences.
                    Throughout the early church the common opinion prevailed that the Scriptures
                    were of great practical importance and promoted the edification of believers.
                    But the church scarcely set itself seriously to ask how the Scriptures edified
                    believers and in what their practical importance consisted; yet these questions
                    bore upon a right understanding of their inspiration. It seems evident, however,
                    that ever since the early conflicts with Gnosticism the church was tempted to
                    look upon Scripture as primarily a means of information, and not so much a means
                    of grace. The Scriptures edified because they instructed, and were of importance
                    because they gave information not otherwise attainable; and so inspiration,
                    whatever else it was, came to be regarded as the means whereby that information
                    was kept correct. It had been always held thab the divine agent in inspiration
                    was the Holy Spirit, but the precise function of the Spirit was not clearly
                    defined. The early theologians, when discussing the inspiration of the apostles,
                    forgot the writing in describing the writers, and enlarged on the powers
                    communicated to them by the Spirit of God to guide the church, to work miracles,
                    and to foretell the future. The promise of the Spirit, however, was not confined
                    to the apostles; all believers were to share in it. Justin Martyr speaks of the
                    miraculous powers of the apostles, and of the spiritual gifts of all Christians,
                    as if the two were the same; and Tertullian, while he does draw a distinction
                    between the inspiration of the apostles and that common to all believers,
                    declares that the difference is one of degree, the inspiration of believers
                    being only partial inspiration. Out of these conflicting tendencies there
                    emerged in due time a double doctrine of inspiration. The Scriptures were
                    inspired to teach infallible truth, and believers were inspired also with
                    something of the same kind of inspiration to interpret this infallible truth.
                    For though it was not distinctly stated, yet still there were intimations of
                    what was to come. Whenever the Bible is looked on as altogether or even chiefly
                    a means of knowledge, and not as a means of grace also, the intellectual aspect
                    overcomes or drives into the background the conception of the Bible as a
                    grace-giving power, and there is need of infallible interpretation as well as of
                    infallible delivery of the propositions which convey the knowledge. In short,
                    the doctrine was in such a state that at any moment it might crystallize into a
                    theory that would practically deny to the ordinary believer the saving use of
                    Scripture as a means of grace. The occasion was furnished by Montanism, which
                    revived within the Christian church the old pagan idea of <hi rend="italic"
                    >μανία,</hi> and applied it not to the original Scriptures but to the infallible
                    interpretation of Scripture. The Montanist prophets claimed to be possessed of
                    the Spirit as the Old Testament prophets had been, but this inspiration they
                    used, not so much to give additional Scriptures, as to give authoritative
                    exposition of the Scriptures already delivered to the church. Theologians
                    rejected the Montanist <hi rend="italic">μανία,</hi> denied that passivity and
                    ecstasy were marks of inspiration, but none the less did the real essence of
                    Montanist prophecy find its way into the church, for the result was a double
                    doctrine of inspiration, —the inspiration of Scripture, which insured that the
                    knowledge they communicated was correct, and the official inspiration of the
                    church, which insured that the knowledge infallibly communicated was infallibly
                    understood. This brings us to the scholastic period.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Schoolmen</hi> accepted the doctrine of inspiration as
                    it came to them from the fathers, and methodized it. They held that the Bible,
                    which was the word of God and therefore inspired, was the source of doctrinal
                    truth; and so this inspiration of the Bible came out in the fact that the
                    doctrinal truths contained in it were infallibly true. The Schoolmen also
                    recognized that a revelation which is primarily doctrinal, and that only,
                    requires infallibility in interpretation as well as infallibility in delivery;
                    and so the inspiration of the church was as important as the infallibility of
                    Scripture. As time went on the infallible interpretations were collected, and
                    side by side with an infallible Scripture was the infallible tradition or the
                    official interpretation of Scripture. The logical Schoolmen, however, perceived,
                    what was not so distinct to the fathers of the church, who were accustomed to
                    think in pictures <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n167/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0167-0156"/> rather than in propositions, that if the Bible
                    was altogether a communication of doctrinal truth there was much in the
                    Scriptures which had not at first sight that appearance. The long histories, the
                    tables of genealogy, did not contain doctrinal statements, or give rules of holy
                    living. Were these portions inspired? The question does not require to be raised
                    if we believe that inspiration implies simply that God has fully committed His
                    revelation to writing, and that revelation is above all things God entering into
                    human life and history for the salvation of His people; for then the whole
                    course of the history, with all the facts as well as the doctrines, contains the
                    revelation. But if we take revelation to be only the delivery of doctrines, the
                    question arises and disturbs our theory of inspiration. The fathers solved every
                    difficulty here by appealing to allegorical interpretation, for allegory will
                    turn the driest statistical details into a moral or doctrinal code; but the
                    Schoolmen were too dryly logical to be quite content with this explanation. They
                    accepted the allegorical senses of Scripture, but many of them held, like Thomas
                    Aquinas <hi rend="italic">(Summa</hi> ii. 2, qu. 1, art. 6; qu. 2, art. 2), that
                    there were two kinds of inspiration in Scripture, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >direct,</hi> which is to be found where doctrinal and moral truths are directly
                    taught, and the <hi rend="italic">indirect,</hi> which appears in historical
                    passages, .whence the doctrinal and moral can only be indirectly evolved by the
                    use of allegorical interpretation. Many different opinions, however, were held
                    about the details of the doctrine. Gregory the Great called the writers of
                    Scripture the <hi rend="italic">calami</hi> of the Holy Spirit, to denote how
                    entirely the Bible was the work of God; while Agobard of Lyons asserted that the
                    inspiration of Scripture did not exclude the presence of grammatical errors.
                    Thomas Aquinas was content to say simply that God is the author of Scripture <hi
                    rend="italic">(Summa</hi> 1, qu. 1, art. 10); but elsewhere he discusses at some
                    length the psychological aspects of the inspiration of the prophets.</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Reformers</hi> placed the authority of Scripture above
                    the decrees of popes and councils, above the opinions of the fathers, above the
                    whole digest of official interpretations of Scripture which made tradition. They
                    regarded Scripture as the judge in all controversies in matters of faith and
                    doctrine, and as the source whence came every article of belief; but besides
                    this they held that Scripture was a means of grace, a principle of salvation, a
                    means of awakening the new life in the hearts of God’s people. This was the real
                    gist of the Reformation doctrine of Scripture; this was the main part in the
                    contribution which the Reformers made to the doctrine of the word of God. The
                    fathers had spoken of the practical importance of Scripture and its power for
                    edification, but they had placed these qualities in a secondary position, and in
                    the scholastic period Scripture came to be regarded as little more than a quarry
                    for doctrines. The Reformers insisted that all doctrines must come from
                    Scripture; they held that the Scripture was the book of the all-wise God, and
                    was therefore the touchstone in matters of religious controversy, but they also
                    held that above all the Scripture was the sword of the Spirit, and that its main
                    use was to pierce the heart and conscience. According to the Reformers, the
                    revelation of God was fully committed to writing in the Scriptures, and the
                    inspiration of Scripture lay in this fact; but they held that the special nature
                    of inspiration must be derived from the purpose of God in this matter. God fully
                    committed His revelation to writing, they argued, not merely to impart new
                    knowledge to men, but also and principally to awaken His people to a new life;
                    and this purpose must appear in the statement of the doctrine of inspiration.
                    Thus the Reformation doctrine of inspiration, while capable of statement in
                    terms somewhat similar, was really different from the patristic and mediaeval
                    theories, and it became more closely allied with the written Scriptures, and
                    paid less attention to the writers. It taught that Scripture as a whole, and the
                    parts of Scripture looked at as parts of the one whole, were designed to be a
                    means of grace, to awaken a new life in God’s people, through the work of the
                    Spirit, and thus the doctrine of inspiration was at once brought into connexion
                    with and yet clearly separated from the spiritual illumination shared by all
                    believers. It is allied because both the inspiration of Scripture and the
                    enlightening work of the Spirit in the hearts of believers are parts of the plan
                    of God whereby by His means of grace through the work of the Spirit He gathers
                    believers into His kingdom; it is quite distinct, for by it God wholly commits
                    His revelation to writing, and so makes the Scripture able to appeal with the
                    very power of God to the hearts and consciences of men. In this way the doctrine
                    of inspiration was advanced a stage beyond what it had before reached, and
                    indeed was raised to a higher platform. It was now seen that inspiration secured
                    that the Scriptures should be instinct with God’s power for salvation, as well
                    as full of the knowledge which God has pleased to communicate to man. And thus
                    in the hands of Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli the doctrine of inspiration had for
                    its correlative the doctrine of the <hi rend="italic">Testimonium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Spiritus Sancti</hi>; the two doctrines supported and explained
                    each other. The second raised the first out of the region of mechanical
                    dictation, the first prevented the second degenerating into a mystical
                    enthusiasm. The Reformers were content to leave the doctrine of inspiration
                    without much further definition, but they took the full advantage of the
                    spiritual form of the doctrine to use great freedom with the letter of
                    Scripture. Their successors acted otherwise.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Protestant Scholastic</hi> for the most part treated the
                    Reformers’doc trine of inspiration very much in the same way as the Schoolmen
                    had treated the doctrine of the fathers. They did not deny the spiritual side of
                    the doctrine; they maintained that Scripture was a means of grace, a power of
                    God to salvation; but they did not bring this side forward much in their
                    discussions about inspiration. They dwelt on the fact that inspiration secured
                    accuracy, rather than on the fact that it brought with it spiritual power. They
                    asked, When Scripture is the word of the all-wise God, what does this imply? And
                    the answers were various. Gerhard held that it implied that the writers were the
                    “pens,” the “hands,” the “amanuenses” of the Holy Ghost. We may with propriety,
                    he says, call the prophets and the apostles “amanuenses Dei, Christi, manus et
                    Spiritus sive tabelliones sive notarios.” Calovius and Quenstedt say the same.
                    Quenstedt holds that everything in Scripture comes from the infallible divine
                    assistance and direction, from a special suggestion and dictation of the Holy
                    Spirit; and he says that because Scripture is inspired it is of infallible truth
                    and free from every error; canonical Scripture contains no lie, no falsehood,
                    not the very slightest error either in fact or in word; whatever things it
                    relates, all and every one of them, are of the very highest truth, whether they
                    be ethical or historical, chronological, topographical, or verbal; there is no
                    ignorance, no want of knowledge, no forgetfulness, no lapse of memory in
                    Scripture. The framers of the <hi rend="italic">Formula Consensus Helvetica</hi>
                    went further, and declared that the Old Testament was “turn quoad consonas, tum
                    quoad vocalia, sive puncta ipsa, sive punctorum saltem potestatem, et tum quoad
                    res, tum quoad verba ôeÔTn/cvcrroç.” On the other hand, Cappellus, led by his
                    investigations into the antiquity of the Hebrew points, maintained that the
                    inspiration of Scripture did not necessarily demand perfect accuracy in details;
                    and he declared that such accuracy not only did not exist in such editions as we
                    have now, but never did exist, for manuscripts <pb break="no"

                <p>The Socinians and certain Arminians, such as Episcopius, who started with the
                    idea that the Bible is simply a communication of knowledge, and so revived the
                    mediaeval idea, also resuscitated the scholastic doctrine of partial
                    inspiration. They did not admit the allegorical method of interpretation, and
                    were therefore compelled to reject the “indirect inspiration” of Thomas Aquinas;
                    but they held that inspiration was only required to communicate knowledge which
                    the writer could not otherwise obtain, and they usually asserted that only the
                    doctrinal parts of the Bible were inspired while the historical were not.
                    Calixtus in the Lutheran Church held a somewhat similar opinion.</p>
                <p>6. In more recent times the doctrine of inspiration has assumed various forms,
                    many of which have but slight connexion with either the Reformation or the
                    mediaeval theories. All admit that the inspiration of Scripture implies that the
                    revelation of God has been committed to writing. Those who hold naturalistic
                    views of revelation reduce inspiration to a peculiar aptitude for and sympathy
                    with religious and moral truth. Others, although believing in the supernatural
                    character of revelation, hold that there is no warrant to suppose anything
                    specially supernatural about the committal of the revelation to writing, and
                    believe that God left His revelation to be recorded in the natural course of
                    providence by men who had perhaps a larger share than their fellows of the
                    spiritual enlightenment common to all believers. Others again have revived the
                    old Thomist doctrine that parts of the Bible are inspired and that parts are
                    not. To meet such theories, orthodox theologians have invented the terms plenary
                    inspiration and verbal inspiration, but the phrasés are neither very exact nor
                    very enlightening. Meanwhile it is interesting to observe that a number of
                    modern theologians, among whom may be named the late Adolphe Monod of Paris,
                    have sought to revive the old simple Reformation form of the doctrine divested
                    of its 17th century subtilties.</p>
