                    by the French Republican Convention, in October 1795, to occupy a similar
                    position to that of the old academies suppressed by an Act of the Convention,
                    8th April 1793 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Academy).</hi> The affix to the word
                    “Institut” has undergone a variety of changes corresponding to changes in the
                    form of the government of France. The Institute owed its existence chiefly to
                    the efforts of three persons, Lakanal, Daunou, and Carnot, and, according to the
                    terms of the law by which it was founded, its purpose was to “advance the
                    sciences and arts of research by the publication of discoveries and by
                    correspondence with other learned societies, and to prosecute those scientific
                    and literary labours which shall have for their end general utility and the
                    glory of the republic.” It was composed of three classes—the first for sciences
                    physiques et mathématiques, the second for sciences morales et politiques, and
                    the third for littérature et beaux-arts. Originally it consisted of 144 members
                    (the 48 nominated by the Convention electing 96 others), an equal number of
                    associates in the provinces, and 24 foreigners of distinction who held the
                    position of correspondents. Each class was divided into several sections, 6
                    members and 6 associates being assigned to each section. The first class was
                    composed of ten sections, viz., (1) mathématiques, (2) arts mécaniques, (3)
                    astronomie, (4) physique expérimentale, (5) chymie, (6) histoire naturelle et
                    minéralogie, (7) botanique et physique générale, (8) anatomie et zoologie, (9)
                    médecine et chirurgie, (10) économie rurale et art vétérinaire. The second class
                    was composed of six sections, namely, (1) analyse des sensations et des idées,
                    (2) morale, (3) science sociale et législation, (4) économie politique, (5)
                    histoire, (6) géographie. The third class consisted of eight sections, viz., (1)
                    grammaire, (2) langues anciennes, (3) poésie, (4) antiquités et monuments, (5)
                    peinture, (6) sculpture, (7) architecture, (8) musique et déclamation. To the
                    first class were thus assigned 60 members and as many associates, to the second
                    36, and to the third 48, the foreign correspondents being divided equally among
                    the classes. No member was permitted to belong to more than one class; but any
                    one might be present at the meetings and assist in the labours of the other
                    classes. The Institute was installed at the Louvre in the building formerly
                    occupied by the Académie Française, but in 1806 its locality was changed to the
                    College des Quatre-Nations. The First Consul on the 23d January 1803 decreed for
                    it a new constitution, the leading features of which were—that the approval of
                    the head of the Government was essential in the election of members; the
                    suppression of the second class; and a redivision into the four classes of (1)
                    sciences physiques et mathématiques, (2) la langue et la littérature Françaises,
                    and (3) histoire et littérature anciennes, (4) beaux-arts. The first class was
                    composed of the ten sections of the old first class, and an additional section
                    of geography and navigation with 3 members, with power to nominate 100
                    correspondents. The second class was composed of 40 members not separated into
                    sections. The third class was composed of 40 members and of 8 foreign
                    associates, and had the power to nominate 60 correspondents. The fourth class,
                    which was composed of 28 members and of 8 foreign associates, was divided into
                    five sections :—peinture with 10 members, sculpture with 6, architecture with 6,
                    gravure with 3, and musique (composition) with 3 members. It had the power to
                    nominate 36 correspondents. All classes had power to elect a stipulated number
                    of members from the other classes. After the Restoration Louis XVIII. on the
                    21st March 1816 decreed the revival of the names of the old academies to the
                    four classes of the Institute:—(1) L’Académie Française, corresponding to the
                    old second class; (2) L’Académie royale des inscriptions et belles lettres,
                    corresponding to the third class; (3) L’Académie royale des sciences,
                    corresponding to the first class; and (4) L’Académie royale des beaux-arts,
                    corresponding to the fourth class. On the 5th March 1833 a fifth academy was
                    added to the Institute,—L’Académie des sciences morales et politiques,
                    corresponding to the second class suppressed by Napoleon. As restored, it was
                    composed of 30 members, with a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 40 correspondents.
                    It was divided into five sections, viz., (1) philosophie, (2) morale, (3)
                    législation, droit public, et jurisprudence, (4) économie politique et
                    statistique, (5) histoire générale et philosophique.</p>
                <p>Each academy has its own special jurisdiction and work, with special funds and
                    one or more perpetual secretaries, in addition to which there is a general fund
                    and common library, which, as well as other matters connected with the Institute
                    as a whole, are managed by a committee chosen in equal numbers from each of the
                    academies. Matters of common interest to all the academies are discussed at a
                    general meeting of the institute, and a <hi rend="italic">séance publique
                    annuelle</hi> takes place on the 25th October, the anniversary of the
                    organization of the Institute. All the expenses of the Institute and the
                    academies are defrayed by an annual sum voted by Government. Each member of the
                    Institute receives an annual allowance of 1200 francs, and each secretary of an
                    academy a salary of 6000 francs. A notice of the several academies is given in
