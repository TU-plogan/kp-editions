                <p><label type="entry">INLAYING</label> is a method of ornamentation, by incrusting
                    or otherwise inserting in one material a substance or substances differing
                    therefrom in colour or nature. The art is practised in the fabrication of
                    furniture and artistic objects in all varieties of wood, metal, shell, ivory,
                    and coloured and hard stone, and in compound substances; and the possible
                    combinations, styles, and varieties of effect are exceedingly numerous. There
                    are several special classes of inlaying, long established and well recognized,
                    which may be here enumerated and defined, details regarding most of which will

                    surfaces <hi rend="italic">Niello</hi> decoration, applied to silver and gold,
                    is an ancient and much practised species of inlaying. It consists in filling up
                    engraved designs with a composition of silver, copper, lead, and sulphur
                    incorporated by heat. The composition is black, and the finished work has the
                    appearance of a drawing in black on a metallic plate. An art, analogous in
                    effect, called <hi rend="italic">Bidri,</hi> from Bider in the Deccan, is
                    practised in India. In bidri work the ground is an alloy of zinc, with small
                    proportions of copper and lead, in which shallow patterns and devices are
                    traced, and filled up with thin plates of silver. When the surface has been
                    evened and smoothed, the bidri ground is stained a permanent black by means of a
                    paste the chief ingredients of which are sal-ammoniac and nitre, leaving a
                    pleasing contrast of bright metallic silver in a dead black ground. The inlaying
                    of gold wire in iron or steel is known as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Damaskeening</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.,</hi> vol. vi. p. 793). It has been
                    very largely practised in Persia and India for the ornamentation of arms and
                    armour, being known in the latter country as Kuft work or Kuftgari. In Kashmir,
                    vessels of copper and brass are very effectively inlaid with tin,—an art which,
                    like many other decorative arts, appears to have originated in Persia. In the
                    ornamental inlaying of metal surfaces the Japanese display the most
                    extraordinary skill and perfection of workmanship. In the inlaying of their fine
                    bronzes they use principally gold and silver, but for large articles and also
                    for common cast hollow ware (for with them inlaying is common and profuse)
                    commoner metals and alloys are employed. In inlaying bronzes they generally
                    hollow out and somewhat undercut the design, into which the ornamenting metal,
                    usually in the form of wire, is laid and hammered over so as to be firmly
                    inserted. Frequently the famous lacquer work of the Japanese is inlaid with
                    mother-of-pearl and other substances, in the same manner as is practised in
                    ornamenting lacquered papier-mâché among Western communities. The Japanese also
                    practise the various methods of inlaying alluded to under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Damaskeening.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">Mosaic</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mosaic)</hi> is generally applied to inlaid work in hard
                    stones, marble, and glass, but the most important class of mosaics—those which
                    consist of innumerable small separate pieces—do not properly come under the head
                    of inlaying. Inlaid mosaics are those in which coloured designs are inserted in
                    spaces cut in a solid ground or basis, such, for example, as the modern
                    Florentine mosaic, which consists of thin veneers of precious coloured stones
                    set in slabs of marble. The famous Taj Mahal at Agra is an example of inlaid
                    mosaic in white marble, and the art, carried to that city by a French artist, is
                    still practised by native workmen. <hi rend="italic">Pietra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dura</hi> is a fine variety of inlaid mosaic in which hard and
                    expensive stones—agate, carnelian, amethyst, and the like—are used in relief in
                    marble. Under the head <hi rend="smallcaps">Buhl Work</hi> (vol. iv. p. 446)
                    will be found a description of the kind of inlaying, principally brass and
                    tortoiseshell, which was introduced and carried to great perfection by André
                    Charles Boule, who gave his name to this particular style of inlaying. Closely
                    allied to buhl work is the more ancient <hi rend="italic">Tarsia</hi> work or
                    <hi rend="italic">Marquetry,</hi> which consists of inlaid woods alone. It has
                    been practised from remote times, but came into prominence, for the decoration
                    of furniture, in Italy during the Renaissance epoch, and has continued to be a
                    favourite decorative art, varying with changing tastes and styles, to the
                    present day. From India, under the name of Bombay boxes, comes a variety of
                    minute and elaborate work, inlaid in geometrical patterns on wood. The inlaying
                    materials consist of tin wire, sandal wood, sapan wood, ebony, ivory, and stag’s
                    horns, and the effect produced by the combination of minute pieces of these
                    various substances is altogether peculiar and distinctive. Certain kinds of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Enamel</hi> (vol. viii. p. 182) might also be included among
                    the varieties of inlaying.</p>
